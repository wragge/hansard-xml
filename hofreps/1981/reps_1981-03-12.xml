<PARA> 1. Note that legislation establishing plant variety rights in other countries has had adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I refer to the diplomatic note incorporated in Hansard last evening announcing an agreement between Australia and the United States for B52 flights into or over Australia. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether he will advise the House of the meaning of the phrase 'strategic and operational developments' in clause (VII) of the diplomatic note. Does it not embrace nuclear capacity? Is that why in clause (VIII) there is a reference to the non-proliferation treaty?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="703" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman has been trying to suggest that clause (VII) overrides other clauses in the agreement. Of course it does not. It is normal, I would have thought, for there to be consultation between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States about strategic and operational developments of a wide variety. There is nothing unusual in the clause. I refer the honourable gentleman to the first clause which, of course, is the one of overriding importance, and which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The B52 staging operations shall be for sea surveillance in the Indian Ocean area and for navigation training purposes. The agreement of the Government of Australia shall be obtained before the facilities are used in support of any other category of operations.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolute. I also indicate to the House that if the agreement of the Government of Australia were sought and given for any other category of operations I, or the Minister, would advise the House at the time of its being done. The Parliament would be able to debate that agreement if it wished to do so. I also draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the second clause which says, in quite detailed terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The operations shall consist of periodic deployments through Darwin of up to three B52 and six KC135 aircraft, supported by about 100 USAF personnel and associated equipment. En route to or from Darwin the B52s may conduct low-level navigation training over Australia on the basis of the arrangements announced by the Australian Minister for Defence on 3 February 1980.</PARA>
<PARA>The second paragraph of that announcement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Announcing this today, the Minister for Defence, Mr D. J. Killen, said that the aircraft, based in Guam, would be unarmed and would carry no bombs.</PARA>
<PARA>That, again, indicates a consistency with what the Australian Government is doing. I refer now to the first words of the last paragraph of the agreement which read:</PARA>
<PARA> In considering whether to agree-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the word 'agree'. It is not a question of the United States consulting with us or whatever. It is a question of the Australian Government's having to agree to any changes. The paragraph provides:</PARA>
<PARA>In considering whether to agree to any request for alteration of the terms of this Agreement-</PARA>
<PARA>Which means an alteration in the terms in which the aircraft may use the Royal Australian Air Force base at Darwin-</PARA>
<PARA>the Government of Australia shall give weight to its international commitments-</PARA>
<PARA>The clause also mentions the non-proliferation treaty and the security treaties between Australia, New Zealand and the United States. I think it would be fair enough to say-I hope the honourable gentleman will accept this-that if we were to agree to any changes to the arrangements that have been announced to this House, all Australia's treaty commitments would be in the mind of the Government at the time it comes to a decision. The honourable gentleman would serve himself much better if he accepted the totality of the agreement and the statement made last night as giving the whole of the story. That is what the agreement does. It is plain and open. The honourable gentleman does not do much service, I think, by making the kind of allegations he has over the last 24 hours.</PARA>

<TITLE>APPRENTICESHIPS: REBATE SCHEME</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. The Government has announced a cash bonus rebate scheme for additional apprentices employed in the metal, electrical and building trades. Can the Minister tell me what response there has been to this scheme and whether it will continue to operate next year?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="704" SPEAKER="Viner The Hon R.I." NAMEID="EE6" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="STIRLING" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT AND YOUTH AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EE6">Mr VINER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. The $1,000 bonus under the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme to employers to take on additional apprentices has been a very successful scheme. Until now 10,410 claims have been paid out. We expect, from information coming through the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, that a total of 13,500 additional apprentices will attract the rebate for 1979-80. That figure was far beyond our expectation when we announced the scheme for that year. We had thought it might attract about 5,000 applications. Honourable members can see that a lift to 13,500 is a very considerable mark of the success of the program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the recommendation of the State and Commonwealth labour Ministers in September of last year the Commonwealth extended this scheme to include the key areas of the metal, electrical and building trades. Those trade areas were identified as the ones where we needed to get a further sharp uplift in the intake of apprentices to cope with the demand for skilled labour in the middle 1980s. The result of that is that in 1979-80 we had a record intake of apprentices. That in turn resulted in a record number of apprentices in training. The preliminary evidence which my Department has from State authorities indicates that there will be a further record intake of apprentices in the 1980-81 period.</PARA>
<PARA> However, at the Ministers for labour conference in Hobart last Friday, concern was expressed by the State Ministers that some employers may be postponing decisions to take on additional apprentices until next year in expectation of the scheme continuing. Therefore, it was recommended by those State Ministers to my colleague, the Minister for Industrial Relations, and me that the scheme not be continued next year. I have to inform the House that the $1,000 bonus scheme will end as at 30 June this year. I would ask all employers to make their decisions now to increase even further the number of apprentices that they have and I would ask those who have not taken on apprentices to do so so that they can get the benefit of the $1,000 tax free cash bonus.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. There are no other relevant documents. All documents we have been talking about were tabled by the Prime Minister last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make the point that the Labor Party's refusal to accept the unequivocal assurance that I was given by the Secretary of State of the United States and as stated by the Prime Minister this morning exposes the whole attitude of the Labor Party to Australia's foreign relations. The two parts of the amendment moved by the Opposition last night in relation to the tabled agreement deserve the closest scrutiny. Both demonstrate without any doubt that the left wing bias of the Labor Party will not allow it to accept a partnership alliance with the United States. Instead, the Labor Party is always trying to arouse suspicion and undermine the mutual trust that must be an essential element of our relationship with our allies, including in this case the United States.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's statement and the latest agreement demonstrate that for its part this Government is prepared and willing to meet its obligations as a partner with a valued ally, while always as its prime responsibility maintaining Australian sovereignty. When it comes to the American alliance all the Labor Party can offer is its tired old socialist platitudes which are completely out of thinking with the Australian electorate. If Labor Party members have any doubt about that I remind them that there was an election in this country a few months ago. Their spineless foreign policies were one very good reason why they sit on the Opposition side of the House and we sit on the Government side.</PARA>

<PARA> The district has been through a very difficult time. It is going through its third year of drought. One of the great problems Goodooga has at present is that the rain dancers cannot get their act together. There is a great bloke in Goodooga called Shillin' Jackson, who broke his leg. He has a son called Sixpence. They and two other men called Robin Quartpot and Bertie Powell are well known as rain dancers. Unfortunately, I do not think this ruddy drought will break until the rain dancers can get their act together. I hope that by the time the drought does break we will have a road system to and from Goodooga that will be far superior to anything that has existed there before. The New South Wales Minister for Main Roads recommended that we spend $226,000 on upgrading the Goodooga road to Brewarrina and Walgett. So I am sure that road access will be improved. I hope that we do not have to go out to Goodooga to get over our international air terminal and airport problem with the New South Wales Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Defence whether he is correctly reported on page 1 of this morning's Canberra Times by his favourite chronicler, Frank Cranston, when he stated: '. . . the Minister for Defence, Mr Killen, said the suggestion'-that is the suggestion in relation to the B52s using Australian facilities-'had been put to the United States by Australia'. He went on to quote the Minister directly as stating:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter was raised by the Prime Minister and I raised it . . . It has been put to them (to the United States) that it could well be of assistance if those aircraft were staged through Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is a correct report, how does the Minister reconcile it with statements made last year by both himself and the Prime Minister that in this matter Australia was simply responding to a United States request and had not initiated the idea? Is this in fact a replay of the misleading way in which the public was encouraged to believe that the United States had requested Australia to enter the Vietnam conflict when, in fact, the release of documents subsequently proved that the request for the invitation had come from a previous conservative government of which both the Prime Minister and the Minister were members?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The facts can be simply stated, and I will state them. It is true that yesterday afternoon I was interviewed by Mr Cranston. He very kindly brought to me the original of a most engaging cartoon in the Canberra Times and, following that, said: 'Do you mind if I have a discussion with you concerning recent developments in the defence arrangements concerning Australia, and touching upon other matters?' I said that I would find that agreeable. Amongst other things, he asked me what progress had been made concerning negotiations regarding B52 aircraft. I told him that I give no indication to any person, journalist or otherwise, as to what business will be raised before Cabinet. I believe that may be another old-fashioned Westminster view but I hold very strongly to that too-that what business is discussed in the Cabinet is for the Cabinet to decide and when the decision is made it is announced. I did discuss with that gentleman the negotiations that my colleague the Foreign Minister had been carrying out with the Secretary of State, Mr Alexander Haig. That is quite clear. I did give Mr Cranston the history of that proposal. I am sorry that memory is such an imperfect vehicle that it is not recalled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, on 19 February 1980, after referring to Indian Ocean operations by Australia, said amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Department is discussing with United States authorities ways in which we can assist their forces, which are operating so far from continental USA.</PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of my honourable friend to Article 2 of the ANZUS agreement which, in quite explicit terms, casts upon each of the parties to that agreement a responsibility to discuss how they can assist each other. There is no ambiguity about that. This is not something that stops and starts. It is a continuing process and has always been so regarded.</PARA>
<PARA> The next matter to which I draw the attention of my honourable friend is the ANZUS communique of 27 February 1980:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council took note of the decision to allocate greater resources to defence announced by the Prime Minister of Australia . . . They further noted that consultations on joint cooperation at both operational and policy levels take on a new urgency in the uncertain strategic prospects resulting from the present Southwest Asian crisis, that operational planning in response to the crisis is well under way, and that additional measures for military cooperation are being explored.</PARA>
<PARA>In this House on 19 March when dealing with the Soviet military preponderance in the Eurasian area I said to the House, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . -the United States-must exercise and maintain its logistic supplies across thousands and thousands of miles. Is it not a sober consideration for men . . . of goodwill to say to an ally: 'How can we help you?' I repeat-I have never disguised this-that I have said to the United States authorities and to British authorities-</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what I have said to them. At the ANZUS council that was stated. I draw to the attention of the House that at the New South Wales State Conference of the Returned Services League of Australia on 28 May 1980 I dealt specifically with B52 aircraft and the responsibility that the United States was discharging. Amongst other things, I said this:</PARA>
<PARA> Today the United States of America . . . discharges a responsibility, an aerial responsibility in the Persian Gulf, with B52 aircraft operating out of Guam, and depending on the winds, they get 3 or 4 drinks of refuelling in the air. I have said to the Prime Minister . . . that I would welcome the Study to see how this nation can assist its friend the United States in the discharge of that responsibility, and an American Naval Team has been in Australia recently, an American Air Team will be here, I think next week, to examine the point as to whether or not we could stage the aircraft through Tindal, Darwin or wherever.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the strike referred to by the honourable member. It is a strike by about 1,200 shunters who are members of the Australian Railways Union. It has ramifications which extend far beyond the particular issue involved. It is unquestionably interfering with exports of coal and wheat, disrupting the movement of freight both within New South Wales and between States and causing considerable inconvenience to suburban and country rail travellers and interstate passengers. Obviously if the dispute continues the State's production and employment will face serious disruption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am informed that the men decided yesterday-this relates to the second part of the honourable member's question-to continue their strike despite their executive's recommendation that they return to work. I would have hoped that the union members involved could have shown more regard and more concern for the effect of their actions on the State's economy and on the country's economy. Instead, they have decided on precipitate strike action without fully utilising the conciliation procedures. I regret that this strike is yet another example of key workers demonstrating a disregard for the impact of their actions on others. Furthermore, this particular rail system has been beset by considerable industrial relations problems over the past few years. Perhaps its record would have been better had the State Government been less acquiescent to industrial pressures on earlier occasions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have to obtain advice on the actual statistical proportion of total raisings by the companies referred to in the first part of the honourable gentleman's question. I am afraid that I do not carry that sort of figure around in my head. In relation to the latter part of the honourable gentleman's question, it is fundamental that there is a certain availability of capital in our community. To the extent that there is too much competition for that available capital between public and private sectors interest rates tend to be forced up. That has consequences in particular for the young home buyers and the small business people about whom the honourable gentleman is so concerned. I have said before and I say again that if governments are concerned to reduce pressure on capital markets they can contribute directly to a reduction of pressure on capital markets by reducing their own borrowing requirements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some time ago Australia formally complained to GATT about the sugar exporting policies of the European Economic Community. We have been concerned for some time about heavily subsidised sugar being put on the world market and causing great damage to the trade. As a result of our complaint to GATT a panel was set up which verified our complaint. The GATT subsequently had discussions with the EEC. On Tuesday this week the council of GATT met and a motion was put forward supporting Australia's complaint. Even though that motion was supported by 18 countries, it was vetoed by the EEC. It is an unprecedented procedure for any country to veto such a motion. It has completely denigrated the dispute settling procedures of GATT which try to bring about a reasonable resolution of complaints that may come before it. The EEC has undermined the whole standing of GATT in relation to complaints about trade matters. It is a very serious issue and one that the Australian Government is concerned about. We will continue to push our case before GATT. At the same time we are concerned about the new agricultural regime coming forward from the EEC particularly as it relates to the export of sugar. It is a matter that has to be faced up to. We will continue to push our case to GATT and not let it be taken for granted that the EEC can veto such measures.</PARA></TALK.START>

But I think the important point to emerge from all this is that the events of the last couple of weeks have made it quite clear that there are two attitudes which dominate Australian Labor Party foreign policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, naturally I withdraw anything that I said which is in contravention of the ruling that you have just given. What I said about the honourable member for Melbourne Ports-I am surprised that he finds it offensive-was that he wanted Australia to exchange defence attaches with Moscow. That is something that he said in this House. If he finds that offensive I say that it is something that he said himself. If he does not want to say it I can well understand that. In relation to the first accusation, if that is offensive I will rephrase it in this way: Two attitudes now clearly dominate Labor Party foreign policy. The first is, let us say, a great unwillingness to criticise in any way actions and activities of the Soviet Union. For example, I have not yet heard from any member of the Opposition any comment on or criticism of the rather extraordinary statement made in, let us face it, unusual circumstances by the Soviet Ambassador recently. The other attitude running through Labor Party foreign policy and running parallel to that attitude is a distrust and suspicion of the United States of America. That is built into the Labor Party make-up. Its members cannot help themselves in that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very seriously, I would have believed that there was such a basis and that there ought to be such a basis. The Australian Labor Party has supported and does support the ANZUS treaty. The Labor Party, during a period in government, which admittedly was short, did in fact support the continued operation of bases by Australia and the United States of America on a joint basis. I would have hoped that that attitude would flow through to their time now in Opposition. I also regard it as much preferable for Australia if a joint approach to these vastly important matters can be maintained. That strengthens the ANZUS treaty, it strengthens Australia and it is less divisive within the community. I hope that we can approach the questioning and debate on vastly important matters against that background with an intention, if it is at all possible, to come to a common view on what is in Australia's interest in these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently the honourable gentleman sought and was given permission to make renewed visits to and to have renewed briefings on those joint bases. He will find that, whilst there has been some modest building activity, the purposes and strategic thrust of those bases are not in any sense different from what they were was when the Labor Party was in power. I hope very much that as a result of the honourable gentleman's visit to the bases and renewed briefings which my colleague the Minister for Defence has offered him and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that will be so because, again, it would be in the interests of Australia if it were to work out that way. The honourable gentleman also said something about nuclear powered ships. I would like to draw a very real distinction between visits by aircraft and visits by nuclear powered ships or, if it were to unfold later, the home porting of nuclear powered ships in--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must point out to the Leader of the Opposition that a point of order relates to the Standing Orders. It does not relate to correcting a statement which a member finds he disagrees with. There is an opportunity after Question Time for making a personal explanation in relation to misrepresentation. I ask the honourable gentleman to comply with the practice of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out to the House that there is a very marked difference between the operations of aircraft and the operations of ships. Changed arrangements, I believe, are needed regarding the kind of assistance that we can offer to the United States, as an ANZUS partner, in matters in which we are in agreement with the tactical and strategic objectives of the United States because they coincide with Australia's very specific national interests. Quite plainly, if a B52 aircraft is to take off from Darwin it is launching a specific mission from Australian soil. That is why I emphasised in Darwin last year and in the statement which I made yesterday that we need to be in agreement with the tactical and strategic objective of any mission launched from Australian soil in that way. That is why agreement has been given for surveillance and navigational flights which are unarmed and which will not be carrying bombs. If the nature and purpose of the mission are sought to be changed the specific agreement of the Australian Government would be required. Agreement would be required not only as to the nature of the mission but also the weaponry that would be carried.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of that detailed view on the part of this Government is that if a mission is launched from Darwin it is specifically a tactical mission of one kind. If it were an armed mission it would be against a specific target. It would be quite wrong, a derogation of Australia's sovereignty and a derogation of responsibility of this Government and this Parliament if any government were to agree to such a mission if the government did not agree with the objectives of the mission. That is a quite different situation from that which applies in relation to naval ships.</PARA>
<PARA> Ships come in to port for rest and replenishment. Then they might be at sea for many weeks or many months. In the case of nuclear powered ships, as my colleague the Minister for Defence will remind me, it may be for six months at a time or longer. Quite plainly, it is not a question of launching a specific mission from Cockburn Sound or any other Australian port. It is part of the normal patrolling duties of the United States Navy and we have offered support for it, if the United States so wishes. The offer for home porting or base porting at Cockburn Sound stands, if the United States so wishes. We are not yet aware of the results of a survey mission that it sent here to examine those matters. That will unfold in the coming months, one way or another.</PARA>
<PARA> The United States has many nuclear powered ships and obviously many nuclear armed ships. The former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, I think when he was the Leader of the Opposition, in this House-the record can be checked-made it perfectly plain that the nuclear powers, including the United States, cannot say when a ship is nuclear armed. That would be giving vital tactical and strategic information to an enemy. Therefore it is not possible to say that. Our support and decision to allow United States nuclear powered and, if they are, nuclear armed ships to visit Australian ports stand and will not in any way be diminished. I hope, consistent with the view expressed by Mr Whitlam in relation to the compulsions on the United States on the matter, that view could also be supported by the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition do lay themselves open to charges by the nature of some of their questioning in these matters. I hope that they watch the matter because it would be much better if a bipartisan approach could be developed and maintained in a fuller sense on defence and foreign policy matters. As I am in a charitable mood this morning, I am prepared to concede that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition misunderstood the fact that sub-paragraph (I) overrode and governed the whole of that agreement and was not diminished in any sense by sub-paragraph (VII). I will accept that that was a misunderstanding and nothing more. But I also think that there was some reason to believe that there could be a bipartisan approach because during the election campaign, when the Leader of the Opposition did not necessarily want all that much publicity for a defence debate, he appeared on the Terry Willesee show in Perth on, I think, 29 September. I hope he will not mind if I remind him of what he said. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly on the B52s. We say our friends, our allies as always can use our facilities but we want to know the reasons for their movements so that we're not dragged into some sort of escapade which could have serious implications for us, such as an American raid somewhere in circumstances-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I will take the opportunity a little later to correct the misrepresentation by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) a few seconds ago. In the meantime, with your indulgence, I raise with you your ruling concerning whether a statement covering a collectivity of people or a group of people is unparliamentary and should be withdrawn. You will recall your ruling a few seconds ago that when a statement related to an individual it certainly should be withdrawn. But you said you thought that when a statement referred to a group of people such as the Opposition or the Government it was undesirable; that it would upset the comity of the place. However, although you said you would prefer that it be withdrawn, you did not state that it should be withdrawn. I refer you to page 1076 of the House of Representatives Hansard of 10 September 1980. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) made a statement which covered all members of the Government. You required that the statement be withdrawn. I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . when an allegation of the nature made, allegedly, by the honourable member for Port Adelaide is made about a collectivity such as the Government or the Liberal Party, it is acceptable in terms of procedures in this House. When a particular person is identified some disputation arises. Can you just briefly outline why you have changed that long-standing ruling?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, you said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have changed it, but not today. I changed it earlier, indeed last year, because a member on the Government side made an allegation about Ministers of a former Labor Government and that led to all former Ministers of the Labor Government standing and saying: 'It was not I. It was not I'. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not need to quote any further. The second column of that page of the Hansard records that the honourable member for Port Adelaide sought to speak. You said:</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. The honourable member well knows that the words I required him to withdraw were a personal reflection upon one or more members. </PARA>
<PARA>You required him to withdraw. You did not require the Minister for Foreign Affairs to withdraw today. I put it to you that there is a glaring inconsistency in your rulings. Unfortunate and unintentional as it undoubtedly is, it is of the nature which causes irritation on this side of the House and encourages some people at least to harbour suspicions about rulings from the chair which are not conducive to the harmony of the House. </PARA>

What he is objecting to is that on a prior occasion, one on which he has drawn my attention, I have called for a withdrawal whereas today I did not call for a withdrawal. If I have been inconsistent I regret it. The reason I adopted the position I took today was that I felt that the House was not fully aware of the change in the ruling. Obviously, I called for the attention of the House and asked honourable members to listen to me carefully. I drew the attention of all honourable members to it. My intention was that in the future I would certainly call for withdrawal. I did not on this occasion. I regret that the honourable gentleman finds in it some inconsistency on my part. More especially I regret that he sees it as some basis for suggesting that I am not being objective. I wish to assure him that I am. If there was any inconsistency it was error on my part; I plead guilty to the error. I will look at the remarks. I did, in fact, at a later point call upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs to withdraw the unparliamentary remark. The Minister did so.

<PARA> Before I proceed I should make it plain that there is regrettably in the public mind a great deal of confusion about nuclear ships. There is a difference between nuclear armed ships and nuclear powered ships. Nuclear armed ships-presumably only nuclear armed naval ships-have come to Australia for very many years. They have come from several powers. Successive governments have accepted that naval ships these days are quite likely to be nuclear armed. It is impossible to expect the navies of other countries to specify for public consumption which of their ships are nuclear armed and which are not so that any country which is host to those ships may require that only those which are non nuclear armed can come to the ports. If that information and that requirement are imposed it becomes a matter of public knowledge which of the ships in any particular navy are nuclear armed and which may not be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The two matters which I wish to raise suggest that the Prime Minister is sluggish this morning. The first matter relates to a comment the Prime Minister made in response to a question. He concluded by claiming that the statement I had made in Western Australia during the election campaign-this is according to his interpretation and we know how reliable that is-clearly committed the Australian Labor Party to the same sorts of conditions that were laid down in the agreement tabled in this Parliament last night in relation to the operation of B52s through this country. That is not true. It was frequently made clear, including to American Government representatives, that not only would we not allow nuclear weapons to come on to or to travel through this country in B52 aircraft but that that would be a condition of any undertaking or any arrangement about their movements. It would not be a provision that we would have to be told of an intent, rather a total prohibition. There was never any dispute about that. I do not want to delay the House any further except to observe that I say now-I believed it then-that the whole exercise was a stunt drummed up for the election by the Government. The Government sought to incite the Americans by inviting them to use these facilities. That has now emerged.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night during the adjournment debate-as reported at page 690 of Hansard-the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) accused me of being 'a rather shonky manipulator of figures'. As reported at the same page he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . even one as shonky with figure manipulation as the honourable member for Macarthur . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Naturally I find those words offensive, I regret to say that there are no dictionary definitions of the word 'shonky', but I understand it relates to people who are less than honest in their activities. The word 'manipulator' also is offensive in the way it was used by the honourable member for Bonython. I will not canvass the correctness or otherwise of the assertions he made in defending that proposition, but I will seek to do so of course at an appropriate time later, perhaps during the adjournment debate tonight. All I wish to stress is this: The figures on which I was accused by the honourable member were 'derived assuming the trend for 1977-78 and 1978-79 held in those years', according to the Legislative Research Service of the Parliamentary Library. My objection was to the fact that the honourable member for Bonython, when attacking me, did not concede, admit or refer to the fact that these figures were not official statistics but were in fact simply derived assuming the continuation of the trend. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) will appreciate in a moment the reasons for my making the statement. It is my great privilege today to draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that 68 years ago, on 12 March 1913, the city of Canberra was named-and today is therefore Canberra Day, the birthday of the national capital. This great city, this community in which we all share, is also one in which we all take considerable pride, and for good reason. The 68 years of its establishment have seen it transformed from a bush settlement to one of the world's most beautiful cities. Even more importantly, today I believe Canberra is demonstrating as never before that it is the heart of the nation. Therefore, on this birthday I want to stress that Canberra is our national capital and it belongs to all Australians. Because the city's population is drawn from all over the Commonwealth and beyond, it is obvious that visitors are assured of a warm welcome from those who themselves have been visitors but a short time ago.</PARA></TALK.START>

On behalf of the city I extend an invitation to all Australians to join, if possible, with the Canberra community in its celebrations over the next few days. Those who are unable to participate in the celebrations should remember that they are always welcome in their national capital. After all, they own it. I can truly say that after 68 years Canberra's growing emphasis on the importance of people will earn national acceptance of the accolade 'Heart of the nation'. Happy birthday, Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I add my congratulations to the people of Canberra on the city's sixty-eighth birthday. It has been a remarkable achievement to transform Canberra from a sheep run to the unique and beautiful city that it is today. It is appropriate to pay tribute to the original planner, Walter Burley Griffin, for the very fine concept he developed. With the exception of the monstrosity on Black Mountain we have adhered to the Burley Griffin concept and still have a unique and beautiful city. Another unique thing about Canberra is that it is the only community in Australia that does not have some measure of self-government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe many members of parliament are not aware of the true nature of Canberra. I would like to suggest to them, particularly the new members, that they resolve to overcome that problem by getting into a government car when they have an hour to spare-I am sure that the drivers of those cars will be pleased to act as guides as well as drivers-and really have a good look around the city. It is very noticable that those members of parliament who serve on the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory become much better informed and are very impressed with the city. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe every member of this Parliament shares a responsibility to see that the standards of Canberra are maintained, as the seat of government and the national capital, and the home of some 230,000 good Australians. If honourable members have a look around the city they will find out also that not everybody lives in affluence. There are pockets of poverty and deprivation. Honourable members will have a better understanding of Canberra if they avail themselves of the opportunity to have a good look at it. </PARA>

It is a young city but its population of a quarter of a million has the same aspirations as other Australians, the same concerns about unemployment and inflation, and it wants a fair go. Canberra is also the national capital, a city of which all Australians can be proud, and a city by which we as Australians can be judged. On its birthday it requires one major gift-a commitment to its future. Canberra's future prosperity depends, more than the future of any other part of Australia, on that commitment from the Federal Government and the people of Canberra. I am pleased that this Parliament has made a major commitment to the construction of the new Parliament House. That will bring new life to the construction industry in this Territory. To ensure that Canberra's future birthdays are prosperous I ask the Government and members of the Opposition to make a joint commitment to Canberra as the national capital and a city with a population of a quarter of a million.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-It is my responsibility in the Opposition to deal with matters of policy concerning Canberra, not the day to day affairs which one would expect the members who represent the area to look after. Canberra is a unique city in that it is the national capital. It is also a city which should be accessible to far more Australians. It is difficult for some Australians to visit Canberra because of the great distance involved. If the Government is serious about wishing Canberra a happy birthday-nobody is in disagreement with that-the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) may well put to his Government propositions to make it easier for school children especially those children living in distant Western Australia, north Queensland and the Northern Territory to make one visit to the national capital during their school years. The cost of a visit for people in New South Wales, Victoria and probably some of the nearer parts of other States is not great. Some consideration of this matter would be a worthwhile birthday present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Every Australian should be proud of his national capital even though it is much maligned especially in the to and fro world of politics and the States' rights argument. It is a capital which has progressed since the site was first chosen. I think it is arguable who determined the site but King O'Malley claimed credit. It is a place to which honourable members often come but do not see much of it. It is now a thriving city and community. Another birthday present which could be given to Canberra is some say in the social structure and the allocation of finances in their city. This is currently lacking. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) endorses the feelings of those Australians who, by recent marches, have demonstrated their concern at the frequency of strikes and bans which have so disrupted the everyday life of the ordinary Australian;</PARA>

<PARA> (3) expresses concern at the unjustifiable effect of strikes and bans on employment opportunities for young and old, their impact on inflation, as well as the international reputation of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Recent marches and rallies in a number of Australian capital cities have been a clear demonstration of the deep concern of Australians against the frequency of strikes and bans which have disrupted the everyday life of the ordinary Australian. Union leaders who promote strikes and bans are insensitive to the feelings of the average Australian. Their intransigent attitude, when seated around the negotiating table, is appalling. But these marches and demonstrations of concern by people will count for nothing unless unions and unionists heed the message and the feelings of the masses. The clear message to the unions is that Australians are fed up to the back teeth with the frequent and unreasonable demands of some union members and, in particular, union leaders. Those people who have marched echo the feelings of hundreds and thousands of Australians. In Sydney some 30,000 people marched in protest. In Brisbane, normally a conservative city, 4,000 people turned out to demonstrate their disapproval. I defy any honourable member in this chamber to state that he has not had expressed to him widespread concern at the nature and frequency of the industrial disputes that plague this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with the average Australian. Normally, Australians do not demonstrate much national pride. When asked what sort of society he wants the average Australian in most cases is stumped for an answer. Pose the same question to a Third World country African or Asian, and he responds quickly by saying: 'Provide me with adequate fuel, food and shelter'. If Australians respond they will probably talk about wage justice or say that the level of taxation is too high, the transport system is inadequate or industrial unrest is crippling the country. A large section of the Australian community lives at a standard far above that of their brothers and sisters in other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet we do not appreciate what a wonderful nation we have and what outstanding opportunities exist here. In times of extreme adversity, such as on the battlefields, Australians have an enviable track record. Our second most notable achievements are on the sporting fields where on a comparative population basis we are up with the top nations. But those areas aside, we fail dismally to exhibit a reasonable measure of nationalism. We have a 'warm the TV and cool the tinnies' mentality. We do not work hard enough, our rate of productivity is too low, and yet we expect high returns and a share in the affluence and prosperity of the country with a minimum of personal effort. There is nothing wrong with enjoying leisure time but we must work at changing our unenviable image of just being a sport loving, beer guzzling, meat pie eating, sun loving nation. With 14 1/2 million people Australia has less than one-half of one per cent of the world's population which is in excess of 4,000 million people. In spite of the fact that we are a mere drop in the bucket in population terms, this is an affluent second world power. It is past time we woke up to this as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the second part of my motion, that is that ordinary rank and file members of trade unions demand-not ask or suggest but demand-that their leadership and the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions cease their confrontation with the Australian community through repeated industrial disruption.--</PARA>

No one quarrels with the basic objective of unions-that is to make sure that their members enjoy reasonable work conditions and receive just rewards for their efforts and skills. I believe average unionists expect their leaders to pursue these goals. They do not want their leaders involved in anarchy, standover tactics and thuggery which is becoming the rule rather than the exception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frequently we hear union leaders proclaim the need for civil liberties. What they do not recognise is that they themselves constantly impinge on the rights of their members and other Australians.

I am talking about the right of employees to work without fear of intimidation in order to support themselves and their families. I am talking about the right of employers to expect continuity of output from employees in order that they receive a fair return for their enterprise and investment.

In other words, Australians ought to be proud and able to hold their heads high to look to the future with a high degree of excitement and expectation. </PARA>

It is high time the Dolans, the Carmichaels, the Gallaghers, the Hamiltons and their ilk adopted a more reasonable and responsible attitude and began working for Australia and Australians. For too long they have used rank and file members and the average Australian as pawns in their power game. If the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the much celebrated shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke)-the 'Mr Fixit'-and those behind them do not work towards the moderation of union activities and towards assisting with the minimisation of industrial disputes, they will never gain the respect and support of the Australian electorate. In other words, they will be on the Opposition benches for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third part of my motion expresses concern at the unjustifiable effect of strikes and bans on the employment opportunities for young and old-their impact on inflation as well as the international reputation of Australia. Let me deal with these several points. In general terms Australia has an impressive record in managing the economy over the past five years. One must remember--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Hawke" NAMEID="YD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr Hawke</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The worst unemployment in the West.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TE7">Mr HODGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member would just listen he might hear a few facts. One must remember we inherited inflation running rampant at 18 per cent. When the Whitlam Labor Government came to power in 1972 inflation was running at about 4 per cent. When we took office the level of unemployment was in excess of 300,000, foreign investment was not being attracted to development projects and Australia was not viewed, because of the policies of the previous Labor Government, as a desirable and stable place in which to invest. Oil exploration had slumped to an alarmingly low level. Australia's economy was in bad shape. That was in 1975 when the Fraser Government came to power. At the present time our inflation rate is a creditable 9.2 per cent while the average for member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is 12.3 per cent. Italy has an inflation rate of 21.3 per cent, New Zealand 16.1 per cent, the United Kingdom 15 per cent, France 13.6 per cent, the United States of America 12.4 per cent, Canada 11.2 per cent, Japan 7.1 per cent and Germany 5.5 per cent. Our containment of inflation is the envy of most other Western world countries. Although interest rates are too high at 14 per cent they compare favourably with 21 per cent in the United States of America, 19 per cent in Canada, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 11 per cent in West Germany. Recently the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) announced investment projects in the committed or final feasibility stages to a total value of $33 billion or some 306 proposals. This is double the level of project investment identified in a similar schedule in October 1979-a doubling in less than two years. These development projects were for manufacturing plants, mining ventures, oil and gas wells and coal and iron ore projects. All of these investments will bring increased benefits and opportunities to all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In spite of unemployment in excess of 300,000, there has been considerable and steady growth in the employment area. In November 1980, 157,900 more people had jobs than a year previously and 311,200 more than in November 1978. Unemployment in January 1981 stood at 6.3 per cent compared with 6.7 per cent in January 1980. Retail sales are up. Exploration for oil and gas has increased. A rise of 4 per cent has been forecast by the OECD in our gross domestic product whilst the average for all countries for 1981 is forecast at one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to two prominent Australians who have spoken in quite glowing terms about the Australian economy. First of all I would like to quote the comments of Ross Gittins, the economics editor of the Sydney Morning Herald. In the National Times of 15 February he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> The economy is expanding quite strongly, with real incomes growing, consumer spending buoyant, and business investment booming. Employment is on the up and up and there are signs that unemployment is starting to drop a fraction. Interest rates seem to have peaked and inflation has dipped below double figures. The economic prospect for the early 1980s is looking decidedly more encouraging than it did 12 or even 6 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn to some comments by John Stone, Secretary to the Treasury, who a few weeks ago addressed the Annual Agricultural Outlook Conference. He said that if it were not for the drought and the flatter world economy:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we would currently be facing in Australia what might almost be described as an economic 'boom' of a kind we have nearly forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA>In his comments he noted that the reasonably swift expansion of the economy would continue, growth in business investment would be 15 per cent in real terms as a result of an improved climate for investment due to control of Government spending, there would be a downturn in exports in 1980-81 but that there was a good medium term outlook for exports based on resources provided that Australia's new-found international competitiveness could be maintained. He noted growth in private consumption in excess of 3 per cent following strong employment growth and a rise in real disposable incomes and very strong growth in total employment-averaging 2.9 per cent-and the work participation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we have established beyond all reasonble doubt that the economy is in good shape. Let me turn to the damaging effect our industrial unrest is having on that economy. Millions of man-hours are being lost annually because of irresponsible action by union leaders. Although damage is being done to employers the greatest damage is being sustained by the unionists-the workers-themselves. The loss in wages is astronomical. This, of course, means a lowering of the standards of living of people involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to Australia's international reputation, which is extremely important to us. Union leaders may not be interested in our international reputation as a supplier of goods, be they primary products or manufactured goods. But I am sure that the average Australian is concerned. With 14.5 million people, a large land mass producing vast quantities of beef, wool, wheat and other primary products and, of course, the mining of billions of tonnes of natural resources, Australia is a great exporting nation. There is no way that Australia can use what it produces; we must export. Strikes, particularly prolonged ones affecting our exports, severely damage our reputation as a reliable supplier on world markets. I call on all Australians to work towards the minimisation of industrial disputes in order that our international reputation as a supplier may be restored. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall illustrate some of the trivial issues that cause industrial disputation. Union leaders call men and women out on strike because of rather trivial matters. If we look just at the last couple of months, for instance in the engineering and metal trades, we see an example at the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd Port Waratah plant where 30 Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union members employed as tradesmen in the coke ovens department stopped work at 12.30 p.m. over a disciplinary matter. Work was resumed at 4 p.m. on the same day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member listens he might see just how serious some of these matters are. Forty Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia members employed as tradesmen assistants in the coke ovens department stopped work at 12.30 p.m. after an employee was spoken to in his tea-break. Work was resumed at 4 p.m. on the same day. On 23 February 40 FIA members employed as tradesmen assistants in the coke ovens department stopped work at 12.30 p.m. because a septic tank was emptied adjacent to their crib room during the tea-break. Work was resumed at 4 p.m. on the same day. Let me go a little further. Ten AMSWU members and 18 FIA members employed on No. 2 bloom mill maintenance stopped work at 9.15 a.m. over the removal of a danger tag. Work was resumed at 7.30 a.m. on 24 February.</PARA></TALK.START>

On 24 February this year 135 FIA members and 10 AMSWU members employed on No. 2 bloom mill maintenance and production stopped work at 8 a.m. in protest at the use of apprentices during a previous stoppage. Work was resumed at 8 a.m. on 25 February. Again, on 24 February, 40 FIA members employed as tradesmen assistants in the coke ovens department stopped work at 12.30 p.m. in protest at their pay being docked for their entering the crib room early. Work was resumed at 4 p.m. on the same day. That is the story over and over again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At Mount Newman Mining Co. Pty Ltd 10 Transport Workers Union of Australia members held a stop work meeting between 8.30 a.m. and 9 a.m. on 5 January to discuss support for other sections of the TWU during possible strike action. A group of 18 Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australia members held a stop work meeting between 7.45 p.m. and 8.15 p.m. on 6 January to discuss a greaser's allegedly pressing a button to start a shovel. That is the sort of situation we are getting around the nation. It is time that the honourable member for Wills, as a former president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, did something in this place to demonstrate that he is concerned now that he is in a different position of power. Between 12.15 p.m. on 27 January and 7 a.m. on 29 January 19 AMSWU members stopped work over the company's refusal to pay overtime to six of its members for a shift they did not work on 17 January. So the story goes on and on. I mention those cases-there are many more of them here in my document-to illustrate how irresponsible are the unions, particularly the union leaders, in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently we had the case of the Qantas Airways Ltd dispute. A dispute erupted which had national and, indeed, international significance. An agreement was reached with the stewards in that case. Yet the ACTU deliberately carried on the dispute. On the one hand the employer and the employees concerned decided on an agreement yet on the other hand the ACTU saw fit to continue that argument. I ask: Do Labor Party Opposition members condone these sorts of actions? If not, I suggest to them that they must vote with the Government on this motion. </PARA>

This is what is shown: Firstly, looking at growth in the real gross domestic product-that is, what we are doing in terms of economic management to increase the output of goods and services-we see that in the period from 1976 to 1979, which was the latest period which could be covered by Dr Sheehan in his book and which covered the whole period of this Government--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, if you would stop him that would provide the greatest help. What was the growth in output under this splendid economic management record of this Government to which the honourable member for Petrie has referred? The rate for Australia in the period from 1976 to 1979 was 2.8 per cent. That was Australia's achievement under this great government of economic management, of which we are supposed to be proud. The rate of growth for all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries was 4 per cent. Australia's rate under the Fraser Government in the period was 2.8 per cent. What was the situation in regard to inflation for the whole of this period? Australia had an inflation rate of 11 per cent and for all OECD countries it was 8.5 per cent. Right at the very outset the intellectual framework-if I may deign to use that phrase in respect of the honourable member for Petrie-falls down. He asserted that the Government had a tremendous achievement when the facts show that the opposite is true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look in detail at the motion and let us proceed to demolish it. Before doing so let me make a point in opening because there are those perverse people on the other side of the House who will seek to misrepresent the position of the Opposition. We on this side of the House do not say that the current industrial relations situation in this country is perfect. We do not condone all strikes. Many strikes which occur should not occur. As distinct from the honourable member, I am able to speak of concrete realities. We have tried to do something constructive about the situation instead of embarking upon this type of divisive exercise. Let us proceed further in the consideration of the actual motion, having made our general point clear in opening about our view of the state of industrial relations in this country. Of course it can be improved and it ought to be improved. It will not be improved by the divisive attempt embarked upon by the honourable member for Petrie. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look now in some detail at his motion. Before I go through it point by point I make the preliminary remark that the Opposition and I are not concerned to impugn the motives of many of the marchers who were involved and to whom the motion refers. In particular, as I made it clear publicly, I am not concerned to impugn the motives or the integrity of Tania Harris. What I was concerned to impugn and am concerned to impugn here is the integrity of the people who brought her here and organised her visit. The Murdoch Press brought her here not for the purpose, I believe, of trying to help constructively in this country but to assist divisiveness. Having said that, let me go through point by point and fact by fact to refute what is contained in the motion. As the motion was presented by a backward member and expressed a backward point of view, let us take each point in reverse order. The third point was that the House:</PARA>
<PARA>expresses concern at the unjustifiable effect of strikes and bans on employment opportunities for young and old, their impact on inflation, as well as the international reputation of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The first point that needs to be made in the context of the honourable member's reference to the impact of the industrial relations situation on the reputation of Australia is this: I plead with him to take some notice of his own Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony). The other night I referred to the statement of the Deputy Prime Minister and must do so again now in view of the fact that the honourable member has said that we should be concerned with the impact of industrial disputation on Australia's international reputation. What did the Deputy Prime Minister say in Tokyo on Australia Day regarding this matter? Let me remind the House of what he said. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the House of what the Deputy Prime Minister said. No wonder it has got under the skin of honourable members opposite. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one aspect about Australia that is sometimes raised with me and indeed was raised at last week's discussions. That is the industrial relations situation in Australia. I acknowledge that there are too many strikes in Australia but the position in Australia is not as serious as the position in the US, Britain or a number of other large industrialised countries. Furthermore, in terms of man days lost, the impact of strikes in Australia is small compared with that of public holidays and normal holidays of workers. </PARA>
<PARA>In terms of the nonsense that has come from the honourable member for Petrie about the impact of strikes and the industrial relations situation on Australia's international reputation, I ask honourable members to note the remarks of the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia in Tokyo on Australia Day. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I believe--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Deputy Prime Minister-</PARA>
<PARA> that the industrial situation in Australia is given too much prominence by some people. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Deputy Prime Minister said in Tokyo. He pleaded in terms of what was good for Australia, that we should not have people undermining our international reputation and creating difficulties for us as a large trading nation. He responsibly said: 'If you have got the concern of Australia at heart and you are not concerned with cheap political point scoring, do not go on, do not emphasise, do not exaggerate about the level of industrial disputes in Australia'. He said that too many people had done so. What is the situation today after the Deputy Prime Minister has pleaded with concerned, patriotic and loyal Australians not to downgrade their country? We have the honourable member for Petrie doing in this House precisely what the Deputy Prime Minister pleaded in Tokyo should not be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, let us proceed a little further and examine the facts. I presume that these people are concerned with an independent, impartial assessment about the impact on the rate of inflation of strikes and wage increases which are brought about by strikes outside the aegis of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commision. Instead of looking at what the honourable member for Petrie had to say about the impact of these things on inflation, let us see what the independent umpire had to say. I refer, firstly, to the decision on 4 January of the Full Bench of the Commission in the national wage case. After listening to submissions from this Government as to the impact on inflation of wage increases brought about by strikes and other causes, the Full Bench analysed the factor which was responsible for inflation. I wish to read out what the umpire had to say. I suppose the answer from our friends on the other side of the House would be an abuse of the Arbitration Commission and an abuse of the umpire. On 4 January 1980 the Full Bench, in its national wage case decision, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In our decision of June 1979, we referred to the risk of a renewed rise in the inflation rate. The movements in the June and September CPI have confirmed our fears, as the following figures show . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Full Bench cited various figures and went on:</PARA>
<PARA> There is general agreement that wages are not to blame for this development which is explained by other factors-the Commonwealth Government's decision to raise the price of domestic oil to full import parity in one step; the continued rise in the world price of oil; and the sharp rise in world prices of meat, wool, metals and various raw materials. </PARA>
<PARA>So what did the independent umpire say in respect of the factor responsible for the increase in the rate of inflation? It said that wages were not responsible. The first element that the independent umpire nominated as being responsible for the increase in inflation was the decision of the Commonwealth Government in regard to its oil parity pricing policy. That is what the independent umpire said. He did not say that inflation was brought about by wages and the action of unions. He said that it was brought about by the action of this Government. What did the Commission say on page 16 of the same judgment? After referring to statistics it said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the face of these statistics and bearing in mind that the resurgence of inflation has been caused not by wages but by international factors which have brought prosperity to certain sectors of the Australian economy, we are not prepared to adopt the course proposed by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have it. The Government went before the independent arbitrator and gave its trumped-up version of what was responsible for inflation. It was told by the independent umpire: 'We do not accept what you are putting'. The Full Bench of the Arbitration Commission, the independent umpire, in the national wage case said: 'It is not your explanation which is right but other factors'. The first one nominated was a decision of the Government itself. What did the Commission say six months later? I refer to its judgment on 14 July 1980. At page 12, after referring to tables 3, 4 and 5, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We conclude from these tables that they endorse the validity of the ACTU submission . . . that the non-wage factors remain the predominant contributing factors in the continuing acceleration of inflation as measured by the CPI for the two quarters under review. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the facts as they come from the umpire, that body which this Government through its Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) urges the trade unions to go to. He tells the trade unions to go to the umpire and to rely on what the umpire says. This Government and this Prime Minister tell them to accept the word of the umpire. I have just quoted the words of the umpire. The Government and the Prime Minister say that we should accept the umpire's word. I have read the words of the umpire. The umpire has said that it is not wages and strikes that are causing inflation. The umpire upon whom the Government tells us to rely said that the first factor causing inflation is a decision of this Government itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is likewise quite happy to rely upon what the umpire has said but it is a matter of very great distress to me that the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) should read out what the umpire said in 1980 but not what the umpire said in 1981. Let us listen to what the umpire, the Full Bench of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, said in its last national wage case decision, that of 9 January 1981, about the very issue which we are debating in this House today. The Commission said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The public have been greatly inconvenienced. Disruption of rail services in Victoria and New South Wales, strikes by tanker drivers, aircraft refuellers, radar technicians and, increasingly, the direct involvement of public servants at all levels of government in strikes, bans and limitations, have caused distress, lost time and hardship to the Australian community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us listen to what else the umpire said on that occasion. Again, this is something that the honourable member for Wills would not read out. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that all disputes are ultimately resolved but the persistence of industrial action on such a wide scale, even before recourse to tribunals, makes it clear that one of the main objectives of the present system has been seriously compromised. The Commission has persevered with the system despite this fact in the hope that the pressure of stoppages and bans would significantly decline. But it is clear now that this hope has not been fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the umpire, the Arbitration Commission, said about the issue being debated in this motion. It said firstly that the nation has been wracked by industrial disputation, secondly that the workers have suffered as a result, and thirdly that the very system of wage indexation has been brought to its knees by that disputation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day I thought-this was confirmed this morning after listening to the honourable member for Wills-that George Orwell's 'newspeak' had arrived in Australia. We know what 'newspeak' is. It is the process of giving a word the meaning one wants it to have and not the meaning that the word has. The word 'divisive' keeps coming up. It was used three times today by the honourable member for Wills. It has been used several times over the last week or so. The allegation has been made that those who have been protesting about strikes, bans and limitations that have disrupted their own lives are divisive. 'Divisive' is the word that has been used. Those people have been accused of taking divisive action. What an extraordinary use of language that is. The people who have taken part in these marches are doing no more than responding in a normal way to bring about some sort of stability in society. They are protesting against the succession of disruptions, strikes, limitations and bans that have plagued this country for years, particularly over the last few months. These people want a normal life. They want to work and use public transport which they pay for themselves. They want to see their country prosper. They are proud of it. In response to their protests the accusation is made that they are divisive. </PARA>
<PARA> The public at large has seen the country wracked by industrial disputes. People have seen an increase in the number of disputes. They have seen workers and themselves inconvenienced. People have been unable to earn their own wages and meet their own commitments. They have seen pickets set up to stop people going about their lawful activities. They have seen people assaulted when they tried to cross those picket lines. They have been prevented from using public transport that they pay for themselves because the transport workers, whose wages they also pay, have refused to work on occasions. In Melbourne people have even been prevented from dumping their rubbish during a garbage collectors' strike. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a reaction against this by the community-at long last, one might say. This is not just rhetoric. The statistics show that the number of strikes and their effect on the community is increasing. Let us look briefly at the statistics for the September quarter. Workers involved in strikes lost more time on average during the September quarter than they did in any of the previous six quarters. The number of working days lost was 848,000 in that one quarter of last year. The loss of wages from disputes, not from all disputes but from those involving stoppages of 10 man-days or more, in the September quarter was $42m. That is not $42m that the employers or the Government lost; it is what the workers themselves lost. That is the agony of the whole situation. It is the worker himself who suffers when he is virtually forced to go out on strike by a minority of union leaders. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, at last there is some response from the public. Is it divisive for the public to respond as it has? Is it divisive to demand the right to work? Of course it is not. Is it divisive to demand the right to use public transport? Of course it is not. Is it divisive to be free once and for all from the black bans, closed shops, limitations, picket lines and strikes? Of course it is not divisive. But it is divisive for people such as the honourable member for Wills to mislead the House as to what the Arbitration Commission said and not read out its 1981 decision. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OD4">Mr N. A. BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. I will take the matter a little further in terms of fact. The honourable member for Wills was prepared to read out what the Arbitration Commission said when it suited his argument. He did not read out to the House what the Arbitration Commission said in its latest decision. That is a fact which he cannot ask me to withdraw and I will not withdraw it. He did not read out that decision. The Arbitration Commission made it plain that the system of wage indexation, which is the only thing that the weaker, less organised worker can rely upon, has been brought to its knees. That has been done by the actions of some people in the Labor Party and of some people in the trade union movement. Those are facts. Who is being divisive-let us come back to that word-when a small group of builders labourers, in the middle of a working period, decide to stop a concrete pour so that the building cannot progress, and other building workers have to be stood down for the rest of the day and lose wages?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Who is being divisive when, in the middle of a working day, some railways union employees decide to go on strike, although the work force has already come into the city, or is at Broadmeadows or some other industrial centre, cannot get home by any means other than public transport, and is left stranded and has either to walk home, take taxis or find some other means of getting there? Who is being divisive then? Who is being divisive when people protest about that sort of thuggery? Who is being divisive when the ordinary working man is sick and tired of being compromised by some of the extreme left wing union leaders and some of their handmaidens in the Labor Party and, indeed, in this Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> Where does the responsibility for all of this lie? It lies with a small group of union leaders who do not care what happens to the building industry. Do honourable members think that Mr Gallagher cares whether the membership of his union goes down, as it has over the last few years? He could not care less. Do honourable members think that he cares what happens to the building industry or whether it attracts investment? Of course he does not. Do honourable members think that he cares whether or not buildings are put up? Of course he does not. If the building industry collapses and people will not invest in it he and his cohorts will happily go off to some new area of activity and carry on their own personal revolution there. They could not care less about the workers. All that they care about is their own revolution. They could not care less whether their own members go for weeks and weeks without wages as long as their action furthers the revolution. Who is being divisive when that course of action is adopted? The union leaders are being divisive. </PARA>
<PARA> The most unfortunate aspect of it all is that it is the worker who suffers from this sort of action. It is not the union leader or the employer. That, after all, is the reason so many union members, so many ordinary workers, vote for this Government. In fact, it could not be in office if hundreds of thousands of workers had not voted for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The first thing I want to do is to condemn the Government for bringing on this motion having regard to the fact that there is a prior notice of want of confidence of this House in the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner). You would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Westminster system, which we often hear talked about in this Parliament, requires as a matter of principle that, when a Minister is under notice of censure by way of a motion, such motion be called on straight away. In recent years, the practice has developed that the motion can be adjourned until the next sitting day. It is certainly out of accord with that principle for the Government to do as it has done here. A Minister is facing a serious censure motion but the Government uses its numbers so that the censure motion is left on the Notice Paper and then again uses its numbers to bring on for debate this motion which can at very best be regarded only as a thoroughly trite, uninformed political exercise. Let me say at the outset that I for one will not vote for a motion that endorses the feelings of those Australians who were involved in recent marches.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I want to encourage in this House is some rational assessment of the nature of industrial disputation and the problems that confront this community in respect to it. Certainly the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr N. A. Brown) was able to quote from a judgment which indicated that a particular strike had caused hardship and suffering. Of course he knows that, and he ought to, because when he is not in this Parliament, he is in the industrial tribunals of this nation as an employers' advocate, on a very substantial fee, arguing the case for the employer. He then comes into this House and commands attention when he changes briefs, and states: 'Now I am talking on behalf of the poor benighted worker who is misguided by his union leadership'. If one looks at the record of the honourable member for Diamond Valley and at the causes that he has advocated in the industrial courts of Australia and asks any section of the Australian working class who they would rather have to advise them-their properly elected union officials or the honourable member for Diamond Valley-I do not have any hesitation in saying that I know what advice unionists would choose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, equally, if this were not a political stunt, what an extraordinary thing it would be for this motion to be moved by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges). Not even the honourable gentleman's closest friends, those who love him, would say that amongst his most consuming and passionate interests was any interest at all in industrial affairs. When I heard that the honourable gentleman was moving this motion, I thought perhaps he had an interest which has never been made apparent to this Parliament. I was so concerned about his interest that I went to the trouble of examining Hansard. This man who, as Deputy Whip, says he is concerned about industrial strikes, has not in the course of the last three years addressed a single question on any matter related to industrial conditions, problems or strikes. </PARA>

I am not about to criticise him for that, but I am not prepared to regard him seriously when he now asserts in this House that he is filled with passion about industrial relations. Let us look at some of these questions. This man wants to lecture to the trade union movement-let me use his term-'On working for Australians and Australia'. What ringing tones-'Working for Australia and Australians'. The honourable member for Petrie-a chemist-on 6 November 1979 indicated in this House his real interests when he put a question on notice which stated, inter alia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Will the Government limit the supply of prescriptions from hospitals and use the facility of private pharmacies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On 19 February he wanted to know the total number of prescriptions for the contraceptive pill in each of the last five years. Maybe he was not getting his share of the scripts. This is the man who now comes into this House as a self-appointed advocate on industrial affairs and urges members of this Parliament to share his sudden, overwhelming and consuming interest in industrial relations. I am delighted to remind the honourable gentleman of the decisions and the statements made by those who have had the responsibility of dealing with our industrial relations for years. Time after time the industrial commission and its spokesmen have pointed out that when one is looking at industrial disputation in Australia it is quite improper to attribute every industrial dispute to the trade union movement. The honourable member for Petrie has not involved himself in any one of those questions in the past three years. Australian Industrial Relations, a publication by Plowman, Deery and Fisher, supports the view of the Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony). </PARA>

The table points out that the most serious loss in working days in Australia is due not only to industrial accidents but also to unemployment which is the direct result of the policies pursued by this Government. I want to make some more general comments about the nature of the trade union movement in Australia. Honourable gentlemen opposite never cease telling us that they believe in a free enterprise and a competitive society. I put it to them that their concept of competition cannot simply be limited to what goes on at two grocery shops at the corner of the street. Competition in Australian society at present involves continuous competition by powerful corporations which, in their dealings, operate as the most powerful economic group within the economy. We have retailers, manufacturers and professional groupings. The honourable member for Diamond Valley is a member of such a professional grouping, as I am. For example, does anybody in Australia seriously believe that the scale of legal fees, medical fees, professional fees--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr HOLDING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And pharmacists' fees, are not ultimately determined by the pressure groups of those professional bodies? If we live in a competitive society and we want to adhere to the requirements of a competitive model, one of the factors which must be involved to achieve a freely operating competitive society is the trade union movement. The trade union movement is created by the very competitiveness, the very nature, of this society. It represents those people at the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum who have only their trade unions to defend their living standards and living rights. The trade union movement not only defends those rights but also it ultimately has been prepared to take on much broader struggles on issues which encompass such matters as civil liberties. I find it extraordinary that the honourable member for Petrie now wants us to support a demonstration. I support the right of people to demonstrate in the streets of Brisbane. That right does not exist because of any actions taken by the honourable member for Petrie; it had to be won by people like Senator Georges, members of the Queensland trade union movement and members of the labour movement being prepared to go to goal to establish that right to use the streets, for the purposes of demonstrations. When the question of whether that right should exist was debated in this House the honourable member for Petrie said: 'You could not have demonstrations in the streets of Brisbane. They are unruly and they affect the traffic'. Now he wants us to support the sentiments expressed in one such demonstration. We cannot have two sets of standards. As the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) said, we on this side of the House concede that from time to time strikes have been misjudged. But has there ever been an occasion-I cannot remember one-when this Government has said that any merit at all can be found in a strike concerning workers' claims?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. Recently the Prime Minister has become a strong advocate of trade union rights, but where does he advocate those rights should be held? It is in Poland. When Walesa and the infant trade union movement of Poland are prepared to hold strikes we see honourable members on the other side of the House moving motions stating what a noble, what a brave, what a courageous action that is. I support Walesa and the efforts of the trade union movement in Poland. But let me say this: I am not prepared, as is the honourable member on the other side of the House, to demand rights for workers in Poland, a communist country, before I honour my first obligation, which is to fight for the rights of workers in Australia. That is the difference between the attitudes of honourable members on this side of the House and those of honourable members opposite. It is interesting that National Country Party members support this motion. That party was brought into being so that it could become a political representative of primary producers. There is no need for farmers to unionise like industrial workers. They have traditionally used the political structure within Australia and the National party to operate as a pressure group within conservative coalitions.</PARA></TALK.START>

No group is more politically ruthless in pursuing its interests on behalf of a sectional group than is the National Country Party. Its motivation in that respect is no less worthy than is the motivation of the average trade union official. He fights for his membership; he fights to preserve their living standards.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that all members of this House would support this motion, yet we have just heard from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) that he condemns it. I presume that he condemns, for example, that part of the motion which states that this House:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . expresses concern at the unjustifiable effect of strikes and bans on employment opportunities for young and old, their impact on inflation, as well as the international reputation of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is most beneficial that today's proceedings are being broadcast, as listeners will have been able to hear the past Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian Parliament condemning such a motion. He referred to the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) in terms which certainly did not dignify a member of this House. The motion we are debating endorses the action taken by those many Australians who feel very strongly about strikes and disputes in this country. Marches of this type are not a new phenomenon. I remind the House that back in World War I there was a tremendous groundswell of opinion concerning strikes. People expressed distaste and disgust at strikes at the Sydney wharves. At that time strikes threatened to deny our allies war provisions. Both country and city people expressed their disgust and their concern by going to Sydney by the train load and camping at the Sydney Showground. As a result, the strikes were broken and the ships were loaded. That might be the mood of the people in this country at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the remarkable situation of a young woman in New Zealand who, on the spur of the moment, after a discussion with some friends and a quick call to a radio station, was able to mobilise thousands of people-at least 30,000 people-to march through the streets of Auckland to express their concern not only about strikes but also about the future of their country. They were expressing a deep seated frustration, a despair, a desperation, a resentment. They were concerned for the future of their country because of the effects of industrial disputation and strikes. Their concern certainly is about unions, about disputes, black bans, go-slows, work to rules-all the ludicrous trivialities which now are emerging in the industrial scene in so many westernised countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Just prior to Christmas I saw one of the most telling cartoons I have seen for a long time. Petty drew a picture of three wise men carrying a strike banner, picketing against the use of what he called an 'auto-Christmas machine' and going: 'Ho, ho, ho'. They were saying: 'We want a Noel productivity bonus, we want retraining of wise men, we want a shepherd retirement plan, we want quarterly harking for the herald angels and we want a shorter silent night'. It would be funny if it were not such a tragic comment on the contemporary state of industrial relations in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would ask the honourable member to note that I have worked in abattoirs and I have been a member of a union. People are denied the right to work, to speak, to express a contrary view. They are intimidated. Threats are made not only to unionists but also to their families. At times, regrettably, we have seen physical violence as a result of strike action and the intimidation associated with it. Recently every facet of life in this country has been affected by strike action-essential services such as our power industry, fire services, garbage services, telephone services, mail, transport services, fuel supply, and even the supply of basic foodstuffs such as milk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was not so long ago that one of the Sydney daily newspapers ran a column on the front page indicating where strikes were occurring that day or that week. I recall the reactions to those lists. People thought it was dreadful and a sad indictment of Australia that newspapers had to run a daily list of strikes and industrial disputes. Since then we have been bombarded with editorial comments, television programs and radio talkback programs as to how bad the situation is in Australia. Yet we seem to shrug our shoulders with tired resignation because most people cannot see how they can do anything about it. How often have we heard people asking: 'Who is running the country'?</PARA>
<PARA> This Government and previous governments have not been strong enough in dealing with this problem. We have witnessed interminable negotiations and slow, protracted processes of conciliation and arbitration. We have witnessed hesitancy and people saying: 'Do not escalate this dispute. Do not provoke further trouble'. At times elected representatives have been virtually impotent in their capacity to solve disputes, and, in many cases far too timid to intervene. It may be a reflection on past years and past leaders that many people say to me: 'Ben Chifley was prepared to send the troops into the coal mines. What is the situation now?' We have heard election promises that a strong stand will be taken, that essential services will be maintained and that secret ballots for unionists will provide one of the answers. Yet in many cases these intentions have not been fulfilled. I am yet to be convinced why a compulsory secret ballot for strike action cannot be implemented. In this electronic age all the punters in Australia can know within seconds through the Totalizator Agency Board, whether a horse has fallen at Randwick. With that sort of technological capacity in this age we should be able to take a nationwide vote on the shop floor as to whether or not to take strike action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may but I am not fearful of having an argument on my side. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) says that really it is not such a major problem if it is assessed in terms of man-days lost. We have seen different types of strike action emerge in this country where key trades, key numbers of people or a small number of employees can hold to ransom a major industry or a major operation such as a power station. It is not simply a matter of man-days lost. For the first time in many years we now see demonstrations indicating that the public is dissatisfied. Had we followed the public opinion polls we would have known about that dissatisfaction. Public opinion polls consistently have shown that this is a very real concern of the average Australian. Such demonstrations are not an aberration, as was claimed by the Deputy Premier of New South Wales. Certainly, they are not something untoward, as I believe the honourable member for Wills indicated. It is not solely a case of union bashing for the sake of union bashing but an expression of opinion by a very large proportion of people. It certainly is not fascist. One could perhaps pick on one person in that category but I cannot imagine that there were 40,000 to 70,000 fascists marching down the streets of Auckland the other day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not just the self-employed or the right wing reactionaries; it is the general community. Many of those people are unionists themselves; many of those people are families of unionists. They are sick and tired of being told by their union organisers what to do, whether or not to go on strike, when to go to work, to pay a levy, to do this and that, to join up or to pay up or to shut up or to go without pay. In many cases they are being told so to do by a union organiser who has been paid from their own levies. On numerous occasions the rank and file members have gone against their union hierarchy. This has occurred in meatworks, manufacturing plants and even in some schools. How seriously do the rank and file members take their directives when we witness such small turnouts as occurs in a number of strikes? How often do we see other unionists who believe they do not have a right to remove services from the community maintaining or attempting to maintain essential services? Those people who endeavoured to keep Qantas Airways Ltd operating during the recent dispute deserve our greatest commendation. </PARA>
<PARA> Who really wins and benefits from industrial disputes? The working public does not win. Do the families, pensioners, aged, poor and disadvantaged win when they are denied public transport services? Do the young and the unemployed win? Perhaps the unionists win in the short term but not in the longer term. Naturally the reaction of the employers, particularly the smaller ones, to excessive demands for wages, penalties, overtime and reduced working hours is to reduce staff. They cannot be blamed for so doing. Certainly it is not helping the young unemployed when people are being replaced with machines that do not strike. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not denying the right to withhold labour as a legitimate expression of a legitimate grievance, but I do not agree with the right to strike on issues that are not legitimate matters concerning the conditions of work of unionists. Strikes occur because it is alleged that it is too hot, too cold, too hard, or too far to go. The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) mentioned a situation where a strike eventuated because a supervisor reprimanded a unionist in his teabreak. The trouble in this country is that everybody thinks that somebody else owes him a living. People are watching one another in case somebody gets a bit of advantage over somebody else. There is a tendency to pull down, denigrate and denounce those who work hard and, as a result of working hard, earn a reward. </PARA>
<PARA> Other honourable members have pointed out the very serious consequences of industrial disputation and strikes to the national economy. Anybody involved with exports would know that Australia's reputation as a reliable, stable and predictable supplier of raw materials is fairly tarnished. </PARA>

The alternatives for Australian exports are wide and varied throughout the world. Importing countries can obtain iron or other basic materials and in many cases, food and fibre from countries other than Australia. Australia has no sole franchise for most of these commodities. It is in no position to become known as an unreliable and unpredictable supplier of raw materials. The effects of industrial disputation and strikes on tourism becomes more and more devastating every day. Many people come to this country and say that it is a magnificent country, but they are loath to return because of the hassles to which they have been subjected through strikes and disputes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member looks through the records he will see that we have had marches much larger than that. Nobody on the other side of the House endorsed the marches that took place during the Vietnam war. Government supporters did not endorse the marches in those days. Why are they suddenly so interested in endorsing marches? It is because the marches are anti-union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to look at who organised these marches in Australia. Who initiated them? The idea to march came from New Zealand. It was not even initiated in Australia. The newspapers in Australia, mainly the Murdoch Press, got hold of what happened in New Zealand, decided to headline the march and to make it a viable proposition for Australians take up. Australia could not even find the impetus to get the thing going. What strikes have taken place in this country over the last 12 months to warrant such a march? Where are the strikes that prompted this sudden initiative? It is understandable that a march was held in New Zealand because industrial disputes were current at the time. The New Zealand people could have had reasons for doing what they did. I will not say anything against Tania Harris or the people in New Zealand because what they do is their business. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I think that honourable members on the other side of the House are engaging in pure opportunism by bringing forward a motion which asks this Parliament to support marches in the capital cities when we do not even know who organised them. In fact, from what my friend the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) told the House last night one of the prominent nazis in this country led the march in Sydney. So I think one has to be very careful about whom one is supporting in endorsing the type of motion which is before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Petrie compared Australia with the rest of the world. He tried to say that because this country is so good unionists have no right to stand up when employers push them down. The honourable member compared conditions in Australia with those overseas. I have not heard in this debate honourable members on the other side of the House say one word against the employer who perhaps creates an industrial dispute. Are industrial disputes always the fault of the unions? Are the union leaders always at fault? Why is it that we do not hear occasionally from the other side of the House that perhaps we have bad managers in the country who could create a situation in which a genuine industrial dispute could take place?</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Petrie quoted from a paper which claimed that people went on strike for safety reasons. To hear the honourable member speak one would reckon that ordinary working people were expected to front up to any job situation whether or not it was safe. An employee has every right to withdraw his labour if conditions are not right. If conditions are dangerous he has every right to take this action. This is particularly so if, as happens in many cases, the employer ignores the requests of the union to do something about those conditions. The honourable member just cannot take the point of view that the unions are always wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Petrie also referred to confrontation. If ever in this Parliament we have seen tactics of confrontation it has been those pursued by this Government. At the present time there is a great deal of legislation on the books which promotes confrontation. It is designed not to create harmony in the country but to create problems. We have seen this legislation used in the transport strike. However, it was not used in the transport blockade, when the highways around Australia were blocked. We heard nothing from the Government side at that time about what should be done to solve one of the most disruptive strikes that we have ever had. </PARA>
<PARA> A few days ago we had a dispute in the Latrobe Valley which is the area I represent in this Parliament. It was once again mooted that the truckies have another blockade so that the problems that they had could be brought to the attention of the Government. They were quite entitled to do that. However, they decided then and there that they would be better off if they took their case directly to the Government. However, we do not hear anything from the other side of the House when the problems affecting the ordinary working people are caused by government action. Employers are quite capable of using direct action. An employer can take the direct action of adjusting the price of his product at any time. He does not have to go to a tribunal to ask whether he can do this. He just puts his price up. The only thing that may hold his price back is competition. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) said, a small grocer might be in competition with another grocer around the corner. In private enterprise this is about the only restraint on direct action. Employers are entitled to put up their prices and take direct action. However, Government supporters take the view that the working man is not entitled to take direct action. Many a time this is the only way in which common sense can be brought to bear. Employees are entitled to take such action. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that we should not support these marches is highlighted in an article in today's Age. This Parliament could not support the sort of thing to which the article refers. The article is headed: 'Screams, struggles and bitter division'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> 11.50 am: yesterday: The City Square is a vortex of angry echoes, screaming people, hatred, raw patriotism, emotionalism, bad blood, and even mateship. It is an ugly atmosphere. </PARA>
<PARA>Is this what this House is being asked to endorse? Is this what members on the other side of the House want the Parliament to endorse? Are these the tactics they want employed to bring unity to this country? The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Fascists, communists, Come-on-Aussie, scabs, communist scabs, fascist scabs, Aussie do care, Prevent the death of our country . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The whole thing is a picture of total confusion. It is designed to divide this country. Yet Government supporters have the nerve to bring this issue into this Parliament and to ask the Parliament to endorse this type of march. The only newspaper group to come out strongly in favour of the march was the Murdoch Press. Right across the country last week newspaper after newspaper urged Australians to take up the example set by Tania Harris. The newspapers incited people to march. For what reason did they do this? It was done to create a division-to divide the country. If any proof is needed that this is the reason behind this action, one has only to listen to speeches made by members on the other side of the House, because not once did we hear anything else but anti-unionism. Not once did they mention any other cause of disputes in this country. The unions are always at fault. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take it a little further and ask whether the unions are always at fault. Let me take as example possibly one of the longest disputes in this country. I have raised this matter in the House previously during the adjournment debate. I refer to the dispute in the Latrobe Valley of Victoria. The Australian newspaper carried an article headed '$8m peace offering to strike workers'. If one reads that article one finds that the peace offering came from the Victorian Government, that it had nothing to do with the strikers. The situation in Latrobe Valley was that nine concrete batchers who were working excessive overtime could not reach agreement with their employer in respect of putting on more labour. The job was too big and they wanted more assistance. They had a meeting and informed the employer that they were going to work only a 40-hour week, which was within the law. They were sacked. As a result of that sacking 600 workers were stood down on the Thursday after Easter. They were sacked on the spot. Yet that is the sort of dispute that this newspaper depicts on its front page as a strike. Because of this publicity honourable members opposite come into the Parliament and say we have to march against strikes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get our facts right. Why did honourable members opposite not march against the disruption that was created in the Latrobe Valley dispute, a dispute which had nothing to do with men going on strike. That disruption involved a deliberate attempt by the State Electricity Commission to slow down work on a construction site. Because of that the men in that dispute copped it. What do they get in the newspapers? What do they get from the other side of the House? 'Strike' is the only word the Government seems to know. I want to raise this point because it was raised by the honourable member for Petrie when he attacked the Builders Labourers Federation. It seems that Government members opposite have decided that those people in the Latrobe Valley will be a good target in their confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the honourable member for Petrie that when those men and their families in the Latrobe Valley had nothing to eat-I can guarantee this; there is evidence to show it-70 families one week had to go into that union office and depend on the BLF members, good ordinary Australian workers, to support them with food vouchers. I did not hear anything from the Government side about that-not one word. Government member's attacked the union movement, attacked the BLF as some sort of monstrous creature that is the cause of all the problems in the country. Admittedly, there are times in disputes in the building industry when nasty things happen on both sides. There is no doubt about that. I am prepared to admit that. But when these people were in the right at that time, they have every right to have that put forward to the public. They should not have had headlines claiming that they were on strike, as has been pushed by the Government side. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Calare (Mr MacKenzie) mentioned a milk dispute. This possibily highlights the cynicism of those on the other side of the House and what goes on in strikes. I was vitally involved in that dispute. Two years ago in Victoria when we had a transport strike the milk supply industry was involved in spite of the fact that the unions had given an agreement that they would not pull milk suppliers out. The Victorian Chamber of Manufacturers in its negotiations on that dispute deliberately pulled a tactic on a Friday afternoon which created the situation in which, if the men had gone back to work, their whole claim would have been down the drain. The men were still out of work over the weekend. On the Sunday morning-I will make this quite clear in the time that I have left-news reports stated that Mr Ivan Hodgson, the Federal Secretary of the Transport Workers Union of Australia, could not be contacted. Being a plain old cow cocky at the time I rang him up to ask what was going on and why he could not be contacted. On answering the phone he said: ' I am sitting here waiting for someone to talk to me'. I went to the phone to ring the leader of the farmers' organisation and said: 'Look, this dispute is going to explode', because the members of the Country Party in the area at the time were organising meetings to try to stir up as much trouble as they could. Within three hours of that phone call the trucks were rolling again and milk was being picked up. But the members of the Government side who were involved in that dispute were quite happy to see it continue until the following Wednesday. They want confrontation. They are desperate to get confrontation. I know of some tactics that were used. I got a phone call asking me to pull the plug out of my milk vat, to let it flow down the drain for media purposes to make it look bad so the public could see the milk running down the drain. I still had plenty of room to store the milk. There was no reason whatever for the action so I refused. If the people involved had asked somebody on the other side of the House to do so they probably would have got the co-operation that they wanted and the problems caused would have been immense. </PARA>

They have allowed those on the back bench to support it because they are not game to do so. They are quite happy to accept the divisions that have been caused in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>

All we are asking for is understanding and an intelligent sharing of the time. Time was set aside for the matter of public importance.

<PARA>The reason for the motion is quite apparent. It will mean that it is possible that the Joint Committee on the New Parliament House, which is faced with a fairly heavy program of review and decision-making between now and the end of May, can conclude its deliberations so that there will be no undue delay in the completion of the detailed design of the New Parliament House and so that that detailed new design can be presented to Parliament in August to become the next declared stage in accordance with the required program of submission for approval to this Parliament. The Committee, the Parliament House Construction Authority and the architect, I am told, are working to a tight schedule to enable completion of the building in time for the bicentenary in 1988. Demands on the Committee in the next two or three months while the plan is finalised are such that apparently it is not reasonable to maintain the schedule of meetings without some taking place during sittings of the House. The number of meetings envisaged, I am told, is about one a week, mainly of the Sub-committee. I commend the motion to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, as you have properly pointed out, the House is engaged in a debate of six Bills concerning the protection of the sea. These Bills are very complicated and very technical. They are oriented in general terms towards discouraging the pollution of the sea by oil. In this respect Australia has joined with other countries to give effect to international covenants and agreements. My colleague the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), who led for the Opposition in this debate, outlined in very detailed terms the complicated and technical provisions of the legislation. I simply want to summarise the Bills to give some kind of total overall context to the remarks that I wish to make. The first Bill is the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Bill. This Bill is involved with the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation known as IMCO. It is a specialised agency of the United Nations. Over 100 countries are associated with this organisation. All those countries base their laws on the provisions that are contained in the international convention and thereby arrive at international standards. This has the effect that ships with over 2,000 tons of oil on board must maintain insurance certificates to cover liability for pollution; that is to say, there is a prescribed rate per ship's tonnage to provide protection for up to $7.8m. Other provisions mean that ships can be detained if they contravene the provisions of the Bill or fail to meet penalties. One provision sets out liability for pollution damage. The owner of the ship from which the oil escapes is regarded as the person who is liable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Bill, the second Bill, seeks to give effect to an international convention of 1969. I notice that a Parliamentary Library summary states that the purpose of this Bill is to authorise the Government to take measures to protect the sea from oil and other noxious substances discharged from ships. Of course, that is a very brief synopsis of this complicated legislation. The international convention to which I refer involves intervention on the high seas in cases of oil pollution casualties. This Bill provides that while the 1973 protocol to the convention is not universally operative its provisions will operate from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Protection of the Sea (Discharge of Oil from Ships) Bill, the third Bill, seeks to repeal existing legislation about the pollution of the sea by oil and to make new provisions to cover that situation. The major feature prohibits oil discharges in an area which is less than 50 miles from the outer edge of the Great Barrier Reef. For the purpose of the legislation and I think possibly for the guidance of parliamentarians, if for no other purpose, a map has been prepared which indicates a mean shoreline drawn roughly from an area which is in the vicinity of Thursday Island down to Bundaberg. The proposal is that it will be an offence to discharge oil within an area 50 miles to the west of that mean shore line. I say in passing that already it has been indicated by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), who is the shadow spokesman on the environment, that the Opposition feels that more should be done to protect the Barrier Reef than is intended by this legislation. Towards that end an amendment to the second reading of the Bill has been proposed. Since the debate has been resumed from last night I will read from the amendment. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . while not denying the Bill a second reading the House urges the Minister and the Government, at the earliest opportune time, to extend the distance within which oil may not be discharged to 200 nautical miles east of the line drawn under Article 1 of Schedule 4 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words the Opposition believes that instead of a 50-mile protection area, 200 miles is more desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the Navigation (Protection of the Sea) Amendment Bill and the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Bill, the provisions of which I will not take the time to enunciate. I think it is important to mention that there has been and is in operation a National Plan to Combat Pollution of the Sea by Oil. This was set up in 1973. The Australian Treasury at that time provided $1m to establish a fund and provide equipment for combating oil pollution in the seas. A levy was imposed to cover the costs of the scheme. This levy is imposed on all ships over 100 registered tonnes which are holding 10 tonnes or more of oil. The fee charged is not to exceed 4c per registered tonne per quarter. The current levy is 0.8c per quarter. The National Plan comes into operation after it has been determined that more than $500 worth of damage in terms of clean-up costs has been incurred. The seriousness of the problem caused by oil spills can be assessed from the following data: For the five years 1975 to 1979 inclusive, a total of approximately 180,000 litres of oil was spilled Australia-wide. The clean-up cost was in excess of $877,000. The amount recovered in fines was only $167,380. I have before me a table containing oil spill data which was supplied by the marine pollution section of the Department of Transport. It provides further information along the lines of that to which I have referred. I seek leave to have the table incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G7">Mr LES JOHNSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) and the House. Very serious shortcomings in the National Plan have been and still are in evidence. It has particular responsibility for ensuring that pollution does not remain unattended in estuaries and ports. From what I can ascertain, the most seriously affected port in the whole of Australia is Botany Bay. Members of the Maritime Services Board of New South Wales say that a staggering 309,400 litres of oil was spilled in Botany Bay in the last decade. There are, of course, clearly visible effects from that constant, repetitive disaster. A short time ago I provided information which came to me from the Maritime Services Board. That authority informed me that more than 68,000 gallons of oil has been spilled into Botany Bay over a 10-year period. That considerable volume of oil has caused direct and indirect damage to the seabed of the bay which is unlikely to be rectified, given the regularity of the spills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1979 alone there were 14 reported spills in Botany Bay, the most significant of which was from the World Encouragement, which spilled a mammoth 110 tonnes of oil. The clean-up cost associated with that epsiode was $210,000. Under Commonwealth and State arrangements the Commonwealth Government provides all funds in excess of $500 per incident to combat an oil spillage from a ship. The funds, as I have mentioned, come from a Federal levy on ships. Existing statutory defences have been used to preclude the imposition of fines of any magnitude on the owners of ships which have caused pollution. Since 1970 a total of only $11,490 in fines has been collected. It seems increasingly unlikely that the maximum penalty of $50,000 will be imposed under the Pollution of the Sea by Oil Act 1960 while the statutory defences under section 7 of that Act remain. In my view, there is a very clear need for additional measures to be introduced to protect the natural environment of Botany Bay. At present environmental studies of the water resources of Botany Bay cost in excess of $600,000. Of course, the Maritime Services Board has to bear the expense. </PARA>
<PARA> A matter that gives me great concern is the damage to the Australian oyster industry resulting from this periodic spillage into Botany Bay. On 9 February last I received a communication from the Australian Oyster Farmers and Producers Association. The Association was very concerned about the oil spillage into the bay on 24 January 1981, Australia Day. Part of its submission stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We are amazed that considering the experience which should have been gained from the oil spill in September 1979, involving the 'World Encouragement' Oil Tanker, that this recent spill was allowed to cover half of Botany Bay and the whole of the southern bays and shores for 2 days and 2 nights with only a minimum attempt being made to control it. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been much Press coverage of these incidents. In 1979 a similar crisis occurred. The Daily Telegraph carried a story headed 'Oyster beds wrecked: ''Pay up for oil spill's damage'' '. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Botany Bay oyster farmers may seek more than $1.7 million in compensation following the massive oil spill from a tanker at Kurnell. </PARA>
<PARA>One spokesman said that 350,000 oyster sticks were affected, putting the potential loss at $1.75m. This legislation will provide an avenue for compensation for people who suffer damages, including oyster farmers. Of course, that is a very good thing. Now that we are adopting the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, a guaranteed sum will be available for the payment of damages to oyster farmers who can prove that damage was caused by an oil spill emanating from a ship; but, of course, that is much easier said than done. I took the precaution of ensuring that the oyster farmers registered their concern in respect of the Australia Day incident. If an oyster farmer claims 12 months or two years afterwards that his oyster crop has failed and that the failure could be associated with the oil spill on Australia Day 1981 it would be very difficult to gather the evidence. How could anyone tell whether an embryo oyster had been affected by a spill? Even in the present situation the oyster farmers might have a job in front of them to gain benefit from this legislation. At least it is a step in the right direction. We are ensuring that funds are available. </PARA>
<PARA> The shipping industry is to meet the cost of premiums for the insurance cover. Oyster farmers suffering damage from an oil spill emanating from an off-shore activity, however, will not be covered by the convention and will be required to seek any legal redress available from the polluter. The oil spill on Australia Day has been determined to have emanated from an on-shore activity. This convention does not apply in that instance. The national plan does not apply either. It seems that changes should be made to widen the activities of the national plan in the interests of maintaining the natural environment and ensuring that the loss caused by spills from whatever source will not fall on to the aggrieved party. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very interested in an account of these matters that has been provided to me by the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, who is responsible for the activities of the Maritime Services Board of New South Wales. In furtherance of what I have been speaking about, I asked the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson), who was previously at the table, whether he would approve of the inclusion in Hansard of a table provided by the Maritime Services Board indicating all the occasions when pollution was caused by the discharge of oil from ships into Botany Bay and also of a covering letter provided to me by the Deputy Premier of New South Wales. The Minister said that he would approve of the incorporation. I now seek leave to have the documents incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr L. Johnson, M.P.,</PARA>
<PARA>Member for Hughes,</PARA>
<PARA>2 Boyle Street,</PARA>
<PARA>Sutherland, N.S.W. 2232</PARA>
<PARA>15 February 1980 Dear Mr Johnson,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter dated 18 December 1979, wherein you seek certain information concerning oil spills and 'other related spills' which have occurred in Botany Bay since 1960. </PARA>
<PARA> To deal firstly with discharges of products other than oil, the Maritime Services Board points out that the State Pollution Control Commission has been the authority responsible for the control of such spillages from sources other than vessels since the promulgation, in 1972, of the Clean Waters Act, 1970. Prior to 1972, the Board had this responsibility in respect of discharges from both vessels and land-based sources in terms of the Navigable Waters (Anti-pollution) Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board does not have detailed information readily available in regard to spillages of products other than oil, but mentions the following as indicative of those which occurred in Botany Bay, or in waters leading into the Bay, prior to the promulgation of the Clean Waters Act:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) occasional spillages of paper pulp liquor from the premises of Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd, Botany. (On 11 June 1971, for example, the Company was fined $100 in respect of two such breaches of the Navigable Waters (Anti-pollution) Regulations); and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) discharges from Alexandra Canal into Cooks River, thence Botany Bay, of poor quality water. (For example, Robertson and Co. Pty Ltd was fined $45 for a breach of the Regulations on 24 April 1969 and Bernard Lawrence Pty Ltd was fined $50 for a breach on 26 November 1969.)</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to oil spillages, before answering the questions which you have raised, it may be of interest to you to know something of the National Plan to Combat Pollution of the Sea by Oil and of the Maritime Services Board's legislation in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board points out that under the National Plan, which has been in operation since 1973, the Commonwealth Government provides all funds (in excess of $500 per incident) to combat an oil spill from a ship. These funds come from a Federal levy on all ships of over 100 registered tons, and which have more than 10 tonnes of oil on board, and are used to provide the necessary equipment and to cover the costs and expenses incurred in cleaning up oil discharged from vessels into the waterways of the States. The National Plan also combines the resources of the Commonwealth and State Governments, and the oil industry, in co-ordinating manpower and equipment around the Australian coastline to combat oil pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> In cases where oil is discharged from a ship due to a negligent act, both the owner and the master may be guilty of an offence under the Prevention of Oil Pollution of Navigable Waters Act, 1960 and are liable to a penalty of up to $50,000. Certain statutory defences are available to the defendant under Section 7 of the Act, one of these being where a leakage could not be avoided or foreseen and where all reasonable steps were taken for prompt discovery of the leakage and after such discovery for stopping or reducing the escape of the oil or mixture (this was the case in the 'World Encouragement' spillage on 10 September last). </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the defence provisions in the Act, the Board points out that its legislation, combined with corresponding laws of the Commonwealth and other States, gives local effect to the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil. This Convention imposed on signatory nations the obligation of having controlling legislation which, amongst other things, included these statutory defences. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the legislation does provides such defences for the defendant, it does, on the other hand, make specific provision for the recovery from the defendant of all costs of removing the oil and compensatory damages for loss or damage to property as a result of the oil spillage. The Board indicates that this could involve a level of expenditure far greater than any fine which a Court would impose if a breach of the penal provisions of the Act had been committed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board is able to draw upon the National Plan fund to meet the costs it incurs in clean-up operations. Costs subsequently recovered from the person causing the pollution enable the Board to re-imburse any National Plan funds which have been drawn. Costs of re-instating private property damaged by oil pollution may be recovered by the owner of the property in civil proceedings against the polluter. </PARA>
<PARA> To turn now to the specific matters which you raise, the Board has furnished the attached schedule containing, as far as possible, the required information. The Board points out that its records prior to those for the financial year 1976-77 do not contain the costing details which you have sought, and, in respect of the years 1960-67, only the source and date of the spills are available. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be noted from the schedule that in many cases the Board decided to take no legal action even though the party responsible was known. The Board points out that its Prosecutions Committee, which includes the Board's Solicitor, gives consideration to the circumstances surrounding each incident and recommends the commencement of legal proceedings in all cases except where the spill was extremely small or where it is considered that the Court would rule that the defence provisions of the abovementioned Act apply. In all cases where the source of the spill is known, action is taken to recover the clean-up costs. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as studies into the effects of oil spills at Botany Bay are concerned, the Board has contributed $600,000 towards an environmental study of the water resources of Botany Bay. This study is being undertaken by the State Pollution Control Commission which itself, of course, has provided substantial funds. Oil pollution is amongst the matters taken into account by the study. </PARA>
<PARA> The study commenced in January 1976 with experimental and research work being conducted in earnest during the period 1977-1978. A series of some 27 technical reports have either been published or are in the process of being finalised for publication. A principal objective of the study is to recommend to the Government a comprehensive water resource management plan for the Bay and its tributaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the spillage from the 'Balder Borg' on 6 August 1978, the Board itself has carried out a limited study on benthic, or bottom-dwelling, organisms to determine hydrocarbon levels in sediment and intertidal molluscs at Kurnell. The following conclusions have been drawn from the study:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) analyses of sediment and intertidal molluscs from the AOR jetty area in the period August 1978 to February 1979 indicated the presence of low concentrations of hydrocarbon in the sediment and a reduction in hydrocarbon in the molluscs over this period. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) hydrocarbon levels in sediment in the jetty area were equivalent to those in Port Hacking, an area not influenced by oil spills. Thus it may be assumed that past oil spills may have not affected the AOR jetty sediment quality. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) reduction in hydrocarbon level of intertidal molluscs during this period supports the view that the oil spill of 6 August 1978 had a detectable effect on the marine environment, probably temporary in nature. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) it is possible that the oil spill caused a reduction in bottom-dwelling organisms, but there were insufficient data to comment on this aspect. </PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the foregoing, the Board informs me that biologists from several government authorities and universities are investigating, separately, different aspects of the impact of oil spillages. I understand that the results of these various investigations are to be used for a report to be compiled by the State Pollution Control Commission and, in this connection, as well as to provide you with information regarding spillages of materials other than oil since 1972, I have forwarded a copy of your communication to my colleague, the Hon. D. P. Landa, LL.B., M.L.C., Minister for Planning and Environment, as the Minister responsible for the Commission. Mr Landa will no doubt himself be in touch with you. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that the foregoing will be of assistance to you. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G7">Mr LES JOHNSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. I strongly support the honourable member for Shortland in his call for a higher levy to finance the national plan which is responsible for the clean-up activity. I know that the States want an increase on the 0.8c per tonne levy which is only 20 per cent of the amount which it is permitted to charge. It is apparent that there is scope to increase the levy. Increasing costs are associated with the provision of booms, skimmers and other containment and recovery equipment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is as plain as a pikestaff that if we are to deal effectively with the hundreds of spills around Australia every year we will need competent personnel with a high degree of mobility. For that reason more funds will be required. The States are involved with the major spills and receive assistance for them where the expenditure involved is in excess of $500, but enormous costs are associated with the minor spills for which there is no Commonwealth supportive arrangement. In those instances the States have to seek recovery from the polluter and often the difficulties involved hardly justify the effort. In most cases no legal action is taken. In many cases there is doubt as to who actually caused the pollution. The States are unable to establish the cause of the spill or the minor oil slick and so have to carry on without the support of either the Commonwealth Government or the polluter in redressing the situation by bringing to bear the facilities associated with the national plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is good. We do not quibble with it. We feel that much more should be done to ensure that our Great Barrier Reef is protected. I believe that this has been an appropriate opportunity to remind the Minister for Transport, who is at the table, that the States are very anxious to make certain that arrangements associated with the national plan are overhauled and brought up to date so that the States can be better equipped to deal with the threat of pollution and the deleterious effect which accrues with too much frequency around Australia's coastline. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-Some points made by various honourable members require a response. Firstly, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) sought advice on the national plan, as has the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). Secondly, the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) mentioned the need for compulsory pilotage in the Great Barrier Reef. Thirdly, reference was made to the amendment proposed by the Opposition. Fourthly, the honourable member for Petrie mentioned the great work of the oil spills inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. The national plan, of course, was developed in consultation with the States, the Northern Territory and the industry as far back as 1971 to deal with spills in areas outside the control of ports and the State marine authorities and also to provide backup to those authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a close operational liaison which has continued between the industry, the Commonwealth and the States. An attempt has been made to improve continually the capability in developing the technological area of this important requirement. Consultations are taking place in the Marine and Ports Council of Australia to extend further the co-operation, including a joint approach to a five-year program for equipment and training and also in-depth studies of the latest techniques of oil spill cleanup, oil containment and oil recovery. A levy increase which was mentioned by the honourable member for Shortland will be sought by regulation to fund the increased costs which will result from this program. </PARA>
<PARA> The national plan has demonstrated the benefits of a well-developed contingency plan for dealing with oil spills and, of course, is fully funded by a levy on the shipping industry. If any honourable members want a briefing on how the plan works, both in-shore and off-shore in the high seas, I would be very pleased to make officers available to them to explain the way in which the plan would operate. In fact, I have asked my officers to prepare models for my own information, and I must say that on paper the models look extremely good. There is a very close liaison between the Commonwealth and the State authorities. The Marine and Ports Council of Australia has devoted a considerable amount of attention to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been keeping the question of compulsory pilotage on the Great Barrier Reef under review. Of course, the embarkation of a pilot is not a guarantee of safe passage. The pilot's legal position is that of an adviser to the ship's master. International law affords freedom of navigation to vessels on the high seas and, of course, parts of the Great Barrier Reef passage are currently high seas. The only known parallel is a proposal which was made to the Inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation to introduce compulsory pilotage at the entrance to the Baltic. This was not accepted by that organisation. Instead, it accepted a recommendation that vessels employ a pilot. International reaction to the effect of this recommendation is being assessed before further consideration is given to Great Barrier Reef pilotage. It is an area that needs to be kept under constant and close review, and the Government will do just that. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to deal now with the amendment to the motion for the second reading. I am in general sympathy with the purpose and the motives of the amendment. It is aimed at extending the prohibited ocean in relation to tankers from 50 miles to 200 miles. Australia was successful in arguing for the baseline to start at the outer reef, which was a unique concession by the international community. An extension to 200 miles would be in contravention of the convention. Indeed, it would apply to Australian tankers only. Such an act could be interpreted as a move towards applying the extension unilaterally to foreign flag ships. At this time it would undoubtedly provoke a reaction from the international community. The oil discharge provisions of the Convention were designed by an independent United Nations group of experts and advisers from many United Nations agencies, including the United Nations Environment Program. I have discussed the matter with the honourable member for Shortland and have explained that whilst the Government is in sympathy with the Opposition's objective it would not be practical to try to implement it at this stage. It is a course that could be followed in future negotiations. The Government does not wish to accept the amendment because it would only delay the passage of this legislation, which is long overdue. </PARA>

In order to expedite the business of the House an attempt is made to keep down the length of second reading speeches, and in this case six Bills were involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the amendment. I wish to say a few words in support of the amendment of the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), which seeks to move the line in question 150 miles further east than is proposed in the Bill. Earlier, by way of interjection, I suggested to the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) that there was no strong disagreement between the Government and the Opposition on the matter. We do not want to hold up the legislation in any way. In the main, these are six good Bills. It is not worth even nit-picking about them because they involve the adoption of an international agreement which will improve the present position. However, we must take into consideration the fact that Australia's Great Barrier Reef is a unique formation, one in which the world is interested and which we, as a parliament, have a very strong responsibility to protect. Although I do not wish to hold up the passage of the legislation in any way, I believe the Minister and his Department, when these matters are again raised with the Inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation can at least raise the question, put forward the points of view that have been expressed by the honourable member for Cunningham and other speakers in this debate, and try to impress upon IMCO the need to extend the area to the 200 mile line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's spokesman, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), has indicated that the Opposition will not divide on this matter. That alone is an indication of our wish to co-operate with the Government on it. We accept the fact that nothing should be done to delay in any way the passage of these Bills but in doing so accept the assurances of the Minister on this matter. I am glad to see that he nods his head in agreement with what I am saying, and indicates that he concurs with the principle and intent of the amendment. I realise that changes such as this cannot be effected overnight. One does not negotiate new international agreements of this type in 24 hours. It could be several years before this matter is brought back before us again. When I say that I have in mind the speed with which international agreements are achieved. The Opposition merely asks the Government to get moving and to put into effect the principle underlying the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. It makes certain changes to the Public Works Committee Act which enable the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works to undertake a wider range of inquiries. It also extends the ambit of the Committee to include statutory authorities with a group of exceptions which are set out in the Bill. I think it is probable that at least to some extent works of the National Capital Development Commission could have been brought within the ambit of the Public Works Committee for selective inquiry. The Commission carries out very substantial works in this area, and it would not be unreasonable for the Committee to examine such works. As an example, I point to the High Court building in Canberra which could well have done with some parliamentary scrutiny before it was built.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill also extends the Committee's ambit to works overseas but not to overseas aid works. I am not sure of the wisdom of that, but given that the Committee's workload is extremely heavy, it is probable that it would not be able to carry out inquiries on aid works. I am concerned, however, that in respect of overseas constructions the legislation limits scrutiny to being carried out within Australia and does not allow any form of site inspection, even on major projects. Recently there were at least two projects which were the subject of considerable controversy and extreme expense. I point to two embassies-Tokyo and Paris. In the case of the embassy in Paris, a considerable improvement could have been effected had a proper scrutiny of the design and construction been carried out and had a site inspection been properly conducted. There is more than one government involved, therefore I am not taking to task the present Government. Because of the design of that building, which was shown to a committee in Australia, it would have looked attractive elsewhere but it looks most unattractive in its location, which is in an old world area near the Seine where it stands out like a sore thumb. The only less appropriate structure I can think of is a Japanese hotel a little further down the river. </PARA>
<PARA> On a more practical side, the building is not constructed to meet the problems which exist at the site. About two years ago the Seine flooded-as all rivers are prone to do-wiping out all the facilities and services of the building, which include a significant amount of housing for embassy staff. All of the electrical equipment, telephones and other service facilities are in the basement below the level of the river. This building cost hundreds of millions of dollars. One wonders whether a proper scrutiny of that project may have avoided what is a very serious technical fault in the design. I do not know what the cost of correcting this problem would have been, but when members of this Parliament were in France on a parliamentary delegation the Australian embassy was virtually powerless. No lifts were working, it had virtually no lights and limited telephone services. The people who lived there were without such basic facilities as light and electricity to cook with and water to use in the toilets because the electrically operated pumps were in the basement. The switchboards were out. In other words the faults in the design are considerable. The Public Works Committee of this Parliament has a very good record of picking up that type of design fault and the problems that go with inappropriate site considerations in designs. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area the Opposition is concerned about is the ability to exempt certain bodies-I am not saying whether they should be exempt-by regulation. I think it should be spelt out in the Act if organisations are to be exempt. The examples given in the notes are Trans-Australia Airlines and Qantas Airways Ltd. I wonder whether that ability extends to Australia Post and Telecom Australia. I draw attention to some activities in that area. We had a debate on industrial disputation earlier today. Such disputes are not all caused by pigheadedness or whatever. Some buildings, especially exchanges for Telecom, built over recent years are going to be, if they are not already, causes of industrial problems. They are built without any consideration of the effect that a lack of proper amenities can have, including natural light and other architectural gimmicks which can have very serious psychological long term effects, not on those people who build the building and then put the plaque on the outside to say that it is open, but on those who in fact spend half their lives inside it. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of these buildings are extremely poorly designed from the point of view of obtaining work efficiency and employee satisfaction. They have the result of reducing the effectiveness of the employee purely because of bad design in a technical sense. Examination of that issue and the expertise which is gathered from the Public Works Committee's continual scrutiny of the matter could eliminate this problem and improve the efficiency of what technically may be a good building but one which cannot work if those inside ultimately reach a stage of total dissatisfaction. I think the most recent and the best example of a badly designed building causing enormous problems both on the small and the large scale is the Redfern Mail Exchange. Quite obviously it was designed by an anarchist who wanted disruption at all costs, and he achieved it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not oppose the Bill. My colleague, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), who was a long term member of this Committee, will be passing some remarks and I expect that the Chairman of the Committee will also put his Committee's views on the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Works yielding to me in this debate. I suppose he would like to reply to this brief debate on the Public Works Committee Amendment Bill. The purpose of this Bill is to bring the works of statutory authorities, instrumentalities and other bodies, subject to specific exemptions, under the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee. Generally, that is a commendable idea. There are exemptions. Some of those can be justified and others cannot. For example, works of the Northern Territory Government are exempt, whereas work associated with the Northern Territory was the predominent work of the Public Works Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are told that the reason for the exemptions is that they are to be reviewed by the Public Accounts Committee, and that could be sufficient justification for the exemption. Tertiary education institutions in the Australian Capital Territory are exempt because they are under the scrutiny of the Tertiary Education Commission. I am not sure that that is a fair substitution for a public works inquiry, but at least that is a reason that we can understand. The National Capital Development Commission is exempt. I fail to be enthusiastic about that exemption. I will say a few words about that in a moment. The Parliament House Construction Authority is exempt, and I have nothing to say about that. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is designed to strengthen the parliamentary committee system and particularly the Public Works Committee. This Committee is one of the few methods by which public scrutiny can be brought to bear in a very significant area of government activity. I often wish the States would give their public works inquiries the same attention, show the same enthusiasm, and afford the same democratic opportunity for people and organisations to scrutinise the proposals. In fact, some States do not operate a comparable public works inquiry system at all. Our Federal Administration, through the responsible Minister, ought to try to bring about more uniform attitudes in this connection. I fail to see why a $2m Commonwealth project should be submitted for scrutiny and a $2m State project, which probably is financed by the Federal Government, is not submitted for similar scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nevertheless the suggestion of the honourable member for Lalor is helpful. I might be inspiring him to make a speech of his own. Many examples of that kind could be mentioned. The States ought to be giving these organisations, local government groups, environmental groups and others the same opportunity as is extended through this Commonwealth provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most important feature of the Bill is that works undertaken by statutory authorities are to come under the purview of the Public Works Committee. It was an absurd situation that the Government could circumvent a proper parliamentary examination of a works project by setting up a statutory authority. The honourable member for Lalor could bring many such authorities to mind. Telecom Australia for example, engages in very large scale construction; Australia Post is another example. There are dozens of such authorities. It is very good that they finally will be subjected to this process. The process simply is: Parliamentarians representing both sides of the political spectrum and both Houses of Parliament meet periodically with the benefit of witnesses, expert advice and so on and make a recommendation to Parliament as to whether works are justified. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that the forty-third general report of the Public Works Committee specifically calls for the extension of the powers of the Committee to enable it to inquire into much of the capital expenditure of the Commonwealth Government, especially that of the National Capital Development Commission, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) has a duty to explain in detail the reasons why the Government has rejected this recommendation. I can see no good reason why the National Capital Development Commission should not be included, as has been proposed by the Public Works Committee. Here we have a model developmental project taking place on a continuing basis; a planned city; the best endowed city in the whole of Australia so far as financial resources and technology are concerned. We should be looking at this body very carefully. It should be under the influence and surveillance of parliamentarians because many other forms of development emulate the pattern set in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not endorse the failure of the Government to extend the scrutiny of the Committee to make random investigations of works costing less than $2m as and when determined by the Committee. Often there is a process whereby a very large scale project is extended in stages over a period. It is quite absurd to think it is important to investigate a project costing $2m or more, while on the other hand disregarding the importance of investigating a project just slightly under $2m, particularly if it is part of a staged program of development. The reasons given by the Government for refusing to do so are spurious to say the least. The Minister, in his second reading speech, declared that this recommendation was rejected firstly, because the responsibilities of the Committee have already been considerably widened by the Bill; and, secondly, there would be severe administrative difficulties for Commonwealth departments and authorities. I reject those alibis out of hand. In short, the Government is not prepared to allow public scrutiny through the committee system of these areas of public expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to mention the staff of the Public Works Committee. If the important duties with which the Committee is to be endowed are to be effectively fulfilled the staff of the Public Works committee will have to be increased in proportion with its increased role and added responsibilities. I think I am right in asserting that at present the Committee is served by a skeleton staff comprised of a secretary, an assistant secretary and two other public servants. To me, that seems to be totally unreasonable. In 1979 evidence taken at Committee inquiries amounted to over 5,000 pages of transcript. This equalled the total evidence taken during the record year 1972 when 35 reports were tabled. This considerable work load was continued in 1980. The Committee actually reported on 12 references, three of which were left over from 1979, and over 3,400 pages of evidence were taken. This makes great inroads into the time of parliamentarians. They do this work at great sacrifice to the other responsibilities they have in their electorates. I remind the House that the United States Congressional Committee on Public Works and Transportation has a staff of 48 not four. The Congressional Committee on Environment and Public Works has a staff of fifty-nine. It is obvious that the Government is treating the Committee indifferently. The valuable work of the Committee could be tremendously embellished if it were to have technicians and people with skills and expertise to advise it as to the type of interrogation and investigation in which it should indulge. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to say a few words about the rejection of the Committee's findings. It is clear that the Committee's recommendations should not be dismissed by the Government without reason. I was once a party to, an initiator of, a rejection of a Public Works Committee reference which involved a very large scale City of Sydney office block which was to house some 15,000 people. The Committee made certain that it gave the reasons for the recommendations it made in that case. But now we find that the Government can reject the findings of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this occurred in respect of the $40m Australian Defence Force Academy. The Committee was prompted to state that in this case the Government's action 'appears to disregard the Parliament, and indeed appears to attack the basis of the parliamentary committee system'. How pious is the Government's rhetoric! It is continuing a policy of strengthening the parliamentary system although it took such action on that occasion. The Government has yet to explain why it is prepared to spend $40m on the Academy against the recommendation of the Committee. I think the Public Works Committee Act should contain a provision to ensure that where the Government is inclined to reject recommendations of the Committee full and adequate explanation is given. </PARA>

<PARA> The Committee could do many things. One project in my electorate-and many honourable members could mention similar instances-involves the Holsworthy investigatory housing project on which $6,087,420 has been expended. The project involves 48 hectares of land and 500 serviced blocks of land. The Minister for Administrative Services, who is at the table, knows all about it. The project was started many years ago. Now a great curbed and guttered estate is lying idle. I fail to see why it is not being used. Projects of this kind could clearly be referred for investigation. I think the Government should be investigated in this case to ascertain why such large scale wastage of public money is occurring at a time when people in the western region of Sydney in particular are looking for land at reasonable prices. Land prices have soared to some $30,000 for a quarter acre block. Yet, land is lying idle at Holsworthy. I would like to see the Public Works Committee turned loose on this project to find out what kind of incompetence is involved in the Minister's administration which prevents him from making land available to the land-hungry people of the western suburbs of Sydney. I am glad the powers of the Committee are to be widened. They should be widened even more. I hope that the Government will pay a lot of attention to the valuable work being undertaken by one of the most practical, down-to-earth and hard-working committees ever to be established in the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Bill before the House. I thank the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) and the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) for their contributions. I know that the honourable member for Hughes had long and distinguished service on the Public Works Committee. This legislation which has been discussed with the Committee is a result of many years of pressure to try to get the Public Works Committee Act changed. I think that action to get the Act amended commenced in 1973. It has been a long and frustrating battle to get the amendments through. Most of the amendments satisfy the Public Works Committee. However, there are some small exceptions. (Quorum formed). The amendments widen very considerably the scope of works that the Public Works Committee can examine. The legislation applies particularly to a number of statutory authorities which will not be exempted by regulation. I point out to the honourable member for Corio that those regulations, when drafted, will come up for parliamentary scrutiny and there will be an opportunity for both Houses of this Parliament to pass judgement on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I acknowledge the comments of the honourable member for Corio in relation to Commonwealth works overseas. I appreciate that the request from the Committee that there be thorough scrutiny of overseas works was in fact prompted by the fact that the Paris Embassy was such a blunder in many ways. This Bill will allow the Public Works Committee to examine such works fairly fully. I know that we are limited to some extent by an inability to make site investigations which are a normal part of our scrutiny arrangements, but I am sure that we can overcome this deficiency. (Quorum formed). Before I was interrupted by the playfulness of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), who called for a quorum, I was referring to the charter of the Committee to look at overseas works. I drew attention to the limitation imposed on the Committee to travel overseas to look at these works. I think that the arrangement proposed by the legislation will be infinitely better than the present situation under which there is no scrutiny at all. I am sure the Committee can make arrangements to ensure that scrutiny is full and thorough. I am also aware of the fact that if Committee hearings were held overseas legal problems would arise in relation to the attendance of witnesses and the like. Therefore I think the Government has made a reasonable compromise in this area. We accept the power given by the Bill, which we think is adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hughes referred to the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island. I think he may be to some extent confused about what is exempted from examination by the Committee. All the Bill does is clarify the fact that works by the Government of the Northern Territory and the Administration of Norfolk Island are exempt. This reinforces the fact that these authorities are independent of the Commonwealth and can make their own decisions on this matter. Work in these areas which is strictly that of the Commonwealth will still be under consideration by our Committee. Matters such as defence works, airports and the like will still be considered by the Public Works Committee. We will not be considering Northern Territory school works and the like. The exemption from the Committee's examination of tertiary institutions in the Australian Capital Territory, the Parliament House Construction Authority and inter-governmental bodies, I think, is reasonably correct and well justified. </PARA>
<PARA> Like some of the previous speakers I have reservations about the exemption from examination of works undertaken by the National Capital Development Commission. The works of the National Capital Development Commission which will not be scrutinised will be set out by regulations. Again, the comments I passed earlier apply to those works. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) in his second reading speech made the following point:</PARA>
<PARA> The National Capital Development Commission and the Parliament House Construction Authority are also exempted because of their specific legislation and functions. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the exemption from scrutiny of the National Capital Development Commission by the Public Works Committee during the rapid development of Canberra was probably justified. I am not sure that that situation still applies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was referring to the exemption from scrutiny of works of the National Capital Development Commission. I was pointing out that during the period of rapid development in Canberra the exclusion of such works from parliamentary scrutiny may have been justified. I think the circumstances are changing quite rapidly. A fair argument can be developed now that such works should be under parliamentary scrutiny. Let us not pretend that the National Capital Development Commission has not made mistakes in the past or is not likely to make mistakes in the future. We have only to look at a few things-to read the Auditor-General's report on the Cameron Offices, to look at the Belconnen township development or to look at all the vacant blocks of land on the outskirts of Canberra which have been developed and serviced, but which are unused and have been sitting there for many years-to appreciate some of the mistakes which have been made and which may well have been avoided by proper parliamentary scrutiny of the Commission's activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory has been attempting to look at some of these aspects in its examination of the town planning provisions. The Committee is limited in its scrutiny because all it can do is approve the town plan. I have had discussions with the Minister for Administrative Services. I can quote an assurance from his second reading speech which I think is vitally important. The Minister in that speech stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government can assure the House and the Committee that should the Committee wish to examine any specific work of the NCDC, the Government would treat any request sympathetically and would facilitate Committee investigation of any such work. </PARA>
<PARA>I feel that that is an important concession. I have also had informal discussions with the current Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman). I think he agrees substantially with that point of view given by the Minister. I point out that the Public Works Committee allows input from the public in respect of decisions on construction works. At present this is denied to the people in Canberra although I notice that there are some efforts to develop consultative practices here. For instance, I suggest that questions such as the location of a motor racing track and all those sorts of things are matters that could quite aptly be referred to the Public Works Committee if the Government could not reach a satisfactory conclusion on them. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hughes mentioned staffing of the Committee. He made a very valid point indeed. Over recent years the Committee has developed further the use of assessors. I think up to two years ago assessors had never been used. The assesors have expert knowledge in certain areas and are appointed under the provisions of section 26 of the Public Works Committee Act. This is one way in which the Committee has been able to a degree to obtain expert advice to supplement its existing staff. I think it is interesting to note also that the report of the Remuneration Tribunal recognised the heavy work load on the Chairman of the Public Works Committee and the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It recommended that additional personal staff be provided to these two chairmen. The points made by the honourable member for Hughes in relation to staff are ones that will have to be looked at very closely indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point that I wish to raise is this: In the Minister's second reading speech there is also an assurance that works will not be phased in in such a way as to preclude examination by the Public Works Committee; in other words, works will not be proceeded with to such a stage that when they are referred to the Public Works Committee its examination is pre-empted by the amount of work that has been done on those works. (Quorum formed). Work is being precluded from parliamentary scrutiny by two procedures: Firstly, by works being developed over a period and having annual budgets of less than $2m. In that way the works either avoid parliamentary scrutiny altogether or, because they are developed to a certain stage by the time the Committee comes to examine them, in effect the Committee's examination is pre-empted. I note this assurance in the Minister's speech:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government expects work totalling over $2m to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, and will do all it can to ensure that all works required to be examined by the Committee in accordance with the Public Works Committee Act will be so examined. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me say that very few examples in this area have come to the notice of the Committee in the last two years, although it was a fairly prevalent practice some years ago. Generally, I support the Bill. It widens the authority, work and references of the Public Works Committee Act. The Public Works Committee does a very worthwhile job. It is the only parliamentary committee that I am aware of that considers expenditure before the expenditure is actually committed. I am aware that the honourable member for Hughes pointed out the value of it and also the need for some States to establish similar committees. I point out that there are similar committees at least in Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia. It is pleasing to note that Papua New Guinea also has a Public Works Committee Act. I have no hesitation in supporting the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will apply to complaints in respect of members of the Australian Federal Police. Its purpose, to use the words of the Law Reform Commission in its first report on complaints against police, 'is to establish a system which permits just and thorough investigation of complaints against police, while at the same time upholding morale and discipline in the difficult work police have to do'. Establishment of such a system is clearly one of the most effective ways of maintaining and improving good relations between members of the public and a police force and the respect in which that force is generally held. </PARA>
<PARA> In large measure, the Bill implements the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its supplementary report on complaints against police furnished in April 1978 at the request of Attorney-General Ellicott. Thus, the Bill recognises the need identified by the Commission for certain elements of independence in the receipt, handling, investigation and determination of complaints against police. The first of these elements is use of the Ombudsman as 'neutral territory' for the receipt of complaints, as the investigator of last resort and as public guardian to ensure that adequate and proper steps are taken in relation to complaints. The second element is establishment by statute of a special unit of the Police Force titled the 'Internal Investigation Division' with a specialised and independent function of investigating complaints by members of the public against police. Investigation of complants against police will normally be carried out by this unit. I mention that a unit of this nature has already been established by the Commissioner by administrative action.The third element of independence will be the establishment of a police disciplinary tribunal whose president will be a judge to hear charges against police officers of breaches of the disciplinary code. However, as recommended by the Commission, criminal charges against police will continue to be dealt with in the ordinary criminal courts.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill lays down detailed procedures for the handling of complaints against police directed to ensuring that any complaint is thoroughly and effectively investigated. I now describe these procedures:</PARA>
<PARA> A complaint by a member of the public as to police conduct may be made to a police officer or to the Ombudsman; where made to a police officer, the Ombudsman must be notified. </PARA>
<PARA> Complaints as to practices and procedures of the force will ordinarily be investigated by the Ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA> Other complaints as to the police, that is to say, complaints as to conduct of individual officers, will be investigated initially by the Internal Investigation Division previously mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Ombudsman is dissatisfied with the report of the Investigation Division on a complaint, he may ask for a further investigation by the Investigation Division or he may carry out an investigation by his own office.</PARA>
<PARA> In special circumstances, the Commissioner and the Ombudsman may agree that either the Ombudsman or a person outside the Investigation Division should make the initial investigation of a complaint; if the Ombudsman and the Commissioner cannot agree on this matter, the Minister shall decide. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may, on his own initiative, establish a special inquiry into any matter relating to the Force. </PARA>
<PARA> After considering the report of the Investigation Division or the report of his own investigation, the Ombudsman may recommend that criminal or disciplinary charges should be brought against a member; if the Commissioner does not agree with the recommendation, the matter shall be referred to the Attorney-General, who shall decide what charges, if any, should be brought. </PARA>
<PARA> Criminal charges against a police officer will be brought in the ordinary courts; disciplinary charges originating from a complaint from a member of the public will be dealt with by the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal to be established under the legislation; other disciplinary charges will also be heard by the Tribunal if the member so requests or the Commissioner so determines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal will be constituted by a judge of the Federal Court or Supreme Court of a State or Territory or magistrate or legal practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Tribunal is constituted by a judge, it will determine guilt and punishment. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Tribunal is not constituted by a judge, it will determine guilt and refer the question of punishment to the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> In special circumstances the Tribunal may allow a complainant to appear and participate in proceedings before the Tribunal in such manner as the Tribunal determines. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be an appeal to the Tribunal constituted by a judge from a penalty imposed by the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General may appeal to the Tribunal from a decision of the Commissioner as to penalty on the grounds that the penalty imposed is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be an appeal to the Federal Court on a question of law, which is defined to include a question whether there is sufficient evidence to justify a finding of fact. </PARA>
<PARA> A police officer may be required by a person proposing to complain to furnish his name and place of duty. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, on the details of the scheme, there were extensive consultations within Government and with the Ombudsman and the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. The Law Reform Commission proposals were made before the establishment of the Australian Federal Police and this development in itself made necessary some variation of the Commission's proposals. As a result of the consultations, the Bill incorporates a number of variations in detail from the Commission's recommendations. These variations will, in the Government's view, improve the general effectiveness of the proposed system while in no way detracting from the objectives identified by the Commission. Dealing with the first of these variations, the Commission contemplated that the Ombudsman would retain his existing jurisdiction under the Ombudsman Act 1976 in relation to the police force in parallel with the new jurisdiction to be given to him under the proposed legislation. The Government, however, concluded that such an arrangement could produce uncertainty and confusion and it would be preferable for the relevant provisions of the Ombudsman Act to be incorporated in the new legislation so that the Ombudsman's role in relation to complaints against police will be dealt with in the one Act. However, whilst the variations should produce greater convenience and certainty, the end result will be substantially the same as that intended by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The second variation concerns the Commission's recommendation that the Ombudsman would be empowered to conduct his own investigations in certain limited cases. As I have explained above, the Bill will empower the Ombudsman in all cases to conduct his own investigation if dissatisfied with the Investigation Division's report. Further, the Ombudsman will conduct the initial investigation when the complaint is as to the practices and procedures of the force. Additionally, in special cases, when the Ombudsman and Commissioner so agree or the Minister determines, the Ombudsman may conduct the initial investigation. Thus, in total result, the Ombudsman will be given an effective and meaningful role in investigation of complaints against police. Pending the introduction of legislation, the Commissioner and the Ombudsman have, by administrative steps, put into effect arrangements similar in effect to these provisions of the Bill and I understand that these arrangements are operating effectively and satisfactorily. </PARA>
<PARA> The next variation concerns the Commission's recommendation that 'in extreme circumstances' the Ombudsman should be in a position to ensure that a charge is laid against a police officer by making a formal recommendation to such effect. On consideration of this proposal, the Government concluded that a more effective arrangement would be to provide that, following an appropriate investigation, the Ombudsman may recommend to the Commissioner what charges, if any, should be laid against a police officer and confer with the Commissioner on this matter. Failing agreement between the Ombudsman and the Commissioner, the matter will be referred to the Attorney-General who will decide what action, if any, should be taken in relation to charging the police officer. </PARA>
<PARA> A further variation concerns the Commission's recommendations that provision should be made for conciliation by the Ombudsman not only by the Commissioner. The Government considered that it would be appropriate to provide for conciliation by the Commissioner as well as the Ombudsman, subject to appropriate safeguards such as notification to the Ombudsman who may require the complaint to be investigated in spite of the Commissioner's conciliation action. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with the jurisdiction of the proposed Disciplinary Tribunal, the Commission recommended that the Tribunal should in all cases determine the penalty as well as the guilt of the defendant. Recognising the need for the Commissioner to be, and to be seen to be, the source of discipline within the force, the Government concluded, as I have explained before, that the Tribunal, when constituted by other than a judge should determine only guilt, the penalty being remitted to the Commissioner for determination. However, when the Tribunal is constituted by a judge, the Bill provides that it should determine both guilt and penalty. Further, the Attorney-General may appeal to the Disciplinary Tribunal if he is of the opinion that the punishment imposed by the Commissioner is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Commission recommended provision of a right of appeal to the Federal Court on questions of law from decisions of the Disciplinary Tribunal. The Bill makes it clear that his right of appeal extends to whether there is sufficient evidence to justify a finding of fact by the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill should be regarded as in no way a reflection on the Australian Federal Police or its members who with the fewest possible exceptions, perform their difficult tasks with honesty, zeal and devotion to duty. However, for the reasons I have explained, it is necessary that an effective and just system of investigating complaints by members of the public against police officers should be established. This Bill will establish such a system and the minor variations from the Commission's proposals that I have indicated in no way detract from the great credit due to the Commission for its evolution of the basic concept on which this Bill is constructed. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill complements the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Bill 1981 in that it implements further important recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its supplementary report on complaints against police. The first was a recommendation for removal of the long-standing anomaly in relation to the vicarious responsibility of the Commonwealth for the acts of police officers. For many years the Commonwealth has been vicariously responsible for the wrongful acts of its officers, servants or agents but, except in the circumstances covered by the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Act 1959, the Commonwealth has not been so responsible for the acts of police officers in the course of their duties. There is no sufficient reason why a police officer should, in this regard, be placed in a different position to that of any other officer of the Commonwealth. Accordingly, the Government was glad to accept the Commission's recommendation in this regard and the Bill will make the Commonwealth liable for civil wrongs committed by police officers in the performance of their duties. The result will be more satisfactory, from the point of view not only of the citizen claiming damages but also the police officer in question. </PARA>
<PARA> The Law Reform Commission pointed out that absence of identification numbers in the dress of uniformed police reduced the capacity of a complainant to make a meaningful complaint. To remedy this, the Commission recommended imposition of a requirement for members of certain ranks of the police force to wear identification numbers. The Bill implements this recommendation. The Bill thus plays an important part in the general implementation of the recommendations of the Commission and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is not opposing either of these Bills. Substantive remarks on the Bills were made by my colleague Senator Gietzelt in another place, who has responsibility for the Opposition in this area. The Opposition has one or two concerns about the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Amendment Bill which it hopes will not develop at a later stage to be of a serious nature. Nevertheless, it is important that where complaints against the police are made the mechanism by which those complaints are dealt with is fair to both the complainant and the police officers concerned. It is of absolute importance that there be no cloud of suspicion over the means by which complaints are heard, or the determination that they be heard, when the ultimate clearing of the police officers concerned occurs, which in most cases it will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the provisions in the Bill which is different from the report of the Law Reform Commission is the provision that when there is a dispute between the Ombudsman and the Commissioner as to whether charges should be laid the Attorney-General shall determine whether such charges should be laid. The Law Reform Commission indicated that in such circumstances the Ombudsman could in fact lay charges which would then be heard by the disciplinary tribunal. I personally think that is a better situation. A police officer may have charges laid against him or her which have sufficient substance for the Ombudsman to consider that they be proceeded with. They may not be proceeded with because the Commissioner, who is after all a member of the police force and, I would expect, has loyalties to his force, and the Attorney-General of the day determine that such charges will not be proceeded with. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give a hypothetical case because this could be very important to the police officer concerned. It certainly could be a matter of considerable denigration of the police force and could damage it. I use as an example a demonstration march which occurred a few years ago when Air Vice Marshall Ky came to Australia. To take the other side I could refer to the Yugoslav Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> An incident involving a police officer could occur and it could result in complaints being made against that police officer. The Commonwealth Ombudsman in his investigation might come to the conclusion that there is sufficient substance in the complaint for the complaint to succeed but the Commissioner of Police, who probably is more practically associated with police operations, might consider that the complaint is not sufficient to warrant its going before the tribunal-he might disagree with the complaint's proceeding. I do not question any Attorney-General, past or present, but I suggest that an Attorney-General who as a politician was vitally involved in certain situations might find that, even though his decision is correct, that decision is not necessarily acceptable. I name two such situations: The now Mr Justice Murphy would have been very much under suspicion from right wing Yugoslav groups concerning the Yugoslav Prime Minister, and the late Senator Greenwood would have been similarly thought of by groups opposed to the Vietnam War. </PARA>
<PARA> The final position of a police officer is that, whilst no charges have been laid, for the rest of his career, or for as long as memories exist, he has a slight against him because charges which were thought by the Ombudsman to be sufficient to prevail were not proceeded with. People who are politically involved or who, considering themselves to have been disadvantaged, were responsible for laying the charges will consider that the charges were not proceeded with because of a political rather than a judicial decision. I think it would be far better if the charges were to go straight to the tribunal. Under those circumstances it would be highly unlikely that the officer concerned would suffer or be found guilty. But if, in fact, it was found that he was guilty, justice not only would be done but also would be seen to be done. It is a problem because I believe it is essential that both police officers and the public are satisfied that the means by which complaints are dealt with enable a correct and proper determination to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> It is probably a weakness in the Act that the complainant has no place in the proceedings other than under special circumstances. It could be felt that the exclusion of the complainant removed or downgraded the status of a complaint. Too often police officers are the victim, especially with members of the legal profession. With due respect to the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), certain members of the criminal Bar make a practice of accusing police officers of malpractice. It is absolutely necessary in all these types of situations that police officers have available to them a means by which charges can be laid, and they are then either convicted or cleared, so that no suspicion remains. That is absolutely necessary for not only the officers involved but also other members of the force because there is a spin-off in all such situations. It is essential that the machinery works. </PARA>
<PARA> The other Bill in this pair of Bills requires police officers to wear identification. One of the great controversies of recent years has been that in certain circumstances identifications have been removed by officers in order to prevent complaints being made against them. I do not think that applied to officers of the Commonwealth Police Force. But I do not think that we of the Opposition should let this Bill pass through the House without my drawing the attention of the House to what a former Opposition felt about the formation of an Australian police force. Such a proposal was first put to this House in 1975 with the introduction of legislation which was not enacted because of the events of that year, events which enable me to speak in this House now. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to quote from an official document, which was distributed by the present Government parties, relating to the formation of an Australian police force by combining the then Northern Territory Police Force, Australian Capital Territory Police Force, Commonwealth Police Force and the Customs sections of the then Department ofCustoms and Excise. That proposal was put forward by the officer then in charge of the Department of Customs and Excise, Mr Camody, who was responsible for Customs matters. I shall read from a document which was distributed to the Australian people by members of the present Government, who in fact introduced the legislation into this Parliament and brought the proposal to fruition. We have an Australia police force. I do not think anyone honestly believes that we should return to a situation of multiple police forces. Certainly we should not reach a situation in which the police forces are weakened in order to protect people who offend in the Customs area or in other criminal areas for which the Australian Federal Police are responsible. One page of the document is headed: 'from Labor with love'. </PARA>

The Opposition does not oppose these Bills. Earlier I indicated some considerations which I would ask the Minister in charge of the Bill to take into account.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the two Bills before the House. I believe that both are very worthy of support because, I hope, they establish a sound mechanism for citizens to have their complaints about the Australian Federal Police investigated. It is certainly a procedure that is needed in the Australian Capital Territory. I do not know how other honourable members fare but unfortunately I receive a lot of complaints against the Australian Federal Police. They are not matters that one likes to handle, but if someone has the courage to come along and make a complaint we are under a strong obligation to carry the matter forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the early days, when we had the Australian Capital Territory Police, it was very easy to pass on complaints to the suitable senior officer or the Commissioner himself and have them investigated and resolved quickly, but with the merging of the Australian Capital Territory Police into the Australian Federal Police this became much more difficult. In the early stages difficulties of communication did exist. Fortunately, with the co-operation of the Commissioner, Sir Colin Woods, we have been able to overcome these difficulties and establish a procedure for handling such complaints. </PARA>
<PARA> If we go back in the history of the Australian Federal Police, to which my colleague the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) has referred, it is ironic to remember those days of 1975 when the then Labor Government proposed this amalgamation. There was a tremendous outcry from the Australian Capital Territory Police, led by the top echelons, the tall poppies. They cried out in great anguish that it was a terrible thing to propose, that they would not tolerate it. They encouraged the rank and file members of the service to oppose it. Very bitter feeling against the Labor government was engendered over its proposals. Later, when amalgamation was proposed again-this time by a Liberal-National Country Party Government, we saw a complete about-face occur. There were moves to quieten opposition and accept the proposals, among the top echelons of the Australian Capital Territory Police in particular. The word was that this was a great scheme and that everyone should just go along with it quietly. It is easy to see why this occurred. One has only to look at the great promotional oppotunities that were created in the Australian Federal Police at the top level. These included quite a number of assistant commissionerships. This all meant substantial promotion for people who were already in senior positions. But I can assure honourable members that the proposals were not accepted as gladly by the lower echelons of the force, particularly the Protective Services element of the old Commonwealth Police, who expressed fairly strong opposition. Many believed that the new arrangements discriminated against them. I feel that they had some justification for that belief. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the creation of the new force, two distinguished knights of the realm were called in to advise us. Sir Robert Mark drew up the original proposal. Then Sir Colin Woods was sent here to lead the new force. I do not doubt the ability of either of these gentlemen and I have the greatest respect for them at the personal level. Nevertheless, they were unfamiliar with the very intricate State-Commonwealth relationships in Australia. They had not had experience in working in this environment. They were unfamiliar with Australian industrial relations generally and I believe that many of the teething problems encountered would not have occurred if we had relied instead on some of our top Australian police officers to do the job that these knights of the realm were called in to do. I certainly do not support that aspect of the cultural cringe-the belief that we cannot do things ourselves and must bring in someone from overseas to carry out these important functions. I believe that we had many competent officers who could have carried out that role. I certainly do not say that in any personal criticism of Sir Colin Woods, who has been most co-operative in helping me carry out my duties in connection with police complaints. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill strengthens slightly the role of the Ombudsman. That is very acceptable and is in accordance with the findings of the Law Reform Commission. It is therefore to be applauded, especially since it is based on co-operation between the Ombudsman and the police rather than conflict between them. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The purpose of this statement is to provide the House with an opportunity of debating our present taxation system and, more specifically, to explain in detail the reasons why the Government decided a short while ago not to introduce a broad-based indirect tax. This statement does not announce changes to the tax system or to existing levels of taxation. I hope that it will contribute towards a more informed and objective debate on the subject of taxation. Such a debate cannot occur unless the Government plays its part in disclosing its own thinking and makes available essential information. This statement is intended, in part, to do that. No economic subject excites quite the level of interest that taxation excites. Few subjects produce such little common ground between different sections of the Australian community. In many ways our existing taxation laws represent an uneasy and not altogether logical compromise between conflicting interests and pressures in the community. It seems on occasions that the only area in which there is broad agreement is that taxation should be reduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The taxation system is an integral part of our economic structure. As such, tax changes cannot take place in a vacuum. Taxation, government spending, budget deficits and inflation are all directly connected. Coping with them is part and parcel of the task of running a modern economy. The Government's views on taxation cannot be divorced, and are not divorced, from its underlying philosophy. We are, and have always been, a government that believes that individuals should be free to make their own choices and that private enterprise should be given room to play the leading role in the development of the economy. This leads us inevitably to the view that the Government's role should be as small as is consistent with providing the basic environment within which individual freedom and private enterprise can thrive. Unless taxation changes are consistent with and achievable within the existing economic framework they will frustrate, rather than serve, the Government's economic objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The most dominant influence on the level and shape of our taxation system is of course the size of government. Those in the community who espouse the cause of bigger government are in fact arguing for still higher taxation. Unless debate in Australia on the subject of taxation fully acknowledges the direct link between levels of taxation and levels of expenditure that debate can have little meaning, Taxation cannot responsibly be reduced unless the room for those reductions is provided by reductions in goverment spending. This Government is prepared neither to finance additional expenditure, nor to reduce taxation, through the inflationary process of expanding the Budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst opinion as to the desirable shape of our taxation system will vary sharply in the community it is possible, I believe, to state some broad goals. I believe it essential that any taxation system be fair, efficient and, to the maximum extent possible, complement the general economic policies of the Government. In saying that a taxation system should be fair, that immediately implies that it should be fair in the sense that all of those on whom parliament imposes an obligation to pay tax should in fact pay that tax. This, of course, leads to the subject of tax avoidance and evasion to which I shall return later in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of fairness also implies that tax should be levied according to capacity to pay. The extent to which this principle should apply must in turn be tempered by the recognition that if marginal tax rates become too high, adverse effects on incentives occur with consequent loss of economic efficiency and productivity and greater resort to tax avoidance. The criterion of efficiency requires not only that the system should be administered in an efficient manner but also that governments should avoid changes which, although providing certain gains, involve complicated and cumbersome administrative procedures to operate, thus impairing the overall efficiency of the system. It is, of course, fundamental that the taxation system ought to complement the economic policies of the government of the day. This involves a whole host of considerations, including the effect of different forms of taxation upon inflation, incentive, investment and economic activity, and the balance between different sectors of the economy. Achieving this objective will often involve a judgment about a requirement or change which might serve one particular area of economic policy but not necessarily another. Such a judgment was very much involved in the Government's recent consideration of whether a broad-based indirect tax should be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>International Comparisons</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Whilst any international comparison has its defects, no discussion of the Australian taxation system is complete without some comparisons of the level of tax in this country with that in the rest of the world. Those comparisons show that, overall, Australians are less heavily taxed than people in most industrialised countries. The most recent figures published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are in respect of 1978 and show that total tax revenue at all levels of government as a percentage of gross domestic product averaged 35.8 per cent for the 22 countries for which data are available. For Australia the figure was 28.8 per cent. Only four countries had a lower overall tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA> The comparable figure for the United Kingdom was 34.5 per cent, the United States of America 30.2 per cent, West Germany 37.8 per cent and socialist Sweden a staggering 53.5 per cent. This fact does not show that Australian taxes should be higher. Indeed it is our objective to reduce them further. In the Government's view this fact reveals that Australia has a strong tradition of dealing with many aspects of individual security in the private sector. The Government believes that its own objectives of limiting the role of government to encourage a vigorous private sector in Australia are in harmony with the dominant values of Australians expressed in this statistic. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table showing these particular comparisons. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;However, it is important to bear in mind that although we rely rather more heavily on personal income tax than other comparable countries, our absolute levels of personal income tax are lower than the OECD average. Once again, to illustrate from Table 1 the OECD average for personal income tax was 14.5 per cent of GDP in 1978; the Australian figure was 12.6 per cent of GDP. As Table 2 shows, in 1978 Australia ranked ninth of 22 member countries in terms of reliance on all types of consumption taxes, but we were twenty-first in terms of 'general' or sales taxes, and on other taxes such as excise and customs duties and levies. This difference reflects Australia's large collections from 'specific' taxes such as the crude oil levy and traditional excise duties on beer, potable spirits, tobacco products and petroleum products. Together these yield almost three times as much revenue as sales taxes. Moreover, these specific taxes, together with sales tax on motor vehicles and parts, account for over 80 per cent of our total taxes on goods and services. Since 1978, of course, the contribution from the crude oil levy has risen sharply and in the current year is estimated to yield almost 10 per cent of Commonwealth taxation revenues. In summary, therefore, our overall tax burden is lower than the average of the industrialised world. We do, however, rely rather more on personal tax as a source of revenue, although our level of personal tax is still lower than the OECD average. To the extent that we collect revenue through indirect taxation, such collections tend to be concentrated on a very limited number of consumption items.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Trends in Taxation and Expenditure</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It has been the common experience of Western countries during the past 25 years for both expenditure and tax to rise as proportions of GDP. Australia has been no exception to this general pattern, although a number of particular observations can be made about our own experience. In the post-war period up to 1973-74, there was little change in Commonwealth tax receipts as a proportion of GDP, although the proportion of State and local tax receipts roughly doubled during that period. However, Commonwealth tax receipts rose from 21.3 per cent of GDP in 1973-74 to 23.2 per cent of GDP in 1975-76, during which time Commonwealth expenditure as a proportion of GDP rose from 24.6 to 30.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> During the five years this Government has been in office, Commonwealth tax receipts as a proportion of GDP have risen from 23.2 per cent to an estimated 24.8 per cent in the current financial year. During this period, however, in contrast to the earlier period, there has been a substantial reduction in the deficit. This is due in large measure to the expenditure restraint applied by this Government. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table providing relevant information. </PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Since its election the present Government has initiated a number of major reforms and improvements to the taxation system. The standard rate system introduced in the 1977 Budget provided a significant reform to personal income tax. The number of steps in the rate scale was reduced from seven to three. Some 225,000 people, including many pensioners, were freed altogether from the liability to pay tax. These changes removed many of the adverse effects on incentive which existed under the rate scales they replaced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time of establishing this new rate scale about 90 per cent of taxpayers were on the standard rate and the top of this step was sufficiently high to permit average wage earners to earn substantial additional amounts of income and still attract only the standard marginal rate. Whilst there has been some abatement of these advantages over the past three years, 80 per cent of taxpayers are still on the standard rate and the top of that step is still about 20 per cent above average weekly earnings. Whilst it is of course a taxpayers marginal rate that is relevant to decisions to earn additional income, this rate does not indicate the percentage of a person's income payable as tax. Because of the zero rate on taxable income up to $4,041, taxpayers on the standard rate pay significantly less than 32 per cent of their income as tax. Similarly, a taxpayer on a higher marginal rate has an average rate considerably less than his marginal rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thus, although the maximum marginal rate of 60 per cent begins at a taxable income of $34,478, the average rate for a taxpayer without dependants does not reach even 50 per cent until his taxable income reaches $85,335.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is worth noting that of the total number of married taxpayers of 3,750,000, some 1,250,000 have a dependent spouse. Various proposals have been put to the Government to allow full income splitting for all married taxpayers.

It is estimated that the cost to revenue of full income splitting would be in the order of $1,100m in a full year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To respond in part to what it saw as an imbalance in the tax system against single income families, the Government increased the dependent spouse rebate last year by 34 per cent from $597 to $800 a year. In all our analysis of changes to the taxation system, we should never lose sight of the impact of inflation upon a progressive tax scale. I can best illustrate by pointing out that in 1954-55 the maximum marginal rate began to apply at almost 18 times average earnings. By 1969-70, it began to apply at 8 times average earnings; by 1975-76 at 2.8 times average earnings; and by 1979-80 at 2.6 times average earnings. The dominant influence producing that trend has clearly been the effect of high rates of inflation on money incomes, which was particularly severe during the early 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA>Recent Review of Taxation Mix</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The House will be aware of my announcement last November that the Government had decided to examine certain options for change to the present taxation system. We particularly had in mind whether the time had come to shift a greater burden of the revenue raising effort towards general consumption taxes, thus enabling reductions in personal income tax. The purpose of that exercise was to assess the desirability of altering the mix or combination of taxes, to the extent possible, in the context of reducing the overall burden of taxation; it was not to bring about an increase in the overall taxation burden. In conducting this examination the Government already had available to it a wealth of material canvassing options for change to our system. These included in particular the very comprehensive Asprey report completed in 1975.</PARA>
<PARA> As well as receiving advice from the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office, I sought the views of a number of industry groups as well as those of the trade union movement and the Government's Taxation Advisory Committee. The Government was conscious when it commenced its examination that there were strong arguments both for and against greater reliance on indirect taxation. The arguments for a change included:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) greater community sensitivity towards personal income tax, being as it is the most visible form of taxation;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the economic advantages of a different mix of taxation, particularly if a greater reliance on indirect tax takes the form of applying to a broad range of goods and services. I cite particularly the need to avoid disincentive to saving, investment and risk taking and to obtain greater flexibility in demand and revenue management;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) indirect taxation is somewhat harder to evade and avoid than personal income tax; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) the possibility that revenue from the crude oil levy would grow less rapidly in the years immediately ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>The major arguments against a change were seen as-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the effect of any change on the consumer price index, particularly at a time when inflationary expectations are delicately balanced;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the consequences of any additional anti-inflationary measures the Government might find necessary to apply;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) the regressive effects that certain forms of indirect taxation can have, although these effects will vary in intensity according to the items included in any broadened indirect tax base. </PARA>
<PARA>There were essentially three options for change. These were extending the coverage of the existing wholesale tax to additional goods and also imposing a tax on selected services; introduction of a general retail sales tax, that is, a tax paid by consumers at the final point of sale; and a value added tax which would be imposed at all stages of the production and distribution chain for goods and services. A multi-stage VAT was rejected fairly quickly because it would have imposed an enormous paper work burden on both taxpayers and collecting authorities. A retail turnover tax had some strong arguments in its favour, particularly its lack of bias on expenditure patterns and its ability to generate substantial revenue from low rates of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It was calculated that the potential value in any one year of sales of goods and services to consumers was some $70,000m and after allowing for those items which for constitutional or practical reasons it would be very difficult to tax, it was believed that the potential base for a retail turnover tax on goods and services was in the order of $55,000m to $60,000m. However, a retail turnover tax would have involved a very extensive licensing system, and the necessity for a significant increase in the number of taxpaying units-perhaps as many as 350,000-and also additional administrative staff of about 3,500. There was the further complication that a period of two years would have elapsed before a retail turnover tax on goods and services could have been fully in place. </PARA>
<PARA> We concluded that therefore, if we were to broaden the indirect tax base, the simplest method would be to extend the existing wholesale sales tax to some goods now exempt and to impose a tax on selected services. Administratively, the former would be quite straightforward and could be implemented quickly; in the main it would involve a small number of relatively large businesses with developed accounting systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The supplementary tax on selected services posed rather more difficulties and could have taken more than 12 months to implement, depending on the number and character of the services that might be taxed. Although the practical problems posed by an expansion of the wholesale tax base and the introduction of a tax on selected services would have been considerably less than those involved in the other options before the Government there were, nonetheless, a number of difficulties involved in such a change. </PARA>
<PARA> There was of course the very basic question of whether there should be any exemption in a broadened wholesale tax base. For example, were basic foodstuffs to be exempted and, if so, which ones? Should prescribed medicines be included? Should goods subject to excise be exempt? Should inputs to further production such as building materials be exempt? In this connection, it is worth noting that if food and clothing, for example, were exempt this would more than halve the coverage of expenditure and thus the revenue base. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also the problem of the rate structure. Whilst a single rate of tax would have been very attractive from an administrative point of view, the graduation in the existing wholesale tax scales suggested that goods and services which could not properly be regarded as necessities should be taxed at a higher rate than commodities seen as essential to everyday life. The introduction of a tax on selected services would, of course, have broken new ground. That, of itself, would have involved the difficulties of educating the large number of new taxpayers and recruiting and training administrative staff. There were also some problems to be resolved on how to avoid double taxation of goods which form part of a service. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that given certain constitutional and other constraints, the base for taxation of services is somewhat more limited than might be imagined. For example, some obvious candidates like betting and gambling are already the subject of State taxes, while interstate passenger and freight movements fall outside the Commonwealth's taxation powers. In addition, it would have been undesirable to tax public services such as those provided by educational institutions and hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout its consideration of this issue, the Government remained firmly of the view that if a shift towards greater emphasis on indirect taxation were to occur, it should be accompanied by a noticeable reduction in personal income tax. The Government was aware when it commenced its examination that any increase in indirect taxation would affect the consumer price index. However, it was not until detailed projections of likely price effects as a consequence of particular levels of indirect taxation and also the cost to revenue of compensating personal tax reductions became known that the total implications of a shift towards greater reliance on indirect tax were fully appreciated by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There was-and perhaps still is-a fairly widely-held view in the community that a quite noticeable reduction in personal income tax can be achieved through a relatively modest increase in reliance on indirect taxation. That is regrettably not the case. Let me illustrate by describing the considerations which finally led to the Government's decision. In deciding whether to broaden the wholesale tax base or to retain the status quo, the Government was caught in the dilemma of not wishing to move towards greater reliance on indirect tax without providing a noticeable offset in personal tax reductions while being anxious to minimise the inflationary consequences of collecting additional revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> It soon became apparent that both of these objectives could not be achieved. It was not possible to raise sufficient additional indirect taxation to provide noticeable personal tax relief without adding to the consumer price index in a major way. For example, to reduce the existing personal income tax scale by 1c at each step would cost the revenue $610m in 1980-81. Therefore, to convert the existing 32/46/60 rate scale into, say, a 27/41/55 rate scale, a total cost to revenue of about $3,000m would be involved. As a general rule, each additional $500m raised through indirect taxes results in direct and indirect additions to the consumer price index of almost 1 per cent. Furthermore, there are additional flow-on consequences for the consumer price index through the wage system which are hard to quantify. </PARA>
<PARA> There was the disturbing possibility that the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission could not be persuaded to discount effectively for the price effects of a shift towards greater reliance on indirect taxation. It will be thus seen that in order to have raised sufficient revenue to bring about the personal tax reduction I have mentioned, the direct and indirect price effects would have been about 6 per cent, with at least the strong possibility of substantial additional flow-on consequences via the wage fixation system. </PARA>
<PARA> I should emphasise that the example of reducing personal taxation which I have just used does not in any way misrepresent the cost to revenue of various changes to the burden of personal income tax. For example, full tax indexation in the current financial year would cost the revenue about $1,000m. A $100 increase in the tax-free threshold of $4,041 would cost $200m and a $100 increase in the dependent spouse rebate would cost about $170m. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from these revenue considerations there would also have been a noticeable addition to expenditure as a consequence of the automatic indexation of pensions and benefits-in fact in the order of $75m for each 1 per cent addition to the CPI-as well as the costs of any other compensatory action which may have been thought necessary in respect of those on low incomes. In reaching its decision, the Government naturally gave thought to future revenue trends. This involved not only making certain assumptions based on likely growth in the community, but also having regard to the fact that under existing policy proceeds of the crude oil levy might begin to level out in real terms in the next couple of years. It should be said that these projections are necessarily difficult to make and reflect a large number of assumptions and judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy is now growing very strongly. Provided the right economic policies are continued, the prospects are for reasonable levels of sustained growth through the 1980s. As I am sure the House will appreciate, the impact of this on revenue collections from the existing taxation base is quite considerable. One of the by-products of greater economic activity is an increase in taxation revenues as the tax base grows. Whilst, once again, projections are difficult to make with precision, there is gathering evidence that the growth in prospect in the Australian economy over the next four or five years will prove stronger than had been anticipated even 12 months ago. As a graphic illustration of this, the indications are that private sector capital investment in 1980-81 is likely to grow by about 20 per cent in real terms. These developments endorse the view that, provided-this is an important proviso-rigorous expenditure restraint can be applied and maintained in the years immediately ahead, a responsible fiscal outcome can be achieved without a rise in the overall tax burden. It should nonetheless be noted that even in a situation where the overall tax burden did not rise at all, or even fell, personal income tax would under present policies be likely to assume a greater share of that overall burden. </PARA>
<PARA> Important though these practical difficulties and future revenue considerations were, the fundamental reason for the Government's decision was its concern at the impact on inflation and inflationary expectations of any significant shift towards greater reliance on indirect taxation. This Government has fought long and hard to restore domestic economic conditions of growth and stability and to retrieve this country's international reputation as a low inflation, economically stable nation. There is no more conspicuous hallmark of these achievements than our continued ability to contain inflation. Perceptions and expectations assume great relevance in economic matters. Rightly or wrongly, no economic indicator is more universally regarded as a barometer of a government's success or failure in economic management than the consumer price index. Therefore, and despite obvious advantages from many other points of view, the Government came firmly to the conclusion that the inevitable squandering of the gains made and maintained in the fight against inflation in recent years was a price it was not prepared to pay. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Taxes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>No statement of this kind would be complete without some reference to other forms of taxation. Unlike most other OECD countries, Australia does not impose any general capital taxes at the Federal level. Other OECD countries levy one or more of capital gains taxes, net wealth taxes or death duties. Australia does not have a capital gains tax or a net wealth tax and, as I noted earlier, the Commonwealth has ceased levying gift and estate duty and of course the States have either removed or substantially cut back their probate duties. With the exception therefore of taxes on specific forms of property, such as local government rates and State land taxes, Australians are very largely free of capital taxes. If the experience of other countries is any guide, general capital taxes are unlikely to raise substantial amounts of revenue unless imposed at very high rates. If that were to occur there would be a real risk of undesirable effects on the tax structure and the economy. It is a plain fact that if any capital gains tax were to exclude basic holdings, such as the family home, then in order to yield large amounts of revenue it would be necessary to impose it at a quite significant rate on other assets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is opposed to the introduction of a resources tax. It believes that many of the advocates of such a tax ignore the disincentive effects such a tax would have on investment and development in Australia. They also ignore the contribution which companies earning very large profits make towards Commonwealth and State revenues through the existing tax structure. This occurs through not only company tax but also royalties paid to State governments. As my colleague the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) noted in the House the other day, a recent mining industry survey showed that, of 81 mining companies questioned, government charges and taxes represented 56 per cent of the companies' pre-tax operating profits and that the companies involved paid a total of $1,113m to different governments in 1979-80. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax system is not the only mechanism through which the Government can ensure that Australians receive a fair share of the development of our natural resources. Our foreign investment policy, which has been and will be fully applied, required as a general rule Australian equity participation of at least 50 per cent Australian ownership, or 75 per cent Australian ownership in the case of uranium projects. Recently questions have been raised as to whether sufficient opportunity exists for the small investor to participate in resource development. It is undeniable that in recent years there has been a marked trend towards larger equity holdings by institutions at the expense of the individual investor. The taxation system is frequently blamed for this development and it may well be that the existing taxation treatment of inter alia dividend income has discouraged the small investor. The matter is not, however, free from doubt and such evidence as is available suggests that the trend I have mentioned has occurred in those countries which treat dividend income more generously than does Australia as well as those which have a similar approach to ours. This matter has been the subject of submissions to and investigation by the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. The Government will await with interest the views of that inquiry on this subject. I should make it plain that the Government is anxious to respond in an appropriate way to the desire of individual Australians to participate in our development. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax Avoidance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>A conspicuous feature of this Government's approach to taxation has been its uncompromising attack upon tax avoidance. The Government is determined to deal with those who seek to avoid payment of their fair share of taxation. Such people push the tax burden more heavily on to the great majority of citizens who are responsible taxpayers. They are justifiably resented. The Government's record on tax avoidance and evasion is evidence enough of its resolve to bear down on it. Since 1977, nine Bills incorporating some 24 legislative measures against income tax avoidance arrangements have been introduced. Other amendments have been enacted to deal with sales tax avoidance arrangements. More measures directed against income tax avoidance have been announced in four separate statements issued by me in the past year. All areas of avoidance have been tackled. We have acted both against schemes creating deductions and against schemes which attempt to shield income from tax. We have adopted a policy of banning the carry forward of paper losses from schemes entered into before the operative date of remedial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Decisive action has also been taken against certain forms of tax evasion. Last year, the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act was passed into law. This legislation was an entirely appropriate and necessary response to fraudulent conduct designed to prevent the collection of lawfully payable tax. It contains penalties of five years gaol and fines of up to $50,000 for those who act, or aid or abet someone to act, to prevent the collection of lawfully payable tax. Honourable members will be aware that the Government has been engaged for some time in the task of rewriting section 260 which is the general anti-avoidance provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Those who criticise the time taken do not appreciate the significant task involved in this exercise. The Government has the twin aim in this area of devising an effective anti-avoidance section whilst not getting in the way of legitimate commercial transactions and arrangements. The balance to be struck is a delicate one and considerable care is required if both these aims are to be realised. </PARA>
<PARA> The work on section 260 has involved not only officers of the Australian Taxation Office but also the obtaining of advice from private counsel. I have also sought the advice of the Government's Taxation Advisory Committee which in the 12 months of its existence has provided invaluable private sector professional comment upon taxation legislation. I have sought the advice on this matter of the Government members Taxation Sub-committee. During the three years that I have been Treasurer, it has provided invaluable comment and assistance to me on all aspects of taxation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The process of re-writing section 260 is near to an end and I hope soon to present it to Parliament. Proper time will be allowed for comment before Parliament is asked to approve the new section. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent days I have told the House that section 136, which deals in principle with transfer pricing arrangements by certain companies, is also under review, particularly as a consequence of the decision of the High Court last year in the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation Ltd case. The case appears to indicate that the power of the Commissioner of Taxation to fix an arms length price is considerably less than previously believed. I repeat previous assurances given to the House that this Government will remain tenacious in seeking out and dealing with taxation avoidance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Debate on taxation can never be wholly conclusive. It is an inherently controversial subject. Opinion as to the appropriate shape of our taxation system will vary sharply throughout the community. It has not been possible for me in this statement to canvass all aspects of our taxation system. I have, however, endeavoured to put consideration of our taxation system into a better perspective and to state some of the realities which must be accepted if sensible debate on taxation is to occur. The most dominant reality is that governments cannot tax less unless they spend less. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government remains committed to further reforms to, and where possible reductions in, levels of taxation. Progress towards these goals cannot proceed in isolation from the general conduct of economic policy. To the extent that we are successful in achieving our economic goals, so we shall be successful, I believe, in achieving our broad objectives in the area of taxation. I commend the statement to the House. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer (Mr Howard) informed us that his statement was designed to stimulate discussion about taxation and inform the people of Australia on the Government's thinking on tax. I cannot imagine that the people of Australia are feeling terribly enthralled at what they have just heard for the last three quarters of an hour from the Treasurer. In the main he has given them a rehash of past statements, coloured and flavoured a little with some interesting information on overseas comparisons, which has not been used by him before and which does not support the thrust towards which he has been trying to direct government taxation policy. This statement must be seen as an attempt by the Treasurer to keep alive the prospect of the introduction at some future date of a broad-based indirect tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the past two years the Treasurer has twice tried to get the Government to agree to the implementation of a broad-based indirect tax; that is, a tax which would apply to the general array of goods and services which are purchased by consumers in this country. Twice he has been unsuccessful in trying to get the Government to adopt his position. In this statement today we see him again spelling out the advantages, as he sees them, of such a scheme and quite clearly trying to keep alive the possibility of the introduction of such a tax at a future date. Perhaps he has hopes that in the not too distant future he will get inflation down to a level where the Government will be prepared to accept an increase in inflation which would result from such a tax. Frankly, I do not share his optimism. As I have already mentioned the Treasurer has ignored in his international comparisons a fundamental fact which totally destroys the thrust of his own belief that there ought to be a broad-based indirect tax in this country and that the tax system should be shifted significantly more towards an indirect collection basis rather than a direct tax basis. That is his position. It is not supported by the international comparisons which he spent a considerable amount of time discussing. </PARA>
<PARA> Table 2 of the tables which he incorporated in Hansard sets out the selected taxes as proportions of total tax revenues. It includes a category for consumption taxes. These are taxes on goods and services purchased by consumers. In Australia we see that 27.4 per cent of total tax revenue comes from such taxes. But the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries is only 26.9 per cent. Quite clearly we are already above the OECD average-the average of other developed industrialised countries-for collection of taxes from this form of indirect taxation. I appreciate that the composition of those indirect tax collections varies from country to country, but what matters in the end is the overall proportion which comes from indirect taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's figure is above the OECD average. It is well above that of the countries with which we like to compare ourselves, such as the United States of America. In the United States of America we see that 14.9 per cent of total tax collections come from indirect taxes. The Australian figure is 27.4 per cent. Quite obviously Australia has higher indirect tax collections than many other countries. It follows from that that no argument is to be found in the international comparison figures for Australia to be thinking of moving towards a broad-based indirect tax and to be making a strong move towards collecting a higher proportion of its taxes in the form of indirect taxation rather than in the form of direct taxation. Nothing that the Treasurer has been able to point to in respect of these international tax comparison figures supports in any way the thrust of his own belief and argument within the Government-an argument which thankfully he has not as yet been able to convince his colleagues to adopt. As I say, I fear that this statement represents an attempt by him to continue to battle for that at some future date and to keep alive that possibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The move towards a broad-based indirect tax system would have been highly undesirable. There is no way that we on this side of the House can see such a move as being advantageous for the people of Australia generally, least of all those who have borne the brunt of the Government's taxation policies over the last few years; that is, the lower middle income earners who in comparison with other groups I will come to later have paid an increasingly high proportion of their incomes in tax while this Government has been in office. </PARA>
<PARA> The first aspect that would flow from a move to indirect taxation-that is, a higher proportion of our taxes being collected through indirect tax-is that it would be inflationary. The Treasurer has clearly admitted this in his statement. Obviously that would be a highly detrimental aspect. That would be the case whenever the implementation of such a system was attempted. Even if we had zero inflation at the present time, if we introduced such a tax it would mean an enormous inflationary shock. As the Treasurer has said, the introduction of a broad-based tax to provide room for a $3,000m cut in personal income tax would mean a 6 per cent increase in inflation. A 6 per cent increase in inflation at any time would give the economy an enormous shock and be utterly deterimental to the economic welfare of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that we have an inflation rate of 9 per cent or 10 per cent at present does not mean that at some future date when the inflation rate is lower-I do not see that happening under this Government-a better environment will be created in which to introduce such a tax. It would still have an enormous shock effect on the economy and be utterly detrimental to our economic welfare. Of course, it would also make the tax system much less equitable. Equity is something that this Government has little to talk about in respect of taxation. It has made the tax system in this country far less equitable since it came to office. A move to greater indirect taxation would have meant a far less equitable tax system. The low and middle income earners would have borne the brunt of an even higher proportion of tax than they already bear. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that such a move would have made the tax system more inequitable is that indirect taxation-taxation on goods and services-is by its very nature regressive. The effect it has on people on low incomes is much greater than its effect on people on higher incomes. The tax paid is the same regardless of income. A person buying a packet of cigarettes pays the same tax on that packet of cigarettes whether he is on the minimum wage, the unemployment benefit or earning $1m a year. The impact of taxing the vast array of goods and services purchased by ordinary people is to bring the tax system to bear much more heavily on those who can least affort to pay a higher proportion of their income in tax. A tax system that moves towards higher indirect taxes is regressive. But the Treasurer wants to move towards a more regressive tax system, making it less equitable and making low and middle income earners, who have paid a much higher proportion of their incomes in tax while his Government has been in office, particularly while he has been the Treasurer, pay much more. To bring in anything like a broad-based indirect tax to raise about $3,000m a year in revenue would have a dramatic impact on the tax burden of those people on low and middle incomes. The Opposition totally rejects any such development now or in the future. It would be utterly and totally inequitable and socially divisive. </PARA>
<PARA> While this Government has been in office it has brought about a substantial disparity in the distribution of income. This disparity is much worse than it was when the Government took office. It has done this through its income and taxation policies and by cutting out various public sector programs which were of benefit to people on lower incomes. The Government, by making the disparity in the distribution of income and wealth much greater than it was when it came to office, is bringing about greater social divisiveness. A broad-based indirect tax, such as the Treasurer would like to introduce, would exacerbate that tendency towards social divisiveness which has so marked the Fraser Government and which will continue to mark it while it remains in office pursuing its present policies. If a government is concerned to achieve social cohesion and justice it must totally repudiate a tax move of this kind. I am pleased that the majority in Cabinet has repudiated it to this time but I suspect that the reason it did so had nothing to do with social justice or the need to prevent social divisiveness. Rather it had a great deal to do with the fact that Cabinet was frightened of the inflationary impact. That alone is the reason. </PARA>

That is what the Treasurer is trying to achieve. We totally reject that kind of approach from the Treasurer. He does not give a damn about achieving social cohesion and justice. To demonstrate the inequity of the system which this Government has introduced while it has been in office one need only look at what has happened to the movement in the tax burden in that time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The table shows that the proportion of total tax paid by pay-as-you-earn taxpayers has increased from 41.7 per cent to 43.5 per cent in the five years of the Fraser Government. Pay-as-you-earn taxpayers are wage and salary earners who have no chance of avoiding tax. They have their tax taken away before they even receive their incomes. They are the easy ones to tax. This Government has made hay with them and ensured that they are paying a considerably higher proportion of their incomes in tax. As I said, the proportion of total tax from pay-as-you-earn taxation has moved from 41.7 per cent to 43.5 per cent. By comparison, other personal income tax payers, those with business, property or farm incomes, paid 13.1 per cent of total tax in 1975-76 but only 10.2 per cent in 1980-81.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting I was discussing a table which had been incorporated in Hansard and which showed the proportion of total tax collections which were gathered under various types of taxes. I had noted that the proportion of the total tax paid by pay-as-you-earn taxpayers had increased from 41.7 per cent to 43.5 per cent over the period from 1975-76 to 1980-81. At the same time the proportion of total tax derived from those whose earnings come from business, property or farm income-the non-pay-as-you-earn taxpayers-had dropped from 13.1 per cent in 1975-76 to 10.2 per cent in this current financial year. There is a marked difference in the record of tax levels extracted from those two groups. I think the difference in experience over that period is made doubly important by the fact that the income growth of the non-wage and salary earners has been far in excess of the income of the wage and salary earners, but despite that the proportion of total tax revenue which the non-wage and salary earners have been paying has dropped considerably. This reflects both deliberate action by the Government and tax avoidance, which I will come to a little later. The table also shows that companies paid a reduced proportion of total taxes. The proportion in 1975-76 was 15 per cent. It dropped this financial year to 14.2 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me now turn to indirect taxes, which the Treasurer would like to increase even further. In 1975-76, 28.4 per cent of total taxes were gathered through indirect taxes. In 1980-81 the figure has reached 30.9 per cent-an increase of some 2 1/2 per cent. While the Fraser Government has been in office the income tax burden of wage and salary earners has increased considerably, yet in that time we have seen the tax burden of non-wage and salary earners and companies reduced. Indirect taxes, which bear most heavily on low and middle income earners, have become much more important as a tax gathering device, the main reason being the crude oil levy which went from 1.6 per cent of total tax revenues in 1975-76 to 9.9 per cent in the current financial year. That is an extraordinary increase. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables which demonstrate the enormous impact that the increased tax burden has had on pay-as-you-earn taxpayers as a result of decisions of this Government over the period 1975-76 to 1980-81. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The first table relates to a taxpayer without dependants and the other to a taxpayer with a dependant wife and two children. They show the various income levels and the increase in the proportion of income that is paid in tax. The tables show that a taxpayer without dependants earning under $15,000 a year is paying more of his income in tax this year than he was in 1975-76. For taxpayers with a dependent wife and two children the cut-off point is around $16,500 a year; all taxpayers below that level are paying a higher proportion of their income in tax than they were in 1975-76. The last figure takes account of the fact that there has been a change in the system of paying assistance to those with families. The tax rebate has been abolished and family allowances increased.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tables show a substantial increase in the tax burden of pay-as-you-earn taxpayers but those on low and middle income levels are suffering most. The lower the income, the greater has been the increase in the tax burden. This is a quite deplorable development. Let me now look at high income levels. These tables also show the reduction in the proportion of income tax paid by a taxpayer earning some $82,000 a year. He has received a tax cut of about $58 a week from this Government since 1975-76. Those on very high income levels have been given substantial tax cuts while those on low and middle incomes have had to pay more, as a result of the deliberate action of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect on the overall tax system of the changes which were mentioned in the previous table has been to make the whole tax system more regressive. In other words, we have reached the stage now where to talk of a progressive tax system is to talk of something which does not exist. As far as most taxpayers are concerned, we now have a regressive tax system. A substantial amount of work has been carried out on this subject by Mr Neil Warren, an economist. It was published by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research in the third edition of the Australian Economic Review in 1979. The article dealt with the 73 per cent of households which in 1975-76 were in the middle range, that is, ignoring the bottom level and the top income levels. Taking into account income taxes and the impact of company taxes on people through increasing price levels, and considering also indirect taxes, it was found that the impact on households was proportional, that there was no progressiveness in the tax system as incomes went up. It was only at the very high income level that there was anything like a progressive tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Those figures related to 1975-76. Since then the system has become much worse because we now have, as a result of the various decisions and inactivity of this Government in respect of tax avoidance, a regressive tax system. When one moves up the income range from the middle 75 per cent of taxpayers one finds that the proportion of income paid in total taxes is going down. So we have quite the opposite of the progressive tax system we like to think we have, one which has regard for the capacity to pay; instead we have a system which taxes people less the higher their incomes. We believe that is a deplorable development. It will bring about great social upheaval if it is continued long enough. If the trends of the past years are continued an ever crushing burden will be imposed on those who can least afford to have an increased income tax burden placed upon them, whilst those on the higher levels will be increasingly able to escape their tax obligations. That is the system that we have reached at the present time. The Opposition finds it deplorable to think that a government was actually contemplating making that regressive system much worse. The Government would have done so, if the Treasurer had his way, by introducing a broad-based indirect tax and by cutting personal income tax. This would have made the system more regressive and, therefore, would have greatly exacerbated the trend under the present Government over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give a little more detail as to why the system has become so regressive. Firstly, there have been the deliberate changes to the rate scales to which I have already referred. Secondly, there is no doubt that tax avoidance has become rampant under this Government. Let me say at the outset that I am not accusing the Treasurer or the Government of doing nothing about tax avoidance. In a previous debate the Treasurer accused me, after I had spoken, of accusing him of doing nothing about tax avoidance. This is not the Opposition's point at all. We realise that a great deal of legislation has been passed. In fact, over the last three years 300 pages of additional legislation has been passed to try to close off various tax avoidance schemes. Our point is not that there has not been any activity by the Government, but that that activity has been ineffective; in fact, totally ineffectual. Over this period we have had an extraordinary explosion in tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has performed like a man who runs around a factory slapping himself on the behind with a ruler all the time. He looks very busy and occupied but he is achieving absolutely nothing. The Treasurer is passing all this legislation but is not stopping the flow of tax avoidance schemes. As fast as he puts his finger in one hole in the dike, another two holes appear and more tax revenue flows through. The Opposition says that there is absolutely no doubt that that is the situation. Government members know that is the situation. It can be seen from the last annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation that the number of identified participants in tax avoidance schemes is 20 times higher-20 times higher-than in the last year of the Labor Government. If that does not prove that there has been a tremendous increase in tax avoidance while this Government has been in office, what does?</PARA>
<PARA> Two years ago the Treasurer made a statement outside this House which was a considered statement on tax and rather shorter and probably better than the one he made in this place today. In that statement he did give us some information about the amount of money involved in tax avoidance claims before the Commissioner of Taxation for the year 1977-78. He found that some $1,400m of income was at stake and some $700m of tax revenue was at stake, assuming 50c in the dollar to be the average tax rate for the income involved which is not an unreasonable assumption. In this statement today which is a much longer one he could give us no such information. I challenge the Treasurer to give us that information now. I am quite sure that if he were to give that information for the financial year 1979-80 the amount of tax revenue under challenge through tax avoidance would be much greater than the figure of $700m which he mentioned for the year 1977-78. The fact that he has not mentioned it in this statement, which he paraded as a statement which would give us all the facts on tax, indicates how frightened the Government is of this figure becoming public knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason tax avoidance has mushroomed is simply, as I have said, that the Government's case-by-case approach does not work. The Government knows that there are ways in which one can tackle tax avoidance which will work and which involve principally retrospectivity about which I will say a bit more later. Without taking that step and endorsing the principle of retrospective action on tax avoidance schemes there is no doubt whatever that the incidence of tax avoidance will continue to get worse unless section 216, when it is finally brought in, is upheld fully by the High Court. On its past record one certainly would have to be a super-optimist to expect that to happen. The Government, apart from adopting the wrong approach to closing off various tax avoidance schemes, has also deliberately allowed the various tax avoidance schemes to continue. I have witnessed one of which I have told the Treasurer many times-the internal superannuation schemes which he knows operate, which he knows are very extensive, which he knows are costing the Government an enormous amount of revenue as they have done for many years and about which nothing has been done. </PARA>
<PARA> The transfer tax decision of the High Court last year in the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation Ltd case was not the start of the realisation by this Government that transfer pricing was costing this Government a lot of tax revenue and that transfer pricing by multinationals was leading to a bleeding-off of enormous amounts of potential tax revenue. The Government knew about this before the decision was handed down. That section has been fairly useless for years and certainly this Government has done nothing about it. Tax avoidance has become much worse under this Government-far worse than it was when Labor was in office. As a result there has been a great distortion to the equity of the tax system. The system has become much more regressive. As a result of the increase in the crude oil levy there has been an enormous increase in indirect taxation in the last few years. I have already mentioned the figures in relation to that. The crude oil levy resulted from a deliberate decision of the Government in 1978 to implement in one big hit instead of gradually import parity pricing on Australian crude oil and as a consequence get a large increase in tax revenue in a most regressive and inequitable way through this form of indirect taxation on a basic commodity. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a long list of tax concessions to various lobby groups. While this Government has been in office it has made many tax concessions. In the last three years while this Treasurer has held his present portfolio, on our calculations some 38 tax concessions have been made-11 to rural industry, 10 to companies and 17 to others, in the main related to deductions on gifts and the film industry. We are all aware of the extraordinary process that is going on in the film industry at the present time as a result of the latest round of tax concessions for that industry. One of the concessions to the rural industry referred to today in the speech by the Treasurer was the allowing of primary producers to opt in or out of the income averaging provisions. These are rather extraordinary provisions which allow farmers to get the best of both worlds. In fact, I wonder whether the Treasurer has been informed of the comments of his departmental head following the National Agricultural Outlook Conference in January when, after he had given his speech he was asked in a period of question time what he thought of the income averaging provisions as they currently operate and he said: 'Well, it is a case of heads, we win; and tails, all the other taxpayers lose'. Of course, that is exactly what it is because farmers opt in and out of the scheme as it suits them and this provision is there to make sure they benefit either way. I think this is a fairly dubious kind of concession to be giving, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA> Of all those concessions that have been mentioned only one relates to the wage and salary earners-the people in real need-and that is the spouse rebate. Even that concession can be questioned as to whether it is the best way to give assistance to people in real need, though certainly there is a significant problem in relation to the difference in the tax rates applying to single income and two income families. This increase in the spouse rebate went some way to redressing that situation. Out of 38 tax concessions that is the only one that can be pointed to which applies to people in need. The tax concessions which have been given to various lobbies mainly have assisted the high income people and have made the present tax system even more regressive. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the investment allowance which is one tax concession which was brought in by this Government the Treasurer in his speech today simply assumed that this allowance increases investment. There is absolutely no study that has been brought forward by this Government at any time to give us any evidence whatever that the investment allowance brings about some substantial increase in investment. Even though it may bring in some investment, it is a cost-effective way of doing it. There is absolutely no study which shows that there has been this increase. In fact, the Crawford Committee on structural adjustment was very dubious indeed about any additions to investment flowing from the operation of the investment allowance. Yet this is the allowance which enables companies to reduce their tax burden by hundreds of millions of dollars! In this year the amount of money involved is about $320m. Yet the Government has no real idea whether this concession is anything more than a handout to the companies. It has no idea of whether this concession is bringing about increased investment. It is arguable that the enormous increase in investment which is taking place at the present time, although it is principally in the resource related area, would have occurred in any case if the investment allowance had not been operating. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a contradiction between the requirements of a good tax system as identified by the Treasurer and what he has in fact produced since he has been the Treasurer. One requirement of a good tax system which he has mentioned in his speech and on previous occasions is equity and fairness. I challenge those speakers who are to follow me in this debate to demonstrate that this Government's actions on tax have in any way been equitable or fair. In any way that one wants to investigate them quite obviously they have been highly inequitable and highly unfair in the way that I have already demonstrated. Quite obviously there is an enormous gap between the rhetoric of fairness and equity and the performance of this Government and that of course would have been made even worse if a broad-based indirect tax had been brought in. </PARA>
<PARA> Another desirable element of a good tax system identified by the Treasurer is efficiency. Again there is this enormous gap between the desire for efficiency and the achievement of it. Quite obviously the tax system has become far less efficient under the present Treasurer and the present Government. This is demonstrated by the increasing inability of this Government to collect tax from a large group of taxpayers-a growing group of taxpayers-because of tax avoidance. If there is this enormous bleeding-off of revenue through tax avoidance, which is getting worse year by year, how can anybody stand up and say that we have an efficient tax system or that the system is likely to become more efficient while these schemes continue to operate? The myriad of tax concessions to the powerful lobby groups also makes our tax system less efficient. Some of the concessions to which I have previously referred not only make the system less efficient but also they tend to exacerbate tax avoidance. They are a real breeding ground for it. One makes a taxation concession for a group with a particular intention in mind but various others will latch on to it and tax avoidance becomes rife, because a concession has been made. So the actions of the Government in respect of tax avoidance and tax concessions in regard to various favoured groups have not assisted in making the system more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer also says that the system should provide incentives to work and to earn more income. Again, I shall challenge the Treasurer to produce any evidence whatever about the effect of tax on incentive to work. As I understand it, and I challenge Government supporters to produce evidence to the contrary, there is no evidence to show what is the reaction of people to reductions in taxation. Although on the one hand it may be argued that with reduced taxation people will work harder because they pay less to the Government in tax, on the other hand it is also arguable that if people have a certain income in mind and the Government takes more of it in tax they will work a bit harder in order to get that end income after tax which they have in mind. As I understand it, various econometric studies have been done on this subject and none has come to any specific conclusion one way or the other. No one on the Government side has any evidence to produce in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is amazing how the discussion of incentives always focuses on people with high incomes. No one on the Government side gives a damn about the incentive to work of someone on a low income. What about the incentive to work of people on low and middle incomes who are paying much more of their income in tax this year than they paid in 1975? A person on average weekly earnings is today paying much more of his income in tax than he paid in 1975. What about his incentives? Why not have some regard to that? We do not talk about incentives in regard to low and middle income people. Incentives are usually used as an argument to give a tax concession to a favoured group. I repeat that there is little evidence to show anything but that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Something else that the Treasurer used to discuss, but has now ceased talking about, is simplicity as a desirable attribute of a tax system. He has thrown that one aside no doubt because he realises that the system has become anything but simple while he has been in charge of it. Indeed, it has become vastly more complex, again because of the extensive array of tax avoidance legislation, amounting to some 300 pages, which has been brought down in the last three years. Every time he brings down a tax Bill to close off a tax avoidance scheme the complications of the Income Tax Assessment Act increase. Obviously, one cannot go on year after year using this kind of approach and adding hundreds of pages to the Act and claim that one is in favour of a simpler tax system. Obviously, every time that is done the system becomes infinitely more complex and fewer and fewer people understand it. The same goes for the vast array of tax concessions, all of which add to the complexity of the tax system and deny simplicity. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Government's tax philosophy. The Treasurer said that the Government, because it believes in a smaller public sector, is a low tax party. One can only say again that there is an amazing difference between the rhetoric and the performance of the Government. The reality is that the total proportion of income that is paid in tax has increased under this Government, and that tax as a proportion of gross domestic product is higher under it than it has ever been before. The Treasurer acknowledged that during his statement. The size of the public sector also is greater now than it has ever been before. These are interesting developments under a government which claims that it is a low tax and low public sector government, as this Government has done many times, and indeed did again in the course of the Treasurer's speech today. The facts are quite the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> This rise has been despite the substantial attempts of the Government to hide its concessions by making them through the tax system rather than through government expenditure. A very annoying and worrying development which has taken place under this Government is that there has been an increase in this process of making concessions to industry and various groups through tax concessions which represent hidden assistance rather than by way of government expenditure which shows up more clearly in the Budget Papers. This is something which runs totally against open government. Of course, this Government likes that because it means that if one does it by way of a tax concession rather than by way of government expenditure one gets the size of the public sector down and the tax level also. The Government is providing increasing levels of hidden assistance. It is also assistance which, in many cases, is very difficult to control. What better example of that could we have than what is happening in the film industry? A concession brought in was supposed to cost $2m but we were told by the Treasurer a couple of days ago that it will cost $20m. That is an extraordinary explosion in cost-something which could not have happened had it been part of an expenditure program. I believe that is something which the House must take very seriously. There is no doubt that there is a deliberate attempt by this Government to channel further assistance through tax concessions rather than by way of increased expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed particularly that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) a few days ago said that he was looking closely at the restoration of tax rebates for children. To introduce tax rebates for children rather than increase family allowances, or instead of having them, would reduce government expenditure. It would also mean an increase in tax concessions. The Government would be able to say: 'The taxes are down and the public sector is down'. All one is doing really is hiding the extent of the assistance, not changing anything-except that in that particular case one is denying the concession to people who do not have taxable incomes. That would be fairly a deplorable development. This whole process of giving assistance to industry through tax concessions rather than by way of open public expenditure programs goes totally against open government. That is a practice which this House and this Parliament must examine very seriously in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not follow that because Labor believes that worthwhile public sector programs should be maintained and introduced, under a Labor government taxes on the great majority of people would be higher. Labor is prepared to tax areas of substantial capacity to pay which this Government is not prepared to tax. One example is a resources tax. It has been much discussed in recent days and I do not intend to say a great deal about it. A resources tax is a tax on the super-profits of mining companies. It does not come into play until super-profits are made. Not to apply such a tax in a period when super-profits are being made, and will be made in much greater degree in the course of the next decade or two as the resources expansion gets underway, will be to forego enormous amounts of tax revenue which should be paid to the Government for use by it on behalf of all the people, by way of either increased expenditure or reduction of the tax burden generally. The minerals that are being exploited are owned by the Australian people. To allow them to be ripped off by multinationals and other companies so that they may make super-profits on what is nominally in the ownership of the people as a whole is an outrage-one that a Labor government would almost certainly not contemplate continuing. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor would also apply a resources tax to petroleum to take over from the crude oil levy. We would apply it to Fortescue, the new oil field operation which is to enjoy tax free privileges under this Government. Not to apply a crude oil levy to Fortesque is to forego, at current oil prices over the 10-year life of that field, some $3.5 billion in tax revenue. As oil prices increase that amount will increase also. To give away such extraordinary amounts of revenue to the shareholders of Esso and BHP at the expense of the Australian taxpayer is unbelievable on the part of the Government which claims to be in favour of lower taxes for the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer said that a resources tax would have disincentive effects on investment. He has no evidence for saying that. Resource taxes operate in other countries without preventing programs for resource development from going ahead. Little Papua New Guinea, an undeveloped country to our north, is able to apply a resource rent tax to two major projects. The projects have gone ahead with beneficial results for the people of Papua New Guinea-simply because that country has such a tax system operating. Many other countries also are able to introduce such a tax. It is absurd to say that such a tax here would operate as a disincentive to development. It should come into operation only when profits reach a level which would have induced the investment in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Treasurer to argue also, as he did in his speech today, that our foreign investment guidelines which require a 50 per cent Australian equity in all new projects mean that we do not have to have such a tax is an utterly ludicrous argument. It means that he is saying: Because some Australians are going to share in the profits from these resource development programs the rest of us do not have to worry too much. We do not accept that proposition. The vast majority of Australians will not benefit in that way. It is only recently that the Government has started to implement fully its foreign investment guidelines and to insist on 50 per cent Australian equity, so many projects in operation do not have 50 per cent investment from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We have again the Government's failure vigorously to attack tax avoidance. I have explained exactly what I mean by that: I do not mean that there has been no action but that the action taken has been ineffective. The Australian Labor Party has produced a long list of anti-tax avoidance proposals which would effectively close off tax avoidance. They mainly involve retrospective application of legislation, which the Treasurer knows would be effective and would stop the absurdity of having to bring in heaps of legislation every session in order to block off particular schemes. Once that legislation is applied retrospectively all people will know that there is no point in getting into a tax avoidance scheme because sooner or later the Government will close it off and backdate that closure to when it first operated. No benefit will be gained from it. The people concerned will have to pay the tax avoidance consultant's fee as well, and they will be worse off. So retrospectivity is the ultimate answer. To rely on the hope that the High Court may support section 260 is to rely on a pretty thin reed indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case the Treasurer has been over two years bringing in section 260. He has been talking about doing so since the middle of 1979 but we still have not seen it. So it is something which is yet to arrive. During those two years there has been an enormous amount of tax lost through tax avoidance. The process of tax avoidance has become much worse. There has also been a great list of unnecessary tax concessions which have been made and which a Labor government would most certainly not allow to continue in the future. We would close off those tax concessions which we felt were useless. </PARA>

As I was saying, the investment allowance has never been shown by the Treasurer to be of any benefit at all to investment. He has never produced any evidence to show that it would have any effect on increasing investment. In the main it must be seen as a handout to business which is unnecessary and which would not be continued by a Labor government. The Government has so many of these handouts that it must place a large tax impost on wage and salary earners, thus increasing their burden so extraordinarily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, what we see is this: The Treasurer's statement today gives no hope of tax concessions to the people of Australia and to the wage and salary earners in particular who have borne enormous increases in their taxes both by way of pay-as-you-earn tax and indirect tax under this Government. The only hope that this Treasurer gives them of tax cuts in the future is if he can slash the public sector expenditure programs. He would like to hack into community beneficial programs, such as health, education and welfare. If we are going to get tax concessions paid for by cuts in areas such as these-they are essential in a decent society-I do not think that those cuts will be beneficial to the Australian people as a whole or that they will improve their living standards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member for Gellibrand says, as he did in that speech, that lower taxes do not make people work harder, he must mean that higher taxes will. That is exactly what he said. Honourable members on this side of the House heard it. What is more, we will make sure that the honourable member remembers having said that because we will use that against him time and again, just as we used a number of other things he has said in the past, such as his statement a couple of years ago about the Australian people having to get used to paying higher taxes to support an ever growing public sector. He keeps saying that and this is what the Australian people know about the Australian Labor Party-that it is a high tax party and that it still has massive hang-ups about simple, ordinary Australians making profits and investing them for their own futures. The Labor Party always sees things in static terms and it was a static speech made by the honourable member for Gellibrand. The Labor Party does not see incentives in the system as being able to achieve higher production. Unless there is tax system-I hope I have time to talk about this a little more later-that says to people 'If you get out and work, you will get some reward', the country will go backwards, as has happened in Britain and Sweden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So many things in the speech made by the honourable member for Gellibrand annoyed me. He has a shocking memory about the concessions that were made available to individuals in Australia. He has a shocking memory about the terrible burden of the deficit which we have had to battle with-a deficit which has made it very difficult to offer further tax concessions. In that context the concessions that we have been able to offer over the past five years in getting that deficit down have been almost miraculous. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not terribly pleased with the statement that the Treasurer made today, for a number of reasons. This is not in any way a criticism of the Treasurer but more a criticism of our system. It is a terrible admission that he had to make today. When talking about the problems in perhaps having a different tax mix and the problems of considering an increase in indirect tax-that is, discretionary taxes as against non-discretionary taxes-he said:</PARA>
<PARA> There was the disturbing possibility that the Arbitration Commission could not be pursuaded to discount effectively for the price effects of a shift towards greater reliance on indirect taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>To me it is very frustrating that we live in a country where we just cannot trust the arbitration system to think sensibly. Apparently we cannot trust the judges to see that a genuine move by a government-a move which is genuinely put forward to increase the incentives and scope for choice by Australian people-is not misconstrued and that they do not just reload an increase in discretionary taxes through the consumer price index on to wages. One of the frustrating things about the speech is to come again to that realisation. Without saying very much more about the mix between direct and indirect taxes it is obvious that there is scope for a different mix. It is obvious for a number of reasons that I hope I can mention later. </PARA>
<PARA> The reference again by the Treasurer, as he was bound to do, to the fact that the artificial schemes that have been springing up in recent times-they were springing up very strongly I might say in the time that the Labor government was in power as well as during our own term in power-continue to proliferate is also frustrating. People use the law in many ways very selfishly. I hope that the Treasurer will be successful in reforming section 260 and section 136. Really it is wrong in our system if the people who, in the sense of the law, are meant to be paying taxes are not. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also frustrating to read the speech and to realise again that many Australian people perhaps do not understand simply arithmetic. One of the most basic bits of arithmetic when it comes to government is that we either have to balance the books or run a deficit. If we run a deficit we are in big trouble for a number of reasons. I believe people in Australia are moving towards the view that if they want tax reductions their programs will have to be cut back. I just wish that people would understand that a little better. As one goes around one's electorate and hears calls for increases in expenditure in pretty well every area one can imagine, it is still very difficult to explain to people that if they want expenditure programs expanded they will have to pay more tax for those programs. Of course, the Labor Party's answer to that is that one just gets at people who make profits or super-profits, or somehow miraculously one gets at people who--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Dr Cass" NAMEID="457">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="457">Dr Cass</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8Q7">Mr SAINSBURY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The Labor Party would get at anybody who wanted to take a risk. It expects to squeeze the tax avoiders to the extent of raising a major proportion of taxation. Any figures on this amount that could be raised from this method that I have ever seen come out of the Treasury-which after all looks at these things face to face-appear to be something of the order of $1,000m. In terms of the Government's overall expenditure in Australia of well over $30,000m I do not see that that $1,000m will solve very many problems. It might cause a lot of frustration. My summation of the total statement is that some very sensible changes remain in the too hard basket-a too hard basket largely created by our own system. I hope that this is not the last definitive statement on taxation that we will hear in the next two or three years. I hope that the too hard basket can be got around somehow. I am certain that our present taxation system, both in size and structure, is not the best that we could have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gellibrand stated that the person in the pay-as-you-earn taxation system is paying an abnormally high amount of taxation, which is desperately bad. I agree. Increases in PAYE taxation have bounded ahead in recent years and it is the person in the middle in Australia-who will save just enough to get moving in some sort of business, who wants some incentive to use the ingenuity that is abounding in this country-who really is bearing too much of the tax burden. It is for that reason that I said that a basic change in the mix towards indirect taxation with some lessening of personal taxation, especially in the PAYE area, is absolutely essential. The honourable member for Gellibrand said that that view is not shared by the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer said that taxation is not just an isolated topic. It bears on inflation policy, resources policy, social policies, the redistribution ethic which we have in this country, and on allocation policies. All these things are mixed up somewhere in the taxation area. As the Treasurer said, something approaching one-third of our total gross national product is tied up in taxation-a massive proportion. When one considers that roughly 30 per cent of the gross national product is going in tax to the Government the amount is given some perspective. That figure approaches four times the value of our total rural production. All honourable members know that rural production alone is quite massive. </PARA>
<PARA> The mix and the vast possibilities in our taxation system give scope to effect the whole distribution of income. Distribution effects have to be taken into account by any government. Of course, some of those issues were canvassed. I said earlier that I hope this statement is not the end of the story. I am not sure why the honourable member for Gellibrand agreed with this proposal in the light of what he said in his speech, but the taxation mix really affects efficiency through a number of considerations-the distribution effect, how much tax should be taken from profits and wages and what share the Government should have. Another cross reference to distribution is the question of how much tax should be paid by people in the work force and people not in the work force. How much tax should we ask investors to pay and how much should we ask consumers to pay? As with anything in our market system, a change in one area has an effect on people in many other areas. That distribution effect of taxation really affects the overall efficiency of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to ask ourselves continuously about the incentive to produce. I refer again to the size of the tax burden. It is probably the greatest disincentive to produce, despite what the honourable member for Gellibrand said; that there is no evidence to suggest that higher taxes will make people work any less hard. If honourable members go around the bush electorates to talk to a few shearers they will find that these people are just not prepared to work quite as hard any more. Maybe people in my electorate are not the same as people in Melbourne, but I believe that they are. When a government looks at the tax system it has to look at the incentives to invest. Many of us are now beginning to understand that Australians really ought to own more of Australia's resources. Of course, the policies of the Labor Party militate against that possibility. The Labor Party does not want people to make profits and to save. Of course, if our vast resources are developed by other people for the benefit of Australia we are the people to blame. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation system has a great effect through its sheer psychology, the expectations of people. The get up and go of this country depends on an expectation of getting some reward for effort. I have said already, having heard the statement of the Treasurer and realising some of his frustrations, that our present stand on matters of taxation just is not good enough. I want to raise one other matter with which I basically disagree and which I believe needs to be corrected. The Treasurer, on page 2 of his statement, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Unless taxation changes are consistent with and achievable within the existing framework they will frustrate rather than serve the Government's economic objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that instead of using the word 'existing' we should talk about a desired economic framework. This Liberal coalition Government has a desire that Australian people grow in affluence and that disadvantaged people reap benefits in a country where incentive is a very obvious fact of life. Again, the taxation system comes very much into that. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard a resources tax as some sort of an option provided it is predictable and not in a sense a penalty for risk taking. Somehow it should involve some purchase price for what people might regard as a national windfall. If we ever consider a resources tax I hope that it will be set in a competitive market framework. I have not the time to discuss that matter but I want to repeat that overlying all that I have said is the argument that we must have less tax. The propensity to increase Government equates with the propensity to interfere more in our lives through economic control and regulation. Of course those are the goals of the socialists who always think that they know better than we do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) had some reasonable comments to make even though he made some derogatory and unjustified statements about what I consider to be a concise and realistic evaluation of the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). Something he said which was very reasonable and with which I agree was that he was not terribly pleased about the statement made today by the Treasurer. All honourable members on this side of the House share that lack of pleasure. Once the people of Australia realise what is behind that bland, window-dressing statement they likewise will agree. The Government's tax options are running out quickly. The Treasurer himself has already stated at great length that the Government said no to a resources tax, to a retail turnover tax and to a value added tax. The Treasurer indicated also that revenue returned from the oil parity pricing policy or petrol tax has peaked and will fall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No one likes tax, but no one wants the anarchy which would surely prevail if the government simply stopped spending its collected revenues on hospitals, schools, roads, airports and the multitude of community services we expect our government to provide. Our taxable resources are finite. This Government has even taxed our patience to the limit, and if these tax options are closed we must ask ourselves: 'Where will the money come from to finance hospitals, schools, et cetera?' There is no confusion on this side of the House about where the money should come from. Our nation's own resources are our people's birthright. We have no qualms about a resource rental tax levied on mostly foreign mineral development companies which are deriving extensive profits from our resource wealth. Such a tax is an inevitability. The Treasurer knows it, the Treasury knows it and, from what the honourable member for Eden-Monaro said, honourable members on the Government back bench also know it. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the alternatives? The Government could I suppose, follow the example of one of the czars of Russia and levy a peasant soul tax under which peasants became mere items on the tax roll, sold or exchanged according to the needs or whims of their masters. The adoption of such a system is not too far off, judging from some of the policies of the Government. We could take a leaf out of King George II's book and impose a window tax. Of course, these are not serious suggestions. But then, there are no serious alternatives to the options which the Government has already considered and rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> The indirect tax alternative which shimmers ominously on the horizon of the Government's options-deny it though the Treasurer may; in fact I think he protests too much-is, as the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) pointed out, entirely unacceptable in that it hits once again at the lower income earner. The Treasurer made a lot of huff and puff justifying the high incidence of tax avoidance. He tried to convince us that it was being dealt with. The Barwick High Court pulled the rug out from under the Government when it brought down its ruling last year on section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and emasculated the limited measures taken to reduce tax avoidance. That is a fact. </PARA>
<PARA> On the expenditure side of the ledger, the options are equally restricted. Areas such as social security, health, education, arts, housing and transport have been cut to the bone and further reductions cannot under any circumstances be countenanced by the public nor surely by members of the Government's back bench. Other expenditure items, principally defence, are already heavily committed. The hard options which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) so enthusiastically espoused at the outset of his period in office are becoming softer and softer. The fact is that the Government is tied to the Prime Minister's medieval Micawber monetarism. I will explain that. Government economic policy is summed up in the words of the Dickens' character, Thomas Micawber who said--</PARA>

<PARA> Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, our national Budgets are in the thousands of millions of dollars, but the quaint oversimplified notion of balanced budgets is as close to the heart of this Prime Minister as it was to that amazing nineteenth century character of fiction. That is where balanced national budgets belong-in fiction and back in the nineteenth century. The concept is fine for domestic budgets, as well I know, but it has no place in a national parliament when we are dealing with a national budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has an oversimplified notion which is easy to sell to the public. Anyone who purports to be an economist knows that a planned deficit can have inflationary, deflationary or neutral effects of the economy. An assessment of a Budget's effect can be made only after consideration is given to the proposed growth rates of expenditure and revenue, the state of the economy compared with its full capacity, the way in which the deficit arises through taxation cuts, through expenditure increases, et cetera, and the way in which the Budget deficit is financed. The balanced budget is the economic strait-jacket in which the Prime Minister has been placed by his own addiction to ideological dogma. I would not mind if he alone were a prisoner of his own narrow-minded convictions, but what bothers me is that we are all economic hostages with him. </PARA>
<PARA> We witnessed today the staying power of the Treasurer as he proceeded doggedly to justify his Government's act of juggling the tax basket to balance the Government's income revenue with its outgoing expenditure without actually doing or achieving anything. The Treasurer's speech was made up of pages of rhetoric and self-justification. One can look right through the speech for some new plan or a new way of dealing with taxation but there is nothing there. The speech was long and bland, but it amounted to nothing. The Prime Minister may have appreciated his act, but we were not amused. The Government's repeated claim that it is concerned about reducing income taxes is wearing thin. This year the Treasurer is budgeting for total tax revenue of approximately $32m-twice that taken in the Budget brought down by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) when he was Treasurer five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians have paid more tax in the last five years under the Fraser Government than the joint total of all taxes collected in the previous 12 years by the Menzies Government, the Holt Government, the Gorton Government, the McMahon Government and the Whitlam Government. That is a fact. Honourable members opposite are not very happy to hear that. As the Leader of the Opposition stated repeatedly during the election campaign last year, Australians in 12 months have paid more in just one tax-the petrol tax-than all Australians paid in total income tax only 10 years ago. The sympathy the Government professes that it has for the plight of wage earners is patently shallow when we take into account the fact that since the Government took office taxes paid by those receiving income from a business, property or profession have risen by less than half of the taxation rises suffered by wage and salary earners. There was a 31 per cent increase for the former contrasted to a 73 per cent increase for pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. In the same period the income of non-PAYE taxpayers increased almost twice as fast as that of wage and salary earners. The Government does not have the interests of wage and salary earners at heart. </PARA>
<PARA> The outstanding feature of income tax over the last five years is an abrogation of responsibility by the highest income earners in this country to pay taxes. In a country where businesses are going bankrupt at an alarming record rate, one business is booming-the tax avoidance business and it is big business indeed. The Treasurer has used words to deal with this problem. All that the honourable gentleman said when he gave us his marvellous epistle was that he realised that the problem existed, that many Bills had been passed and that much had been done. The fact is that tax avoidance still remains. Professor Russell Mathews, a leading authority in the tax field, estimates that tax avoidance costs us about $3 billion a year. It has been five years since the rot set in. Still the Government refuses to tackle it head on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may be an outdated quote, but this speech is not. What the Treasurer said is a most outdated piece of window dressing. His speech was utterly bland and it amounted to nothing. As my colleague the honourable member for Gellibrand noted, hundreds of pages of tax avoidance legislation have been processed by the Parliament. It is well past the time when the boom should be lowered on tax avoidance. Every dollar avoided is another dollar that must be squeezed out of wage and salary earners. Not only has that challenge to end avoidance not been made, but also this Government has incorporated tax avoidance as part of its policy in other areas of government concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final, lasting tribute of the recently departed Minister for Home Affairs and High Court aspirant was the so-called tax incentive scheme designed to increase investment in Australia's film industry. That has become a real lurk. No wonder everyone is trying to buy into the film industry. The Government has made it so easy to do so. People who put $100,000 into a film can claim $150,000 as a tax deduction. If they make a profit over and above their investment they have to put down only half of the profit made for taxation purposes. It is a fascinating insight into the logic and rationalisation of this Government's policy-making processes that it should use the carrot of tax avoidance as part of its arts policy. It would not be the first time that the Government has stooped to conquer. There can be no justice, no equity in our taxation system without enforcing the responsibility of our wealthier citizens and companies to contribute their share to the nation's general revenue. For those on the top end of the income scale income tax is now almost voluntary. It seems that only the ones with conscience pay. The taxation debate is not just an economic debate; it is a moral one. Taxation is more than the collection of government revenue to finance public works. Certain principles are acknowledged. But the fundamental assumption of governments around the world is that in order to finance government programs they should draw most heavily on the resources of those most able to pay-the wealthy, the big businesses, the big companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as the most significant development in taxation over the past five years has been the explosion of tax avoidance-it has increased by 12,000 per cent over five years-the most significant response of the Government has been to bear down even more heavily on wage earners, those least able to pay, to compensate for the loss in revenue. It has done that by increasing indirect taxation. The Treasurer in his statement put every possible reason why we should not go ahead with indirect taxation. But it is obvious that this is an option that he is leaving open. Over past years we have had a number of income tax surcharges introduced in Budgets, and in mini-Budgets. These surcharges have hit wage earners because it is wage earners, people on fixed incomes, who are the sitting ducks for the Commissioner of Taxation. Wage earners cannot avail themselves of the techniques of tax avoidance-tax avoidance trusts, for example, which despite some Government measures are still a means of evading tax for very high income earners with property or investment income. A person with an income of $100,000 can reduce his taxation by about $16,000 through a trust set up to split the income with his wife and two children. The Government's failure to bite the bullet on trusts last year will cost it an estimated $50m in tax revenue for the current financial year. If the Treasurer is on the level in wanting to assist the ordinary middle and lower income earner, he should follow through enthusiastically and energetically in clamping down on tax avoidance. He cannot mean what he says. Wage earners cannot avail themselves of the lurks used by companies to avoid tax-overseas tax havens, transfer pricing and contrived internal superannuation funds, for example. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no good for the Government to shed tears of regret over revenue which has slipped through the tax man's net. These avoidance schemes are well known to the Government and it need only announce unilaterally that henceforth highly contrived avoidance schemes of this nature will be unlawful, subject to the provisions of amending legislation to be brought in at a later date. That is something that the Treasurer could do. If there are reasonable members on the other side of the House, some back benchers who really want something done-it has been indicated to me that there are-they will consider this and consider the Opposition's recommended options of a resource tax and a clamping down on tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House acknowledge that retrospectivity should be applied only as a last resort and on an extremely selective basis. Retrospectivity is the Treasurer's greatest weapon. If he refuses to use it, he is impotent. Fully retrospective anti-avoidance legislation would not extend to the penal provision in the Income Tax Assessment Act. It can only operate to deny taxpayers benefits they would otherwise derive from the particular schemes in question. These are exceptional circumstances which warrant and demand exceptional measures. Retrospectivity is exceptional. The blatant advertising of avoidance that occurs in such journals as the Australian Financial Review and the National Times is an affront to all taxpaying, law-abiding wage earners. Tax avoidance is theft. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to draw the Opposition's attention to the fact that the statement made by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) was never intended to be a mini-Budget or an indication of what tax reform was in store for Australia. I wish to lay down in very real terms, stark terms, what has been happening with the tax system and, more importantly, draw to our attention the various statistics which I believe have not been available to this Parliament before. I refer to the tables at the back of the Minister's statement, particularly table I. Whilst it is all very well for people to say that we are overtaxed just because somebody runs a special article to that effect in a newspaper, the fact is, as shown by table I, that Australia is one of the least taxed member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. That does not, of course, say that the system is perfect. In fact, anybody on the Government side will be happy to make a contribution to this debate if he is given the opportunity. That is just one of the oversights of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, of the two contributions that I have heard so far the first, that by the Opposition spokesman on finance and the Treasury the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), would indicate that the Australian Labor Party is as full of financial illiterates now as it was between 1972 and 1975. Many of the criticisms that are being made now are just not based on recent events. I want to point to the area of tax avoidance. The Opposition can now tell us what we could do with section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It can now tell us what might happen if there is retrospectivity. What did the then Opposition do between 1972 and 1975? Perhaps this is not the type of debate in which we should draw the Opposition's attention to this matter, but I think it is necessary that we do. The Opposition had obvious evidence of the Curran scheme. The Treasurer of the day-I believe it was Mr Crean-mentioned that the Government was going to move against it. Not only did that Government not move against it, but it also did nothing about section 260 and tax avoidance generally. It was only in 1977-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an industry that started in the years between 1972 and 1975. I think the Opposition ought to take this into account. If there is an industry-nobody is denying it-it started in the years between 1972 and 1975. The records will show why. That was when the massive increase to salary and wage earners in this country took place. That was under a Labor Government that was supposed-but never did-to take care of the workers of the country. I suggest that the Opposition should get its act more into gear. We might hear something more constructive from the following Opposition speakers than we have heard from those who have already spoken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This statement is a springboard from which members of the Government parties-if we are the only ones to make a sensible contribution to this debate-can air their schemes. I do not want to recapitulate everything that was said. I mention the resource tax, which is one of the hardy annuals of the Labor Party. It says that companies, particularly multinationals, are bleeding the country of income. I can only give the facts and figures on one company that operates fairly extensively in Queensland. These indicate that its net profit for two years trading was one half of what the Queensland Government and the Australian Government took out of that company in the way of royalties and various taxes. In other words, if the multinational concerned had not been in operation both the State and the Commonwealth would have been denied in the vicinity of $250m a year over the last two years. Do not talk to me about resource taxes. If there is not something of a resource tax in royalty payments, rail freight, payroll tax and branch profits tax I would be very surprised. In fact, the State and Federal Government share is such that the proprietors of developing minefields at times wonder about their viability within the industry. The Labor Government had its opportunity between 1972 and 1975, but it did not take it. Yet Opposition members now come into this House and talk about what the present Government should be doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk about future policy and expound a few thoughts of my own about indirect taxation. Indirect taxation in any of its forms hides not only the amount of tax payable by the public but also many of the anomalies that are within those taxes. I mention one anomaly that has existed for the last 20 years. Sales tax on freight imposes a penalty particularly on people living in capital cities and manufacturing areas. Some people might say that it is only a small thing but if that anomaly cannot be removed from the sales tax area I suggest that the anomaly will be a lot greater under other forms of indirect taxation, particularly retail turnover tax and value added tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In that respect, if the tax were more widespread than the wholesale tax and if it were applied to most items, there would be an anomaly not only in relation to freight but also in relation to the various handling charges in the country. Also there would be an anomaly in relation to the higher profit margin which the country businessman would strive to obtain because of a limited number of consumers. An article that might cost $100 in a capital city would be more likely to cost up to $120 to $150 in the country as a result of these charges. Any percentage of tax imposed on that item would mean that people in country Australia would pay a lot more than those in the capital cities. If we look at indirect taxes in the future we must remove this anomaly completely from a retail turnover tax. I suggest to the Treasurer, who is at the table, that perhaps we should put on our collective thinking caps in order to remove that one small anomaly which exists at the moment in the Sales Tax Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that wage and salary earners have received no consideration from this Government. They have received more consideration in the way of lighter taxes than they did when the Labor Government was in office between 1972 and 1975. I will just give an indication of that. Although tax indexation has not gone as far as some of us would have liked-it has not been complete-there has been some tax indexation. Between the years 1972 to 1975 the Labor Government, given that option, did not take it up. There has been relief and it has been given mainly to those people in the form of the spouse rebate allowance. Also the change from the taxation allowance for dependent children to the family allowance, I think, has been of great benefit to those people on smaller incomes who were previously denied the advantage of a tax deduction for dependants. Wage and salary earners have received consideration but I suggest that they are the people who should be receiving more consideration, not so much from the zero ceilings or the tax indexation aspect, but in relation to the rate of tax in the dollar on the incomes that they might eventually aspire to. I speak with some authority in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> All honourable members who were in the Parliament in July and August of last year will recall the strike in relation to taxation by workers employed at the Bowen coal basin in central Queensland. The strike started out on the basis that they would not pay an extra tax on the houses which they rented. Effectively, they said: 'We do not deny that we are high income earners but we want the rest of Australia to know that we are also high taxpayers'. Such workers do not have the benefit, being residents of one industry towns, of having a working spouse, halving their incomes and receiving benefits in that way. There is a very real lesson to be learned from that tax revolt for all Australians. I understand that by the time the strike had ended the sympathy of Australians was with the miners for that one reason alone. They realised that if a bonus is to be given in the form of a tax reduction it was time we started with the middle and high income earners and not maintain our effectiveness on behalf of the lower income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> I would go so far as to say that tax indexation, when it was introduced, was hailed as a great achievement. I must say that I support it in this House. I think now it is too much of a bind for any government or any Treasurer at Budget time to be forced into a situation of giving that concession before consideration is given to the overall ramifications of where other benefits might be given. I suggest that tax indexation be dropped from our taxing policies and be replaced each Budget by an effective policy that allows the Government to structure its tax rates in order to achieve the best result-to structure them in such a way that we give a positive incentive to middle and high income earners instead of the maintaining the positive disincentive that exists at the moment. I think we should be giving a bonus to those taxpayers who are earning higher incomes. It has been said, I think by George Bernard Shaw-I am glad that the honourable for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) is not in the chamber because he would probably correct me on this--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He will probably pick me up on it. George Bernard Shaw said that any government that sets out to rob Peter to pay Paul will always be guaranteed of the support of Paul. I think that is probably an area in which our taxation policy fails. That statement must have been right because the honourable member for Lalor did not correct it. It is a very topical matter. Over the last ten years the Pauls-that is, the beneficiaries from welfare in one form or another-have increased by 122 per cent. In the same period there has been an increase of 25 per cent in the number of taxpayers. The Peters in this Australian nation are becoming fewer, but the number of Pauls is becoming greater.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very important to consider-I think it is one of the most critical points we should be looking at as a government as far as future taxation and policy is concerned-how does the nation of Australia in the 1990s maintain its funding to those people who have a priority call on our funds; that is, the old age pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> How do we maintain the momentum and the equity to them in the 1990s if the number of welfare recipients, particularly the old age pensioners, is increasing and the number of taxpayers is decreasing, optionally or otherwise?</PARA>
<PARA> The figures show that tax avoidance, as has been said in the statement, is a fairly well established industry. I maintain that it started during the years of the Labor Government. One startling statistic shows that the people who are dropping out of the income scales are those in the top income bracket. The figures-I took them out for the three years from 1976 to 1979; it is a three-year comparison-indicate to me that the number of persons who earned $32,000 or more, the high income people of Australia, actually halved in that period. Not only did their numbers halve but also they contributed one-half of the total personal tax collected. It is important that we recognise that and ask: 'What will we do in the future?'</PARA>
<PARA> The final Hancock report was tabled in this House over two years ago. It is in this direction that I want to draw the attention of honourable members. I think our income tax structure should be separated completely from the requirement to fund in the current year the old age pension. I know that the Government has decided that a national superannuation scheme may not be the right cause for Australia to follow. I believe that the introduction of a national pension scheme is. Such a scheme can be introduced in such a way that the private insurers can participate and that it can keep open some of the doors. Some doors are being closed at the moment. The doors that are being closed, I believe, are those involving our change from an asset test to an income test which prevents us in many ways from disallowing pensions to people who are entitled to receive them on an income basis but not on an assets basis. We have eliminated the gift tax from the area of tax collection, thereby allowing people at 65 years of age to transfer superannuation to somebody else by way of a gift and still be eligible to receive the pension. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are two areas, I suggest, that the Government might look at: Firstly, our future policy on a national pension scheme for old age pensioners and, secondly, the small anomaly in the Sales Tax Acts. If that matter of sales tax can be rectified my attitude to indirect tax would be considerably different from what it is at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to have the opportunity to take part in some of these late night debates in this House. Peter and Paul economics is quite a new subject matter for debate. More clearly, it should be Peter Pan economics, which is what we can expect from the plough boys. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) realises, as does little Ronnie, that government spending is one of the causes of the need for higher taxes. That is obvious. It is so basic that even he can appreciate it. It seems to me that there his intellectual ability reaches its limit. We are told that one of the main causes of the need for this additional tax, is the growth in government, in other words, big government. The record over the last 10 years indicates that the biggest growth in government has been in the Liberal States. It was 36 per cent in Western Australia, 27 per cent in Queensland, 21 per cent in New South Wales and less in South Australia. In that time the growth in the Federal Government was about 18 per cent. Clearly the Liberals are the supporters of big government. The Liberal States have had a proliferation of semi-government authorities, Western Australia being the record holder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear-Government members are quite right about this-that a government cannot cut taxes unless it cuts government spending. I think that everyone agrees with that but the question is where to make those cuts. We all agree that we have to make cuts. One of the first places to make them, obviously, is in the investment allowance. This revenue, foolishly forgone, is every bit as much a Government expenditure as social secutiry but a cut in this area would be much more equitable. This is where the Government should be cutting expenditure. I refer to the Fortescue oil field. The Government will forgo in the life of that field at least $3 billion in revenue. This is reckless Government expenditure. Money not collected is money foolishly squandered. The people of Australia are not naive. They know that if the Government does not collect money from this oil field, which would be equitable, it will collect it from them. That is fairly basic but, as I think I have observed before, very few Government members seem to understand how the system works. We also ought to look at the tremendous growth in tax avoidance. People say that it started under the Labor Government. That is true but it was only a small beginning. It has proliferated under the present Government simply because of the judgments of a corrupt High Court, formerly headed by a corrupt Chief Justice. There is nothing in the Standing Orders that forbids me saying that. It is the simple truth and Government members know it. </PARA>

They think that if the people at the top can rip off the system it is okay for them to do so. The High Court has made valid every contrived source of tax avoidance. That is the crux of the matter. Tax avoidance has reached such a stage that the only thing that can now stop it is retrospective legislation. We probably need even more than that. We need a complete change of attitude in this country. We need a government of national reconciliation-an Australian Labor Party Government. I believe that only an Australian Labor Party Government can heal the breaches in the community. The perverse philosophy that exists today was started in 1975 when a party was prepared to bowl underarm to achieve its own ends. It set guidelines for the rest of Australia. It introduced an 'I'm all right Jack' system-get what you can, how you can, when you can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the basis of the greed underlying the system we have today. In my opinion the only thing that will cure it is the election of an Australian Labor Party government. I believe that the Australian Labor Party is the only party that can achieve a national concensus. The Government is benefiting only one section of the community. The Peters that it is robbing to pay Paul are the poor people. One has only to look at the massive increases in the profits of the large companies. They have done very well. Many people involved in large companies, particularly mining companies, recognise that a resources tax is inevitable. It would be more equitable than the proliferation of greedy State taxes they have to pay now. When a mining company has to pay royalties on a mine it puts an arbitrary life on that mine. It will reach a point when it is no longer economic. People will be thrown out of work simply because of State government tax. That does not occur with a resources tax. Obviously, if the mine is not making money it will not pay a resources tax. It will keep on producing for a much longer time. It is so simple. </PARA>
<PARA> The only reason that Government members do not grasp this is that they are ideologically blind. They have been blinded by their own ideology for so long that they fail to see reason. It is possible that a few Government supporters may recognise what I am saying but they are so timorous and intimidated by their party structure that they are unable or unwilling to do anything about it. Until they are prepared to bite the bullet and see that what they are doing in this country is inequitable and divisive there will never be any real harmony in the country. We will not be able to bring to the community the justice that the taxation system should bring. We will not see the benefits that a just taxation system would bestow on the tremendous development potential of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity of supporting the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in the statement he has made on taxation. I must confess that I am appalled at the negative attitude of the Opposition. I am appalled at the arguments and the criticism it has put up while, at the same time, making no positive suggestions. The purpose of the Treasurer's statement was to put the public at rest about the wild speculation on taxation programs that it was said would be introduced. Such speculation only causes economic and general disruption throughout the country. Over the last two, three or four years people have been speculating about resources taxes, retail turnover taxes and other taxes. That is not good for the community. The Treasurer's statement has proved to the people that the Government is looking for a better and fairer tax system. In the Treasurer's lengthy speech he clearly showed the advantages and disadvantages of the options that the Government has explored and the reasons that it has not been able to adopt some of the suggestions. The statement was a comprehensive summary which outlined the complexity of our tax system. No one will deny that the system is complex and that it should continually be revised and improved. The statement indicated the options that the Government has considered and gave the reasons why none of those options could be taken up. One of the reasons is that they would have caused disruption in the community and that is one thing that we do not want.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, our tax system is complex. There is dissatisfaction with it as there will always be. As necessary as we realise it is, no one likes paying tax, no matter who he is. The statement that has been made tonight is not the end of the issue. It is the start of improving the present system, making it watertight and fair to all. A taxation system needs simplicity. It certainly should be understood by the taxpayer. It must be efficient. Of course, for it to be efficient taxes must be collected with a minimum of public expense. Most important of all-I am sure that honourable members will not disagree with me-it must be fair to all. It must ensure that the tax burden falls equally on the shoulders of all according to their ability to pay. I think all honourable members opposite will agree with that. It must be clear in its interpretation and it must be able to stand the test of the law. That is something which we have not had. The tax system we have had, because of the law, has not maintained the thrust that the Government originally intended it to have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members opposite did not change the law when they were in government. The effectiveness of the law has been destroyed by the professional promoter of tax minimisation schemes. We and the Treasurer recognise that. The Treasurer's record in endeavouring to counter tax avoidance is quite extensive. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) virtually joked that there have been 300 pages of taxation legislation dealing with tax avoidance. I do not think that is a joking matter; I think that represents a fine effort by the Treasurer, an effort which indicates clearly that we are concerned and we will not condone tax avoidance or tax minimisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another important factor that must be considered when planning our future tax system is that the system must maintain the incentive of the individual to maximise his or her earnings. If we have a system which overtaxes people, if people through that overtaxing mechanism lose the will to earn, the system will be destroyed-it will become non-workable. It frightens me that the Opposition would overtax people and destroy their initiative and incentive to work and to earn money. Finally, a tax system must produce sufficient revenue to ensure that we can carry on adequate programs to provide essential services, that is, programs associated with pensions, education and health, just to mention the main ones. </PARA>
<PARA> Over recent years one of the burdens that have been placed on our tax revenue comes through the affluence of this country. People are retiring earlier than previously. People are recipients of pensions at a much earlier age. People are being educated for longer. Once again, those things require financing. If people are being educated for longer and people are retiring earlier, the percentage of the population paying tax is diminishing. So, in recent years, a lot of the increase in demands made of taxpayers has been as a result of affluence. If we look at the thrust and intention of the present tax system we find that it has many of the qualities I have mentioned. But as I said, to a certain extent the system has been destroyed by the professional promoters of tax minimisation schemes. Contrary to what Opposition speakers have said, the breeding ground for those tax minimisation schemes was established in the years that Opposition members were in government, namely, from 1972 to 1975. </PARA>

People know how much taxation rates increased in the years 1972 to 1975. When people look at the statistics for those years they can see why so many people began looking at tax minimisation schemes and tax avoidance schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I too have some feelings for the wage and salary earner. I agree with some of the points made by Opposition speakers. I fully realise, as does the Treasurer and the Government, that over the past six years the amount of tax taken from business enterprises. The Government is well aware of that and we want to stop that trend. It is true that in the past six years total pay-as-you-earn taxation-that is, the tax taken from the wage and salary earner-increased by 100 per cent, as the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) pointed out. At the same time, I certainly am well aware, as is the Treasurer, that the amount of tax taken from business enterprises throughout Australia increased by only 40 per cent in that time. We must arrest that trend. I hope that we will be able to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer mentioned the fact that in an international sense Australia is not a high-tax country. Many Opposition members want to disprove that claim. I have a copy of a book written by Russell Mathews of the Australian National University which clearly shows that people in many countries are taxed at a far higher rate than are the Australian people. The book lists countries such as Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Belgium, France, Austria, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, New Zealand and Switzerland. People in all those countries pay a higher rate of tax than do people in Australia. That is a significant list of countries. How can honourable members opposite claim that Australia is a high-tax country when we see that people in all those countries pay a higher rate of tax?</PARA>

We are not prepared to rest on the fact that our rate of taxation is lower than that of all those countries. We want to reduce that rate. We want to lessen the tax burden for the Australian people. The Treasurer's speech illustrates his continuing efforts to lessen tax avoidance. He mentioned that he hopes shortly to have section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act rewritten and brought into this Parliament. That section deals with tax avoidance. It is hoped that when it is amended it will stand up to the test of the law. The Treasurer mentioned also that he wants to amend section 136 of that Act. Of course, that section deals with something that I know the Opposition is dearly interested in; namely, the tax payable by overseas companies based in Australia on transfers of income to the overseas parent companies. We could go on and consider all those avenues. The Treasurer is aware of them. I think that his speech tonight makes every honourable member aware of the fact that we want to continue to improve the system and to provide a fair deal for all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mention also one part of the Treasurer's speech which deals with a matter that is very dear to me. I think it is terribly important to all the Australian people. I refer to honourable members to what the Treasurer said towards the end of his speech when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Recently questions have been raised as to whether sufficient opoprtunity exists for the small investor to participate in resource development. </PARA>
<PARA>It is terribly important that the Treasurer recognise that fact. It is very important to the future of Australia that that fact be recognised and that an incentive be created for people to invest directly, to participate directly and to reap the benefits of resources development and the associated development that will come to this country. It is very important to enterprise in Australia. It is something which must go hand in hand with the development which will take place in Australia. What the Treasurer said in his speech has clearly shown what areas we have looked at and what we have in mind for the future to make this tax system fairer. It is a long way from the negative cries of the honourable member for Gellibrand and other honourable members on the Opposition side who really have put forward nothing positive. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable members to recall some of the comments of the honourable member for Gellibrand. He totally rejected the present tax system, but he neglected to say what sort of a system he would have. He talked about the present system being regressive. He used the word 'regressive' just after he talked about the three-tier scale under which those people who earn more pay a higher rate of tax. How on earth can that be regressive? He also said that the Government was concerned about the impact on inflation of any tax changes which was clearly set out in the Treasurer's statement. Should not we be concerned about the impact on inflation? We are concerned about inflation. Honourable members opposite were not concerned in the few years when they were in government. That was one of the things which destroyed the economy of the country, which destroyed the tax system and which brought about the breeding ground for the tax avoidance schemes that we have today. It has been my pleasure to support the Treasurer's statement. It clearly demonstrates to the people of Australia that all the speculation on tax schemes that has been going on over the last two years is now put to rest and I think this will give people a lot more confidence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield), I can say that no part of the statement by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is dear to me. The long awaited and if I may say so the long heralded statement by our Treasurer has finally been delivered. The statement had been scheduled for delivery on Tuesday of this week. However, the Treasurer found it difficult to fill the empty paper in front of him with an empty speech. It took him till today. He took a long time to say little. I do not envy the Treasurer's position as he is endeavouring to increase revenue without taxing the rich and the mighty. However, I trust that with his ingenuity he will be able by Budget time to play a new confidence trick and further fleece the ordinary wage and salary earner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Irrespective of what the Treasurer had to say, or rather what he really omitted to say, because I suspect more is coming in the next Budget, let me examine the position as far as taxation is concerned today. Let me examine who carries the burden when it comes to revenue collection. I hope honourable gentlemen opposite did not forget to analyse the Treasurer's Budget last year. He delivered it with a confidence of a used car salesman, not so long ago-last August as a matter of fact. One has to ask what went wrong with it because only a couple of months later, after the October election, the Government suddenly discovered that it had to look for more avenues to squeeze out a few more dollars from the ordinary wage and salary earners, in other words, from the ordinary family man of Australia; not that it did not do well in that respect in the Budget of 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with a few of the figures in that Budget. The wage and salary earners of this country had to carry the main burden. In direct taxation they accounted for 44 per cent of the revenue, in round figures. If one adds to this petrol taxes and other indirect taxes one finds that 67 per cent, in round figures, of taxation paid in this country is paid by the ordinary wage and salary earners. No wonder the Treasurer finds it very difficult to squeeze more money out of them. Contrast that with company taxes which amount to only 14 per cent in round figures-of taxation paid in this country is paid by the ordinary wage and salary earners. The 10 per cent of Australians who own more than 60 per cent of our wealth contribute only 14 per cent to our tax revenue whilst the wage and slalary earners are taxed more and more every year by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In case I am accused of distorting the figures by referring only to the 1980-81 Budget let me look at the figures over a longer period. The ratio of company tax to pay-as-you-earn collections was 43.9 per cent in 1970-71. This figure has fallen to 26.4 per cent in 1980-81. Let me deal with other sets of figures. Company tax in relation to the gross operating surplus dropped from 40 per cent in 1974-75 to 27.8 per cent in 1979-80. The proportion of Federal revenue derived by company tax has fallen from 18.6 per cent in 1969-70 to 12.5 per cent in 1979-80. Whichever way one looks at these figures it becomes obvious that only nuts and wage and salary earners pay tax in this country under this conservative Government. The companies and the rich friends of the gentlemen who sit opposite know how to avoid taxes legally or illegally. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PH4">Mr KENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Your friends are. One has to consider also that the small proportion of taxes, the 14 per cent that is meted out to companies, is paid mainly by small companies while the large multinationals escape the tax man by cooking their books. Of course when they were taken to the High Court on this matter our former Chief Justice, who was not too bad at that practice himself, found that they were quite right when they cheated. Because tax avoidance became big business under this Government, not before, the ordinary people have to pay more taxes to make up for the cheats and crooks. That practice of tax avoidance was sanctioned by a stacked High Court. The small companies, the small businesses, have to make up for the big fish who elude the fish salesman. No wonder there are so many bankruptcies of small businesses as they find it harder and harder to carry the burden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me quote from a good authority on this. In my maiden speech on 4 December last year I said:</PARA>
<PARA> There were nearly twice as many bankruptcies in business and industry under three years of Fraser Government as there were under three years of Labor Government. There were 6,952 bankruptcies between 1972 and 1975 as opposed to 11,970 bankruptcies in the last three years of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Let the business and industry sectors speak up for themselves. They are quite vocal and able to do so. I want honourable members to look at the ordinary family man and see what the taxation policies of this Government have done to him. Of course honourable members opposite, including the honourable member for Barton who preceded me in this debate but who has now left the chamber, would not know how to fill in an S form and they do not know how hard the wage and salary earners have been hit by this Treasurer. A few years ago every wage earner who was compiling his yearly tax return-believe me, I have assisted many as a voluntary welfare worker-found that he had a handsome cheque to expect as a refund. What is the position today? Most of them have to cough up an additional amount at the end of the financial year to make up for the tax evader friends of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course we have to pay for the various concessions and subsidies which are given to the rich by the Treasurer. To make it more palatable to the ordinary worker who honestly pays his taxes the Government uses euphemisms such as 'investment allowance', 'superphosphate bounty', 'export incentives' and so on to cover up for the subsidies to the rich. These are not the only injustices in our tax system. Indirect taxes are imposing a heavy burden on Australian families. The most iniquitous of all is the petrol tax. Petrol tax revenue rose from $476m in 1977-78 to $3,157m in 1980-81. Let us forget about these astronomical figures and consider the position of the ordinary motorist who, during the last year of the term of the former Labor Government, was paying 13c a litre and is now paying 39c a litre, three times as much, under the Fraser Government. He is paying that amount for petrol that costs $1 a barrel to produce today, the same as it did in 1975. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is cheaper but the point is that it is our own, we do not import it. Our prices are set not by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries but by this Government, with its taxes. But, irrespective of figures and statistics, every motorist knows that although a few years ago it cost him only $5 to fill his tank, it now costs him $20 or more. On the order of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Treasurer has turned every petrol pump in Australia into a branch of the Taxation Office. Since there is no more that the Treasurer can squeeze from the poor and since he does not want to hurt his rich friends, he is now in a dilemma. Following upon the last big tax confidence trick by the Prime Minister, the introduction of petrol taxes, his imagination and that of the Treasurer have somewhat run dry-as will our Bass Strait oil production in a few years. Like a desperate angler, the Treasurer is casting around for ideas on how to tax more and more the ordinary people, while he and the Prime Minister protect the astronomical profits of trans-national companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Only a couple of days ago the Prime Minister defended in this House the cheap electricity rates offered the Alcoa aluminium smelting company. While he was advocating subsidised electricity rates for trans-national companies he smartly forgot his election promise to bring down tax cuts. The ordinary taxpayer is remembered by this Prime Minister at election time only. In contrast, the rich fare much better. I do not begrudge a fair return being received on investment, especially if companies pay a fair share of taxes, but let us not forget that here we are dealing with large, foreign trans-national giants which do not spend their earnings in Australia for the benefit of Australians. The amount of repatriated profits is increasing year by year. In 1971-72, 26.2c of each dollar of company income was taken out of the country. In 1977-78 this figure rose to 35.6c. So much for the Prime Minister's promise that every Australian would share the prosperity created by the resources development boom. If honourable members think that I am alone in voicing that opinion, they should have listened to what Mr Stone had to say. Of course, it is said now that he was misreported. He might have been misreported but he was very well understood when he was advocating a resources tax. I should also like to quote from an article by Michael Gill in the Melbourne Age of 3 March 1981. Under the title 'Tax man in a dilemma' he says:</PARA>
<PARA> But the Government has rapidly run itself out alternatives to oil income. Meanwhile many in the community expect the promised tax cuts-soon. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few things Mr Howard can do. He can, and says he will soon, introduce a wide-ranging change to income tax law to catch tax avoiders. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer has the rehetoric but is somewhat lacking in action. While the bonanza to the mining companies continues the burden of ordinary Australians grows. The real value of the family allowance is much less today than it was when it was introduced. Likewise, the real value of pensions has decreased under this Government. The actual value of take-home pay is less than when it came to office. Again, under this Government the average Australian family is $16 to $20 a week worse off than it was five years ago. One does not have to be an economist to see the worsening financial position of the Australian family. One has only to go into the supermarket on Thursday, the pension day, to see how pensioners and low income families are forced to seek out specials, to buy inferior quality products, because they cannot afford to buy better foodstuffs. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Treasurer has been defeated on his proposal to introduce indirect taxes, I suspect that he is still flirting with the idea. In that connection, the following passage from his speech is worth noting:</PARA>
<PARA> There was, and perhaps still is, a fairly widely held view in the community that a quite noticeable reduction in personal income tax can be achieved through a relatively modest increase in reliance on indirect taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us not kid ourselves; he has not given up the idea. He is a very persistent man. He will keep picking the pocket of the ordinary family man unless we become stronger and stronger and defeat him at the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this statement by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) because the whole question of taxation reform has long been the subject of considerable public debate. It is high time that debate was brought into this chamber. However, it is a pity that we are required to debate a 26-page comprehensive statement upon a complex issue straight after it has been made. I regard that as a regrettable way in which to run the House. It really does not give honourable members time to express a considered opinion on the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the decision that has been taken by the Government not to broaden the tax base by moving away from our very high level of dependence on direct taxes is a reasonable one given the circumstances outlined in the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Howard). But if this is to be the case it becomes even more important for the Government to act much more effectively against the present abuse of our income tax system. Whilst I congratulate the Treasurer and the Government upon the way in which they have actively sought to close down those artificial tax avoidance schemes which have come to their notice, there is no doubt that there has been a massive shift in the distribution of the personal income tax burden as between wage and salary earners and other taxpayers-a shift from the rich to the poor as a result of massive tax avoidance schemes. Again, the burden has shifted as upper income groups have successfully participated in such schemes, and as tax evasion has been practised by those who have the opportunity to participate actively in the cash economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Russell Mathews, who was quoted earlier, summed this up best when he said in January 1980 that tax avoidance had flourished on such a scale as to make personal income tax a voluntary tax for the rich non-salary earner. In referring to the emphasis which had been given to vertical equity in the design of the Australian income tax system, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the essential problem is not to make the rich pay higher rates of tax, or even more tax, than the poor-it is to make the rich pay any income tax at all. There has recently been some discussion about the potential for a tax revolt in Australia. It must be recognised that a massive tax revolt has already taken place, but it is a revolt of business taxpayers against wage and salary earners of the rich against the poor. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus, despite the Government's record of introducing some 24 legislative measures against income avoidance arrangements-a record which is much better than that of the Labor Government-the fact remains that these people stay well ahead of the Taxation Office investigators. Therefore, I am very pleased that the Treasurer has indicated that the rewriting of section 260, which is the general anti-avoidance provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act, is now almost complete and will soon be presented to the Parliament. The people whom I represent, the lower and middle income earning family units, are paying for this massive rip-off. </PARA>
<PARA> Only if the Government can succeed in implementing this catch-all provision will the intended equality of the income tax system, on which we are more dependent than is almost any other member country of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, become a reality. But I do not agree that a greater reliance on indirect taxes should be advocated if the prime objective is to catch the tax avoiders. This would only make the taxation system much more regressive than it is already. I would still maintain that position even if exemptions were introduced in order to make the indirect taxation system slightly more progressive in its impact. </PARA>
<PARA> I maintain that the tax avoiders who suggest that a switch in the tax base would reduce their incentives to avoid tax would still be seeking to ignore their responsibilities even if the tax rates were significantly reduced. Of course, the fact remains that if everyone paid his way now, under a government committed to expenditure restraint, everyone would be able to receive a substantial tax cut anyway, without adversely affecting the Budget deficit. My only objection to the present direct taxation system is that the taxes are too high and they do not, therefore, meet the essential criterion mentioned by the Treasurer of being consistent with the Government's overall economic objectives, particularly of providing the private sector with the incentives which are needed to encourage investment growth and generally improved employment opportunities. Although economic recovery is well under way in this country I sometimes wonder how much stronger the economy and the labour market would now be if we had pursued these often stated government objectives more vigorously and consistently. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the Treasurer when he says that the inflationary impact of a large-scale change from direct to indirect taxes could not be tolerated, even though this makes it harder to cope with the cash economy tax evasion. Using his own figures, to convert the existing 32-46-60 rate scale into a 27-41-55 rate scale, would involve a total cost to revenue of some $3,000m. If this revenue loss were recovered through indirect taxes, inflation would increase by 5 per cent to 6 per cent on the Treasurer's reckoning. Although some have argued that this would be a once-off increase, the fact remains that in the absence of any guarantee of discounting by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, this increase could become institutionalised, causing a continuous round of cost-price increases. Having said that, I think I should also state that any taxation increase, whether it is direct or indirect, will eventually harm our cost structure and reduce our international competitiveness. Once again in this statement the Treasurer has mentioned that the choice confronting him is to axe or tax. In the conclusion of his speech, he states:</PARA>
<PARA> The most dominant reality is that Governments cannot tax less unless they spend less. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite true; I thoroughly agree with it. But I do think that the Government's credibility in this area has been strained over the past six months, although I was encouraged by the Government's recent actions regarding the Olympic Games in 1988 and Expo '88. I certainly acknowledge that in the fiscal area the budgetary problems are very substantial. With oil revenue sources slowing down, with many alternative tax source options now being excluded, with tax indexation, with necessary but massive defence expenditure increases, and with many very essential humanitarian welfare programs being indexed, the Government is certainly facing very difficult budgetary problems, particularly given the demographic status of the population. Therefore, there certainly remains a very great need for the Government to control expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that in its present review of expenditure the so-called razor gang will come to grips with the kinds of stupid expenditure commitments the Government made last year regarding a motor racing circuit in Canberra, a rowing and canoeing course in Tasmania, a shooting complex in Queensland, a ballistics complex in Western Australia, an equestrian centre in Victoria and so forth. There are many other examples I could mention. Although these facilities may all be worth while and much needed by specific interest groups, I do not regard them as top national priorities when the alternatives are lower taxes, greater scope for private sector employment or better welfare programs for the needy. </PARA>
<PARA> Although those particular items of expenditure that I have referred to do not amount to massive sums of money, I think that they do nothing for the overall credibility of a government committed to budgetary restraint. I cannot and I will not at any time justify cutting expenditure on the needy, and I trust that the Government will not do so. Given some of the ridiculous priorities outlined to the Australian people last year, any move to cut expenditure in more essential areas will be almost impossible to tolerate and justify. That is not to say that there is no fat left to cut. I think there is, and I think it has to be cut. But it has to be done with a lot more sensitivity and consistency than has been the case in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree that if we must have extravagant government, higher taxes are preferable to big deficits from an economic management point of view. The decision to limit the tax base will, I hope, act as a constraint on the kinds of expenditures to which I have referred. From the point of view of the impact on individuals and families, whether we have higher taxes or bigger deficits does not really matter. Everyone gets hurt either way. In this context I remind the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling), who seemed to imply that there was not a great deal wrong with budget deficits, that home buyers around Australia are paying now for past extravagances of government because the present round of interest rate increases basically stems from the kind of fiscal history which we have had. We are now trying to finance the expanding borrowing requirements of governments and their extravagances over the past 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> If governments can reduce their expenditure sufficiently-this means much more successfully than in recent years-all Australians, in my opinion, may be able to look forward to the day when they will face lower taxes, lower mortgage payments and higher real incomes. That is the reality facing every Australian at present. The average Australian with his average commitments is having some difficulty because of the fiscal problems which have not been adequately tackled over the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to comment on the Treasurer's reference to single income families. Under the present taxation system the tax avoiders, the cash economy tax evaders and the two income families are all facing lower tax liabilities than wage and salary earners supporting family units on a single income. As the Treasurer said, the tax burden on single income families is greater than that on two income families with equivalent family income levels, notwithstanding the fact that their household expenditure obligations are very similar. I congratulate the Treasuer on the way in which the Government acted in this area last year and helped to redress this imbalance by substantially increasing the dependent spouse rebate. But I emphasise to the Treasurer that the single income family remains the great new poverty group in our society. The family unit, the basis of our society, will remain at risk unless the Treasurer gives the single income family the absolute top priority for taxation reform and relief in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's statement gave some idea of the magnitude of this problem when he cited some statistics which indicated that there are some 1.25 million taxpayers with a dependent spouse in this country. They are the people who were clearly identified two years ago by the Department of Social Security as the emerging poverty group in this country. I believe that for social, economic and compassionate reasons this Government really has to do a lot more to help the single income family unit. I place that at the top of my priority list and I hope that the Treasurer does the same when he considers the tax reforms for the coming Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) apparently believed that he was insulting me by comparing me with the great mathematician Pythagoras. There are two things which can uncontroversially be said of Pythagoras. Firstly, his theories were clear, coherent and they stood the test of time. Secondly, he believed that to gain a true understanding of life we should look at the facts and figures before us in a balanced way. The wisdom that Pythagoras had is totally and completely lacking in the Government's economic policies which have resulted in this increased taxation burden on the majority of the Australian people. Indeed, the economic theories of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) have so blinded him to the real economic situation within this nation that he cannot even perceive the essential injustice and inequity of the set of statistics on taxation which he dares parade before us in his self-satisfied fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While we are thinking about history one thing that is certain is that only a very short period will be required to discredit totally the absurd economic philosophy by which this Government pretends to guide this nation. The disastrous course along which that ideological love of the Prime Minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, has led the United Kingdom will, if the present policies persist, also manifest itself in this country. By some peculiar logic the Treasurer considers that to have been responsible for the greatest increase in taxation in Australian history is something of which to be proud. At the same time we have witnessed the biggest reduction in the growth of public services, especially funds available for education, social welfare, transport, urban development and conservation. In other words, the Treasurer is proud of the fact that he is taxing the Australian people a lot more and giving them a lot less. Australian people are getting less value for their money. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Liberal Party and its leaders are well known for showing contempt towards the average Australian, it must surely be clear to everyone in this nation that we are paying too much in taxes for the services that we receive and that far too much of our money is being squandered on concessions and privileges for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his wealthy friends. Instead of repentance for this state of affairs the Treasurer congratulates himself day after day in this House and claims that he has achieved some kind of economic recovery and that the country is about to experience some kind of economic miracle which the media love to refer to as a boom. In a moment I shall demonstrate that this is an example of distorted and unbalanced perception whereby one sees only those facts that suit one and ignores the rest. However, one of the most important things about the democratic socialist tradition is that it has always made a distinction between appearance and reality. Nowhere is this distinction more crucial than in the study of economics and economic systems. </PARA>
<PARA> When looking at the dynamics of an economy we should ask: Whose interests does that activity serve? Who will that development benefit? If we ask such questions about the so-called recovery and the so-called resources boom in the Australian economy certain facts come to light. The most important fact is that some economic indicators are chosen because they seem to demonstrate recovery while other indicators are ignored. A recent article in the National Times was headed: 'Despite Inflation and Unemployment, the Dark Days of the Slump are Over'. Unemployment in Australia is dismissed despite its continued existence as an almost irrelevant item in an assessment of economic recovery. Unfortunately, many Australian economic journalists seem also to have adopted this unbalanced approach and seem unable to recognise that there are different frameworks of economic thought and different viewpoints which can be presented, even given the statistical data. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the debate about the so-called recovery or boom. It is only by a realistic and balanced assessment of our economic situation that we can possibly hope to develop a rational and fair taxation policy, while at the same time providing an economy which maximises the satisfying of human needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I would like to say what such a balanced approach would involve. Of course, no one denies that there are substantial planned developments of our resources by multinational corporations, especially in energy and minerals. Large amounts of foreign capital directed at this resource development are pouring into Australia. The issue that still remains is: What benefit will this have on the overwhelming proportion of Australian people? This point raises the important issue of a resources tax to which my colleagues have referred in earlier speeches. Let us look at certain other aspects of the Australian economy which media commentators and the Treasurer habitually ignore. These point not to recovery or to a boom but, in fact, to a crisis. I wish to mention three aspects: Firstly, the run down of Australian manufacturing industry. The extent of this run down was documented by Peter Robinson in his book The Crisis in Australian Capitalism. Robinson pointed to the fact that Australia's manufacturing industries were increasingly going to the wall, especially where they were forced to compete with Asian imports-the latter, of course, being produced in economies where virtual slave wages are paid to workers. Robinson concluded as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> If we fail to evolve a coherent manufacturing strategy we will find ourselves racked by periodic economic crises, given to internal bickering and doomed to a steadily declining standard of living. At worst, the strains which such a scenario suggest will lead to the kind of schisms in Australian society that Professor Manning Clark foresees in his direst moods. Questions such as who controls Australia's natural wealth, who profits from it and who disposes of it will divide Australians, embitter their society and leave them vulnerable to external pressures. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, I mention the large increases in the level of unemployment. I will not say much about this as we have heard a great deal about it in this House. I repeat that the total number of people out of work has reached the highest level since the great depression of the 1930s. But the human dimensions of this unemployment crisis-which is what it has been called by many commentators-have yet to be assessed. Thirdly, I mention the dramatic increases in the number of people living in poverty. From 1975 to 1980 the number of people living below the Henderson poverty line increased from one million to two million; an increase of 100 per cent. This claim, which the Government attempted to deny, was made by the Catholic Commission of Bishops in Australia. It has been supported by more detailed figures from the Australian Council of Social Service. Needless to say, these organisations and other bodies are pressing for urgent action to change this disgraceful situation. </PARA>
<PARA> How can the Treasurer and some economic commentators blithely describe this situation as a recovery or a boom? A balanced approach would be to look at the minuses as well as the pluses. As an example of such a description I recommend that honourable members read the first paragraphs of a book written by the highly respected economist Dr Peter Sheehan entitled Crisis in Abundance in which he explains quite clearly that, on the one hand, Australia has high unemployment, high inflation, serious problems with the social and educational structures and so forth, while on the other hand it has what appears to be an abundance of natural resources from which a small group of Australians are benefiting. We have to look at this realistic situation if we are going to develop a coherent taxation policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In the post-war period it was a popular belief that there could be an increasing development of the public sector-government services of all kinds-and that sufficient money to pay for this expansion could be raised without government intervention in the private enterprise economy. This belief could be maintained during the period of substantial growth which has been called the great boom from 1945 to 1970. It is obvious that there were understandable reasons for this view. After all, from 1945 to 1970 real gross domestic product grew at a rate of 4.5 per cent per annum. However, in the last few years the situation has been completely different. From 1976 to 1979 real GDP increased by only 2.8 per cent while inflation rose at a rate of 11 per cent; a very important factor to keep in mind. In our present economic situation more taxes are being paid while at the same time fewer services are being provided. We can no longer rely upon unrealistic predictions of economic growth to pay for government services, especially while inflation goes ahead of the level of growth. Even if services are reduced, as the Prime Minister has attempted to do, the Government will not have sufficient money while inflation continues to outstrip growth. This phenomenon is what the American economist James O'Connor called the fiscal crisis of the state. Each year the Liberals have imposed more and more taxes, notably the notorious crude oil levy on petrol which raised $2,500m extra in the last year; yet the Budget deficit last year was not significantly an improvement on that of the last Whitlam Government, even though services have been severely reduced. This clearly shows that Australia is suffering from the phenomenon which I have described as the fiscal crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has no strategy to deal with this situation. He does not even understand it. What does he propose to do when the oil levy from domestic production no longer permits the Government to achieve a tax rip-off? Does the Government propose to slash further the services provided to the people? If not, will it do what Mrs Thatcher did this week and dramatically increase the taxation burden on the people? When one recognises the nature of the problem one can put forward some proposals to deal with it. There are alternatives to which my colleagues have already referred, such as the resources tax and laws against transfer pricing. However, it is my view that there is one alternative which we must in the long run countenance to solve the fundamental types of problems that I have mentioned which other Western countries are suffering from. We must increase public ownership and participation in productive enterprises; that is to say, the people as a whole must, through their Government, take out a greater share of the wealth generated in the resources area and other areas of the economy. In the last Budget net receipts from government owned enterprises amounted to only $264m out of a total of $27,305m. This is one of the lowest rates of contribution by a productive sector of the state in the world. Unless we expand this sector-the sector of government and publicly owned enterprises-especially in the areas where wealth is being generated in this nation, particularly in the resources area, in the long term we will not be able to solve our fiscal problems; nor will we be able to reduce the taxation burden on the middle and lower income families of this nation. The crisis in our economy will continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. The honourable member accused this Government of presiding over 'the greatest increase in taxation in Australia's history'. That is rot and he knows it, as the Australian people know it. This Government and this Government alone has the determination and the capacity to contain and reduce in a responsible manner the total paid in tax. I refer honourable members to table 3 in the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) which I think the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) said earlier was so much history. However, I think that history is worth reflecting on. The table shows that from 1972 to 1975 when the Labor Government was in office taxation receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product increased by two to three percentage points-not by two per cent or three per cent-from a level of about 20 per cent. This was a very substantial increase over a very short period. The percentage increase over the period that this Government has been in office has been only fractional. If we take the Commonwealth and State taxation receipts as a percentage of GDP-we should never lose sight of the fact that the States have hardly had to increase their taxes and charges in recent years because of the large revenue grants that this Government has made-we find that the percentage has in fact fallen fractionally. I suggest-no one doubts-that it is the Labor Party which is the socialist, big spending, high inflation, high taxation party. The Australian people recognise that, and the Australian people gave a very clear verdict on that in the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to raise a matter which relates not only to my electorate but to the people of Victoria. Despite the accusations of Messrs Hamer and Crozier that they are attempting to sack the Melbourne City Council because of its alleged mismanagement, its inability to make long term planning decisions and its corruption, it is in fact the Victorian Government which has an abysmal record in these areas, and which, according to its own logic, ought to be sacked. The background to this decision to sack the Council is riddled with connivance, concoction and corrupt, vested interests. The issue of the Bourke Street Mall has been reduced to how trams can be rerouted along Lonsdale Street so that their passengers can be funnelled into Myers through the back door, while leaving the Bourke Street entrance to be redeveloped at public expense as an annexe of the same store. We are, of course, expected to believe it is pure coincidence that the plans of the Hamer Government for the mall are identical to those of the Myer corporation which is a self-confessed philosophical supporter and financial benefactor of the Victorian Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The go-slow by the State Government over legislation relating to the implementation of the city's strategy plan has now been exposed for what it is-a cheap ploy to enable Hamer to accuse the Council of having done nothing to enable development to take place in the central business district. Having created the illusion of the council being unwilling to act on these issues, the Government has placed itself in the position to rip the heart out of the central business district of Melbourne. This welter of reprehensible circumstances ought to be enough to convince any disinterested observer that whatever legitimacy the Hamer Government may have once had it has long since gone. The ripping out of the heart of the central business district of Melbourne will leave the way open for the millions of dollars from developers who are waiting to transform what has justifiably been described as one of the finest Victorian-era cities in the world into a neo-Los Angeles. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to placate the National Party and its supporters, the Government compulsorily acquired the Council's wholesale markets in the mid-1970s at a direct cost to the ratepayers of $16m. This has resulted in Melbourne having the fastest growing food prices of any State capital. Not being content with this piracy, Hamer now intends, through his quisling administrators, to close the retail Victoria Market at the behest of the supermarket chains. This will further reduce the checks on spiralling food prices and severely affect the ability of low income households to make ends meet. This is not to mention the gross waste of public money that will result as the market has only recently been restored at a cost of three quarters of a million dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> The attempt by the Government to reduce the ward boundaries of the City Council must constitute one of the most blatant acts of gerrymandering that has ever been seen in this country. Liberal Party surveys consistently show that the popularity of the Victorian Government is plummeting. On the evidence of the last Liberal poll, the Liberals stand to lose 14 seats and government at the next election. Despite the scapegoating which followed the land deals scandal, maladministration continues to remain the prime aspect of the Victorian Government's housing policy. Hundreds of thousands of Victorians are homeless while high rise housing estates remain half empty. Energy is being made available to dangerous industries at a discount while householders are forced to buy electricity at rates which effectively subsidise industrial users. Electricity tariffs have been increased as a direct result of increased payments by the State Electricity Commission to Consolidated Revenue, that is, an indirect tax on consumers at a time when 48 per cent of those living below the poverty line are unable to afford sufficient heating during winter. As part of the takeover bid on the Melbourne City Council the Government is attempting to appropriate $200,000 from the Council's electricity supply department to help cover the SEC's deal with Alcoa of Australia Ltd. The whole range of this scandal lies at the feet of the Victorian Government and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has an obligation to apply pressure on the State Government by the means that he has available to him. He is a political counterpart of the Victorian Premier and holds the purse strings in respect of tied grants and the like. He should ensure that a public inquiry is held to investigate the implications of the action of the Victorian Government in order to protect the democratic rights and the interest of the people of Melbourne. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Subaru is a Japanese motor vehicle which is available for sale in this country. It is distributed by the LNC Industries Ltd group and is available in two models. One is a quite attractive front wheel drive sedan. The other is a four wheel drive wagon. Currently the four wheel drive wagon is imported as a four wheel drive commercial vehicle. It is sold under those circumstances and therefore attracts a lesser rate of duty than passenger vehicles. Also it is free from quota restrictions. The problem is that a reference has been sent to the Industries Assistance Commission on whether the Subaru should be regarded as a normal two wheel drive type of passenger vehicle rather than a four wheel drive commercial vehicle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basis of the reference to the IAC is to question whether there is with Subaru in its four wheel drive wagon configuration a substitution effect, that is, does the four wheel drive wagon take away from normal two wheel drive passenger sales. If it does, it substitutes for passenger vehicles. If that is so, the argument goes, it should be subject to the higher rates of duty and the quotas applicable to passenger vehicles. If that were to happen the effects could be quite disastrous for Subaru. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three reasons for suggesting that the reference should not succeed; three reasons for saying that Subaru ought to be allowed to continue to sell, in its four-wheel drive configuration, as a commercial vehicle. The first is, of course, the question of substitution. Does the four-wheel drive waggon substitute for two-wheel drive vehicles? It is not my job to canvass the sort of evidence that the IAC will be considering or to prejudge what it is likely to find. Suffice it to say that I believe that on careful consideration of many factors it can certainly be argued that there is not a significant substitution effect. Honourable members can look at some figures that are quite readily available. If honourable members look-this is in evidence before the IAC-at the use to which four-wheel drive Subarus are put by their owners then they will see quite clearly that those owners have in the main, purchased that vehicle because of its four-wheel drive bush use. It can be used in circumstances where no normal two-wheel drive waggon or any two-wheel drive passenger vehicle can be used. It can go bush; it can do tougher things than the others. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, if honourable members look at some of the figures they will find that if there has been any substitution effect, then where Subaru is winning its sales is not from passenger vehicles but rather from the other four-wheel drive commercial type vehicles available in this country. In other words Toyota, Nissan, Range Rover and Leyland are the manufacturers suffering at the hands of Subaru's sales. They are suffering because Subaru offers a significant price advantage as against those other four-wheel drive vehicles. At the same time, people who buy a Subaru four-wheel drive waggon pay a higher price than the normal waggon of its size and power. It is as though people are paying a premium because it is a four-wheel drive vehicle. Thirdly, we can look at a geographical analysis. It happens that in the main the popular Nissan, Toyota, Range Rover type four-wheel drive vehicles sell more in the big cities than in the country. On the other hand, Subaru vehicles sell more in the country than in the big cities. That reinforces the view that it is a vehicle that is acquired by many purchasers because of its four-wheel drive capacity, not because of its passenger capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> But the whole reference is a nonsense in any event. In Australia the motor vehicle industry is often regarded as being in a whirlpool. Will it go down the hole? We have to break out of that way of thinking. The IAC has said that we must take moves to break out of that. Why on earth then are we considering dragging the Subaru four-wheel drive vehicle into that whirlpool? For God's sake, it is outside the whirlpool now; it ought to remain outside and it ought not be the business of government to try to drag in even another industry into the whirlpool that the whole nation so desperately wants to get out of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to draw attention to a general attitude of the Government in its attempt to ridicule the proposal by honourable members on this side of the House for the introduction of a resource rent tax. The failure of the Government to introduce this tax means that the resource rich States of Queensland and Western Australia are able to benefit at the expense of the more populous States of Victoria and New South Wales. Let us look at how the Queensland Government is taking advantage of the situation by imposing its own resource tax. It is reported that the oil company, BP Australia Ltd, and its partners have gained the approval of the Queensland Government to explore and mine a rich steaming coal deposit in the State. The consortium had offered a $220m royalty for the coal to be shipped from the proposed mine. This royalty is similar to a resource rent tax. This offer comes on top of the many millions of dollars which the Queensland Government gains from other mining corporations in the form of royalties, rail freights, port charges and other infrastructure charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This ability of resource-rich States to mount their own taxes is of great concern to States such as Victoria as it means that these revenues are not available as revenue for the Federal Government. It would appear that the Government wants the States of Queensland and Western Australia to benefit from the mineral riches so fortuitously located within their own State boundaries to the detriment of the more populated areas of Australia. A resource rent tax would ensure that some of the riches which are being extracted so avariciously by the transnational mining corporations are made available for the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's journals carried announcements regarding the Australian Council of Trade Unions' proposed superannuation scheme. The proposal states that the scheme will offer portability and improve returns to its members. Three separate firms are to be nominated to undertake administration, investment and auditing. All that is to be applauded. I wish that this Government was further advanced in its investigations of the Hancock report to ensure the availability or portability in the private enterprise schemes. However, the reading of the balance of the article that appeared in the Australian Financial Review becomes almost sinister. I would like to read from this article which quotes, and in fact pictures, the ACTU President, Mr Cliff Dolan. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ACTU executive decided to proceed with the establishment of the fund and said that, with 2.1 million potential members, it could eventually become a dominant force in Australian investments. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dolan estimated that the ACTU fund could ultimately have control of half of Australia's investment funds. </PARA>
<PARA> He hinted that these could be used as a tool of ACTU policy-</PARA>
<PARA>What do those few words mean? Before the investment advisers are announced, politically motivated investment guidelines are emerging. Profit motives which are essential to the success of the scheme are to be curtailed in the interests of totally unrelated ideology. The Press statement also makes it clear on two occasions that the ACTU is not unmindful of how it can use the accumulated profits to play a power game. Obviously again the benefit of the contributors can be submerged by this activity. All that is bad enough but it is also reasonable to read between the lines of this statement to the time when a future ACTU executive will decide to impose its own commercial judgments on the scheme. The known financial expertise of the ACTU as demonstrated in the Bourke's fiasco must point to the dangers of this happening. At this stage I believe any contributor, whether employer or employee-let us realise that both employer and employee are contributors to superannuation schemes-would have good reason to question sincerely whether such a scheme is in his long term interest and decline to join. However, we find that that choice is to be refused to the contributor. The same article says of Mr Dolan:</PARA>
<PARA> He also suggested that industrial action would be used if it was necessary to persuade employers to participate in the fund. </PARA>
<PARA>A similar quotation is attributed to him in the Australian. That statement could not appear to inhibit the worker in his choice of superannuation. Not much! If the employer is forced into the scheme what option does the worker have? How long will it be before the production of an ACTU superannuation policy will be necessary as a union ticket to get on a work site? It is useless for the ACTU to state that the queries I raise will not arise. It has made its position quite clear. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) has a right to approve tax deductibility for contributors to superannuation schemes. I trust he will consider the matters I have raised before giving approval in this case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add my good wishes to those of the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) who on Tuesday congratulated the Apex clubs of Australia on their Fiftieth birthday this week. As he said, 'a five minute speech in the adjournment debate cannot recapture 50 years of Apex history'. So I am glad of the opportunity to add some words to his. Apex is a uniquely Australian institution. It was conceived in Geelong in the depths of the Great Depression and has since expanded to the stage where it is a rare community in this country that does not possess an Apex club. Some 800 Apex clubs exist throughout Australia and some 18,000 young men are currently members. The idea of Apex-young men concerned for their community and prepared to do something about it-has been successfully exported to India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Fiji, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea following a challenge in the mid 1950s by the then Minister for External Affairs, later Lord Casey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Materially, the contribution of Apex to the Australian community has been a great one. Schemes such as the Royal Flying Doctor Service, Guide Dogs for the Blind, compulsory X-rays, Foundation 41 and microsurgery have all been initiated and/or supported by Apex nationally. In addition to national commitments, the contribution by Apex clubs to the forgotten people in their own communities continues. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) was recently presented with a facsimile cheque for some $8m representing the contribution of Apex clubs to the Australian community in the past 12 months. This is a contribution not just in money but in time and community work. I mentioned before that there are very few communities in this country without an Apex club. Indeed, throughout its 50 years of existence the strength of Apex has been outside the metropolitan areas, in the many far-flung centres of population scattered across this country. I mention, for instance, the town of Tullamore in New South Wales with a population of 300 and an Apex club of some 30 members. This small club in a small community recently built a $100,000 nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the greatest contribution of Apex in its 50 years of service to the community lies in citizenship. The oganisation has as one of its ideals, 'to develop by example a more intelligent and aggressive citizenship'. We in Parliament should be pleased to have in our communities an organisation that seeks to raise the awareness and interest of those we represent. Some 1.5 million young men have passed through Apex ranks since its inception. It is not surprising that a great many of our local, State and federal representatives have received motivation in this organisation. I know that there are a number of Ministers of the Crown, both State and Federal, from all parts of the political spectrum who are proud to have worn the triangular badge of Apex. As Apexians around the country celebrate the fiftieth birthday of their organisation and as they prepare for their golden jubilee convention in Geelong at Easter to be attended by three founders of Apex and by His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, I am sure that this House would want to pass on its thanks for the contributions of Apex until now, its congratulations on attaining the half century mark and its best wishes for the next 50 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was amazed to hear tonight the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) say in the adjournment debate that the Hamer Government owed the Myer Emporium Ltd of Melbourne a debt. He went on ad infinitum about the Hamer Government's wanting to put trams down Lonsdale Street-something of which I have never heard-and to close off a mall in Bourke Street because it would help Myers and because Myers supports the Liberal Party. The memory of the honourable member for Melbourne must be terribly short; has he forgotten the time when the then chairman of directors of Myers went public by putting his name on a full page advertisement in the national Press supporting the Labor Party in the infamous Whitlam area? This advertisement asked people to vote for the Whitlam Opposition. This is a matter of history and does not have to be proven. If the honourable member thinks that the Liberal Party owes Ken Myer a debt, he is completely wrong. If any party owes him a debt it is the Labor Party, because Ken Myer helped put the Whitlam Government into office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us get the facts straight. The Liberal Party and the Liberal Government in Victoria owe Myers nothing; it is the Labor Party which has a debt to pay to Ken Myer but, of course, it is not in the position to repay at the moment. The honourable member for Melbourne should get his facts right. The case which he has made in this debate tonight is completely discredited as are most of the statements that the honourable member makes in this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter of some concern to me. A former member of the Defence Force whom I will not name in this debate-the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) is aware of his name-has written to me and the Minister drawing attention to what is a serious anomaly in the provisions of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefit Act. The member concerned served during the Second World War with the Australian forces. He married-I think for a second time but that is not relevant-in 1967. If he dies, and he is obviously of reasonable age, his wife will not have a right to a continuation of his DFRB pension. The anomaly is that under all other pension schemes for Government employees of which I am aware, provided a person has been married for an acceptable period, the pension carries on and the widow is entitled to a pension. Certainly under the existing Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme for servicemen a widow in exactly the same circumstances whose husband has died is entitled to receive his pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise this anomaly in the House because unless it is raised it will go on for years and a few people will be disadvantaged. Most superannuation schemes have provisions which protect the scheme against marriages of convenience undertaken in order to benefit financially a woman whose husband's life expectancy might be extremely short. This obviously can not be the case with a marriage which took place in 1967, nearly 14 years ago. I hope that members of the Government's welfare committee will consider this problem to see whether some action should be taken to correct it and to ensure that a person is not disadvantaged because of an existing or continuing anomaly, especially when the scheme is substantially out of line with other superannuation schemes for government employees which this Parliament has introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier we heard the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) make his now regular tirades against anything which is done to benefit employees. I can understand his attitude. He is one of those people who believe-I think sincerely-that if you can get it it is yours and bad luck for the bloke who cannot. He said in this House in his maiden speech that the strong should get all and bad luck for the weak. He did not use those words but that is what he meant. Honourable members ought to realise that superannuation is not available to many people in the workforce, nor is any other means by which they can ensure their retirement. This affects especially those people who transfer regularly from job to job because of necessity. Any effort to allow people to help themselves to ensure against their retirement must surely be encouraged by all people in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the Australian Council of Trade Unions is endeavouring to cover those people in the work force who can get cover in no other way. It is important that encouragement of this system, which is the basis of Sweden's social security system which is privately operated, should come from members in this House. There are too many fly by night superannuation schemes in too many industries-I do not hear members opposite complaining about them-in which employees' moneys are capital for the company and they rarely get any return. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all tonight, I join the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Free) this evening and last night the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) in congratulating the Apex movement in Australia on its fiftieth anniversary. I must say how pleased I was to join several other members of this House in encouraging the former Minister for Post and Telecommunications to convince Australia Post to change its mind when it decided not to issue a stamp to celebrate the anniversary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like now, in a slightly calmer atmosphere than last night, to raise questions relating to the real role of the Labor and present governments in the provision of financial assistance to the aged. In a very short speech last night, I responded angrily to suggestions from the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) that I was a shonky figure manipulator. All I really want to do is to dramatise my interpretation of the figures without involving myself, I hope, in any conflict with the honourable member for Bonython because it seems to me that some obvious things appear from the figures. If we take the figures used by the honourable member for Bonython, which were derived from the assumption of a trend and were not necessarily official figures, and recognising that I based my comments on the only official figures available, we find that between 1975-76, the year of Labor's last Budget, and 1978-79-that is, in three years-there was a 52 per cent increase in Commonwealth expenditure on the aged by specified departments. That expenditure was on programs solely and principally for aged people. That expenditure not only exceeds the inflation rate but also exceeds by far the rate of growth in the number of aged people. That appears to me-and I may be wrong-to disprove the proposition put by the honourable member for Bonython that 'they were not the achievements of the Fraser Government'; in other words, they were not the achievements of the present Federal Government's increasing its involvement in the area of aged people. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the honourable member for Bonython can explain to me how a 52 per cent rise in three years, using the very figures the honourable member for Bonython presented, represents some kind of manipulation. In a shorthand way, I said something which the honourable member for Bonython correctly picked up. I claimed that the present Federal Government should be given credit for the big increase in Commonwealth expenditure on the aged as a percentage of gross domestic product. I will concede the point that the honourable member for Bonython made-that a proportion of the increase took place during the period of the Labor Government. But I stress that a big proportion of that increase came about because the Labor Government gave the over seventies a means test free pension while at the same time introducing a tax on pensions for the first time in Australia. The huge offset of $100m involved in a tax on pensions was naturally not mentioned by the honourable member for Bonython. I skimmed over that proposition because it seemed to me that that huge offset was a factor worthy of some consideraton. </PARA>
<PARA> I had no official figures and I am prepared to accept the figures assumed by the honourable member for Bonython. There is no doubt that the point he made is correct: There was some Labor Party contribution, and a significant one, in that big increase. All I stress is that in increasing that expenditure considerably from 3.8 per cent to 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product, we have not had any offset. We did not introduce any new taxes on pensioners, as the Labor Party did when it introduced a tax on pensions for the first time. Under this Government total expenditure on the aged as a proportion of total government outlay has gone up from 12.6 per cent to 14.6 per cent. Under Labor it went up by only 0.4 per cent. All I wish to put on the record is that it appears to me that this Government's performance has been very good. </PARA>
