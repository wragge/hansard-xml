<TITLE>Toxic Shock Syndrome</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned by the threats to women's health and lives posed by Toxic Shock Syndrome, and urge the following steps to be taken as a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under 'Cosmetics' as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to: (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed. This campaign of public education would necessitate multilingual distribution of the information where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take immediate and positive action to avert possible threats posed to women's health by implementation of the above measures.</PARA>

<TITLE>Law Reform Commission: Privacy and Personal Information</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA>The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Paragraphs 107 and 108 of the Privacy and Personal Information discussion paper number 14, brought down by the Law Reform Commission in June 1980, undermines the family unit and the authority of parents, which is the Christian basis of our society, by proposing that 'between 12 and 16 years, a child should be entitled to object to disclosure of information to a parent'.</PARA>
<PARA>It is your petitioners sincere belief that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) an adolescent between the ages of 12 and 16 is not at a mature enough stage of life to decide whether or not the disclosure of information to a parent will be in the best interests of the adolescent.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) as a record keeper has no responsibility for the child, and as his moral standards may be different to those of a parent, he should not be permitted to come between child and parent.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a parent has a unique position which may enable him/her to perceive a situation that the record keeper does not. The parent must therefore be aware of the problem if remedial action is to be taken, and has the right to guide the child in the direction he/she feels fit.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners therefore pray:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Members of the House of Representatives will reject the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission and find some other means to protect children from the excessive abuse of some parents.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Health. I refer to his answer to a question on Wednesday, 25 March, concerning prescription fees paid to chemists, who have had no effective increase since July 1977. The Minister will recall that he told the House that the Pharmacy Guild's current application for an interim increase was being assessed and that the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements, Mr Justice Ludeke, had asked for the Government's response within two weeks. As it is more than two weeks since the judge's request, can the Minister now inform the House of the Government's positive response to the Guild's application? Will the Minister also enlighten the House as to how he expects the promised new fees tribunal to undertake a full review of chemists' prescription fees by 1 July when legislation to establish that tribunal has still not even been presented to this House?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government shares the view of all those who believe that the chemists have put forward a reasonable case in applying for some increase in their remuneration. As the honourable gentleman has noted, to this end we have set out to establish a new tribunal which will give all interested parties the opportunity in public to put their cases. I think this augurs well for the future because this area has been bedevilled by misunderstandings and lack of agreement since way back in the 1960s, including all through the time when the honourable gentleman's party was in power. This is an honest attempt by the Government to resolve a difficult area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable gentleman is quite right in saying that Mr Justice Ludeke has asked the Government to prepare and file a paper on the Guild's case by 27 April next. At present the Government is giving top priority to the development of the necessary legislation to establish the tribunal. I am very conscious of the time scales which are worrying both the honourable gentleman and members of the pharmacy profession. I can only assure him and them that the Government will do everything in its power to give all those concerned with putting their cases the opportunity to do so and to urge a speedy resolution of the problem.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NI4">Mr PORTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I ask, firstly, whether the Government accepts that the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission properly identified the effects a shorter working week would have on the economy when it said that any reduction must be related to the productive performance of the economy as a whole and that to exceed such productivity:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . would be to build accelerating inflation into the economy, which would destroy the viability of indexation. This is not a matter of conjecture but an inescapable fact of economic life.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, what is the Government's response to the new wage fixing principles?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1430" SPEAKER="Peacock The Hon A.S." NAMEID="MI4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="KOOYONG" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer to the first part of the question is, of course, yes. The Commission has unquestionably recognised that the campaign for a shorter working week was inconsistent with, and indeed represented a major threat to, the operation of an orderly system of wage determination. The Commission has clearly indicated that the shorter hours question should be tested in arbitration against the background of national economic and industrial relations priorities in the final review. The unions' attempts to selectively pressure and pick off individual industries or companies by the spurious use of so-called productivity bargaining with the intent of eventually gaining an across the board reduction in hours has unquestionably forced the Commission to point out that such action goes well beyond the spirit and the intention of its 1978 endorsement of a limited application of the productivity bargaining concept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite the warnings by the Commission, we still heard comments yesterday and today from spokesmen of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union stating that they were 'furious' with the decision and claiming that the new guidelines would be 'unworkable, impracticable and unrealistic'. We have heard Mr Carmichael, in particular, say to the media that the AMWSU would continue with its campaign for shorter working hours and that claims would be pursued outside the Commission. Unquestionably, these statements should stand condemned. It is the duty of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, in our view, to point out to its affiliates that expectations of shorter working hours put at risk economic recovery and maintenance and improvement of living standards as well as the survival of the wage indexation system. The commissioners made it perfectly clear that it is the survival of the system that is at stake.</PARA>
<PARA> The trade union officials should act responsibly and recognise that selfish claims and disruptive tactics to gain shorter hours for their members cannot be contemplated in current economic and industrial circumstances without damaging the standard of living of the Australian community. Finally, the new system of wage fixation does provide, in the Government's view, a sound basis for dealing with claims for improvements in both wages and conditions on their merits. It will be most unfortunate if those gains are jeopardised by the union movement choosing to ignore this fact.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not quite sure whether the honourable gentleman asked a question only about south-west Tasmania and that wilderness area or whether impliedly he was also trying to ask a question about the damming of the Franklin, which has been a matter of some comment and notoriety in Tasmania. It is a matter on which the Government of Tasmania has taken different positions at different times. I am not quite sure what the current attitude of Mr Lowe and his Government on that issue is. I do believe that it is an issue which is largely for the Government of Tasmania. The south-western wilderness area is land of great beauty. It is unique; it is irreplaceable. I hope that it can be listed in the World Heritage list. If Mr Lowe has made the decision to seek that nomination, I think that that is a good thing. The honourable gentleman would also have noted that we have sought the listing of the Kakadu National Park as one of the great national parks of the world and of the whole area of the Great Barrier Reef as one of the marvels of the world. If the information contained in the honourable gentleman's question is correct, I am glad that the Government of Tasmania has a similar concern for that south-west wilderness area.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is it the case that, in matters such as the use of direct rather than indirect taxes, the rejection of resources taxes, the control of inflation, the firm control of the money supply, a reduced role for government and tight control of government spending, the Government's policies are in line with the views of Professor Milton Friedman? Why does the Government have difficulty in agreeing with Professor Friedman's view that it is possible to introduce a taxation system that is fair and equitable and that does not discourage people from working harder and longer? Why does the Government reject the Friedman view that people who increase their incomes by working harder should not be penalised by higher tax rates and that a tax system can be devised to do away with much, if not most, of the tax evasion that goes on-most of it by the people on the highest incomes? Finally, why does the Government reject the Friedman view that government revenue would not fall under the kind of tax system he supports and that those who would benefit most from such a system would be those on the lowest incomes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, that is not true. There are a number of areas where the policies adopted by this Government and successfully pursued over the last five years are close to those advocated by Professor Friedman who is a very impressive and articulate advocate of the cause of free market forces and a person whose views have had a very significant influence on the practices of governments in the industrialised world in recent years. I refer, of course, to the importance that he places on monetary policy as an instrument to control inflation. Having said that, it does not automatically follow that, because the Government and I personally have a high regard for what the professor advocates, there is an uncritical acceptance of everything advocated, particularly in the environment in which the Australian economy operates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support very much the aspiration which is inherent in the question asked by the honourable member for Hume that we ought to strive to have a taxation system that is fair, equitable and productive of the greatest amount of incentives. I suppose that differences of opinion in the community occur as to how best one can achieve that. I believe, and the Government believes, that, if we are going to have a taxation system that significantly relies on personal income tax as a source of raising revenue, for the sake of fairness there must be some element of progressiveness in it. It should not be so great, as I pointed out in my recent parliamentary statement, as to have a significant effect on incentive. One of the things that this Government has done in that cause has been to reduce the number of steps in the tax rate scale from seven to three. This has taken out a significant part, but not all, of the progressive effect of the taxation system. I have said before, and I say again, that I regard our taxation system as being far from perfect. Equally, we have to ensure, before we embrace propositions involving radical change, that what would result from that radical change would not be more unfair and less equitable than the present system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition is really taking a quite extraordinary attitude, in public, to this matter. The honourable gentleman has been briefed at length by Australian security organisations. He has been briefed at length in the presence of my colleague the Minister for Defence in relation to joint facilities in Australia. He has made an extraordinary range of comments round about which makes it very difficult to ascertain his objective in relation to these matters. Earlier this week the Leader of the Opposition had-for all I know he may still have-the documents of the Hope Royal Commission into Intelligence and Security, which investigated various agencies, including the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. Therefore, he would know quite well what Mr Justice Hope thought about these matters. He would know that the view of His Honour was that ASIS should be continued and maintained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition has also had the advantage of discussions with Mr Kennison. He has sought further discussions with Mr Kennison so that he might continue his interrogation of him. That being so, I find the statement that the Leader of the Opposition made yesterday in relation to ASIS and M16-he implied that M16 had been penetrated but left open the question as to whether or not that was still the case-a quite extraordinary thing to say about an agency of a friendly government. The purpose of the honourable gentleman certainly seems to be confused; it is not one that I can detect. The honourable gentleman knows quite well that the matters that have been the subject of revelations in the United Kingdom have been dealt with at length in the parliament of that country. They occurred many years ago and involved two or three people who have been named. It is my understanding that part of the briefings of the Leader of the Opposition involved all that is known in relation to Mr Hollis and Mr Ellis. If that is not so, briefings can be reinstated in relation to them.</PARA>
<PARA> These matters occurred many years ago. Since then an Australian royal commission has been appointed by a Labor government. Under Mr Justice Hope it reported during the term of this Government. The recommendations, which were in relation to the totality of security organisations, have in a large way been accepted. Therefore, it would seem to make the concerns about what might have happened in an earlier period somewhat irrelevant to Australia in the 1980s. Those matters are subject to the past, and since then we have had the hearings of the royal commission.</PARA>

I did answer the question last week. The suggestion in one newspaper article that there was a mole somewhere in the higher echelons of the Australian Public Service and that the Central Intelligence Agency or the United States Government had known of that but had not told Australia of it was too absurd to contemplate. If there had been any knowledge of that kind within the ranks of the United States I have no doubt that Australia would have been told. I have no reason to doubt the confidence that Mr Justice Hope himself exhibited in ASIS. I have no reason to doubt that whatsoever. If the honourable gentleman has any doubts, if he has any allegations to make or if he has any information to put forward, having a proper regard for considerations of the security organisations and the bipartisan approach which this Government has sought to maintain by allowing the Leader of the Opposition very full and repeated briefings on these matters, in the interests of this nation he should make those allegations to me and should not try to make public his concerns. There is a great deal wrong with raising allegations about MI6, an organisation of a friendly country, in a public way.

Circumstances in the United Kingdom are different from those of 10, 20 or 30 years ago. There is no evidence that Australian security has been prejudiced in any way.

I draw the Prime Minister's attention to Press reports of Polish officials seeking food aid, loans and credits from Western European states and the United States. I ask: In view of Poland's economic need, has the Government determined an amount of assistance to Poland in food aid, loans or credits? If so, how much will be given? If not, when does it expect to make a determination? Has the Government sought to influence other Western powers to provide such economic assistance? If the Soviet Union should invade Poland, has the Government considered providing assistance to Polish refugees? Has it made contact with international organisations and governments on this matter, particularly the Swedish Government, which, according to Press reports, has been considering what action it might take in those circumstances to assist refugees?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An approach has been made in relation to credits, food and, I think, one or two other matters. That is currently under examination by the Government. The honourable gentleman can rest assured, especially in view of the domestic situation within Poland and the hardship being visited on the Polish people at the present time, that the Government will be looking at this request as sympathetically as possible. If a refugee situation does arise, and I think that it must be the hope of every member of this House that it will not arise, the honourable gentleman can be quite certain that Australia will be active in helping to assist refugees and in helping as many of them as we humanly can to find a home in Australia. We would want to act in a way which I think is traditional for this country. We have acted in a very forthright way in relation to refugees from Indo-China, Vietnam and Kampuchea in recent times. If the Soviet armies march into Poland and if there is a flood of refugees, the Australian organisation will be well able to assist in a very ready and forthright way. Our capacity to assist in these matters is, of course, proven and the organisation is proven. So, in a sense, special arrangements do not need to be made; the organisation is there and it is ready.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs has had a number of discussions and a number of communications with his counterparts from overseas countries about the circumstances that could arise if there is direct Soviet intervention in Poland. The maximum degree of co-operation, not only in the appropriate reactions to the Soviet Union itself but especially in assistance to refugees, is something which many countries would have at the forefront of their policies. Again, it should be the objective of all members of this House to make sure, to the extent that we can, that that situation does not arise and that there is continuation of the degree of restraint of which I spoke in my statement a couple of days ago and which the Soviet Union has shown so far-for reasons which only the Soviet Union can give-compared to the nature of its actions in Afghanistan or earlier in Czechoslovakia or Hungary. I hope it is the objective of all nations to make sure that the Soviet Union understands that it is not only in its own interests but also in the interests of the widest international community that it should not act and move its troops against Poland.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman would know very well that, as a result of mining and mineral developments, a great deal of direct employment is provided. He would also know that, in addition to that, many service industries need to be established on site or in the town or place of development and that many other Australian firms are able to expand their employment because they gain contracts for fabricating works and the provision of the supplies and services which are needed as a result of major resource development. Of course, State governments gain considerable revenue as a result of mining ventures. Some governments in particular, by various devices, gain very significant additions to their normal revenues and that, of course, is used as they think fit for the benefit of all the people in their States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Taking the major mining corporations overall, I am advised-subject to correction by my colleagues-that approaching 60 per cent of the profits of the major companies is involved in either Commonwealth or State taxation. If that figure is correct, 60c out of every $1 is a very substantial return for the treasuries of the States or the Commonwealth-moneys which, of course, are used to help to provide the services, the standard of living, the maintenance of welfare payments, and the improvement of assistance for the disabled which are so necessary in a compassionate and concerned community. So the revenues that governments, both State and Federal, gain from these ventures under present arrangements are very considerable indeed. It ought also to be noted that a small number of projects would seem to gain the public eye because they turn out to be, in a sense, highly profitable. They attract a great deal of attention and often notoriety. But, especially in oil exploration, there are many companies and many ventures which result in no economic return at all. The stimulus to enable that venture to take place is not only the implementation of appropriate Government policies but also the possibility of significant reward, having in mind the fact that the chances of success are not necessarily high and therefore the prospect of high returns has to be in place or the drilling and expansion of exploration just would not take place.</PARA>

I assure the honourable gentleman that both I and my colleague, together with officials from our various departments, are watching the question of steel imports to make a judgment as to whether overseas firms are seeking to move some of that surplus production on to the Australian market. It is certainly true that recent import order statistics for some steel products have been subjected to an upward movement and the translation of these order figures into actual imports will be the subject of very close monitoring indeed. The House will be aware of the mechanisms which are employed both in the European Economic Community and in the United States of America at present to protect their industries against dumping.

I ask further: Does the Minister recognise that this situation will force some pensioners who are eligible for free government cover to take out expensive private health insurance as well? Finally, does the Minister agree that this is not in the interests of cost containment within our health care system but is an additional cost generated by the medical profession? What does he propose to do about it in order to protect the interests and welfare of dependent pensioners?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There seems to have been an attitude, consistently expressed by the Leader of the Opposition both during his present incumbency and while he was a Minister in the Labor Government, aimed at denigrating the medical profession. This consistent attitude, which has been displayed by him and by his party, has sought to portray the medical profession as comprising rapacious individuals who seek nothing but their own financial rewards. The fact is that the vast majority of the medical profession of this country have provided over the years a highly efficient medical service to the people of Australia and, in a great many instances, have provided services free of charge to people in necessitous circumstances. The fact is that the range of medical services available to the people of Australia is of a very high standard indeed. The various options available to people, whether or not they take out health insurance, mean that in a very real sense a choice is available to them. For sure, there are occasions when people in necessitous circumstances have been required by medical practitioners to make some contribution to the cost of the services provided. That is up to the individual medical practitioner. But I say again that, overall, the medical service that is provided by professionals in this country is of a very high standard indeed. I do not think it is advantaged by continually being denigrated.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the course of Question Time the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in responding to a question that I asked of him in relation to security matters, sought to impute my motivation and, it would seem, to imply that there was something sinister involved, although he was not precise in identifying what it was. I want to make clear that in relation to those matters which quite properly are confidential and secret there will be no disclosure by me. My record in that respect is consistent, but we must make a distinction between an obsession with security for security's sake, to the point at which it impairs a proper awareness within the community of certain functions about which the public should be informed, and that level of confidentiality which must be preserved in the national interest. I remind you, Mr Speaker, of processes in other countries, such as the United States of America, where a relatively open inquiry system is associated with the congressional system of government.

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr STREET</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is firmly committed to the continued development of a broader and mutually beneficial bilateral relationship with China. During the 12 months covered by this report, Australian contacts with China expanded rapidly. Personally, I was pleased to have the opportunity to visit China in January this year. Chinese Vice-Premier Li Xiannian, the most senior Chinese leader ever to visit Australia, was here in May 1980. During that visit, an agreement on co-operation in science and technology was signed. It was also agreed to begin negotiation of a cultural agreement to establish a technical co-operation program and to encourage further exchanges in the social sciences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australia-China Council has an important role to play in this process. Since it was established in June 1979 the Council has established policy guidelines for its work, and set up programs and advisory panels in areas such as academic and educational matters, science and technology, culture and the arts, social science, publications, and sport and community affairs. The Council has emphasised its role as a catalyst, bringing interest groups in Australia and China together, rather than involving itself directly in arrangements for exchanges. At the end of its first year of operations the Council was pleased to report that the circle of those involved in exchanges with China of various kinds had widened greatly. In the past nine months the Council has continued to promote exchanges with China. It has also sought to increase awareness in the community of the longer term advantages of increased communication and exchanges between Australia and China. The Council has maintained its emphasis on keeping people informed of its work. A party of six journalists from metropolitan and regional newspapers in five States toured China for three weeks, and the Council has supported the development of relations between the Melbourne Age and the Peking People's Daily, leading to the production of an English-language daily paper in Peking which is shortly to begin. </PARA>
<PARA> Some new areas of Council activity include continuing negotiations for a group of Aboriginal health workers to visit China to observe the 'barefoot doctor' arrangements and other Chinese community health services; financial support to the Museums Association of Australia to host a visit to Australia by a group of senior Chinese museums staff; preparations for a return visit by an Australian women's delegation to China, to reciprocate the visit by a Chinese women's delegation mentioned in this report; and the exchange with China of delegations of publishers, and discussions on copyright matters. In association with the International Cultural Corporation of Australia and the major sponsor, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, the Council contributed towards the Chinese classical paintings exhibition which opened in Sydney on 31 March. These are only several examples of the wide and increasing range of contacts between Australia and China which have been developed and are continuing to be made by the Australia-China Council. I have much pleasure in tabling the second annual report of the Australia-China Council for 1979-80. </PARA>

The point I am trying to convey to the House is that we established the relationship there because of what we felt was a mature situation which I am now congratulating the Government for continuing. I had the opportunity to lead the first parliamentary delegation to China in June 1973. I welcomed the support I received from the late Senator Ivor Greenwood and others. It is of interest to note that that initiative was taken by the Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We must foster increased awareness of our respective cultures and be prepared to allocate adequate finances to programs which will increase understanding. In particular, we should be encouraging our young people in this regard. I applaud the activities of the Australia-China Council in that regard. It was a significant step forward when we signed the agreement of co-operation in science and technology. I also note from the report and from the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) that the respective governments have agreed to begin the negotiation of a cultural agreement. There is some suggestion and an uneasy feeling that the latter agreement is being impeded by cuts in the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs. I hope that this is not the case. I would welcome the assurance of the Minister to that effect. I believe that it is important that we move ahead with it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one particularly disturbing aspect of the report and it relates to developments which have occurred, since its publication, with respect to Radio Australia. The Council stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In possibly the most dramatic development, Radio Australia opened postal boxes in Hong Kong and Beijing and in twelve months from January 1979 received over 100,000 letters from those who hear its Chinese-language broadcasts. </PARA>
<PARA>The response from Chinese listeners is set out in detail in the section of the report dealing with the media and information program. It was a great response and an encouraging reaction but the question is, what was the Government's response. Apparently it has been an extraordinarily shortsighted and miserly one. It did not renew funds available to Radio Australia and ten translators employed to deal with the correspondence have been sacked. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not question the integrity, ability and hard work of the members of the Council; but I think it is important that the Government give them support. It is unfair that their actions have been undermined by the decisions to which I have just referred. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is firmly committed to the continued development of a broader and mutually beneficial bilateral relationship with China. </PARA>
<PARA>If this is the case, the Government should ensure the decision to which I have just referred is reversed and that no similar decisions are taken in the future. The urgency of the matter is highlighted by the fact that letters reaching Radio Australia now run at the rate of 200,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that China is of immense importance to our region, and its importance is growing. I believe the other power in this region whose importance is growing is Australia. This presents us with important opportunities. The time available only allows me to make the general point: That our own activity in this area should be substantially increased. I hope that can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I applaud the great progress that has been made by the Chinese in overcoming the problems of their nation, including their outstanding efforts to improve living conditions for all people within their society and to modernise to achieve that result. However, I also point out that the Australian Labor Party remains strongly committed to the view that the best interests of all people are served by a democratic government and the right of citizens to organise free trade unions to promote their interests. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0N7">Mr NIXON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have said on several occasions in the past that the Commonwealth supports the continuation of the live sheep export trade, providing it is carried out under the best animal welfare conditions. That is still the case. To ensure that these conditions are maintained and improved where necessary, the Government has continued to monitor the live sheep export trade and, indeed, other livestock exports. Government veterinarians accompanied a shipment of live horses for slaughter to Japan in May last year, a shipment of sheep to the Middle East in September-October last year, and a shipment of cattle to Indonesia in January this year. A veterinarian is currently accompanying another live sheep ship en route to the Middle East.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of this continuing assessment of the livestock export trades, the Government is able to keep abreast of developments and changing needs. The report I have just tabled, by the Australian Bureau of Animal Health, deals specifically with the live sheep export trade. This trade has grown quite dramatically over recent years. In 1971-72, just under one million head of sheep were exported for slaughter. By 1979-80, that figure had grown to over five and a half million head, and this financial year live sheep exports for slaughter are expected to exceed six million head. The trade is worth over $124m in foreign earnings, and is therefore an important industry. Obviously, any trade that grows as quickly and extensively as has the live sheep export trade, must be expected to encounter some problems. This report by the BAH into the sea transport of sheep has pointed to a number of deficiencies which need to be rectified. The Government has accepted the conclusions and recommendations of the Bureau and I have already set in train a number of a measures which will further improve the conditions under which live sheep are exported from Australia. I am determined to ensure that all requirements for this trade are met. If they are not, then shippers will face the prospect of not being allowed to load, or of having to sail with a reduced cargo. </PARA>
<PARA> Several of the deficiencies noted by the Bureau's report should not, in fact, have been occurring. They are matters which are covered by existing standards and regulations, and therefore a greater policing of the requirements of the trade will in itself bring about considerable improvements. The Commonwealth has the constitutional responsibility for animal exports. The Bureau of Animal Health co-ordinates and supervises this activity by delegating inspection and certification functions to State departments of agriculture. Accordingly, with respect to the specific deficiencies mentioned in the Bureau's report, the following measures are being adopted to improve welfare aspects of the live sheep export trade. I will briefly paraphrase each deficiency, as found by the report, and outline the action that is being taken in each case. </PARA>
<PARA> Unsuitable sheep are presented for export:</PARA>
<PARA> To overcome this the Bureau has told State authorities that sheep at farms or assembly points must be inspected wherever possible to ensure that unsuitable sheep do not enter the export process. </PARA>
<PARA> Inadequately prepared-preconditioned-sheep are presented for export:</PARA>
<PARA> The standards spell out requirements for preconditioning and these must be observed. If not, sheep will be rejected by the State officers carrying out the inspections at assembly points. </PARA>
<PARA> Sheep off-shears are being presented for export:</PARA>
<PARA> The standards require that sheep not be shipped within 14 days of shearing. Unsatisfactory wool length will lead to rejection of sheep by State officers carrying out the inspections at assembly points. </PARA>
<PARA> Sheep with excessive wool length are being presented for export:</PARA>
<PARA> The standards require that average wool length should not be more than 25 millimetres. This will be insisted on by final certifying officers. Sheep with wool length in excess of 25 millimetres will not be passed for loading. </PARA>
<PARA> As culling takes place in the pre-export process mobs are 'topped up' at short notice with unsuitable sheep:</PARA>
<PARA> This will not be permitted. If suitable sheep are not on hand to make up numbers, ships will sail with reduced numbers. Certifying officers at shipside will ensure this. </PARA>
<PARA> Some yards and feedlots are poorly designed and maintained:</PARA>
<PARA> Yards and feedlots will be regularly inspected by State officers. Improvements and maintenance must be carried out as required and sheep will not be allowed to be handled through substandard facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Unskilled people are handling sheep:</PARA>
<PARA> Shippers are required to employ only skilled personnel for sheep handling. If State officers find cases where skilled personnel are not on hand, then loading will not take place until such employees are provided by the shippers.</PARA>
<PARA> Junior officers supervise shipments of sheep. </PARA>
<PARA> State departments of agriculture have been asked to locate senior and experienced officers at shipside during loading to ensure proper handling practices are observed. </PARA>
<PARA> Although it may be only a short haul from assembly point to shipside, some sheep are distressed by poor transportation:</PARA>
<PARA> All facilities and transports used to move sheep from assembly points to shipside will be inspected by State officers, prior to any transportation. Unsuitable or deficient vehicles will not be allowed to transport sheep and State inspectors will ensure that no overcrowding takes place during transportation. </PARA>
<PARA> Sheep are being loaded in mixed lots causing bullying and overcrowding:</PARA>
<PARA> The drafting of sheep of different sexes, ages and weights will be better supervised by State officers. Indiscriminate mixing will not be allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> Ship maintenance is sometimes delayed resulting in poor facilities on board:</PARA>
<PARA> Inspections are to be made of every live sheep ship as it docks, and where necessary repairs carried out before sheep are loaded. These inspections are normally made by Department of Transport officers examining the ship for safe practice. In future State departments of agriculture officers will also carry out inspections relating to the husbandry needs of sheep. Repairs are the responsibility of the shipping companies. If repairs cannot be made at once ships will not be allowed to load sheep to full complement. </PARA>
<PARA> Feed provided on shipboard is sometimes of low quality and palatablity:</PARA>
<PARA> A new BAH instruction requires that feed must be of adequate quality and palatability. Feed is to be inspected on each ship. If it is found to be inadequate for any reason, ships will not be permitted to load sheep until deficiencies are corrected. </PARA>
<PARA> Watering facilities may be inadequate or poorly maintained:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Transport will require improvement to unsatisfactory watering facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Unsatisfactory distribution of sheep occurs on some ships:</PARA>
<PARA> State inspecting officers are to ensure that sheep are distributed as comfortably as possible throughout each ship to ensure overcrowding does not occur. This requirement will be rigidly enforced even if it means that a ship does not take on its full intended load. </PARA>
<PARA> Problems with ventilation:</PARA>
<PARA> Ventilation systems are to be inspected before loading of each ship and numbers to be shipped on the vessel will be reduced if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The special nature of sheep husbandry on board ship must be clearly recognised:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a need for specific research related to the shipboard environment. The Australian Bureau of Animal Health has set in train studies to initiate and co-ordinate research into the specific needs of sheep transported at sea, as suggested in recommendation 3 of the report. The study will be ongoing, and will involve consultation with State departments of agriculture, the sheep and transport industries and welfare organisations. If further improvements are determined by this research, they will be incorporated progressively into the export process. </PARA>
<PARA>The measures I have outlined will further enhance the animal welfare and husbandry requirements of this industry. The Government will continue to monitor the trade, and will in particular closely police the standards and regulations to ensure that all requirements are being met. I have advised State governments, and through them, exporters, of these new requirements. Furthermore, I am proposing to hold a meeting shortly with all concerned with the live sheep export trade to emphasise the Commonwealth's determination that husbandry conditions be maintained and improved wherever necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This is almost a tongue twister statement, but it is a very important matter. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) talked about shorn sheep on ships as they leave the seashore; so one has to be careful. This is a very serious matter and the Opposition welcomes the statement because it refers to animal welfare. The report on sea transport of sheep is not about whether there should be a live sheep trade or what size it should be. Perhaps I will have a chance to say a few words about that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Animal Health has been given the job of looking into aspects of this trade and has produced a good and comprehensive report. I think it is based, more or less, on one veterinarian's report. As the Minister said, another veterinarian is looking at the matter again. There will be continuing scrutiny of it. The nub of this report that the Minister has tabled is continued in appendix 4 which starts at page 35. This is to be read in conjunction with the requirements for the carriage of livestock by sea which is a specification of the Marine Standards Division of the Commonwealth Department of Transport. Although the Minister has listed quite a few recommendations in these revised standards, the BAH makes the observation that it is not making any attempt to provide a detailed or exhaustive list of requirements. It states that veterinary supervision will provide professional judgment on the spirit and intention of the standards over the health status and fitness of the animals to travel. Should special or unusual circumstances call for variation of these standards, approval must be obtained from the Bureau of Animal Health. It must be remembered that while standards can be set they do not replace professional veterinary judgment on the health or fitness of animals to travel. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has already said that the existing regulations were not being observed. Whilst I welcome these revised standards and the fact that BAH says that professional veterinary standards should be exercised, I think we can still ask the question: Why were these standards not exercised more in the past? This report comes about as a result of a report by a government veterinary officer who was despatched to the Middle East by the Minister as a consequence of the animal welfare debate raging at the time. Representations were also made by the animal welfare lobby to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The Minister, of course, can back this report in rather glowing terms because he virtually determined what would be in it. A very strong allegation has been made. I believe that the Minister rejected the findings of his own officer in the first place. The authentic report on which this report is based did not see the light of day. Be that as it may, this report shows that the animal welfare lobby, the animal lovers and the farmers themselves were very well advised to express concern at the conditions that sheep were being shipped under. I will read parts of the report on mortality to the House. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The final mortality on this shipment was 1.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>I must say that, in terms of cartage of livestock within Australia, 1.5 per cent is not a really high mortality figure, but it was the conditions under which the sheep were being shipped that caused most of the concern by farmers, animal lovers and the animal welfare lobby. A qualification is made in the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . true mortality figures are difficult to establish for such shipments because of the logistics of obtaining an accurate on/off count uncomplicated by other factors. </PARA>
<PARA>Some detailed information is given about the percentage daily mortality of sheep on the ship on which the veterinary officer accompanied the sheep. The report reads:</PARA>
<PARA> On the morning of day 4 . . . an electrical fault caused a breakdown in ventilation and higher mortalities subsequently occurred in sheep on closed decks on days 4 and 5. This strongly suggests that the differences in mortality between sheep on open and closed decks can be partly attributed to differences in ventilation. </PARA>
<PARA>In terms of morbidity, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Morbidity or sickness rates could not be determined because of poor lighting and high stocking densities. A variety of conditions common to sheep under many systems of management were observed. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues with veterinary information on the conditions of the sheep, including post-mortem findings. I will summarise the situation by saying that one cannot accurately determine the exact situation with respect to morbidity because of poor lighting and high stocking densities. The mortality figures cannot be accurately assessed. Nothing really definite could be said about the breakdown in ventilation that occurred on this ship. This all paints a picture of rather atrocious conditions on the ship. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the 300 sheep that were examined by post-mortem. A total of 86 per cent of those sheep showed hyperacute or acute lung lesions. It is very obvious that one of the major factors in design of the sheep ships relates to the ventilation conditions. The Department of Transport has already laid down certain conditions. I welcome the fact that the BAH has now said, in its general conclusion, that there is a need for a lot more research into the conditions on ship. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The development of sea transport requires research to define the special needs of the sheep. Initiation and co-ordination of necessary research needs to be accelerated and given higher priorities in funding. </PARA>
<PARA>It then outlines a program of research and development. I hope that the Minister is fair dinkum when he says that he will see that this happens. The report makes sensible, professional and general recommendations. It is good to see that the Minister has pulled out from the report the very specific areas of concern and has informed the House of the actions that are now to be taken. Let us look at the actions that the Minister has elucidated. He is saying that the State authorities will now do this and that they will now do that. Anyone looking from the outside would ask: 'Why have these things not been done before?' A heap of Department of Transport regulations have not been carried out. Unless we see the original report, it is difficult to say where most attention should be directed. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already pointed to the fact that a lot more attention should be directed towards the design and ventilation of the ships. One can validly hypothesise, without seeing the other report, that the strongest criticism in the report must have related to conditions on the ships. This is the area in which the recommendations of this report I believe are the weakest. By way of summary the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> All who are working in this industry and wish to make sure that it continues to flourish in its own interests, and in the interests of the Australian sheep industry and rural Australia, must also work at all levels to see that there are no departures from good husbandry practices in the transport of sheep. </PARA>
<PARA>We all agree to that. The Opposition wants to see a live sheep trade that is best for the farmers, best for the meat workers and best for the sheep. We need full information on all aspects of this trade. If, as appears to be the case, a more detailed report is available, we would like to see it. As it is, the Minister has said that another veterinarian is accompanying another ship; perhaps we will get more information as a result of that. The Opposition intends to see that the veterinarian ensures the State authorities carry out what they should have been carrying out all along and that the procedures will be tightened up. </PARA>
<PARA> I will say a few words on the live sheep trade itself. This is very much a volatile issue. We have had a lot of experience in this matter. It is a matter which concerns the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union because it sees the live sheep trade threatening the income of its members. At the same time, the live sheep trade must be said to be good for the farmers because normally, at this stage into a drought, the price of live sheep in this country would be at very depressed levels; but the price has held up. This is partially due to the fact that many live sheep have been shipped out at high rates. The flock structure itself-a little research has been done on this-is adjusting to the new demand. It is actually in a healthy condition. There is a higher percentage of ewes than there was previously. The average age of the flock is younger. These things will benefit the basic breeder stock for the future sheep industry, whether it be meat or wool. If there had not been a drought the sheep flock would have been larger by this time. On the latest figures the killing rates for sheep have increased locally. Again, the impact of the drought has distorted the figure. A drought can have the effect of activating the number of sheep being killed and it is difficult to get a long term trend and to show accurately what is happening. That is one of the biggest problems of working with figures in the whole livestock area. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things we have to stress in considering the whole question of live sheep exports and the slaughtering industry is that the industry structure at the abattoir level is bad. There has been over-investment and a number of other problems. If we are to solve those problems and those of the unions we should look at the slaughtering industry and the processing industry as a whole. The slaughtering industry causes the problem as much as the export of live sheep does. We have to work out what changes are occurring in the whole industry. Are the changes in the sheep and lamb sections of the meat industry signifiantly different? To what extent are the same factors prompting change in different components of the industry? I can answer those questions myself to some degree. I believe that all parts of the industry are declining and need restructuring. Essentially the same set of factors are operating. The drought is accentuating the problem of the whole slaughtering and processing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> A report on the live sheep trade was prepared by Mr Miller of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Again, this report has not seen the light of day but I have heard somewhere on the grapevine that we may yet see it. If that report sees the light of day I hope that the figures in it will be updated and relevant to today's situation. The live sheep industry will always present a problem in the industrial relations area. The sanest people need to discuss the problem rationally. While many animals are being exported live, there is no way that unionists in the abattoirs will be convinced that that is not denying them some income. If we are to solve this problem we have to look at the slaughtering industry overall and find out the reasons why the Middle East countries cannot engage in the chilled meat trade a little more. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On 26 February the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer) drew the attention of the House to Press reports of interviews with Miss Liliana Gasinskaya in which it was claimed that she had retained her Soviet citizenship and her Soviet passport to travel overseas last year and had visited her parents in the Soviet Union. Bearing in mind Miss Gasinskaya's claims in 1979 when she was granted refugee status on the recommendation of the Determination of Refugee Status Committee that she held a well-founded fear of persecution should she return to her homeland, I instructed the Chairman of the DORS Committee to make inquiries into the reported statements in the Press and elsewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following this, officials conducted an extensive inquiry into Miss Gasinskaya's activities over the last year. Miss Gasinskaya was subsequently interviewed on two occasions. During these interviews marked inconsistencies in her various accounts of her overseas visits emerged. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite these inconsistencies, my Department was able to establish beyond reasonable doubt that at no stage had she visited the Soviet Union and that she had not used a Soviet travel document for a visit to Britain last year. Miss Gasinskaya travelled to the United Kingdom and returned using a certificate of identity issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for use by non-citizens when they travel abroad. In the first interview Miss Gasinskaya claimed that she had not returned to the Soviet Union but that she had visited her mother in London. In the second interview she admitted that she has not seen her mother since she arrived in a Soviet vessel in Sydney over two years ago. Independent checks by my Department have confirmed this. Having examined all the evidence, the DORS Committee has advised me as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is of the view that, on the evidence available, there are insufficient grounds for revocation of Liliana Gasinskaya's refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA>However, during these interviews Miss Gasinskaya admitted that she had applied to the Soviet authorities for the return of her Soviet citizenship and the issue of an appropriate travel document valid for travel to the Soviet Union and return. I am informed that, in so doing she sought certain assurances from the Soviet authorities. In making these applications Miss Gasinskaya was no doubt motivated by an understandable desire to see her family again. Her applications however raise new issues, the significance of which Miss Gasinskaya does not appear to comprehend. If her application were to be granted by the Soviet Authorities so that she again became a citizen of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Article 1C of the 1951 Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees would apply. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of Section A if:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) He has voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of the country of his nationality; or</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Having lost his nationality, he has voluntarily reacquired it . . . </PARA>
<PARA>For this reason, the Committee has advised me that it 'is of the view that the question of Miss Gasinskaya's refugee status should be kept under review. Miss Gasinskaya should be counselled about the seriousness of her situation and the possible results of any such action.'</PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to explain Miss Gasinskaya's actions throughout the investigation and the motives that might lie behind them. The inconsistencies in her various statements have caused me great concern and have led me to scrutinise all of these inconsistencies most carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> Having done so, I have come to the same conclusion as the DORS Committee, namely that she has not breached the Convention under which she was granted refugee status despite the fact that even the kindest critic of her public utterances would regard her conduct as disturbing and extraordinary for a refugee. I have instructed the Chairman of the DORS Committee that she should be counselled about her situation and the prospect that, should she proceed with her application to reacquire Soviet citizenship, she would come within the terms of Article 1C (2) of the Geneva Convention and would lose her refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of her resident status in Australia is a separate matter. Miss Gasinskaya was granted permanent residence by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs soon after being granted refugee status by my predecessor. She left Australia in June last year. Whilst she was given a return endorsement prior to her departure, she did not receive a new entry permit granting either permanent or temporary residence when she re-entered Australia in August. At that point her previous entry permit which afforded her permanent residence in Australia expired in accordance with the provisions of the Migration Act. I am informed by my Department that this was due to an oversight by a Commonwealth Officer on the primary line. </PARA>
<PARA> To regularise Miss Gasinskaya's status I have decided that she should be given a temporary entry permit, with permission to work, for a period of six months. This will enable her to consider her position and be counselled by my Department about the consequences of her actions. If she proceeds with her application to the Soviet authorities she will do so in the full knowledge of what that means in terms of her refugee and resident status. If she withdraws her applications or should they be refused by the Soviet authorities I would be prepared to consider an application from her for the restoration of her permanent residency. </PARA>
<PARA> Miss Gasinskaya is being informed of my decision and has been advised to keep the Regional Director of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in Sydney informed of her intentions. </PARA>
<PARA> The granting of refugee status is a most important act. Those granted refugee status have rights and privileges bestowed by the international convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees which Australia has ratified. It is important that refugee status should be given only to those who meet the definition in the convention and that refugee status is not abused. As I have indicated, the DORS Committee advised me that Miss Gasinskaya has not taken any action which would justify removing her refugee status but she has taken action which could lead to a course of events which would involve her losing refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that as this matter was raised in Parliament it is appropriate that I should respond in Parliament. The delay in making this response reflects the conflicting nature of assertions made by Miss Gasinskaya and the importance of the issues raised as a consequence. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EV4">Mr YOUNG</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Port Adelaide)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-We are discussing here, I suspect, the most famous refugee we have had in post-war Australia, Miss Liliana Gasinskaya. I suspect further that she is only famous because she is of Russian nationality. Following the statement of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) to the House today, I think that the young lady in question ought to realise that Australia has been exceedingly generous to her in the way in which she has been allowed to stay, for the status which has been granted to her and for the amount of attention and money that has been paid in all the inquiries that have taken place as a result of the matter being raised in this Parliament just a few weeks ago. There are many people in Australia, especially in the ethnic communities, who believe that perhaps she has received too favourable a treatment which is not available to people from other countries. They continually raise the question why this young lady, Miss Gasinskaya, should have treatment that is not available to other people. I have not checked today but certainly a few days ago there were people being held in the gaols of Australia awaiting deportation because they had virtually done exactly the same as Miss Gasinskaya; they had either jumped off their boat or come into Australia illegally and were awaiting deportation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that, at the time when Miss Gasinskaya claimed refugee status in Australia, a question was asked of the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the present Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar), as to how many people had been deported from the country during the period from January 1978 to March 1979. A total of 794 persons who had entered the country illegally had been deported and, in the same period, a total of 303 deportations were effected in respect of those persons who had entered Australia illegally. So we were really bending over backwards to allow this young Russian lady to stay. In addition, we had 151,000 people apply to migrate to Australia, and 80,000 of those, many of whom would have been families of people already living in Australia, had been refused entry. I think that it is much easier for the ethnic communities of Australia to try to rationalise these questions because they feel the unfairness perhaps more than the rest of the community. I am not suggesting for one moment that it is a responsibility that can be handed over to one section of the Australian community, but the ethnic community does feel the matter very deeply. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I have no quarrel with the way in which the Minister has acted in order that Miss Gasinskaya now has time to receive a reply from the Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, as she has now applied for the return of her Soviet citizenship with the intention of travelling back to the USSR, I suggest that she be given time to think about the matter. Obviously, from her actions since she came here and from the reports contained in the ministerial statement, sometimes she is not all that sure of what she has done and said. I think that she should dwell on the matter and be counselled very wisely about what the future may hold. She ought to realise now the sort of publicity that she attracts. When Peter Falconer raised the question of Miss Gasinskaya in the Parliament, the following news headlines appeared around Australia: 'The Red-Bikini Girl ''USSR holiday'' to be checked'; ' ''Red Bikini Girl'' denies Soviet visit'; 'TV man says ''bikini girl'' admitted trip'; 'Send Red Bikini Girl Back-MP'; ' ''Red bikini girl'' wants out'; and 'Red-Girl Lillian on Mat'. So, of the 14,500,000 people in this country she is one who attracts an undue amount of publicity. It would not be so bad if that publicity started and finished with the young lady in question, but it does not. We have some very, very important communities in this country. A lot of people from those communities come to the offices of members of Parliament repeatedly asking that representations be made to Ministers for other people to be allowed to stay here after they have entered the country illegally. As I said at the outset all of this has occurred primarily because the mentality in Australia is that anyone from the Soviet Union who applies to stay after coming here illegally must be allowed to stay as something dreadful will happen if he or she is sent back. That has always been the parameter within which a government has to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the House to one exception which, of course, was the case of the Russian violinist, Georgi Ermolenko who visited Australia some years ago during the period of the Whitlam Labor Administration. At one stage Mr Ermolenko said that he did not want to return to Russia with the musical group and then he changed his mind and said that he did want to go back. But there were people in Australia who said that he was not telling the truth and that he did not really want to go back and we should not let him go back. In fact unions in Western Australia took action. The Federated Clerks Union and the Transport Workers Union took industrial action to try to stop this young chap going back to Russia after he had told people he had conferred with the Government and private individuals in Western Australia, that he did want to return. It so happened that the government of the day had to use the Royal Australian Air Force to fly the musical group to Singapore to get them out of Australia. Subsequently the Ermolenko family applied for and were granted residence in Australia and they are still here today. I raise this matter because it seems extremely important to me that, if in the future someone wants to leave a Russian vessel to stay in Australia, the Australian public ought not to believe that the repercussions of a decision to allow that person to stay will cease with that decision. Tens of thousands of people who are affected by that decision will discuss it. A lot of people will disagree with it and a lot will believe that the person involved should be sent home to apply later to enter Australia, the same as everybody else. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I realise the political parameters within which we operate on such questions in Australia. I think it is totally unfair that it appears that Australia has one policy for people leaving the Soviet Union and another for people who come from the many countries of those communities which make up the Australian ethnic community. Of course great political play was made of the Ermolenko case in the parliaments. People tried to suggest that we were persecuting Ermolenko. The unions took action; and people were upset about the matter. The same thing has happened with the young lady in question, Liliana Gasinskaya. It appears that the tolerance of a lot of people in Australia is running out with this young lass. She ought to think very carefully about her future. She should keep out of the limelight of the media, as her actions are not helping in the decision-making processes concerning people who want to settle in this country. I think that we at least have to rationalise our thinking about people who want to stay in Australia after entering illegally. We took a very major step last year in altering the laws so that people were warned that there would be no future amnesties for those who had entered and were staying in this country illegally. I think that, as near as we can, we need one more law to apply to everybody. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that from time to time the Minister is going to have to use his discretion, but all the communities ought to understand and accept the decisions-I am sure they will-if one law applies to them all. If they believe that people are to be favoured because of their nationality, this will cause unrest in the ethnic communities among people who do come here legally, live here legally and try to bring their relations here. Perhaps, on the odd occasion, they are involved with someone who has come here illegally. In trying to keep such people here they are told that anybody who comes in illegally must be deported. It is a very sorry state that we have got into. I am sure that every member of this Parliament is familiar with the circumstances of making representations to the responsible Minister after the family of someone who has entered this country illegally comes into his or her office and asks for a case to be argued. I know from discussions I have had with the present Minister and with previous Ministers, both Liberal and Labor, that sometimes they can have up to 100 representations on the same case. People will go to different members of parliament and exercise every avenue available for a person to stay in Australia, but ultimately that person can still be refused permission to stay here. All of these things have to be taken into account when we are discussing the case of people such as Miss Liliana Gasinskaya. I hope that she will consider her case more seriously than she may have done in the past two years and that she will make up her mind quickly about what she wants to do. I hope that she will not attract further media sensationalism, which plays a very large part in upsetting the very important ethnic communities we have in this country. </PARA>

<PARA> The Government has generally accepted the recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on the iron and steel industry. The effect of this decision is that certain basic products and hot-rolled and semi-finished materials will be dutiable at 5 per cent; that some coated flat products and cold finished materials, other than those of high alloy, will be dutiable at 10 per cent; that other coated and further worked products will phase from 25 per cent to 10 per cent over a five-year period; that high alloy steel products will be dutiable at 25 per cent for three years and will then phase by annual decreases of 2 percentage points to the long term rate of 15 per cent; that certain large bore steel pipe, and pipe and tube fittings, will phase from 25 per cent to 15 per cent over a five-year period; that other pipes and tubes will be dutiable at 15 per cent immediately; and that minimum rates will apply to a range of input materials and minor products. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the IAC's report on metal cans and canisters of iron or steel, the Government has accepted the recommendations. The effect of this decision is that imports of cans, canisters and similar containers, with the exception of certain jerricans, will be dutiable at 15 per cent. Jerricans having a capacity of between 15 and 25 litres will be dutiable at 30 per cent for 12 months and will then become dutiable at the long term rate of 25 per cent. A summary setting out the nature of the duty changes has been prepared and is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The stench of corruption today hangs over Canberra. This Government, which so earnestly preaches propriety, has been caught with its fist in the till. It has abused its authority in an utterly arrogant fashion and misused public funds in a totally inexcusable way. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has established a dirty tricks department on a scale not seen since the Nixon White House. It is a dirty tricks department that will do anything to anyone to ensure this man's survival. This Prime Minister, who demands loyalty and objectivity from the Public Service and who at the same time rejects the notion of public funding of political parties, has established a unit within the Public Service to work as an indispensable operational arm of the Liberal Party of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia, with our established system of party politics, there will always be close liaison between any government and the party organisation which supports it. Of fundamental importance, however, is the notion of separation of the political party on the one hand and the operations of the government on the other. The bureaucracy is accountable to Ministers and not to the political parties which they belong to and any fudging of this separation inevitably destroys democracy as the country falls into the hands of the non-elected faceless apparatchiks of the political parties who are answerable and accountable to no one except the big and anonymous backers of those parties. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last three years the Prime Minister has abandoned that important principle in an effort to tighten his grip on the control of this country. This is all part of the Prime Minister's total inability to cope with criticism and his total failure to account for his actions to anyone. He has avoided scrutiny more than any of his predecessors. He will not participate in debates in this Parliament. He will not debate with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in public. He will not subject himself to the scrutiny of the media, except in a most perfunctory way and even then only to a selected portion of the Press gallery. He is a Prime Minister who is running scared; he is driven by the fear that someone will one day pin him down and find him out. He has cocooned himself behind the protection of his handlers in his Press office, who in turn behave as if he is some sort of punch drunk zombie not to be let out of their sight or control. It is therefore a simple and predictable extension to establish the mechanism for controlling the news in the hope that the Government and the Prime Minister will always be portrayed in the best possible light. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has instituted a series of regular dinners with newspaper editors-browbeating sessions to ensure that the metropolitan dailies mirror the world according to the Prime Minister. Apparently that exercise has been less than totally successful. Some newspapers have deviated and have dared to contest the views of this man. His response, therefore, has been to establish the Government Information Unit. The Government Information Unit and its State appendages, the State Co-ordination Officers, was established in 1979 with a staff of eight people. It has grown so much in the last month that it now has a staff of 18. All these 18 members of the Government Information Unit are members of the Public Service. I invite honourable members to turn to page 38 of the Commonwealth Government Directory, where a special page is set aside for this peculiar organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is indisputably a part of the Public Service. As Senator Carrick said in the Senate a few days ago, these people work for the government of the day. That is, if there were a change of government, we, God bless us, would be left with Messrs Matthews and Hall. The cost of this Unit is now running at a level of half a million dollars a year. </PARA>

He might also explain who paid Mr Matthews's $4,000 bill when he was put up at the Windsor Hotel during the last Federal election campaign.

<PARA> To assist Ministers in their dealings with matters affecting the States concerned and to keep the Government in touch with public reaction to Government policies and programs. </PARA>
<PARA>That all seems innocuous enough until we realise the true purpose of this totally sinister organisation. In fact, the Unit exists for two main reasons. Firstly, it exists to manage the news and to ensure that only the government line is reported. This is achieved by ensuring that Ministers are inaccessible to the Press and also by ensuring that all Government statements are released through the Unit, as far as possible, in such a way as to circumvent the Press Gallery. The Unit is about to embark on a program of distributing carefully prepared tapes for use by the electronic media. There will be no chance to question. One will have the opportunity simply to play these carefully sanitised Government opinions. This is only the beginning. Unless someone takes a stand-it is a stand which will have to be taken by the Press-the freedom of the Press is at risk from these news managers as they attempt to eliminate altogether the need for journalists and reporters. </PARA>
<PARA> The second main function of the unit is to service the Liberal Party. Indeed, the Liberal Party secretariat clearly considers that the Unit is its own. During the last Federal election campaign the Unit played an indispensible role in the running of the Liberal Party campaign. The involvement of the Unit was carefully planned from the earliest stage of the Liberal Party's campaign. I refer honourable members to a document entitled: 'Campaign HQ: Agenda' which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Herewith the agenda for the meeting on Thursday morning to discuss the structure and operations of the campaign headquarters. </PARA>
<PARA>It is signed:</PARA>
<PARA> Jackie (for TE)</PARA>
<PARA>There are no prizes for guessing who T.E. might be. From this agenda paper it is perfectly clear that the Government Information Unit and its operations were discussed at the campaign meeting. In item 5 of the agenda for this meeting under the heading 'Operations', amongst a whole list of other organisations with whom the Party has dealings-quite properly, in most instances-we find the words: 'Liaison with Government Information Unit'. Further, the Federal secretariat is given the task of liaising with the Government Information Unit. So from the very outset this Unit was expected to be involved in an intricate way with the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> On 26 and 27 June the Federal Liberal Party conducted a campaign seminar. When discussing the question of the co-ordination of ministerial visits the following paragraph appears:</PARA>
<PARA> On arrival in the State, their first port of call-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Ministers-</PARA>
<PARA>should be the office of the Minister to whom the State Co-ordinator Officer is attached, for a briefing on the local campaign climate. </PARA>
<PARA>That means that when a Minister arrived in a State he would repair directly to the office where the State representative of the Government Information Unit was housed to get a briefing on the political climate which existed in that State. Further, we have an indication of a discussion which took place concerning what should happen in relation to the itinerary of the Prime Minister. When detailing the action which is to be taken during the Prime Minister's visit to a State, the document reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Consult with State director--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the State director of the Liberal Party-</PARA>
<PARA>and State co-ordination officer to obtain input for initial 'political climate' report for the PM and the Federal campaign director. </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> On the eve of the PM's visit the State director--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the State Director of the Liberal Party-</PARA>
<PARA>should liaise with the State co-ordination officer--</PARA>
<PARA>That is of the Government Information Unit-</PARA>
<PARA>about the filing of a 'political' climate update. (This should reach the Prime Minister and the Federal Director no later than 24 hours prior to the start of the visit.)</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, what we see here is that the Unit is to provide a briefing or report on the local political climate as it exists in each State. Obviously this is a highly political task, so political in fact that the local director of the Liberal Party has to be involved in its compilation. When that report is prepared it is sent not simply to the Prime Minister but to the Federal Director of the Liberal Party. This is a scandalous abuse of the Public Service. This sort of task is a task for the political parties to carry out. It is not a task for public servants to carry out. Even if it were it certainly is not something which should be made available to the Liberal Party. But I think what has happened is that the Government Information Unit has recognised that its true master is, in fact, Mr Eggleton. </PARA>
<PARA> On 25 August a monitoring meeting was held. The participants at that meeting included the following: Tony Eggleton, Martin Rawlinson, Bob Baudino, Grahame Morris, Eddie Dean, Dale Budd, Vincent Matthews and Jim Hall. Vincent Matthews is the head of the Government Information Unit and Jim Hall is the media secretary. Also included at that meeting were David Barnett, Alister Drysdale, Jon Gaul and Sue Grant. All of those people, with the exception of Vincent Matthews and Jim Hall, were either officials of the Liberal Party of Australia, officers of the Prime Minister's office or consultants to the Liberal Party of Australia. What on earth were Vincent Matthews and Jim Hall doing at that meeting of the Federal Secretariat on Monday 25 August, involved in a campaign meeting to discuss the question of monitoring during the election campaign? We realise that their monitoring activities during the campaign were to be totally indispensible to the Liberal Party during that campaign. In fact, included under the item 'Operations' for this monitoring activity were the Government Information Unit and the national campaign headquarters of the Liberal Party of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What were the monitoring priorities to be pursued by these people involved in monitoring? Firstly, they were to monitor in the following order: Hayden, Hawke, Wran, shadow Ministers, advertising-theirs and ours-all local media, talkback radio, Press conferences, interviews et cetera and other activities. As a result of their monitoring they had to file a report to the Federal Secretariat on what they had discovered. This monitoring was to be done by, amongst others, the national campaign headquarters and the Government Information Unit. The reports of these monitoring activities clearly are of such a blatant political kind that it could only be done by those people who had an absolute preoccupation with and a vested interest in a Liberal Party victory. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicate that on 12 September there was another meeting which again indicated that the prime body involved in monitoring during the campaign would be the Government Information Unit. Following a strategy meeting on 25 September a document was produced indicating what follow-up action was required. Under the heading 'Dale Budd', who at that time was in the Prime Minister's office, we find the following instruction:</PARA>
<PARA> Follow up request made by Vincent Matthews as to whether the Party can assist Laurie Power. </PARA>
<PARA>It will come as no surprise to honourable members that Laurie Power is the person who operates for the Government Information Unit in Sydney out of the office of Senator Carrick. The Minister is reported as saying that this same Laurie Power is involved only in government information dissemination and is not involved in any party political activities. If he is not involved in any party political activities why on earth would he need the assistance of the Liberal Party to pursue his functions? Clearly, this man, who is now a Liberal Party candidate in New South Wales, had a vested interest in using his position within the Government Information Unit to secure a Liberal victory. During strategy meetings held on 26 and 28 September several other references were made to the Government Information Unit. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to deal now with the meeting on 30 September. Again there is the question of the follow-up action required. We find, under the heading 'Monitoring', the following:</PARA>
<PARA> Eddie--</PARA>
<PARA>They use these quaint terms of familiarity amongst themselves at R. G. Menzies House-</PARA>
<PARA>to ask SCOs--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the people in the States working for the GIU-</PARA>
<PARA>to report daily on placement of press ads. </PARA>
<PARA>What on earth is Eddie doing there anyway? Eddie is a consultant to the Liberal Party. What has Eddie Dean got to do with asking a public servant to do anything, let alone report to him on the placement of Liberal Party campaign advertisements in the newspapers in the States? Eddie Dean has no right to ask any public servant to do anything, but he did. Because the Liberal Party sees the Government Information Unit simply as an extension of its organisation, that was an unexceptional task for it to ask the Unit to do. This is a half a million dollar a year dirty tricks office for the Liberal Party, paid for by the taxpayer. Matthews and Hall are the E. Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy of this administration and they are carefully controlled by the John Mitchell of Australian politics, the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch). This intricate organisation reaches its tentacles into every State in the Commonwealth and has attempted many times to sabotage the activities of the free Press. I take this opportunity to absolve the National Country Party because either it was not prepared to grubby its hands in this activity or, more likely, it was too stupid to avail itself of this rort which is exclusively the preserve of the Liberal Party. What has been exposed today is a scandal of massive proportions. The Government Information Unit is a threat to democracy and a threat to the free Press. </PARA>

I will return to those three points. I want people to understand that they are the only points on which the honourable member bases his argument. If they are the only points that are made, then a lot of the other things that he tried to prove do not follow. I will demonstrate that in my remarks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point which upsets some members of the Opposition was a direct aim of the last Labor Government when it established the Australian Government Liaison Service. Providing access to government information was a function of that Service. This Government agrees with that function. In order to be able to carry out that responsibility, which we accept, firstly, we have made provision for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and certain Ministers to have Press officers. The Prime Minister has three. Four Ministers have Press officers. Secondly, we have established a Government Information Unit. The task of the Unit is to provide information about government activities, programs, policies and objectives. It also helps Ministers in their contact with the media and keeps them informed on issues that are arising in the States. That represents an information service for the Government. It represents a Press secretary service for Ministers. At the moment the Unit consists of two journalists who are based in Canberra and one journalist based in each capital city-a total of eight. All the journalists are members of the Australian Journalists Association. The Government has a responsibility to keep the nation informed and that is what it is doing. It intends to acquit that responsibility despite the sort of nonsense, inaccuracy and misrepresentation which we have just heard from people such as the previous speaker. I can assure all members of the House, including Opposition members, that we will continue to use the Government Information Unit to provide information and the facts about what the Government is doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This debate reflects a great deal of what has been happening in recent weeks. It all boils down to simple whinging by the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party was thrashed in the last Federal election. It tried to dispute the verdict of the people by taking a spurious case to the High Court of Australia. The High Court, quite rightly, threw out the matter. There is a close link between the whinging in relation to the case which the Labor Party took to the courts and the protests we have heard today and over recent weeks about the establishment of the Government Information Unit. The Opposition is hell-bent on grossly misrepresenting the Government's intentions and motives and is definitely exaggerating and deliberately misrepresenting how the Government Information Unit works. What the Opposition is really about is attempting to destroy the Government Information Unit. That is the case for one reason and one reason only. It is desperately afraid that the Australian people will be kept informed on what this Government is doing and why it is doing it. The Government Information Unit has been eminently successful in fulfilling that function. The Labor Party has set out to destroy it because it is frightened of it. It is frightened that the Unit will continue successfully. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party is afraid that the steady flow of factual information about policies and decisions of this Government will make it all the more difficult for the ALP to mislead and misrepresent. Let me repeat to all members of the House: We make no apology for providing an information and Press service for the Government and the Ministers who require it. The Information Unit will continue to assist and advise Ministers. It will not simply put out Press statements and leave it at that, but will assist and advise Ministers on the basis of how best to communicate with the Australian people, make Ministers more accessible to the media by planning and arranging media coverage, assist journalists in their task of reporting the affairs of the Government, and make the Government more aware of issues in the States which are relevant to the Commonwealth. We all accept that in a Federal system it is essential that Government Ministers, who spend so much of their time in Canberra, should be kept fully informed of what is said and reported in the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I said a moment ago that the Labor Party had deliberately set out to mislead and misrepresent the Government to the people. To illustrate this point, there is no better example than that of the honourable member for Fremantle who, in the discussion today and on the radio broadcast this morning, sought to give the impression that members of the Government Information Unit were permanent public servants. That is a falsehood. They are not permanent public servants. They are employed on the same basis as the staff of Ministers and office holders. They are directly under the control of Ministers. Furthermore, they can be dismissed on a fortnight's notice. They are of the same political nature as Press officers, speech writers or ministerial officers employed by Government Ministers or Opposition members. They differ from other ministerial officers in one respect only. They have a responsibility to make their services available to all Ministers as they are required rather than being on the staff of one single Minister. As would be expected, they have a responsibility to maintain relations on a day to day basis with Ministers and with the States as appropriate. Naturally, during election campaigns they continue to service the Government as do speech writers and Press secretaries of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I have set out the position in respect of the Government Information Unit, its functions, and the composition of its staff. It is a modest, and therefore economical, approach to providing Press support for the Ministers of the Government. Its cost is not $500,000 plus, as the honourable member for Fremantle so glibly tried to tell us. This year the Unit's appropriation is about $388,000. Let us compare this staff with that of the Whitlam Government and that of other State Labor governments at the moment. In the last Federal Labor Government there was provision for 27 Press secretaries to the Prime Minister and Ministers. That is bad enough, compared with the modest arrangements that we have made but, in addition to that, the Labor Government established the Australian Government Liaison Service. The Service consisted of 13 journalists, two clerks, five clerical assistants, one assistant printer and two typists. To top all that, it also established the Department of the Media to which it appointed one of its socialist cronies, Mr Spigelman. The Labor Government appointed him as the permanent head of a department of state. Mr Spigelman presided over a massive propaganda organisation within the Department of the Media. That Department had a budget of $17m. My colleague, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron), will probably describe that in a little more detail. What the situation added up to was a permanent head appointed to preside over a department of state, a major function of which was to provide a vast propaganda machine which had a capacity to employ over 40 Press secretaries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. I think when the debate is examined the facts will become quite clear. We are used to that sort of performance from the honourable member for Fremantle. Let me illustrate how important it is for the people of Australia to be properly informed of this Government's policies and decisions. Much has been said by the Opposition about propaganda and misleading information. Let us just have a look at a thumb nail sketch of what propaganda and misleading information mean to the Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has a particularly enviable record when it comes to misleading information. On 5 October last year he said that under this Government's petrol pricing policy motorists would be paying 45 cents a litre for petrol by the middle of 1981. He also said at various times that Labor would provide cheaper petrol. All this, of course, is totally misleading. On 10 October he was reported as having said in Brisbane that more than half a million Australians would be without jobs by the New Year of 1981. That was misleading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a speech to Expo on 16 October the Leader of the Opposition said that the unemployment figure was likely to reach one million by 1981. On 6 October the Leader of the Opposition said on the Derryn Hinch Show in Melbourne that inflation would be 12 per cent or 13 per cent at the end of last year. He was wrong. That was misleading. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) made a similar prediction about inflation on 29 September. He said that it would reach 12 or 13 per cent by the end of 1980. That was misleading. It was wrong. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who has been managing to make a fool of himself by interjecting half the time, has made reckless statements about petrol prices-all of them misleading. Is it any wonder that this Government needs a government information unit that can give the people of Australia the facts so that it can counter the misleading information, the exaggerations, the inaccuracies that the Leader of the Opposition and the people who sit behind him make it a practice week by week, day by day, to churn out to the Australian people?</PARA>
<PARA> The point I am trying to make is how important it is that the Australian people should be provided with reliable, factual information. Ministers should have a service by which they can do that. That is the reason the Government established an information unit. The Government makes no apologies for it. It is an economical and efficient way of providing that Press service for its Ministers, for the Government. The people have the right to be informed, and the Government has a responsibility to keep the people informed. We will continue to use the Government Information Unit to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, as you indicated, some substantial charges have been made. The charges seem to have been overlooked by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) who is at the table. He stated in reply to the serious allegations that the responsibility of the Government Information Unit was to keep the nation informed with a steady flow of factual information. If that, in fact, was what the Unit was doing we would not be involved in this debate today. But that is not what the Unit is doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue in this debate is the use of the Government Information Unit and the State co-ordination officers as propaganda units of the Liberal Party. That use for blatant political purposes is a scandalous situation. The use of taxpayers' money in this way is contemptible and a disgraceful abuse of democratic process. To answer these charges, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) must categorically deny that the Government Information Unit and its State representatives carried out the following tasks during the 1980 election campaign. The areas in which they were, in fact, involved during that campaign were: The establishment of groups in each State to monitor radio and television broadcasts and newspaper reports; the circulation of digests of these reports to Ministers, ministerial staff and the federal directors of the Liberal and National Country Parties; liaison with local media for appearances by, and statements from, Ministers; preparation of audio tapes and Press statements for Ministers; marketing these tapes and statements to the media; meeting Ministers and the Prime Minister on their arrival at cities where these information unit officers are based; arranging transport for Ministers, ministerial staff and journalists covering the Liberal and National Country parties campaign; and performing other tasks as directed by either the Prime Minister or Mr Tony Eggleton. </PARA>
<PARA> Some information which came out very late today makes one wonder just where it is all going to end. In Melbourne the Victorian representative of the Government Information Unit prepared a weekly summary of political news items to members and candidates covering the whole of the metropolitan area. None of this information was provided to any members of parliament or candidates in that State other than to government members. The Minister makes great play of the steady flow of information. He also made the point that these people were not public servants. I refer the Minister to the statements made in the Senate by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Carrick, which show that that is not a view shared by the senator. In fact I suggest, on a matter of such significance as this, that the Government get its act together. The view expressed by the Minister is different from the view expressed in the Senate within the last couple of days. </PARA>
<PARA> I outline some specific examples of the way this Unit operated as a straight propaganda machine for the Liberal Party. The Minister kept saying that it had the responsibility to keep the nation informed. That is an entirely different matter from operating within the Liberal Party and under the direction of the Liberal Party machine. We are not talking about the Government; we are talking about the Liberal Party machine. The document issued by the Federal Secretariat of the Liberal Party on 17 June 1980 was headed 'Federal Campaign Headquarters-Structure and Operations'. But there is a further heading: 'Campaign Planning'. An item listed under this heading is 'Liaison with Government Information Unit'. It is proposed that the campaign headquarters of the Liberal Party take the deliberate step of setting up a direct link with the Government Information Unit, which is staffed, according to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick), by public servants paid by taxpayers. That is something that the Minister has not agreed with today. It is about time that he got his facts clear on that. I suggest that he again check what Senator Carrick has already said on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Unit to be part of the Liberal Party campaign machine is a deliberate plundering of the people's purse for party political purposes. The Unit was taking directions from the Liberal Party headquarters. I also point out that the Liberal Party held a campaign seminar on 26 and 27 June 1980. The details of that seminar were predictably dull and were directed not to benefit Australia but simply to keep the snouts of the members of the Liberal Party in the trough. I suggest that it is probably more relevant in this context to say that they are keeping their fingers in the public purse because that was, in fact, what was going on. However, one item listed for discussion-I refer to item 19 which is headed 'Kinds of Engagement'-contains a devastating indictment of the Liberal Party. Under this heading, advice was given to travelling Ministers during the campaign. Such advice was that, on arrival in a State, their first port of call should be to the office of the Minister to whom the State co-ordinating officer was attached, for a briefing on the local campaign climate. If the Minister was talking seriously about a factual flow of information to the nation, would it not have been handy for shadow Ministers of the Labor Party to have been in the position when travelling of having only to call in and be briefed on the local campaign climate. Of course, that advice was not available to anybody except Government Ministers, who at that stage were members of the Liberal Party. This unit was being controlled from the Liberal Party headquarters. </PARA>

We have a situation in which these Ministers would arrive in a capital city and go along for a briefing from a government information unit on the local campaign climate.

<PARA> A further item at the seminar was that, on the eve of the Prime Minister's visit, the State director of the Liberal Party should liaise with the State co-ordination officer of the Government Information Unit about the filing of a political climate report for the Prime Minister and the Federal campaign director of the Liberal Party. Obviously both the Prime Minister and the Federal campaign director needed all the help they could get, but not at the taxpayers' expense. That is what happened. This Government appears to have forgotten that it has been appointed and not anointed. It will learn that the people of Australia will not, and should not, tolerate public servants being used as part of the Liberal Party machine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The final sentence of the speech of the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) underlines the different interpretation which has been placed on this subject and on the facts relating to it by the Opposition, whose members keep claiming that these people on the staff of the Government Information Unit are permanent public servants. The fact is that they can be dismissed with two weeks' notice. That is not permanency in the Public Service. Their position can be likened to those of Mr Alan Ramsey, the Press Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and Mr Nagle, who is another of the Opposition's Press secretaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is appropriate to turn back the hands of time to 1975 and beyond, when the present Opposition was in government, and to recall the order of the day that existed then. The concept of government public relations was first established in 1955 by the Menzies Government. It stayed almost in the same style until two or three days after the Whitlam Government took over in 1972. It was then subjected to vast change. In June 1973, it was further changed and enlarged. This happened again in November 1973 and February 1975. The Labor Government of those days allowed every Minister to have a Press secretary. It also enlarged the Australian Government Liaison Service with several staff to supplement and to work hand-in-hand with the Ministers' Press secretaries and with the Ministers and the Government of the day. There is absolutely no difference. Members of the present Government know what it was like. We know of the frustration felt by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) in having a body which does not exactly work in one's favour. We have been through it too. </PARA>
<PARA> He is a little like the young man who just found out that his mother and father had to get together at some stage to create him; it has all come as a shock to him. The honourable member stands in this place pretending that such a unit never existed. This type of set-up was truly the creation of the Labor Government. However, the Government of this day has pruned it dramatically. There are only four Press secretaries serving the Ministry, outside of the three Press secretaries who serve the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). There is a total of seven Press secretaries to the entire Liberal National Ministry. There were 27 Press secretaries to the Labor Ministry. The Government Information Unit comprises two journalists in Canberra and one in each capital city. If we add those to the number serving the Ministers, we have a figure of 15 journalists serving this Government compared to 27 journalists serving the Labor Government, as well as the Australian Government Liaison Service, which was a creation of the former Whitlam Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I will read to the House the role of the Australian Government Liaison Service to underline the total distortion which has been brought to this subject by the honourable member for Fremantle, and which was supported by the honourable member for Holt. I read the description of the Australian Government Liaison Service, established on 10 February 1975. This document states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Liaison Service was designed to assist the distribution of national government information-</PARA>
<PARA>It is just the same as the situation now-</PARA>
<PARA>from both the executive and administration-</PARA>
<PARA>'The executive' meaning the Ministry; there is no escaping that-</PARA>
<PARA>and to determine gaps in information services by a feed-back to government of the information needs of the community at a regional, State and national level. Target groups-</PARA>
<PARA>These are the target groups singled out for the Opposition's political arm to work at-</PARA>
<PARA>include radio-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the same area covered by the Government Information Unit-</PARA>
<PARA>TV and print media without direct representation in Canberra; State and local government; social welfare groups; community groups; ethnic groups; business organisations and individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>The description then deals with the staffing establishment. There were two A grade journalists and a B grade journalist in Canberra as well as two typists. In each State office there was an A grade journalist and a clerical assistant. The Digest Office, which worked in conjunction with the Service, had a class A1 journalist, an A grade journalist, clerks and clerical assistants. The Ministerial Documents Reproduction unit had journalists, an assistant printer and more clerical assistants. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9F4">Mr DONALD CAMERON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Fremantle made claims to the media that the service was costing a half a million dollars. Let us do a little arithmetic about just the 27 journalists who were on the payroll of Labor Ministers. If we multiply the number of journalists by $23,000-this is for ordinary time and does not include overtime-we arrive at an amount of $621,000. We all have memories of that in this place. After the Labor Government was defeated those journalists left here and bought car yards and restaurants because they were all part of the grab. I say to the honourable member for Fremantle: Do not come in here again and talk about gross expenditure which this Government has indulged in. It is a mere pittance in comparison to the expenditure of the Labor Government. Current expenditure is half the expenditure that the Labor Government spent on the basic salaries of journalists alone six years ago. That, considering the inflation which this country has experienced in the last few years, speaks for itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regard the matter of public importance which has been brought before the House today as an exercise in sheer humbug by the Opposition. The honourable member for Fremantle has set about trying to grab a headline. It was interesting to note that only the Australian Broadcasting Commission ran his story on air this morning and that the newspapers were disinclined to pick it up. No doubt the honourable member for Fremantle has been out there today whipping it along in the hope that it will become a big feature and that the credibility of this Government will be put in doubt in the minds of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government makes no apology for the creation of the Government Information Unit. It is there to assist Ministers and to assist the Government. There is no pretension on the part of the Government that it is anything else. The honourable member for Fremantle has used sinister means to try to create an impression in the eyes of the public that something untoward is going on. All that we have done in learning from the experience of the Labor years in office has been to look at the operation that the Labor Government established. We did not moan and groan about it in the same way as honourable members opposite are moaning and groaning about it today and--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Dawkins" NAMEID="9E4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9F4">Mr DONALD CAMERON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So the honourable member for Fremantle admits that it existed. I have been waiting for such an admission. Even though the honourable member for Fremantle was packing his bags, he knew what his own party was doing. Yet he has had the audacity to come into this place and criticise an organisation which has been pruned and which is costing the taxpayer about one-fifth of what it cost previously. I assure the House that the Government information service that the Labor Government established-the Australian Government Liaison Service-served the Labor Party and the Labor Party alone in exactly the same way. I might have been sent copies of Press releases at that time so that I knew what was going on but could not go along to the service in Brisbane and say: 'Help me combat the government of the day'. That was just not on. In a nutshell, this has been a time-wasting exercise by the Opposition. I hope that the members of the media who have run with the bait which has been given to them by the honourable member for Fremantle and others will recognise the matter for what it is and put it on the back page where it certainly belongs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Planning and Implementation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> (a) Obtain maximum political value in the time available . . . keeping in mind the Senate as well as the House of Representatives</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Communicate with as large an audience as possible: a national as well as a local audience</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Engagements should be assessed for media potential There should be very good and politically justifiable reasons before recommending any engagement that cannot be maximised through the mass media</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Avoid over-loading the itinerary Importance of 'think' time and opportunity to deal with government business</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The PM's itinerary is the cutting edge of the campaign and deserves all the honing it can get The visit should be supervised personally by the State director, and final responsibility should not be delegated down-the-line</PARA>
<PARA>(2) Nature of engagements (a) With all engagements, there should be an eye to reaching the wider audience through media coverage</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The PM would expect to address at least one major rally/public meeting in each capital</PARA>
<PARA> (e) There is often scope for visits to local institutions and clubs</PARA>
<PARA> (f) There may also be local projects and developments with which the PM can usefully be associated</PARA>
<PARA> (g) Divisions should be alert to opportunities for associating the PM with ethnic communities and young people</PARA>
<PARA> (h) The PM does not favour time-consuming 'whistle stops' through electorates</PARA>
<PARA> (i) 'Walkabouts' should be impromptu rather than being planned as specific campaign engagements (and there should not be advance publicity)-(Attachment 'C')</PARA>
<PARA> (j) Except in special circumstances, factory visits should have a low priority PM is not very interested in just walking rapidly through a factory</PARA>
<PARA> He would want a chance to join the workers (not the executives!) in their canteen, and to address them</PARA>
<PARA> (n) At public meetings, the number of other speakers should be kept to an acceptable minimum The PM should be followed only by a short vote of thanks (where appropriate)</PARA>
<PARA> Note: In planning the most effective program for the PM, it is worth keeping in mind that-apart from getting best value for the PM, the campaign and the Party-the media are quick to criticise if they can point to sloppy campaign planning and politically irrelevant engagements. </PARA>
<PARA>(3) Planning the Visit (a) Early consultation with the federal director</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Proposals to be discussed by State Strategy Committee as appropriate, but not raised with candidates and electorates (danger or raising expectations)</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Proposed program to be submitted to the Federal Director in writing</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Detailed planning for the program not to be activated until Federal Director or PM's private office confirm PM's acceptance of the proposal</PARA>
<PARA> (g) The Federal Campaign Director and the PM's private office require advance details in writing, covering: Nature of the function</PARA>

<PARA> Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA> Canberra, A.C.T. 2600</PARA>

<PARA> The 'advance man' will:</PARA>
<PARA> discuss the detailed planning</PARA>
<PARA> make contact with the local media, with an eye to maximising PM's coverage, particularly on TV and radio</PARA>
<PARA> consult with State Director and State Co-ordinator Officer to obtain input for an initial 'political climate' report for the PM and federal campaign director</PARA>
<PARA> (b) On the eve of the PM's visit, the State Director should liaise with the State Co-ordination Officer about the filing of a 'political climate' update (this should reach the PM and Federal Director no later than 24 hours prior to the start of the visit)</PARA>
<PARA> (c) In all centres visited, the Prime Minister and his staff will require temporary offices This will normally be organised by the PM's office and the federal campaign team, but the division may be looked to for some assistance</PARA>

<PARA>Campaign Seminar 26-27 June, 1980</PARA>
<PARA>MINISTERIAL CO-ORDINATION</PARA>
<PARA>Approach</PARA>
<PARA> 1. During the campaign proper Ministers will be asked by the Prime Minister to undertake one of the following roles-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Travelling Ministers: Ministers who take part in a co-ordinated programme of visits around the country. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) State Spokesman: Ministers who will act as Senior Government Spokesmen in their State throughout the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) State Specialists: Ministers who will undertake general campaign activities within their States. </PARA>
<PARA>Travelling Ministers</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The aim with each Travelling Minister is to design an itinerary which maximises publicity for the Government both nationally and in each State he visits. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. This should be done keeping in mind:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the need to use Ministers to the best possible advantage during the campaign;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the wishes of both the Ministers themselves and the State Divisions;</PARA>
<PARA> 4. In consultation with Ministers' offices and the Divisions, the National Co-ordinator will draw up a program for each Travelling Minister 'allocating' him to particular States on particular days. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. In preparing the program, the following guidelines will be kept in mind:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Travelling Ministers should not be in a State at the same time as the Prime Minister. (Activities by other Ministers are less likely to receive coverage if the Prime Minister is also in town.)</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Otherwise, at least one Travelling Minister should be in each State on each day of the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Desirably, each Travelling Minister should visit each State. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Visits should be of two days duration to maximise impact. </PARA>
<PARA> (e) Adequate time must be allowed for each Minister to spend in his own electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Once the overall program is finalised, the detailed planning of itineraries in each State will be the responsibility of the State Director. State Directors may wish to delegate the task to a Senior Officeholder or staff member, but they should retain overall responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. The co-ordinated program for Travelling Ministers will commence on the day following the Campaign Launch and will conclude on the Wednesday prior to polling day, allowing them to spend the last days of the campaign in their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA>State Spokesmen</PARA>
<PARA> 9. The primary role of State Spokesmen is to generate favourable media coverage for the Government in their State. To do this they should be available to the media at all times. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. State Divisions may wish to ask State Spokesmen to undertake a campaign program within their home States, but this should not impinge upon their primary campaign responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. In normal circumstances State Spokesmen would not accept engagements outside their home States. Where they do so, arrangements should be made with another Minister to assume their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. It is suggested that State Spokesmen be co-opted to State Strategy/Campaign Committees. </PARA>
<PARA>State Specialists</PARA>
<PARA> 13. State Specialists would be available to undertake general campaign activities within their State. </PARA>
<PARA> (a) Maximising the Senate vote. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Assisting local candidates. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Working closely with the Party Organisation at electorate level. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. In some cases, there may be scope for these Ministers to undertake engagements outside their home States. </PARA>
<PARA>Kinds of Engagements</PARA>
<PARA> 16. Ministers are a scarce 'campaign resource' and all activities they undertake during the campaign should be designed to get the most possible mileage. </PARA>
<PARA> 17. The principle aim of all Ministerial engagements should be to obtain favourable media coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> 18. Other engagements should only be undertaken if there is a definite objective in mind-for example meeting key businessmen, civic leaders and other opinion formers, speaking at a 'closed' fund-riasing function, et cetera. (Normally, fund-raising activities in electorates would be expected to generate coverage, at least in the local Press.)</PARA>
<PARA> 19. Because of the special importance of Travelling Ministers to the overall campaign, the following guidelines are suggested for planning their itineraries:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) On arrival in a State, their first port of call should be the office of the Minister to whom the State Co-ordinator Officer is attached, for a briefing on the local campaign climate. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) State Directors should also contact them to brief them on any special campaign matters, and to finalise last minute details of their itineraries. </PARA>
<PARA> (e) Wherever possible, opportunities should be taken to get Travelling Ministers on radio talk-back shows. </PARA>
<PARA> (f) There is often scope for Ministers to take advantage of forums such as major Chambers of Commerce, Conventions et cetera during the campaign. State Divisions should be alert to opportunities to 'orchestrate' suitable invitations. </PARA>
<PARA> 20. Where Travelling Minsters visit local electorates, close liaison is needed with candidates and campaign managers. </PARA>
<PARA> (a) Past experience has shown that it is not satisfactory to leave arrangements solely to those in the electorate. Against this background it is essential that detailed itineraries be provided well in advance (preferably before the campaign commences) and be cleared by both the State Division and the Travelling Minister concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Suggested engagements could include:</PARA>
<PARA> public meetings;</PARA>
<PARA> meetings with key special interest groups, civic leaders et cetera;</PARA>
<PARA> visits to local institutions, clubs and factories;</PARA>
<PARA> shopping centre walks;</PARA>
<PARA> calls on local newspaper editors;</PARA>
<PARA> in country electorates, local TV and radio interviews, talk-back shows et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> fund-raising dinners/bar-b-ques et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> large meetings of Service Clubs, Chambers of Commerce et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) All electorate activities should involve the local candidate and, where possible, Senate candidates as well. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Coverage in the local Press, and if appropriate the major dailies and television, should actively be sought. </PARA>
<PARA> (e) Use the time of Travelling Ministers frugally. Generally speaking, activities such as attending small gatherings of 'Party faithful' or Branch meetings, purely social functions and doorknocking (!!) do not require the time of a Travelling Minister . . . and can be left to others to handle. </PARA>
<PARA> 21. Similar guidelines to those contained in Paragraph 20 should also apply to the kinds of activities undertaken by State Spokesmen and State Specialists. </PARA>
<PARA>TO: JACK HAMMOND</PARA>
<PARA> Attached is brief for you on Hinch show and brief on ethnic media was already sent to you to Martin Place office on Tuesday afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe Hinch should be taken head-on otherwise he will win what he is billing as 'the battle of the year'. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty is that Hinch has the assistance of Jill Nankerville and Barber (both sit in an outside studio and have direct acces to Hinch via earphones). Paul Barber tends to feed question and follow up points to Hinch. I would suggest that someone remains outside and talks and disturbs both Nankerville and Barber. I found this worked well with both Newman and Howard interviews. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is concerned with one of the ways in which the registered proprietor of a trade mark can protect his rights. In particular, it relates to section 103 of the Trade Marks Act 1955 which, in some circumstances, prohibits the import into Australia of goods bearing a registered trade mark. The Government, through the operation of the Trade Marks Office, is committed to the promotion of orderly development of trade, industry and commerce by the protection of trade marks, whether they be for goods or services. This Bill seeks to give effect to that commitment in the area of importing of goods bearing a registered trade mark. </PARA>
<PARA> A trade mark indicates that goods or services bearing the mark come from a particular trade source. It is a kind of property, able to be bought and sold. It is part of the family of intellectual property which also includes patents, industrial designs and copyright. Since a trade mark is a kind of property, it carries a principal feature of property, the right to exclude others from using it. </PARA>
<PARA> This right to exclude others may be enforced in different ways. First, there is the common law remedy known as 'passing-off'. In appropriate circumstances the courts will protect a trader who has built up a reputation in a trade mark, usually by long, extensive, continuous and exclusive use. The basic idea behind this is to protect the public against deception. However, the 'passing-off' remedy is cumbersome and expensive, since the trader has to prove his reputation by calling witnesses into court. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Barry Jones" NAMEID="KH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr Barry Jones</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You mean a remedy against 'passing-off'.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS7">Mr THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, a remedy against 'passing-off'. Therefore provisions were included in the trade mark legislation to solve this problem. The Trade Marks Act provides quick proof and quick machinery for enforcing trade mark rights through a system of trade mark registration. A trader may apply to the Registrar of Trade Marks for registration. If the Registrar considers the trade mark is one which the Act says he can or must register he will accept the mark. The trade mark will be placed on the register after the public has been given the opportunity to object. The registered trade mark can then be protected by an infringement action for which production of the registration certificate is sufficient proof of ownership of the trade mark. The remedy of infringement proceedings under the Trade Marks Act is the second way a trade mark owner can protect his rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A third protective remedy is section 103 of the Act. This allows for the prohibition, under some circumstances, of imported goods manufactured outside Australia which bear a trade mark registered in Australia. The registered proprietor or registered user of the trade mark can notify Customs that he objects to goods bearing the mark being imported. This objection enables Customs to seize such goods. It is not hard, for example, to see the value of this remedy where pirate goods bear forged or falsely applied trade marks. Section 103 effectively protects the proprietor or registered user against encroachment on his rights by unscrupulous overseas manufacturers. However, the use of section 103 to prevent the import of genuinely marked goods has caused concern. This includes cases where the trade mark was applied overseas by the same company which is the registered proprietor in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Many object to this use of the section, saying it goes too far beyond the ideas behind protecting trade marks and abuses the purpose behind protecting trade marks by registration. The use of section 103 in relation to the importation of goods was therefore referred to the Industrial Property Advisory Committee for review. That Committee's recommendations have generally been accepted by the Government. This Bill is designed to amend section 103 to implement the report. The Committee's key recommendation is that the provisions for seizure and forfeiture of goods under section 103 should be confined to those cases where importation infringes a registered trade mark. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 103 will no longer be available to prevent the import of goods bearing a genuine trade mark applied overseas by the Australian registered proprietor. It would still protect against pirate goods, provided that the import of those goods constituted an infringement of the registered trade mark. This brings section 103 into line with the philosophy of the rest of the Trade Marks Act, providing a convenient and effective means of enforcing the same civil rights protectable under infringement proceedings. Section103 will therefore apply only in situations where the trader's reputation might suffer and where the public might be deceived. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives effect to the Committee's recommendation that the mechanism of notifying Customs be retained. Section 103 is available to any registered proprietor of a trade mark registered in Australia, and also to registered users. Procedures laid down are consistent with tying section 103 to the test of infringement. This Bill ensures the rights of the registered proprietor and the consuming public are adequately protected against the import of goods infringing trade marks. At the same time the Bill eliminates undesirable practices which have grown up under the current provisions. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Government to implement important elements of a new policy for industrial research and development grants. It will also allow another five-year program for industrial research and development incentives. The Bill is part of the Government's response to the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia which was announced in the House on 18 September 1980. Our general objective is to make the Australian manufacturing sector more export oriented and more competitive against imports. A major factor in achieving this objective will be the success of the Government's general economic policy. As well, the Government's general industry policy approach has two broad strands: Firstly, to give encouragement to activities which are efficient, internationally competitive and export oriented by such measures as export, innovation and investment incentives; and secondly, to achieve, in the long term, an industry structure requiring minimum levels of government support. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing Act, which expires on 30 June this year, was introduced in 1976 and provides for funding commencement and project grants as well as projects of industrial research considered to be in the public interest. This Government believes it is vital to encourage industrial research and development. Funding has risen from $14 in 1977-78 to $54m in 1980-81-nearly a four-fold rise within three years-despite the need for continuing expenditure restraints. Under the new program, commencement and project grants and public interest projects are to continue for a further five years. However they are to be brought more into line with the other aims of the Government industrial development policy. Project grants will remain the main focus of the new program. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Government has been urged to stimulate industrial research and development by a number of expert committees including the Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia, and the Australian Science and Technology Council. Their advice was taken into consideration in developing the program which I am about to announce. Basically the Government has decided to become more selective in providing assistance. The rationale for government assistance rests on the proposition that there are disparities between the private and national returns from research and development expenditure. The market does not provide enough incentives for firms to undertake research and development. The result is a national under-investment in industrial research and development and a tendency for firms to concentrate on relatively short-term industrial research and development. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS7">Mr THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the honourable member for Lalor agrees. The fundamental purpose of the program is to correct this market failure. Against this background, the Government has decided that, in future, an industrial research and development project will be supported only where it involves a substantial degree of risk or where a firm is unable to gain enough of the profits generated from the industrial research and development to justify the project. The Government has also decided that policy measures should be cost effective, be designed to improve rather than impede the operations of the market and that objectives should be spelled out clearly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill proposes that regulations be promulgated to ensure that project grant applications are ranked according to their potential contribution to industry policy objectives. However, for practical timing and flexibility reasons, I propose that initially these guidelines be issued to the Board as directions under section 19 of the principal Act. Firms will be required to maintain a sizable financial stake in subsidised industrial research and development to ensure their motivation for success is not diminished. To compensate for inflation as well as to strengthen the incentive to firms to undertake the industrial research and development, the Government proposes to increase ceilings from $500,000 to $750,000 per year for project grants and from $25,000 to $40,000 per year for commencement grants. The grants will remain taxable. For ongoing commencement grants the rate for the following year will be announced on 31 March and will not exceed 50 per cent. The project grant rate shall not exceed 50 per cent without ministerial approval. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes provision for the inclusion of industrial research and development related to and carried out at the site of a building and is retrospective to 1 July 1980. I am sure the building industry will be very pleased with this announcement. Eligibility does not extend to more general operations in the industry such as works. The Bill also allows computer software research and development to be eligible for project grant assistance under the Act, but only when it is relevant to the objectives of the Act. It must relate directly to new products of, and new or improved processes employed in manufacturing, mining or eligible on-site building or construction activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's intention is to encourage the application of new or innovative software techniques to the development of such products or processes. However, where computer software research and development has been eligible under the commencement grant scheme, this eligibility will be retained after 1 July 1981. In accordance with CITCA recommendations and with Government decisions on that report, the Bill includes a section on the Board's powers and functions. In broad terms, these are: To authorise the payment of industrial research and development commencement grants to eligible companies; to enter into agreements for projects of industrial research and development carried out or proposed to be carried out by eligible companies; and to enter into contracts for projects of industrial research in a field of science and technology where, as Minister, I consider this to be in the public interest. The Board will be restructured and chaired by someone outside the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains provisions to enable the Board to obtain specialised advice in technical and commercial areas. As Minister, I shall obtain advice on the selection of public interest projects by a re-constituted IR &amp; D Incentives Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee shall take into account certain guidelines. The project must, firstly, be of high priority in terms of Government policy objectives; secondly, have substantial social and economic benefit for the community; thirdly, normally involve the commercial development of public sector or non-profit research institutions; and, fourthly, be of major importance and likely to command widespread public support. As well, the guidelines will specify that funding should be for industrial research and development and not be in the place of other funding sources. </PARA>
<PARA> Ownership of the results of public interest projects will be vested in the Commonwealth Government, with commercially viable prospects being exploited on normal business terms. In future the Board's annual report will include statements giving the names of companies with which the Board has made arrangements, the progress of their projects, and payments made to them. Directions from the Minister to the Board will also be included. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill repeals the Industrial Research and Development Grants Act 1967. The Government will be monitoring the operation of the new scheme, to evaluate its effectiveness against the principles which I have just outlined, prior to the Act's expiry in 1986. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to provide Commonwealth loan guarantees to Ansett Transport Industries Ltd and an unnamed subsidiary up to a limit of $US490m. The guarantees will enable Ansett to conclude purchase arrangements for 21 new Boeing aircraft, which will be programmed for delivery between June 1981 and late 1985. The 12 Boeing 737 series aircraft to be purchased are old technology, noisy aircraft which will exacerbate noise pollution problems at Mascot airport. The Government's approval of the import of these aircraft strikes out the major recommendation of the Government's Major Airport Needs of Sydney Committee-that new technology, quiet, wide-bodied aircraft should be introduced during the 1980s to replace smaller and noisier aircraft currently in use. The provision of Australian Government guarantees to Ansett and Trans-Australia Airlines in respect of loans raised abroad to purchase new passenger aircraft is a basic feature of the two-airline policy. Similar guarantees have been provided to Ansett Transport Industries Ltd on 21 previous occasions since 1966-67, and on one occasion to Trans-Australia Airlines, last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As at 31 December 1980, the Commonwealth's contingent liability in respect of overseas Ansett loans stood at $US57.2m and in respect of TAA at $US34m. Traditionally, Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bills have not been objected to by the Opposition. However, in view of the grave and exceptional circumstances that are associated with this Bill, at a later stage I will move that consideration of it be postponed. </PARA>
<PARA> Before dealing with the Bill I propose to comment on some of the statements that have been made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) in his second reading speech. The Minister re- affirmed that the Government had decided to transform Trans-Australia Airlines into a public company. There is no doubt that the Government intends to sell all or part of TAA to its wealthy friends and stock exchange speculators. TAA has been an innovative and successful public enterprise. Its sale would rob the 90 per cent of Australians who do not hold shares in public companies of their ownership of this famous airline, of this valuable national asset which is a symbol of national public enterprise achievement and of national spirit. Its sale to private enterprise would constitute misappropriation of public property and would be resisted at every opportunity by the Australian Labor Party. My Leader and my colleagues will respond later in the debate in more detail to this aspect of the Minister's comments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also referred to the Government's decision to establish an independent fare tribunal. The use of a tribunal to process publicly applications for air fare increases has been Australian Labor Party policy at the last two elections, and we welcome this step in the direction of our policy. If the tribunal is to be truly independent and not just an acquiescent appendage of the Department of Transport, as is the so-called independent Office of Road Safety, and if the tribunal conducts public hearings on fare increase applications, it will receive the full backing of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister used his second reading speech as a subterfuge to announce that an inquiry was to be conducted, at some time between now and 1986, into the desirability of the deregulation of the airline industry in the long term. By making the announcement late in the evening he hoped to prevent parliamentary response on a matter which ought properly to have been the subject of a separate statement to the Parliament. It is now evident, that, following a threatened rebellion in the Government caucus against this Bill last Thursday, a deal was concluded to establish an inquiry into airline deregulation if the rebels would support this measure. The hapless, embattled Minister for Transport told the Government caucus that the Bill concerned the purchase of one aircraft only. Subsequently he had to be advised that the purchase of 21 aircraft was involved. The rebels were jubilant when the inquiry was announced. However, the indications are that their victory was a hollow one; that they have been fooled again by the Government. The inquiry, in the form outlined, was a sop to those gullible back bench rebels. The Minister, in announcing it last Thursday evening, could not tell the House who would conduct it, where it would be held, when it would be held, what its terms of reference might be or even when it might be commenced. But he seemed fairly confident that it would report by 1986-if by some mischance this incompetent Government were returned at the next elections. </PARA>
<PARA> The servile attitude of the Government to the proprietors of Ansett was again shown by the Minister for Transport in announcing the inquiry. He told the House that he was confident that TAA and Ansett would co-operate, despite the almost unlimited legislative powers that he has to require both airlines to supply all relevant financial and operational information. It will be recalled that he made a similar statement when the Holcroft inquiry was announced. The record shows that his confidence on that occasion was misplaced. Ansett did not co-operate or make a substantive submission to that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make clear the position of the Opposition on the deregulation inquiry. If it is to be a public inquiry, if it is to receive the full support of, and access to, the resources of the Department of Transport, if its task is to be completed within a reasonable period, say one year, and if it is to be given the power to compel the airlines to present all relevant information, it will have the full support of the Australian Labor Party. However, in the form announced, the inquiry amounts to no more than a sop to the deregulations rebels in the Government caucus. It is an impromptu, token inquiry offered to appease the opponents in the Government's ranks of the Government's policy, and the proposed massive public guarantee of almost $US500m sought under the Bill. The five-year reporting period for the inquiry means that the Government does not intend to take any firm action on airline regulation or deregulation before the 1983 elections. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Bill before us. The manner in which this legislation has been approved by Government caucus and presented to the Parliament for urgent passage is a matter for grave public concern. The Bill has resulted from brawling amongst Government members following the collapse of the Government's aviation policy. We have now a situation in which the Government's aviation policy is being determined on the hour, by the hour, and this Bill is being handled by a Minister who did not know how many aircraft were involved and who, I am satisfied, does not appreciate fully the implications of the legislation, which was introduced late last Thursday evening and is to be rammed through the Parliament this week at the behest of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The proposed guarantee of the $US490m borrowing for Ansett involves the largest amount sought by any airline in this country's history. In the circumstances, Parliament should have been given full information on the loans to be guaranteed and the purposes to which they were to be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's second reading speech was scandalous for its sparsity and its exclusions. In a departure from standard practice, the Bill does not stipulate the percentage of the aircraft purchase price that can be the subject of Commonwealth guarantee. Despite repeated requests from the Opposition in earlier identical debates, the Minister for Transport has again failed to advance any evidence for the justification of a financial need by Ansett of $US490m. Unlike previous loan guarantee Bills, the Ansett subsidiary concerned with these guarantees is not named. It ought to have been specified in the provisions of the Bill. Clause 4 of the Bill stipulates that the proceeds of the loans raised by Ansett are to be used for the purchase of the 21 aircraft itemised and related spare parts and equipment. However, most interestingly in the publicity associated with the provision of the Eximbank loans to Ansett, there is reference to the provision of an amount of money, in total $US34.2m, for purposes related to publicity and other matters. I will come back to that subject a little later. Clause 5 sets out the conditions of the guarantees to be provided. It gives the Minister extensive powers, which the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares highlighted that the Minister had failed to exercise in the past. He had failed to exercise those extensive powers of access to the financial accounts of Ansett and its subsidiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ansett loans affair has become a matter of much notoriety in the United States of America. It is regrettable that an Australian company should be the subject of such notoriety in the United States Press and the attention of so much concern and activity by the United States Government agencies, especially when it is a company that is so dependent on legislative protection for its financial success. There are in- volved here a series of loans from the United States Export-Import Bank-Eximbank-to Ansett Transport Industries associated with this legislation. Yet the Minister, in his second reading speech, most of which he devoted to matters not relevant to the Bill, made no mention of the individual loans involved or the series of loans in- volved, nor did he provide any advice to Parliament on the public concern and the investigations in the United States at the manner in which the Eximbank loans were arranged and the purposes to which the proceeds of those loans may be put. In what was a patently false statement the Prime Minister claimed last Friday that this legislation had to be passed before Easter. Let me quote from a transcript of his Press conference. It does not read correctly; it is as the Prime Minister said it. The transcript reads:</PARA>
<PARA> We have to get this legislation through before Easter, because the guarantees are needed. The Ansett group, in fulfilling that loan with the Exim Bank and we are not prepared to run the risk of going over the time scales in relation to that because that would probably force Ansett into a renogotiation with Exim and that would have all sorts of complications and difficulties which nobody would want. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me say to honourable members that the people of Australia are likely to be locked into a guarantee for almost $US500m and they very much want to know what are the complications and the difficulties associated with the Eximbank loans being made to Ansett Transport Industries. In those few words the Prime Minister took the course of concealing what is a very serious issue in the United States, an issue to which this Government does not want to address itself. I ask the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport to elaborate to this Parliament and to the people of Australia what the complications and difficulties are which the Prime Minister is so concerned about in respect of Ansett Transport Industries and Eximbank, that he does not want to risk a renegotiation of those loans. Let me remind him and those honourable members who sit opposite that they are sent here by the people of Australia to protect their interests, not to protect the interests of the Government's wealthy backers in private commerce. The Minister for Transport carefuly refrained from mentioning the Eximbank loans in his speech. He made no mention of any urgency or deadline for the provision of the guarantees. No evidence has been provided to the Parliament that there is a deadline to meet; nor has there been any mention of anything to support what the Prime Minister said last Friday at his Press conference. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence that is publicly available indicates the opposite of what the Prime Minister said. In fact, the Prime Minister, by rushing this Bill through, is seeking to protect Ansett in its difficulties in the United States. Obviously he wants to give the Ansett Transport Industries loan applications added status by providing the company with Australian Government guarantees before the current United States investigations into the circumstances of the Eximbank loans are completed. Obviously he wants Ansett to be able to say: 'Look, what are you arguing about and questioning? These loans have already received legislative guarantee from the Australian Government. There could not possibly be anything wrong with the manner in which these loans were obtained.' That is not good enough. The responsibility of the Prime Minister should be to see that the public interest is protected and that there is propriety in all dealings of Australian companies abroad, particularly when they have the very strong legislative backing of this Parliament. I mentioned earlier that the Ansett loans affair has attracted much notoriety in the United States partly because of the manner in which the loans were arranged and partly because there is a large public subsidy, from the United States taxpayers, involved in the low interest rates available to Ansett through Eximbank. </PARA>
<PARA> There is around this issue a stench arising from the manner in which this Bill has been presented to the Parliament and is being rushed through; a stench arising from the failure of the Minister for Transport to inform the Parliament of the questionable circumstances associated with the Eximbank loans to Ansett Transport Industries; a stench arising from the persistent preferential treatment accorded Ansett Airlines by this Government, this Minister for Transport and this Prime Minister; and a stench arising from the relationship between this Government and the proprietors of Ansett Airlines and the Ansett Press. There is a smell of corruption hanging over the Ansett loans affair. The course that this Government is proposing to follow may even be illegal. It is certainly immoral. The Australian Treasury has very strict regulations with respect to loans and Commonwealth guarantees for loans. Can the Minister for Transport really tell this Parliament that the procedure he is proposing to adopt to guarantee loans by the people of Australia of almost $US500m-loans which are presently under active federal investigation in the country where they are being made-without even waiting for preliminary reports on those investigations is legal and is a responsible course?</PARA>
<PARA> On 26 March, almost two weeks ago, I asked the Minister for Transport-it is recorded on page 951 of Hansard of that date-several specific questions related to contingent liabilities associated with the Eximbank loans to Ansett. It was clear to the House from the answer of the Minister for Transport that he did not understand or appreciate the seriousness or the thrust of the questions. He said that he had no doubt that the Treasury had been examining all of the details associated with the loans. Let me remind him again; he is the Minister presenting this legislation to the Parliament. He and his Department have a responsibility to see that all of the Treasury regulations and directions are being complied with in respect of the provision of Commonwealth guarantees for loans being raised by this company. It is not good enough and it is not acceptable for the Minister for Transport to brush aside a serious issue like this and say that it is the responsibility of the Treasurer. Public servants do not stand for election and they are not accountable. It is the Minister at the table and the members of the Government who stand for election and who are accountable to this Parliament and to the people of Australia. In the two weeks since I asked the question not a word has come from the Treasurer or from the Minister for Transport on any contingent liabilities existing, the possibility of added contingent liabilities that may arise following the United States investigations of the loans or the nature and the course of investigations. It is traditional practice in this House-it would have been common courtesy-that when a question of that nature is asked and the Minister concerned is not able to provide information or when he says that the matter falls within the responsibility of another Minister, that information is provided in written form or by a statement to the House at a later stage. Neither of those courses has been adopted in respect of that question or in respect of this very serious matter.</PARA>
<PARA> On 25 March this year Senator Proxmire of the United States Senate Banking Committee asked Eximbank to suspend the Ansett loans until the high-powered United States General Accounting Office had completed its investigation into the terms of the Boeing sale to Ansett. Senator Proxmire had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the public interest required that upon completion of the General Accounting Office report, Ex-Im--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Bank-</PARA>
<PARA>re-examine the loans to determine whether approval or denial is the appropriate course of action. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator John Heinz-this is most significant because he is now in the majority party in the Senate-the chairman of the Sub-Comittee on International Finance, joined Senator Proxmire in calling for a review of the loan. Senator Heinz said that the Eximbank board would be well advised to honour Senator Proxmire's request. Senator Heinz added:</PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be a good idea for the new chairman to look at the whole Ansett financing arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the kind of discussion that has been taking place in the United States where these loans are being raised and provided at a major cost to United States taxpayers. But in this Parliament, under this Government and its Minister, there has not been one word, whisper or even suggestion; there has been only an assertion from the Prime Minister that some sort of phantom deadline had to be met. The Prime Minister was really saying: 'Let us get this legislation through quickly; let us make Ansett look better in the light of those investigations; and let us not talk about any of the problems or difficulties associated with those loans'. </PARA>
<PARA> On 31 March the Eximbank deferred to a future date approval of the $US289m loan to Ansett. The public record shows that the Ansett-Eximbank loans are currently under investigation by the following bodies: the United States Senate Banking Committee; the powerful General Accounting Office to which I have already referred-the organisation is much more powerful than the Auditor-General or the Public Accounts Committee of this Parliament and is reportable to the United States legislature-the administrative officers of the Eximbank itself; and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Australian Broadcasting Commission A.M. program reported on 26 March this year:</PARA>
<PARA> The American Justice Department has announced that the FBI is to begin investigating the circumstances surrounding the $200m loan to Ansett from America's Export Import Bank. The new complaint comes from the Public Integrity Section within the Justice Department and a spokesman, Mr John Russell, said that the FBI agents in particular would be probing whether politics had played a part in the granting of the Ansett loan. </PARA>
<PARA>The report concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> Never before--</PARA>
<PARA>I stress this statement-</PARA>
<PARA>has the American Congress approved legislation or a joint resolution to try to deny one of the American bank's foreign loans. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, nothing happened here. There was paralysis because this Government and this Prime Minister know who their political masters are; they are captives of the proprietors of Ansett Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> It is significant, as I mentioned earlier, that Senator Heinz joined Senator Proxmire in expressing concern at the Ansett loan. A bipartisan decision was reached by two senators from both sides of the committee which examined this matter. The integrity of these men is very high in the United States Senate; their credentials are very highly regarded by the United States people. Here, in contrast, the Australian Prime Minister sought to gloss over the grave questions raised in the United States on the Ansett loan. The hapless Minister for Transport does not want to know about it. He cannot even get the number of aircraft right. Both of them have embarked on a process of guaranteeing loans, the very probity and legality of which have been called into most serious question by senior legislators in the United States Senate. That legislature at least has the public integrity to demand answers to the same questions I am now asking and to defer approval of the loan until satisfactory answers are forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> A little later in this debate I will move an amendment. I ask those honourable members opposite who have integrity and probity to join the Opposition and support this very responsible and proper amendment which states that consideration of this legislation be deferred until the outcome of the United States investigations is known. If they do not it will mean one thing-that those honourable members opposite disregard the decisions of the United States senators, the Senate committees concerned, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the other agencies I have mentioned. It will mean that honourable members opposite, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport are prepared to risk the liability that would be incurred by the Australian people in entering into an agreement and a guarantee that afterwards may be found to be legally faulty. Where are the men opposite with integrity and the stature of Senator Proxmire who are prepared to elevate public accountability over cronyism and favouritism to the wealthy friends and political masters of this Government? If there are any I invite them as men of integrity to join the Opposition in supporting my amendment when a division is called. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware of all the aspects of the Ansett loans affair to which I have referred. It would have senior Treasury officials following the United States inquiries and events, and no doubt those officials have been reporting on the progress. It would be aware of the United States allegations of political favours and kickbacks associated with the Ansett loans. It would be aware that the Eximbank was not informed of the funds being provided through the loans to Ansett and of matters that were not associated directly with the purchase of the aircraft and related spares and equipment. The charges involved in these United States inquiries are serious and need to be cleared up before the people of this country are locked into a liability of almost $US500m. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no certainty as to the outcome of the United States investigations. The loans could be cancelled, they could be reduced or they could be endorsed. But we have a responsibility to protect the Australian public interest by ensuring that we do not enter into a liability that is found subsequently to be faulty and illegal. It would be utterly irresponsible to pass the Bill before us into law without the benefit of the result of those inquiries and the decisions of the United States legislature. I have shown that there is no deadline for the legislation. I have shown that serious matters are being questioned in the United States. I have shown that there are serious allegations as to the propriety of the loans and the manner in which they were negotiated. I have pointed out that since the United States elections of late last year the incoming majority party in the Senate has also taken up the question of the propriety of those loans. In all these circumstances I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Consideration of the Bill be postponed pending the outcome of inquiries being conducted in the United States of America by the Senate Banking Committee, the General Accounting Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the circumstances of the United States Export-Import Bank loans to Ansett Transport Industries Limited and its subsidiary'. </PARA>
<PARA>In the few minutes remaining to me I want briefly to comment on the aircraft that are being purchased as a result of the loans that may be raised and which are associated with the legislation before us. I want to refer to the decision of the airlines, particularly Ansett, to choose differing aircraft. That decision has been trumpeted by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport as being one that will increase competition and reduce the cost of air travel in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to make any assertions. I will simply quote someone who has much greater experience and much higher qualifications than I in the air transport industry. I refer to a statement by Mr Lyn McKenzie, the former general manager of TAA, a man with impeccable credentials and a man highly respected in the airline industry. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not like the Minister's advisers laughing at my comments. If they do not like them, will they leave the chamber or conduct themselves with propriety? On 10 September last Mr McKenzie told the New South Wales Chartered Institute of Transport of Ansett's decision to buy differing aircraft. He is reported in a newspaper article as saying that this would force up fares and would not end parallel scheduling. He also criticised Ansett Airlines for buying differing wide-bodied aircraft. He is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The two different major aircraft types provide the consumer with a choice, but the consumer will have to pay for the privilege. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> But it is a big price to pay, particularly as the current attitude of the airlines seems to be towards seeking strong Government support for reducing competition to improve yield by enforcing the elimination of all marketing initiatives so much in evidence only a short time ago. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA> The extra costs will have to be passed on in fares. </PARA>
<PARA> The current trend with passenger traffic seems to be towards a severe tightening of controls and the complete elimination of the greater flexibility seen in more recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt this is designed to improve yields to meet higher costs incurred in part by service innovations recently introduced for competitive reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to refer now to another man of equally impeccable credentials, who is also very highly respected in the airline industry. I speak of the Director of Engineering in Ansett Airlines, Mr John Warner. In a paper he delivered last year dealing with the introduction of new aircraft by Ansett, he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> There is an element of risk with the purchase of the Boeing 767s wide-bodied jets as yet untested and commercially untried. </PARA>
<PARA>He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a cardinal rule has not been followed in the case of the purchase of new 767s in that an airline needs 2 years input to evaluate a new jet aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>I offer those comments to honourable members opposite and to my colleagues as comments along similar lines made by two men of very high standing with a lifetime of experience in the airline industry, one from Ansett and one from the public airline, Trans-Australia Airlines. Those comments throw considerable doubt upon the claims of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport that the choice of differing aircraft is a step forward. I commend the amendment to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation before the House is an integral part of new initiatives of the Government for the airline industry in Australia. It reflects a desire to increase real competition, give more consumer choice, and make the airline industry more efficient. The legislation permits the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to furnish guarantees for borrowings of $US490m by Ansett Transport Industries and sets out conditions of the guarantees. It is a step towards real competition because the frontline fleets of Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines will be different for the first time. We should remind ourselves of the fact that previously competition was illusory based largely on advertising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ansett will completely restructure its fleet. The Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill deals with 21 of those new aircraft-12 Boeing 737 jets, five Boeing 767 wide-bodied aircraft, and four Boeing 727 long-range jets. It is important to put this Bill into perspective with other aviation commitments of the Government, because it represents an addition to a series of important decisions from studies undertaken by the Government, the first being the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review of 1978-79. That review set out the principles and administration of air transport policy. Its recommendations urged more competition in industry, for example, the lessening of parallel scheduling and competition on Australian routes by smaller operators. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Bureau of Transport Economics reviewed general aviation in 1979-80. The BTE examined the structure and the operational and economic characteristics of the general aviation industry. The recommendations of its report must be read in conjunction with the overall air transport policies now developed by the Government. Thirdly, we have the report of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares in 1980-81. Three main findings were identified in the Holcroft report. They were: An iniquitous cross-subsidisation on fares, a deficient air fare setting formula, and a lack of accountability by the Department of Transport and the airlines. These three reports collated and analysed the views of Ansett, TAA, regional operators, State governments, travel agents and many others with interests in the aviation field. </PARA>
<PARA> Consumer demands and expectations were identified by the Holcroft inquiry as being: Firstly, a wider consumer choice, not just in flight service but a real choice in timetables and an end to parallel scheduling; secondly, fairer air fares and the elimination of cross-subsidisation; thirdly, the consumer demand of no compromise on safety; and fourthly, an acknowledgement of the high comparative standards of air services in Australia. Consumers want wider choice. The new generation aircraft to be introduced by Ansett and TAA offer a number of benefits. There will be a real prospect of an end to parallel scheduling which the Holcroft inquiry identified as a major aggravation to the travelling public. Differing capacities of the Airbus and Ansett's Boeings inevitably will require differing schedules. The second advantage is improved fuel efficiency which can be achieved by the new generation aircraft. In view of the fact that fuel costs are now so important in determining overall airline costs, the introduction of fuel-efficient aircraft is to be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> These developments may not be an unmixed blessing. We need to maintain pressure on the airlines to ensure that new aircraft are not used in ways which disadvantage some routes. Again, it is the travellers on the long haul routes from the extremities of the national network who could be disadvantaged. Large capacity aircraft operating to and from Darwin could mean reduced frequency flights. This would be undesirable unless it permitted a much better service, for example, significant cuts in fares. While curfews remain in place in southern airports, reduced frequencies would leave Darwin only with night flights. Clearly, any movement by the airlines to initiate less frequent services would be opposed by the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to look at the Government's recent response to these events. There have been the move towards elimination of cross-subsidisation and the acceptance of the principles of the Holcroft formula, the announcement of a further investigation and a review of the fares and the methodology adopted by Holcroft, the establishment of a tribunal to hear and to make decisions on future proposals for changes to air fares, and the decision that TAA is to become a public company to enable it to compete better and to be more commercial. The nature of that company, of course, is still to be determined. It appears to me that a number of people are making dangerous presumptions as to how the structure of that company will be set up in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) has announced an inquiry into deregulation of the industry. Of course, this Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill will result in increased competition. The financial guarantees are part and parcel of the existing airlines agreement. Obviously they are essential if Ansett is to obtain new generation aircraft. Approval should be given on the clear understanding that the fundamental reappraisal of the airline industry, which the Government has now foreshadowed, will be carried through. Issues which could be tied to the approval of financial guarantees include the proper examination of air fares and the implementation of the Holcroft recommendations-that is, genuine cuts in fares for long-distance travellers-the follow through by the Government on recent announcements made by the Minister of the inquiry into deregulation of the airline industry; and a review of the two-airline policy. In essence Ansett's need for financial guarantees has provided an opportunity to confirm the Government's commitment to total review of the airline industry, along the lines of the Holcroft report, and deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note the difference of approach between the Government and the Opposition. It is one of basic philosophy. Labor's stance is unequivocally socialist and its greatest socialist exponent, the shadow spokesman for Transport, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) when talking about the TAA options, said that the next Labor government will restore TAA to rightful public ownership. There was no acknowledgment of benefits of present decisions for the industry or for the travelling public. There was just a single-minded concept of keeping it just as it was. There was no desire for the industry to become competitive or efficient; there was just an obsession with restricting TAA's growth and progress and maintaining absolute government control. The Opposition's spokesman on transport stated initially that the Opposition has traditionally supported loan guarantee Bills. In the past, the Australian Labor Party has also supported the two airlines agreement. The political cussedness of now opposing or stalling this legislation is only to allow the Labor Party to make scurrilous accusations against the Government, just because the Government is seeking now to give to Ansett a loan guarantee which has always been available to both Ansett and TAA and which they have had to have to raise money to purchase new aircraft and new equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to look back at the only occasion during the Whitlam Administration when a loan guarantee Bill came before this House. The then Minister for Transport-the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones)-said on 17 October 1974:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I expect the Australian airlines to provide the community with the most suitable modern aircraft types. Hence, I look forward to the earlier practicable introduction of wide-bodied jets . . . </PARA>

He seems to have a strange in-built suspicion when he looks at this matter. The negotiations of those loans is a matter for consideration, I think, by the travelling public, the fare-paying public. They were certainly negotiated at very generous interest rates. The consequential effect has to affect the fare paying public. What did the Opposition's spokesman say? He said that perhaps they could be cancelled, reduced or endorsed by the American authorities or by the bank. He did not mention that the rate could be or almost probably would be increased.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party should welcome the initiative on these 21 aircraft and the introduction of TAA's Airbus. It is in the interests of the fare paying public and the fares that the public will have to pay. The introduction of the new generation aircraft during the 1980s will be the most exciting event for decades in the domestic aviation industry. Let us remind ourselves that the new aircraft will be more fuel efficient, will be more efficient, operationally, will have higher capacities and will be less noisy-all significant points that should be considered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member waits a minute he will find out. It is also important to recognise that the introduction of these new aircraft will help to stabilise air fares, particularly in comparison with average weekly earnings throughout Australia, making it possible for more people at lower income levels to use this fast, safe and comfortable mode of transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ALP's stand on this issue causes me to wonder about links with some of its other party objectives. I am suspicious naturally about the impact of the campaign for the 35-hour week. The ALP shows its total disregard for industry and for Australians by seeking to destroy the economic growth achieved so far. Let us relate that 35-hour week to the operations of the transport industry. It is interesting to note the stance at the moment of the militant unions in the Territory with regard to the export and transport of mining products. They threatened to renege on the uranium contracts, just like the ALP is now threatening to renege on a major loan guarantee and on TAA. That can only be described as being totally irresponsible. It can only inject confusion and a lack of confidence into the economy, scaring off investment, as occurred between 1972 and 1975 when confidence was at an all-time low. Is the ALP concoction of a massive public sector propped up by little innovation all that Australians can look forward to under a Labor government?</PARA>
<PARA> There has been discussion of the ALP's stance on TAA and the move for it to become more commercial and to be set up as a public operation. Who is worried? Only the fear-mongers. I have had the opportunity to know personally many of the TAA staff. I do not find them all that frightened. Naturally, there are apprehensions about any change in administration or in style of management. But who basically is worried? I suggest that it would be the very few inefficient and incompetent staff members. Good, efficient, helpful staff and management are not worried and will not be worried. </PARA>
<PARA> The arguments in this debate have centred to a large degree on long haul and short haul air fares. Mr Holcroft certainly addressed himself to this matter. In his inquiry there was a correction of past sins. Northern Territory and Western Australian travellers should not subsidise others. Air fares should be more appropriate and fairer. Time-tabling and services should be better, particularly with the new aircraft being provided by this Bill. The intolerable situation of extra flights at peak holidays periods being scheduled during the night to reach the eastern States for the daytime trade is something that we will probably be able to correct. It should also be important to consider the impact that this new type of aircraft will have on the tourist industry's expansion into the remote areas of Australia. Indeed, Ansett is certainly about to embark on a huge advertising campaign to get the tourist dollar for Australia and for the remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The time is ripe to stop sweetheart deals between the airlines. This proposal, with loan guarantees to provide new and different aircraft for Ansett, is an appropriate means to push TAA and Ansett into separate beds and encourage competition, which has been sadly missing from the airline industry. It is particularly important to Territorians who have to travel long distances. With these new aircraft, Territorians can look forward to a new deal, both from the thrust of the Holcroft inquiry's recommendations and the introduction of new and differing wide-bodied aircraft. The new two airlines agreement will open up many more areas of competition. These have been clearly set out by the Minister. Instead of the obtuse opposition from the ALP, the polygots opposite who speak with many tongues-they say one thing and mean another-should adopt the traditional backing of their party for loan guarantees and back the Government with this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill is a backstop to a rather shady $500m commercial transaction in the United States of America. I do not propose to go into the details. That has been adequately and tellingly done by the Opposition spokesman on transport matters, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). I merely observe, as he did, that it seems quite inappropriate that the national Government of this country should be providing a gilt edged undertaking in support of a commercial arrangement which is attracting investigation from, among other authorities, the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States of America. I even forgo the novelty of the reference to a five-year inquiry into the deregulation of airline services in Australia as outlined in the statement of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I guess that if, in five years time, anything is produced fruitfully the best title would be: 'A major study in still life'. It is as exciting and productive as watching paint dry. Whilst I do not necessarily accept the proposition that one is born every minute, those who are born seem to throng into the back benches of the Government because they rushed away to propose that this five-year inquiry, which should not take five months if the Government were serious, was a major breakthrough for them. I remind those honourable members that by 1986 the government succeeding this one, after its 1983 defeat, will be too busy preparing for the 1986 election to consider such irrelevancies in terms of the major issues in this country. What is more significant is that this Bill is part of the chaos, the confusion, and the favoured back-door deals that go to make up Government airline policy under the Fraser Government. I want to zero in, in that sense, on a statement made by the Minister in this House last week. Among other things he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday I announced that the Government has taken an in-principle decision to establish TAA as a public company . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What that really did was to bust the fable of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), during the 1980 election, namely, that Trans-Australia Airlines would not be sold. It is not unusual for the present Prime Minister of Australia to say one thing at election time and do absolutely the opposite soon after the election is out of the way. Last Friday night we found that exactly the same thing had happened again. On the Australian Broadcasting Commission's program PM, the following discourse took place during an interview with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> But my impression in the election campaign was that you promised that TAA would not be sold. Was my understanding wrong?</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA> That had been the policy of the Government, yes. We had examined it earlier, and Mr Nixon as Minister for Transport had made it plain that we wanted TAA to stay as it was. We have re-examined that over recent times as a result of I think of somewhat changed circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister was asked the following question:</PARA>
<PARA> Do you think it is fair to make a promise in an election campaign and then to say, five months later, we have changed our mind?</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I think if circumstance is different, governments have to adjust to that. Yes, I do. </PARA>
<PARA>He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Is there any value in promises in elections?</PARA>
<PARA>The reply was:</PARA>
<PARA> A great deal, but look. This wasn't a matter of the high point of people's minds at that time. I think you would conceded that also. </PARA>
<PARA>The question was then asked:</PARA>
<PARA> It was an issue, though, in the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I wouldn't have thought so. </PARA>
<PARA>Two things should be mentioned as a result of that interview. The first is that it ceased to be an issue because the Prime Minister gave his word. Most people believe the Prime Minister because of the office he holds. Most people do not know him. If they had known him most people would not have believed his word. The second point is that the Prime Minister said that circumstances had changed. I put the question: In what way? The only change that one can objectively establish as having occurred since the election is, in fact, that the election is out of the way. There is one other ancillary and not unimportant influence; that is, since the election is out of the way a certain entrepreneur, Rupert Murdoch, has been calling in campaign debts from the Government. This is another one that has been paid up by the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been established by this, as has been the case with so many promises so glibly made by the Prime Minister at election time and just as easily broken once an election is out of the way, is that Prime Minister Fraser is a master of the disposable promise. We all remember his words in 1975: 'We will maintain Medibank'. We know what happened to Medibank. We all recall in 1977: 'Inflation at an annual rate of 5 per cent is within our reach by mid-1979'. By mid-1979 it was 10 per cent, double the rate promised. We recall vividly the promise made in 1975: 'We stand by our commitment to abolish the means test on pensions'. Absolutely nothing has been done since then. We can call to mind the promise made in 1975: 'Petrol prices in all country areas will be reduced to within 1c a litre of the normal city retail price'. We can recall the promises regarding taxes, interest rates and indexation. </PARA>
<PARA> The promise that TAA will not be sold is the latest of a long list of promises, solemly given and just as easily broken. The question that must be raised is: Why suddenly has TAA become a liability? We hear a great deal of caterwauling from members of the Government that TAA is under capitalised, too highly geared and that the debt liability is such that repayments on interest and capital will accumulate to a level with new borrowings, that TAA will no longer be a viable commercial enterprise, whatever the word 'viable' happens to mean. These are the sorts of things which are suddenly surfacing in the dialogue of the Government as it seeks to destroy the credibility of TAA as a public enterprise in this country. The implication is that the private sector has the resolve to succeed. It has the drive, the initiative and the resourcefulness. It has those essential qualities. On the other hand, the public sector is a parking lot for commercial dodos. What Government spokesmen easily forget is that the great failures that have burnt the fingers of so many investors in this country have all taken place in the private sector and the crooks of the commercial world have all been in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give a few facts about this. Trans-Australia Airlines has always been treated as a public utility by all governments, which means that in fiscal terms the approach of governments, regardless of whether they have been conservative or Labor, has been quite distinctly different from that which has applied to a private sector commercial undertaking. What is equally significant is that governments, regardless of their political ilk, have plundered in the most rapacious way TAA's income. I give some instances. In relation to TAA, in 1979-80 the dividend paid as a proportion of net profit was 81.6 per cent. In 1976-77 it was 95.4 per cent. In the first year of the Fraser Government the rate was extraordinarily high. Let us compare that with Ansett Airlines of Australia for the year 1976-77. The dividend paid amounted to 41.8 per cent. I repeat that 95.4 per cent of the dividend paid as a proportion of net profit was ripped out of TAA by this so-called businessman's government as against what had to be provided by Ansett, the commercial enterprise. The only other figure which is available for this five-year period of the Fraser Government, 1978-79, shows that Ansett's dividend was 33.2 per cent. In the same year, TAA's dividend was 79.4 per cent. Quite clearly, TAA has been regarded as, and has been treated as, a milch cow by the conservative Government; it has ripped everything it could out of TAA. For instance, if we compare the profitability of land transport in Australia, we see that the dividend paid as net profit was only 40.4 per cent as against those astronomically high rates that this conservative Government ripped out of TAA in that period. I seek leave to have this table incorporated in Hansard because it covers a number of other fields. </PARA>

What do the Government's advisers think about all of this? I make a distinction between what the Government's advisers think and what the Minister thinks. What the Minister thinks can be written on the back of a used postage stamp with a crowbar, with some space to spare.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know how pathetic it is, because I am going to read the pathos on page 19 of a report of the Interdepartmental Committee on TAA's operations which is dated 14 March 1980. Paragraph 39 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, given the Government's support (both explicit by way of guarantee for borrowing and implicit as the owner of TAA) TAA should be able to operate without any equity capital in much the same way as do ATC and APC, borrowing funds as required on the capital market. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a crucial proposition. The Government's advisers are saying that all governments, regardless of their political colour, have treated TAA in exactly the same way as they have treated other public sector undertakings such as Telecom Australia and the Australian Postal Commission. That is totally different from the way in which commercial enterprise is treated. Therefore, if TAA, in common with other public sector utilities, should get into what could be described as financial difficulties when measured against private sector commercial undertakings, they arise not because of the efficiency, efficacy or capability of the organisation-the way in which it is run-but rather because of the way in which, conceptually, government has conducted its affairs. The second matter arises in paragraph 40 of the IDC report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that it was unable to determine the extent of Ansett's equity in its airline operations. It noted, however, that both TAA and Ansett have borrowed to the maximum extent possible in their recent aircraft acquisitions. Therefore, the Committee was unable to reach any definitive conclusion on the extent, if any, to which the relative undercapitalisation of TAA provides an advantage over Ansett. </PARA>
<PARA>The significance of that is simply that it is impossible for anyone to assert with any claim to honesty and confidence that TAA operates more or less efficiently or successfully than Ansett, or vice versa. The Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares made that clear. Ansett just does not provide information to the Government. This supine individual opposite, the Minister for Transport, who intellectually is too opaque to understand this problem, allows Ansett to walk over the top of him. That is the problem. Is TAA in trouble? It is claimed that Ansett, as a private sector operation, provides better performance and that TAA is excessively geared, it is undercapitalised. It is true that TAA's gearing rate is about 85 per cent, which is high by the standards of comparable industry, which run at about 60 per cent. But, Ansett's rate is in excess of 75 per cent. Honourable members should bear in mind that no one really knows what Ansett's gearing rate is, least of all the Government which has authority under the regulations available to it to demand that Ansett should declare that rate. I put this as another fact to indicate the spuriousness of the case that conservative spokesmen on the other side of this House and more especially in the other chamber-I instance Senator Rae-are seeking to establish, to demolish TAA. The Government has bled TAA white. At the same time time that the Government condemns TAA for being undercapitalised and when it is facing major capital expenditure over the next five years, the Government is seeking a significant increase in dividends. It is a policy of plundering and disposal. It is a crippling rapaciousness of a so-called businessman's government which is run by hobby farmers. I quote again from page 12 of the IDC report. Paragraph 17 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Applications of profits to dividends and reserves are subject to approval by the Ministers for Finance and Transport after the operating results for the year are known. </PARA>
<PARA>I might go along with one Minister, but would anyone go along with this Minister for Transport? In paragraph 18 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> In recent years--</PARA>
<PARA>Listen to this-</PARA>
<PARA>decisions on these matters have been taken having a greater regard for the Government's overall budget strategy than TAA's commercial views. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has been ripping it off; it has not given a damn about the profitability of TAA in a so-called commercial environment. I return to page 1 and the summary of that interdepartmental committee report. I do not think anyone on this side of the House, and very few honourable members on the other side of the House, would dispute that the Government's advisers, for all their shortcomings, would know more about this subject than the Minister. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that TAA's commercial performance has not been as good as Ansetts. </PARA>
<PARA>That is fine. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In this regard the Committee noted, however, a number of commercial disadvantages relating to ground staff superannuation, capitalised exchange losses and operation of uneconomic western Queensland F27 services which reduced the level of TAA's profit. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, there is a far greater extent of government induced disabilities than is the case with Ansett. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> It was found that TAA's debt/equity (gearing) ratio was high by commercial standards but given TAA's statutory authority status and the protected nature of the industry, it may not be inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the committee is rebuffing the Minister and the Government. It is telling them it is a spurious argument to discover suddenly that TAA is not commercially viable and cannot stand on its own two feet in terms of private sector accounting, because the Government has never required it. All governments have created successively a situation in which TAA has operated on different tours to Ansett. It is completely unfair suddenly to argue that, comparing unlikes, TAA does not perform as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the dimensions of those disabilities. Superannuation alone disadvantages TAA by $2m a year; the uneconomic routes of the F27 aircraft disadvantage TAA by at least $3m a year and the currency revaluation on a borrowing in Swiss francs imposed on TAA against its wishes 11 years ago and, in consequence, subsequent revaluations, forced a write-off of $23m last year. That is a total disadvantage of nearly $30m last year for TAA compared with Ansett. As a loss, that $23m represents 77 per cent of the capital and reserves in the consolidated balance sheet of TAA to the end of June 1979. Members of the Government have the gall to suggest that TAA cannot function successfully, totally as a public enterprise, and therefore it ought to be sold to the public sector. It is just a camouflage for their real intentions. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the other disabilities of TAA are that it cannot compete on an equal basis with Ansett on the domestic capital market because of Loan Council restrictions; there is Public Service Board interference in relation to salaries that disadvantage it against Ansett and it is disadvantaged by having the Government's industrial relations policy imposed on it. It has ministerial regulations, dilatoriness and timidity as an inhibition to its proper, effective operation. It suffers restrictions, as outlined on page 11 of the report. I refer to page 11 of the IDC report which deals with the restrictions on the Australian National Airlines Commission compared with those on Ansett. Paragraph 15 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Other areas of the Australian National Airlines Act which impose restrictions on the Commission's freedom to act in a commercial manner include:</PARA>
<PARA> appointment of officers</PARA>
<PARA> salary and number of positions of senior management</PARA>
<PARA> purchase and disposal of assets including lease arrangements</PARA>
<PARA> services provided at the direction of the Minister</PARA>
<PARA> bank accounts</PARA>
<PARA> investment of money not immediately required</PARA>
<PARA> provision of insurance</PARA>
<PARA> borrowings</PARA>
<PARA> dividends</PARA>
<PARA> annual report</PARA>
<PARA> (Extension of time granted). </PARA>
<PARA>What this all boils down to, very simply, is that a very heavy penalty is borne by TAA as a public enterprise. When all these things are considered together it is clear that in total TAA has to carry much more lead in the saddle than Ansett does. That is why TAA has some financial difficulties. The remarkable outcome is that in spite of all these things TAA still performs creditably. The dividends which are paid to the Government by TAA are set by the Minister. The dividends that Qantas pays are set by the directors. There is no requirement for the Australian Industry Development Corporation to pay a dividend. I return to page one of the summary of the IDC report. It is very handy to be able to point out to the Government the sort of advice it is receiving upon which it bases its policy decision making. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Committee concluded it was not possible to make Trans-Australia Airlines fully commercial whilst the Government was a majority shareholder. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a particularly significant statement. What it means is that the Government, having embarked on the course which it has rather vaguely described and allowing for the criticisms it is making about TAA's not being commercially viable, being under-capitalised and excessively geared, clearly intends to sell out, at the very least, a majority control of TAA. I warn the Government that we will not bear that. Even if TAA is sold out in that fashion the sorts of defects I have outlined will still have to be repaired. Even as a commercial enterprise, those defects will have to be repaired before TAA can become viable. Paragraph 64 on page 25 of the IDC report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that before commercial profits could be achieved resolution of difficulties relating to TAA's groundstaff superannuation, and uneconomic Western Queensland services would be required. </PARA>
<PARA>What it boils down to is that the Government ought to have enough guts to face up to the difficulties it has created for TAA, resolve them and allow TAA to get on with the job of providing a proper, adequate and efficient service in the community, unhindered by incompetent government and even more incompetent ministerial administration. I serve fair warning on the Government that the Labor Party, when it is returned to office in 1983, will take immediate steps to ensure that TAA is returned fully to the public sector. We will use the powers undoubtedly available to a national government to ensure that. We will use the Government's power over exports and imports, loan guarantees overseas and airport operations to ensure that TAA stays where it rightfully belongs, as a public enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> There are arguments why TAA should remain in the public sector. I notice that the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr N. A. Brown) has his mouth open. That is unusual. He usually has an empty mind. There is a public sector need for TAA with an industry regulated as stringently as the airline industry is in Australia today. Should both major operators be run by the private sector, there would be an opportunity for them to conceal their real levels of profitability through artificially rigged costs. That would be to the disadvantage of the travelling public. Only by having a full public sector operating authority such as TAA can governments have an overall and reliable porthole on the operations of airlines in this country. Let me put another proposition. There is no need for TAA to be privatised. It is a successful public sector operation. We have no embarrassment at all about our ideological commitment to public sector enterprise which can function successfully in Australia. </PARA>

Conservative spokesmen opposite forget that the great crashes that have hurt the Australian economy in the past several years have occurred exclusively in the private sector. Mainline, Cambridge Credit, ASL were all in the private sector, as were Patrick Partners, Minsec and the Gollin companies. I can understand the sensitivity of Government members. After all, one of the representatives of one of these failed, crooked companies now sits in the ranks of Government supporters. Let us also recall that the crooks-the private buccaneering entre- preneurs-were the Keith Compton Gales of the private sector, adviser to and confidant of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The Prime Minister certainly learnt his lesson well. Keith Compton Gale is now doing 16 years in gaol. If the Queen's justice claimed a rightful entitlement there would be a vacant seat in the Parliament. He would have company. Dowling and Allen were crooks from Patrick Partners. Kenneth McMahon was the crook from Minsec. I remind honourable members that Frank Nugan and Michael Hand were not public servants. They were supporters of the Liberal Party and free enterprise. Alfred Zion was not a legal adviser to public enterprise. He was a stalwart of the Liberal Party with his fiscal support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the beginning of a big vendetta against public enterprise. Today the target is TAA. The Prime Minister has indicated that next week, the week after or whenever, it will be Telecom Australia. He will shear off the profitable sectors of Telecom and give them to his friends in the private sector. He will effectively give bank note printing presses from the Australian Mint to those people but he will leave the taxpayers strapped with the uneconomic undertakings of Telecom which, in terms of the uneconomic rural services, will add $200m a year alone to the deficit. He will shear off the profitable side of Australia Post. He has already indicated that power generation will be the next cab off the rank, the next public sector undertaking he wishes to go to the private sector. Can honourable members imagine bestowing a more profitable monopoly, that could be abused in the most outrageous fashion, on the private sector than the power generating industry?</PARA>
<PARA> I make it clear that we are totally opposed to what is happening. The evidence-not only what I say, but also what is said by the Government's advisers-clearly is that Government's case cannot be proved or substantiated. Within the parameters which have been laid down by a succession of governments, mainly conservative governments, TAA has functioned well and successfully. Within the definition of how a public facility should operate TAA has operated well and can continue to operate well. It is completely unreasonable and unjustifiable for the Government to say suddenly that TAA has to be seen in the light of completely different circumstances. In these different circumstances it does not stand up so well. Let the Government remove those government imposed disabilities, the uneconomic services in country areas which, incidentally, service National Country Party electorates. Let the Government eliminate the disadvantages of an unfair superannuation scheme. Let the airlines be free from all the disadvantages of incompetent decision-making by a Minister and by a government that claims to be a businessman's government but which could not even run a chook raffle in the corner pub. </PARA>

It is very interesting that members of the Australian Labor Party come in here and throw muck left, right and centre and accuse the Government of changing its aviation policies and of not looking at aviation policies of the Opposition. Honourable members opposite should go back through decisions made at their Adelaide convention and look under 'A' for 'aviation'. They will find that the Australian Labor Party did not have an aviation policy at its Adelaide convention. Not one solitary word was said about aviation. That condemns the Australian Labor Party; it does not have an aviation policy. Honourable members opposite are not concerned about the aviation situation. They certainly are not concerned about the consumers of aviation in Australia. That is what is most important in this debate tonight. Admittedly the loan guarantee Bills that go through this House from time to time are usually concerned with the technicalities of providing loans for aircraft, and nothing much more than that. But the debate tonight is of very great significance. More changes are lining up for aviation by virtue of this debate than any other debate we have probably had in this House for about the last 24 years. That is important. </PARA>
<PARA> I think members of the Government should be congratulated for finally taking the bit between the teeth and saying: 'Let us look at the consumers. Let us forget about the airlines for a while and let us get the thing established. Let us give the Australian travelling public one principal thing'. Australians are very lucky. They have got all the freedoms. Australians have the freedom of speech, the freedom of assembly and the freedom of religion. The one freedom Australians do not have is the freedom to fly cheaply. We are one of the few nations that does not give its people that freedom. This Bill embodies the start of a new outlook. It is the first dint in a highly regulated two-airline policy situation. It is the first move down the road to providing efficient and cheaper services to all Australians. That is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to hear the balderdash that was thrown up by the shadow Minister for Transport, in relation to these loans. Admittedly an investigation is being held by a United States Senate committee. I think we should point out that this is not the first time that Eximbank has given a loan to an Australian airline. It has been going on for donkeys years. It has never been questioned before. If honourable members look at the United States Senate proposal and at what is being investigated they will find that only a small clause is under consideration. That clause concerns services and back-up equipment. There is really no question about the nature of the loan. Allegations which might be made about the impropriety of Mr Rupert Murdoch or ex-President Carter have been denied. Is ex-President Carter now denying, in the face of everyone, that there was no funny business? Is the implication of the shadow Minister for Transport that ex-President Carter is a liar? That would seem to me to be the argument that was put up tonight. That does not come into question. </PARA>
<PARA> The only section that is being looked at by the United States Senate committee is that dealing with contingencies. As I said, these are not the first loans that have been lined up in this manner. This has been going on for years. The Australian travelling public is benefiting from loans like these. They are in a most acceptable form. The interest rates are a couple of points lower than they would normally be. If we go on to an open market with higher interest rates only one thing happens: The extra costs will be passed on to the travelling public. Once again the Australian travelling public will be ripped off. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that the implications of this Bill are massive. It is interesting that it is only now that the Opposition opposes what has been happening. Only 12 months ago Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines decided to go their separate ways. For the first time since the introduction of the two-airline policy we saw in Australia a decision to go into different aircraft types. TAA went off on its Airbus exercise and Ansett went off on its Boeing exercise. That decision made by the two airlines was the first chink in the armour of the two-airline policy because, for the first time, the whole situation of freedom of choice came into play. I am not to say whether TAA made the right decision or whether Ansett made the right decision. We can no longer look successfully towards parallel scheduling of our airline services. It just does not work that way. No longer can the airlines get together, along with the Department of Transport, behind closed doors and under secretive conditions and decide exactly what fares will be because one cannot cost an airline fare by comparing an Airbus with a Boeing 767, or by comparing a Boeing 737 with a souped-up DC9. That sort of thing can no longer occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The plain facts of the situation-despite all the reasons that were given by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) tonight-are simply these: No longer can we have the situation that existed in the past, especially in terms of the problems in the structure of TAA, where fares were set along the cost structures of the least efficient carrier, and rightly or wrongly, that happens to be TAA. Now we have an opportunity to get the whole fare structure into perspective. I think that one of the most magnificent moves that has been made by the Government-I include the Ministry and the back bench in my comments because it has been a combined effort-is that for the first time an independent authority will hear, consider and question evidence about airline charges. In this way we can have a little honesty in the airline business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I think the Minister should be congratulated. That is what the whole matter is about. I repeat: It is about giving the travelling public a fair go for the first time. Once that is established we can reach a situation where there will be a real input. Perhaps a basic fare can be set and we will be able to go along to the airlines and say: 'It is up to you now. You decide what your economy fare will be and you decide what your super advance purchase excursion fares will be. If you want to run honeymoon specials up to Hayman Island you can go ahead and set a fare even if the aircraft does leave at 11 p.m.'. That is what it is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The history of overseas aviation, especially in Europe, Great Britain and the United States in the last few years shows that incredible advances have been made. Although conditions are different in Australia-we have obligations to people in the outlying areas and we have thin routes-we now are setting ourselves up so that we can be in a position where we can make reasonable and promotional fares available to all consumers. That is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine the situation in the United States at the moment. The fact that Australian air fares are about the same price as air fares in the United States and slightly cheaper than the air fares in Europe is quoted often. I do not deny that in relation to scheduled fares. In the United States at the moment about two-thirds of the number of people travelling on airlines are doing so on some sort of discounted fare. The fact that the United States has loosened up its regime has allowed people to experiment with fares, capacity and special flights at all times of the day and night. We have seen a massive increase in the number of people who are using air services. In the United Kingdom and Europe, which also have opened up the system, many of the fares, particularly those around Europe, are being offered at promotional prices-at about 50 per cent of the present levels. I can see no reason why we cannot eventually achieve something like this on the jet routes of Australia. Unless we go down the road that is being promoted by the Minister for Transport at the moment, we are never going to get to a stage where we can provide this sort of promotional fare. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition made very great play of the situation within the structure of TAA where, in fact, it loses many millions of dollars on its Fokker Friendship routes. I am not denying that. Providing those services for the west has been a terrible problem. What we have to try to imagine in our minds now is a completely different system from the one we have ever known. The moves that have been made by the Government simply do this: They establish Ansett and TAA for a period of five years and five years only as the major trunk carriers. An opportunity will be given for third level operators, for commuter operators and for new operators in the airline industry to go in and highly specialise their services. </PARA>
<PARA> The proof is already there that Ansett and TAA are not specialist F27 operators. Let us look at an operation like East-West Airlines Ltd in New South Wales. It gives its whole operation to F27s. I believe that East-West Airlines is, indeed, one of the most innovative and one of the most progressive airlines in Australia. It has proved that it can be that way purely because of the fact that it has specialised. I have no doubts that Ansett and TAA will specialise in the jet routes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hazelton is another one. The right honourable member for Lowe brings to mind Hazelton. That is a commuter operator that is doing very well indeed. Another example is Bush Pilots Airways Ltd in Queensland which is emerging possibly as the No. 3 airline in Australia. With this sort of innovation it will have an opportunity not only to get into those routes that are thin in their nature but, indeed, to get into some of the cream routes that are presently being operated by Ansett and TAA with those smaller aircraft. This is the exciting concept of the road that the Government is going down at the moment. This is what the Government should be congratulated for. It will ultimately be horses for courses. When we get down that road, I do not deny that there will be quite a big upheaval in many of the air services. If we can look down the road five to eight years ahead, I can see an exciting time for Australia when, not only will so many of these remote areas be serviced and some of these country towns getting just one service a day, but also many services a day. One can do this on a horses for courses basis even with aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MH4">Mr JULL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has said that they must get the right equipment. He, of course, is perfectly correct. That is exactly what will emerge and that is exactly what will happen. If one looks at the United States experience, there are some tremendous examples there where airline operators as big as United Air Lines have been forced to pull out of some of the smaller routes. Certainly in the south of the United States, Texas International Airlines is one example that comes to mind, of a company that has done very well indeed. United pulled out of a lot of those routes and Texas International went in there operating specialised equipment. It was not a case of towns losing services. In fact, where it had one service a day, which was not terribly profitable, it now has three, four, five and up to eight services a day using smaller specialised equipment and those services are highly profitable. That is what it is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen that sort of example emerge in my own State of Queensland. Let us look at the Bush Pilots operation to a place like Emerald. Emerald did not have any air services at all. Bush Pilots Airways went in with its Metroliner. It was a specialised type of aircraft and from a situation of no air services Emerald at the moment has up to four flights a day. That is a very profitable route. One has the same situation in Thangool and at Dysart. I am not sure, but I do not think the population of Emerald would be more than five or six thousand. This is the type of development that will happen and we must encourage it. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I want to talk about is the inquiry into deregulation. Although I have stood up in this House quite often and advocated a form of deregulation in Australia, I do not profess to be the greatest expert on it. I believe that there must be a very close examination of all the ramifications and all the implications of deregulation. It does the people of Australia no good to have State transport Ministers within 24 hours of statements being made in this House appearing in the Press around Australia and blasting all hell out of this Minister and this Government when those Ministers do not have a clue in the world what is going on and they do not know what it is all about. We have seen examples of this attitude in the last weekend. Indeed, the State Ministers will be condemned out of their own mouths by the time they settle down and have a look at the long term implications of this proposal. It extends beyond that. It extends to a lot of the mayors in some of these remote areas. I make this plea to them: Just keep your mouths shut for a while, fellows, if you possibly can; sit down and study the ramifications and implications and I am sure that you will agree in the long term Australia is headed towards a situation where we will have proper airline services to all points within the country, where we will have a fair, reasonable, equitable--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MH4">Mr JULL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Perth says, we will have a cheaper airline service all round Australia. I know that the Minister is interested too in terms of international aviation. I believe that this particular move initially to establish the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares ultimately can probably be extended to international air fares as well. I have spoken to the Minister and I know of his particular interest in this matter. I remember one night we were discussing a newspaper advertisement that appeared in the Sunday Observer in London a couple of weeks ago. The Minister and I were surprised to learn that fares from London to Australia were openly being advertised for #198 one-way, which is not bad, being about one-third of the price of the going fares operating out of Australia at the moment. I think that that is probably an example of what free market forces do. Maybe there is an option there to go into some form of deregulation, it need not be complete deregulation and, indeed, in international terms it is probably hard to go into a full deregulation situation in a country like Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ultimately we will have to look at some sort of capacity control in Australia, but the opportunity is there to extend these cheaper air services into the international sphere. That, of course, achieves two purposes. It does that which I mentioned earlier in my speech tonight; it provides a much more fair, equitable and cheaper air service to Australians and it makes Australia a much more equitable proposition for international tourists. </PARA>
<PARA> So, all in all, I think I should repeat that this is the very beginning of going down what will be a long road until we really get the whole airline industry into place. We are going into a situation where there will be some upheavals and there will be a number of changes in terms of domestic aviation as we know it in Australia. We know that the present fare setting policy at last is on a fair basis. Although there have been some rather major increases on some routes, the situation we have achieved initially is that we have a fair and equitable system and that has to get into line. We have to get to a situation where we can get ourselves a standard kilometre rate. That, in itself, will make some adjustments to the fares and some of the fares will go down. </PARA>
<PARA> We have reached a stage where no longer is the subsidisation going from the long distance passengers to the short haul passengers; and that is important. We have set that point in principle, but we have a bit further to go down the road. At last we are taking aviation into a public forum where people know what is going on and have an opportunity to make some sort of input into the type of air services that they want. We are getting to a stage where there will be true competition because of different types of aircraft, because of the different costs of aircraft and because of different timetables that we have not had for the last 24 years. It is terribly important to give people that freedom of choice. Once we get TAA established as a fully viable operation that can go into competition with Ansett, I am sure one will see the free market forces come into play and, indeed, the entrepreneurial nature of Trans-Australia Airlines comes to the fore. One will see the deals coming up, the promotion of special flights and the promotion of domestic Australian destinations and that can only be for the good of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I repeat the proposition that Australians enjoy all the basic human freedoms except one, until the moves that have been made by this Minister, by this Government and all the members of the Government, and that human freedom was the freedom to fly at the right price; but we are getting it now. Really, that is what it is all about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Mr Deputy Speaker, chairmanship of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism helped the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) in one respect; that was to at least teach him something about what happens in tourism and aviation. Whilst I do not always agree with what he has to say in a debate on airlines and all that goes with it, at least he puts up some points of view that require an answer. In his concluding remarks the honourable member for Bowman talked about the two-airline policy. Which government was responsible for setting up that closed door type of industry? Which government created the two-airline agreement? Perhaps we should call it the Ansett agreement as the agreement was set up so that the Ansett organisation could go on printing money; that is what it amounts to. It was created by the Liberal-Country party Government of the Menzies era and it carried through until the Australian Labor Party was voted into government in 1972. In fact, the agreement was tied up so tightly that the Labor Government could not shift it. Let us face the facts of life. It was so tied up that it could not be shifted. The reason why it is being shifted today is that the Government is about to make it even better for Ansett than it is at present. That is the only reason why there will be a renegotiation of the agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bowman talked about the public getting a fair go. Which political parties stopped Trans-Australia Airlines from operating in Western Australia? It was done by the Liberal-Country party coalition. The then Opposition in this place used its numbers in the other place to stop the appropriate amendments, in the form of the airlines legislation that we put forward in 1973, from going through. Those parties are responsible for the people of Western Australia not getting a 25 per cent cut in the price of airline fares. I say to the honourable member for Bowman that it is easy to make such comments, but for God's sake have regard to the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> The allegedly terrible Whitlam Government introduced off-peak fares in the face of opposition from Ansett. Before that Liberal Ministers for Transport would not allow off-peak air fares to be brought in. When we came into government we gave instructions to the then Chairman of TAA, Sir Frederick Scherger, who completely and totally supported the concept of off-peak travel, to tell the other fellow-Sir Reginald Ansett is known in aviation circles as the other fellow-that TAA would be introducing off-peak fares from a particular date and that if he did not like them he could stay out of it. He had enough brains to come into it. One thing I will say about Sir Reginald Ansett is that when one has a fight with him one has a fight on one's hands, but he is a bloke who relaxes and enjoys it when he knows that something is inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested in the comments of the honourable member for Bowman regarding East-West Airlines. It is a good airline and it should be given the opportunity of exploiting and expanding quite a number of the air routes in Australia. If it does set up a decent route and expands it, Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett should be stopped from moving in and taking it over, as has happened on occasions. As far as the comments of the honourable member on the light aircraft flown in Queensland are concerned, Trans-Australia Airlines should be permitted to abandon the unprofitable F27 flights that it is compelled to operate in Queensland. Let me cite my own district as an example. When F27 aircraft operated between Newcastle and Sydney, there was one flight out of a morning and one flight in of an afternoon. A fellow by the name of Keith Hilder, with great imagination and initiative, attacked the problem by introducing light aircraft-Cessna 402 aircraft-with the result that today there are 24 flights a day each way between Newcastle and Sydney. There are more aircraft flying between Newcastle and Sydney than there are buses in some of the suburbs of Newcastle. These things should be looked at. When the Government of Queensland says that we have to retain F27 aircraft it is doing the people of western Queensland a disservice. I honestly believe that with the appropriate selective type of light aircraft they will get a much better service than they have presently. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation we are dealing with is the Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill, which deals with a guarantee by this Parliament of loans totalling some $490m for Ansett Transport Industries Ltd to enable it to buy 21 Boeing aircraft. I join the honourable member for Bowman on the score that this is another step into the field of genuine competition between the two main trunk route operators. Trans-Australia Airlines opted for the A300 aircraft, which I believe is a very good aircraft. It is highly suited for the work that it will be required to do in Australia, as are the aircraft that Ansett is proposing to buy. The Boeing Corporation is one of the best aircraft manufacturers in the world today. That has been proven by the performance of the aircraft that that company has manufactured. So for the first time we will have a degree of competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Years ago when Trans-Australia Airlines wanted to buy Caravelle aircraft, which likewise have proven themselves, it was refused permission to do so by the Menzies Government. We were stuck then with the aircraft that Ansett wanted. The same thing happened with the purchase of the DC6B aircraft for Ansett. Trans-Australia Airlines bought Viscounts. The Viscounts proved to be a better aircraft and a better proposition all told. They were more popular with the people and more economical. The result was that the Menzies Government forced Trans-Australia Airlines to exchange aircraft. Honourable members opposite talk about the policies of socialist parties. That was a case of socialising the losses and capitalising the gains to the advantage of Ansett. When Ansett makes a mistake the Liberal Government rectifies it. We are now at the stage where we will at least have a choice of aircraft. We may not have a choice as to departure and arrival times, but at least we will have a choice of aircraft on which to travel. The decision to purchase the five A300 aircraft and the 21 aircraft that Ansett is buying-a number of which are wide-bodied aircraft-should have been taken six years ago when the Labor Government was in office. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1974-75 the opinion of the airlines was sought as to the earliest date they could introduce wide-bodied aircraft. Ansett opposed the introduction of wide-bodied aircraft. The man was opposed to every damn thing that was a change. He was frightened of a real change. So he opposed it. By the time we reached some point with it we were unfortunately disposed of by a representative of the Central Intelligence Agency in Australia, the then Governor-General. This Government has done nothing about that in the intervening period. These aircraft would have provided more economic operations within Australia. They are quieter aircraft. Everything to do with these wide-bodied aircraft was preferable to the aircraft then in use in Australia. This Government has plenty to answer for. If the Labor Government had remained in office the result would have been much different. Wide-bodied aircraft would have been operating in Australia at least five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to see this matter being brought forward at this stage. It is pretty obvious that the back bench members who thought that they had the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) by the scruff of the neck have been outsmarted. He has outsmarted them again, just as he has outsmarted the rest of the electorate over the years by making all sorts of promises and breaking them. A promise does not mean a thing to him. He breaks them as quick as lightning. This is another one that he will break. The back bench members will be double-crossed because once this Bill goes through the Parliament there will be nothing they can do about all the other pressures they have been talking about applying to the Prime Minister; the opportunity will be gone. Having in mind that these aircraft will be delivered in 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988, this legislation should be brought in to cover the aircraft as they are being delivered to Ansett or Trans-Australia Airlines as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA> One other matter I want to refer to is the question of interest. When we were in government we told the public what interest rates had to be paid on Eximbank loans. A few years ago-I think it was on 14 November 1978-when we last dealt with an airlines equipment Bill, I endeavoured to squeeze out of the then Minister for Transport-the present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon)-details of the interest rates. He could not give them to us. The information was commercial. The airlines were the only ones entitled to know. The interest rates that Ansett were paying were not something to be spread all over the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I have looked very closely on this occasion to ascertain the interest rates that Ansett is to pay. I read every word in the Minister's second reading speech. I assumed that this information was top secret and confidential and that it could not be released. The only way that I could find out what the interest rates were was to read the American Press. Cuttings from the American Press indicate that the interest rates are 8 per cent and 8.4 per cent. Why does not the Minister come into this place and tell the Parliament all the facts? Why does he not give us the details of what the interest rates are? This should not be a private matter. It involves this Parliament and it involves the people of Australia. The people of Australia are entitled to know. I hope that the Minister will learn a lesson. In fact this will be the last occasion on which he will be in charge of an airlines equipment Bill because aircraft will not be purchased for another three years. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) will be the next Minister to introduce an airlines equipment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that concerns me is the fact that we have no real control over the operations of Ansett. Sure, Ansett can come along each year and give us a piece of paper which purports to be a correct report of its operations. That is all we can get. It took me a long time as the shadow Minister for Transport in this place to force the government of the day into the position of requiring Ansett at least to give us that piece of paper. It was not so many years ago that the only information one could get on Ansett was the total financial report which it circulated publicly every 12 months. But at least we have that. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) said tonight, we do not know the internal workings of Ansett. We do not know what capital is invested in the airline. We do not know on what basis profit is calculated. One of the conditions of the guaranteed equipment loans that are of great financial advantage to Ansett should be that Ansett set up a separate airline, one that has nothing whatever to do with Ansett's road operations, nothing to do with Ansett's television interests and nothing to do with Murdoch's other investments. It should be a straight out airline operation whose activities are wholly and solely associated with aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> The same thing should apply as far as TAA is concerned. If TAA wants to go into the hire car business, into tourism or into engineering, that is okay. If it wants to do that it should set up a subsidiary company that will conduct those affairs. But because of the extent of the preferential treatment that the main trunkline operators are getting from this Government the people who are using those airlines are entitled to know that they are not paying 1c per kilometre more than they should be paying. I say to the Minister for Transport who is sitting at the table that the Government should give serious consideration to setting up an airline company that will do the things that I have just outlined. That company should operate only as an airline so that we know what the profits or losses are and what costs are incurred. We should be told about the whole operation of the airlines. We should say: 'To hell with the rest of the things they are doing'. The airline operations of these companies should be separate from other operations. Do not let us get the facts confused. We should require the airlines to declare their company investment, their share- holding and all the rest of it so that at least we can work out the true position. </PARA>
<PARA> On 14 September 1978 I made a speech on the last airlines equipment Bill which was Airline Equipment Bill (No. 2). In that speech I drew attention to what was happening at that time. I pointed out that TAA had purchased a number of 727 200 series Boeing aircraft and that it had financed this purchase out of its own money without borrowing from overseas. I further pointed out that Ansett had financed its aircraft purchase out of money that it had got from the Eximbank in the United States. I drew attention then to the fact that Associated Securities Ltd, the finance company, was in a perilous state, and that the money that was being borrowed by Ansett, allegedly for aircraft, was to finish up in ASL. About that time I think $10m was transferred by Ansett to ASL. Aviation money should not be used to bolster up a finance company or a television station as happened in the early days of a Melbourne television station that was owned and is still owned by Ansett. Ansett used money from its airline operations to keep that television station going. We are not interested in that. The two-airline agreement, airfares and all the rest of it involves aviation and not television. That is why I say to the Minister that the Government should require this airline to be a separate private company doing nothing else but aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate which is being carried on at present is concerned with the comparative operations of TAA and Ansett. Let us have a look at the reports of these two organisations. For 1979-80 Ansett showed a net operating profit after income tax of $8,008,000. For the same period TAA's profit was $8,702,000. The 1979-80 report of TAA contains a table which covers the company's profits for the last five years. In fact one can go back for at least the last 20 years and one will find that TAA made a profit on every occasion. Why do honourable members opposite want to get rid of an organisation that makes millions of dollars profit year after year? They want to hand it over to their own supporters, the people who finance their election campaigns. That is the real import of the Government's intentions. If TAA were a losing proposition honourable members opposite would not want to touch it and they would not want to take it over at any price. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to discuss the amendment moved by the honourable member for Shortland and what is behind it. This whole deal involving this loan stinks like hell-like everything that Murdoch touches. This is the man who supported us in the 1972 election. When we would not deliver his crooked goods for him he then turned on us and in 1975 and ever since he has been instrumental in the defeat of the Labor Party and the return of the Liberal-National Country Party coalition. This man is a crook and anything that he is associated with is rotten and stinking. One only has to read the Australian papers to see what happened. A report from America in one paper was headed: 'Anger over Loan to Murdoch'. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> America's Export-Import Bank should be put out of business because of deals like its controversial loan to Ansett Airlines, an influential financial magazine claims. </PARA>
<PARA>This magazine was Barron's the weekly publication of Dow Jones and Co. This is typical of what is happening in America. That report was published on 3 June 1980. I do not have time to go through all the reports in the Australian Press of what is happening in America today. But another article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator William Proxmire, a Democratic member of the Senate Banking committee, has referred to the General Accounting Office-the investigative arm of Congress-allegations that more than 17 per cent of the loan is for publicity, advertising and other 'extras'. </PARA>
<PARA>One can go on. Three of the major organisations of the American Congress are investigating Ansett Transport Industries of Australia. Yet this Government is prepared to guarantee the loan of $490m. Although this company is under close investigation by the Congress of the United States the Government is still prepared to guarantee its loan. This matter should be deferred until this total inquiry has been completed and the people of Australia know whether the loan is fair dinkum or whether it is politically inspired. The history of the loan in the initial stages is that Mr Murdoch had lunch with the then President of the United States of America and three days later the bank came out and gave a most favourable loan-one of the most favourable loans that has been granted by Eximbank over recent years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I wish to compliment the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) who has just spoken in the debate on much of what he has said. Indeed, most of the time he spoke with a great deal more honesty and a great deal more knowledge than did other Opposition members who contributed to this debate. For example, the honourable member quite correctly referred to the increased competition which will accrue by virtue of the different equipment purchases of the airlines. By and large, until the end of his speech he avoided the baseless excesses of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). I only regret that he felt obliged, I suppose for the sake of the Australian Labor Party, to end his speech by repeating some of the anti-Murdoch rubbish which we have heard from Opposition members in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard from Opposition speakers a tirade of unsubstantiated innuendo and scurrilous allegation. To prove that point, I wish to quote from the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt). He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian National Airlines Act already authorises the Treasurer to provide guarantees for TAA's borrowings. This Bill is consistent with the principle of according similar treatment in respect of guarantees to the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, within the framework of the two-airline agreement-so far I have not heard any objection from Opposition speakers to the two-airline agreement, one presumes that they are quite happy about that-the Government is here providing guarantees to Ansett Airlines of Australia that are available to Trans-Australia Airlines under another Act. Honourable members might ask what is wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with that. Yet we have from the Opposition the allegation that in this Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill the Government is doing more than affording equal treatment. To quote the colourful phrase of the Leader of the Opposition, it is handing out 'to one of the crooks of the commercial world'. </PARA>
<PARA> It just shows the Murdoch paranoia of the Leader of the Opposition. It just shows how he is not prepared to debate what this Bill and surrounding issues are all about. He is not prepared to talk about how we are trying to improve the lot of the average traveller in this country. There is none of that. He is simply trying to denigrate by virtue of his own paranoia. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, there is more than that. Where is the evidence to support the statement that this man Murdoch is 'a crook of the commercial world'? No evidence has been brought foward in this debate. All we have had is baseless allegations and no evidence. The mere fact that some committee in the United States of America is looking at the matter is no evidence of anything being wrong. Yet, because of its paranoia about Murdoch, the Opposition is trying to dredge up this matter and it is trying to suggest, by virtue of this Bill we are passing tonight, which is doing no more than affording similar treatment to that which is already being given to TAA, that there is something unduly wrong. What absolute rubbish!</PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition said also that TAA carries too much lead in the saddle. Yet significantly he avoided the question of the supperannuation carried by TAA which presumably is part of that lead. If he is going to talk about that, why does he not talk about all of the facts instead of ignoring some of them just to support his own baseless attacks. If TAA is carrying too much lead why is it not, therefore, desirable and reasonable to help TAA's position by forming it into a public company, by inquiring into the two-airline agreement and by inquiring into the possibilities of further airline industry de-regulation?</PARA>
<PARA> The true colours of the Leader of the Opposition came through at the end of his speech. He concluded his speech with a general tirade against the private sector of this nation. He talked about private enterprise in this country forever going broke. Yet he did not admit that private enterprise has been the very basis of the growth and development of this nation. He extolled the virtues of public enterprise simply to show up his true socialist colours. One is left to presume that all he was doing, rather than adding factually to the debate on this Bill in the House tonight, was orchestrating a speech for the benefit of his own back bench, helping his own left-wingers to believe that he is still a true socialist. I say to honourable members opposite that if that is the best their leader can do, shame on him. </PARA>
<PARA> Three issues emerge from the second reading speech of the Minister to which I should like to refer. Firstly, let us consider briefly the decision to make TAA a public company. That decision quite properly carries with it certain concerns. It carries with it a concern that whatever is the new structure of TAA, that airline and the other major airline, Ansett, should be able to maintain services to this nation which are both reasonable and desirable. It carries with it also the prospect of being able to improve TAA's competitive position. Indeed, it carries with it the possibility that if, for example, the final decision is to make of TAA something like the Qantas type of wholly owned company, TAA may well benefit from this move. In other words, a move is being made to help TAA in its competitive position, so that as further investigations proceed into the airline system in Australia, TAA, along with Ansett, will be in a better position to offer to the Australian public more of what it deserves in future years. Basically, of course, that comes down to more reasonable fares in relative terms. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason at all why we should not consider a step towards deregulation. I have always been one of those people who are not against the two-airline agreement. After all, in my view it has helped to maintain a very fine safety record in this nation. It has helped to maintain services to many outback parts of the nation; services which, without a two-airline agreement, might not to this point have been developed. Nevertheless, what is wrong with being flexible? What is wrong with considering deregulation which may enable us to build on the foundations thus laid and to provide an even better, more flexible and more reasonable service to many parts of Australia in the future. For this reason I would be one of those people who would applaud the carrying out of an inquiry. Certainly it cannot do any harm to have more knowledge than we have at present. After all, the inquiry into further deregulation will provide us with more knowledge than we have at present. I would applaud that. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision on air fares that has been announced by the Government in recent days gives some cause for concern in my State of Queensland. In some respects Queensland can be seen to have done somewhat badly at this time. For example, Queensland has not been seen to have done so well in terms of lower increases in air fares on the long haul routes, and yet it has suffered from the short haul increases we all know about. I recognise, of course, that the current fare structure is an interim one. It is an approach to the Holcroft report and an attempt to provide a formula which in the short term will get over some of the cross-subsidisation which was found to exist by the Holcroft inquiry. Nevertheless, as far as Queensland is concerned, we certainly can hope for improvements in the fare structure of the nation as we know that the Government is going down the track towards working out a better formula. Whilst at present one might be a little suspicious of any benefits to Queensland from the current air fares decision, nevertheless, with the establishment of the independent fare tribunal, with the further working out of the two-airline agreement, and with the inquiry into deregulation upon which the Government has decided, we certainly have moved a distance towards providing for the Australian public and certainly for the people in Queensland a fairer structure of air fares. That can only be applauded. Notwithstanding the interim weaknesses that can be seen in the current air fares decision, the decision to set up the independent fare tribunal, the decision to consider deregulation, the decision to establish TAA as a public company and the decision to support Ansett in its purchase of quite different equipment from that of TAA, which the honourable member for Newcastle has said will add to competition, certainly are great improvements and great steps forward-a product of the events of the last few days. For those reasons I applaud the steps that the Government has taken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If people have the kinds of mind which obviously they have demonstrated they have, we cannot do very much about it, can we? If one were in, I think, a more charitable mood-it would appear that charity seems to have evaded us all this evening-it would be possible to feel some compassion for the traumatic state of confusion in which the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) finds himself. To be sure, he would need to be a political schizophrenic to be able to satisfy the various lobby groups within his own government ranks. We have been treated to a plethora of lobbying positions during this afternoon, many of them quite irrelevant to the Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill now before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Somehow, it does not seem to be appropriate to feel terribly sorry for the Minister since, I suppose, one has to assume that he has some responsibility for his actions and the mutations of his position. His record speaks for itself. That has been amply alluded to with great accuracy by members on this side of the House during this debate. I do not think it is particularly appropriate to go over the record again. I do not think-this is one little act of charity-we should be so terribly cruel to the Minister as to drive the barbs in even more deeply than doubtless they are. It is an unpremeditated and truly remarkable example of double standards for the Government to rush in legislation to support the privately owned major airline by guaranteeing the purchase by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd to the order of $US490m when at the same time it is moving to sell out Trans-Australia Airlines supposedly to make it more competitive. That is a non-sequitur if ever I have heard one. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been indicated the management of Ansett Airlines has brought its problems upon itself by attempting to curry favour with the United States Administration before and after the election. Surely, while this matter is under investigation by the United States Senate banking committee, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and so on, the management of Ansett deserves no sympathy. Why should Australian money be used to guarantee these greedy men? The acquisition of these new aircraft in such numbers will further increase the advantage that Ansett Transport Industries Ltd has over an undercapitalised TAA. Why did the Government not deal with this issue at the time the purchases were mooted? The Minister claims that his action is even-handed by suggesting that the Australian National Airlines Act authorises the Treasurer to provide guarantees for TAA's borrowings and that it would be equitable to do the same with Ansett. As I said, why this post hoc action? Why was it necessary to take the action proposed by the Government at this stage? It is a typical example of the amoral and the ad hoc volte-face that is so characteristic of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite remarkable to observe just how insensitive to public reaction this Government really is. It would seem that the electorate of this nation has no right to expect consistency and propriety from this Government. This Government has a fanatical desire to remove itself from ownership of any successful enterprise. It is a fanatical desire; it is not a rational one. The people of Australia should mark well the ominous implications of these moves to hand over TAA to the private sector. Let us just face it. That is where TAA will move inexorably. The peculiar sense of justice that pervades the benches opposite would sell out successful government enterprises to the moguls of commerce and industry after using vast sums of public money, much of it from the taxpayers who cannot buy into the sale of their own property. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the enormous deluge of crocodile tears from the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Dean) about our supposed lack of concern for the consumers. Nowhere have we heard anything about the concern for the owners of TAA. That is what we are talking about. What a perfidious government this is! Did the Minister or his Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) tell the electorate during the last election campaign that a plan was afoot to divest the Government, the people of this country-for that is, though the Government might forget it, what the Government is supposed to be about-of its own publicly-owned enterprises? Of course they did not. They never do. These are the afterthoughts. As has been pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) these are matters which the Prime Minister considers to be miniscule in importance. But we have come to expect that sort of behaviour from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> TAA is a publicly owned enterprise-I am speaking of now, not when it is sold-and the Government is its custodian. Yet the Government and its responsible Minister-I use that in the formal sense-is prepared to disregard the interests of the real owners of this enterprise and proceed to sell it to the select few. That is what will take place. As I said, it is inexorable. The codswallop which we have been treated to that suggests that decisions have not been taken is something which I have come to dismiss. It might seem that I am being rather harsh towards the Minister. To be sure, he has reassured the House that he will not permit the moguls of transport, the proprietors of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, to obtain control of TAA. We are also treated to the same depth of assurance by the Prime Minister. But, as the Minister would recall, he and also the Prime Minister have gone on record with a reassuring notion that the Government would not sell TAA. There is little doubt that the Minister has caved in to a push of zealots on his own back bench, plus the pressures from outside-perhaps the real government of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister introduced this Bill in such haste-I am sure he would agree that it was done in haste-and at such a late hour to avoid debate. This shows how confused the poor man was. As I have said, the Minister has changed his position, without satisfactory explanation not just to us on the Opposition benches-quite obviously he does not have to give that much to his own back benchers-but to the Australian people and their formal representatives in the Parliament. Why must this House be repeatedly affronted by the temerity of this Minister who has assured us that TAA would not be sold. Now he expects us to accept his assurances that, when sold, it will not fall into the hands of the wealthy backers of this Government. We have no grounds for accepting his assurances-and why should we? What are we to look forward to now? Will the same situation apply as in relation to successful enterprises such as areas of Telecom Australia, Australia Post, the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, et cetera? Institutions that have belonged to the people of this nation and have served them so well must now be seen to be in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> Some members of the Government appear to be having a flirtation with the term 'philosophy'. An avalanche of pseudo-philosophical garbage has descended upon the floor of this House, with the frequency and unrecognised occurrence of non sequiturs. The honourable member for Herbert is a classic example of those who use them. Other lapses in logic indicate that many people are merely using the term to give authority to their prejudices and enthusiasms. The naive social and economic stances of so many honourable gentleman opposite are no substitute for rational discourse. The people of this country will judge these men guilty and will catapult them into political oblivion at the next election. The only ones who will applaud them will be the small and select coterie of wealthy manipulators of the stocks and shares whose coffers are already amply filled. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Government's actions are endorsed and the over-indulged friends of the Government gain control of TAA it will not be average Australians who will be able to buy back some of their own property. Since 70 per cent of the Australian population earn less than the average weekly earnings, their battle to survive will make the purchase of shares a somewhat irrelevant issue. As 80 per cent of the income earners in my noble electorate of Ballarat earn less than the average weekly earnings, the theft of the airline which they already own will no doubt make them angrier and more cynical of this Government's machinations to offer the wealthy further opportunities to widen the gap between the haves and have-nots in our society. The Government has impugned the integrity of this Parliament. What the Australian people are deserving of is an explanation of the motives of those hell bent on selling off the people's own enterprises. I deplore the simplistic apologies for economic theory that are used so obviously by those in the Government as a crude attempt to justify their belief in economic Darwinism. Given the seriousness of this matter, I endorse the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Shortland. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I speak on behalf of those consumers whom the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) said Government members were wishing to protect. I put forward the proposition that if the Government really wanted to protect them it would be looking at the conditions of the loan which we are guaranteeing instead of brushing off all of our real concerns for those conditions. It would end all the monkeying about that has been going on and which is being questioned in the United States of America. The Government would be saying what the Opposition is saying, that is, that we should not go forward with this proposal until a decision is received from the United States Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill provides a guarantee for loans entered into by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd for the new front line Boeing aircraft. In all, Ansett will acquire 21 Boeing aircraft at an all-up cost in excess of $800m. Last year, the new owner of Ansett, Rupert Murdoch, negotiated a loan for $290m from the Export-Import Bank of America in return for which Jimmy Carter received an editorial endorsement from Mr Murdoch's New York newspaper, the New York Post. Naturally, the loan produced a storm of controversy. Such storms are nothing new for Mr Murdoch. He has caused considerable turbulence in the process of amassing his international empire. In this country, the News Ltd-Ansett network rivals the authority of the Federal Government itself. Rupert Murdoch has more de facto power over the Australian people than the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), Elizabeth II and Joh Bjelke-Petersen combined. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a power structure outside the democratic checks and balances of public accountability must be an unhealthy development. Now, having corrupted American politics, having in effect bought a former President with his influence as a Press baron, he is to receive the privileged patronage of the Parliament by gaining our guarantee for this ill-gotten loan. What is up with us in Australia? What an operator the man is. One cannot help but admire his gall. He has more front than a Mack truck. The failing Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) is just another in Rupert's long line of conquests. This legislation ought to be renamed 'Rupert Murdoch's easy-money, fly now pay later Bill'. </PARA>
<PARA> The manner in which this legislation was dropped in our laps last week, without notice, moments before the adjournment is entirely appropriate. My colleague, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), immediately after the introduction of the Bill stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Here, at this almost indecent hour the Bill was brought in and thrown away as a throw-away line . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The loan itself is surrounded with indecency. The headlines of newspapers in Australia have told the story. I quote a few of them: 'Ansett loan under fire', 'FBI looks at Ansett $290m loan', and 'Anger over loan to Murdoch'. Are we not aware of what has been happening in America? An article under the headline 'Unease at Ansett loan' stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Three senior US Senators said yesterday that they were dissatisfied with the US Export-Import Bank's explanation of the generous terms it had offered on a loan to Ansett Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA>Another newspaper heading reads: 'Envoy to explain his part in Ansett loan'. The list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is not without its humourous side. The Minister has informed us that clause 5 of the Bill provides that the Treasurer must be satisfied that the terms and conditions of the borrowing are reasonable. I ask: Reasonable to whom-to the consumers of Australia, the United States Import-Export Bank or to Rupert Murdoch? Maybe the present Treasurer (Mr Howard) should ask the United States Senate, the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the man himself. The Opposition takes the view, as expressed in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Shortland, that the Government should be satisfied that the terms and conditions of the loan and the manner in which the loan was secured should not only be reasonable but above suspicion. The sinister background against which this Bill has been introduced deserves some comment. The spectre of a wholesale sell-out of the nation's airline Trans-Australia Airlines, hangs over this Parliament. Much has been said about this sell-out. The Minister, in his April Fools' Day statement on domestic air fares, revealed the Government's intentions. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided in principle to establish TAA as a public company. The Government has under consideration the nature and structure of such a company. Such an arrangement should enable TAA to compete more effectively in a more commercial environment. </PARA>
<PARA>In what is probably an attempt to please the visiting monetarist, Milton Friedman, the Government is clearly paving the way for the sale of TAA. But even the arch-monetarist, as my friend the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) describes him, had this to say in his book, Capitalism and Freedom-which is itself a non sequitur:</PARA>
<PARA> Unregulated monopoly may not be tolerable and either public regulation or ownership may be the lesser evil. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall quote just one of the statements that have been made by Government spokesmen on the subject of selling TAA:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government had ruled out the sale of TAA to private interests, the Minister for Transport, Mr Nixon, told a meeting of government back benchers yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking at the weekly meeting of the coalition parties in Canberra, he said there were a thousand political and social reasons why the sale was not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement has been repeated time and time again, and yet again today in this Parliament, but one would need to have rocks in the head still to believe anything that this Government said. The intention of the Government is now plain. TAA is about to be sold off to the highest bidder and interested speculators can lodge their bids at Liberal Party headquarters in the form of party donations. The Opposition has already made it perfectly clear that the only result of the auctioning of TAA will be the inevitable creation of a private monopoly in the provision of major domestic airline services, with higher air fares and greater profits for Ansett. </PARA>
<PARA> TAA has proven itself a success. Obviously, the members of the Liberal and National Country parties like nothing less than a successful government enterprise. Their lauding of TAA this evening shows that it has been successful as a government enterprise. This disproves all their mindless theories about government ownership on behalf of the people. TAA enjoys the support of a majority of Australia's air travellers. Ansett, despite the cheap cheesecake advertising to which it has resorted, and which we have come to expect from Mr Murdoch, is a poor second in a two-airline race. The pre-eminence of TAA is all the more remarkable when consideration is given to the obstacles placed in its path by the Government. TAA has been starved of capital and has been forced to operate with a higher borrowing ratio than has its competition. Last year it was compelled to pay a higher dividend to the Government than was commercially sound. It incurs greater superannuation liabilities than does Ansett because of government directives, and maintains a service on unprofitable inland routes such as those in Queensland. Despite these obstacles, TAA has beaten Ansett hands down. To use these very same government-created obstacles as some pretext for getting rid of TAA is irresponsible and dishonest. </PARA>
<PARA> It is equally irresponsible and dishonest for the Government to distort the recommendations of the Holcroft committee and to attempt to use that report as justification for this action. As the honourable member for Shortland has already pointed out, nowhere in any of the 36 recommendations of that inquiry is there any suggestion, or even a word, which recommends or mentions the sale of TAA, or a change in its financial structure. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned about the implications in the Government's plan for air services in rural Queensland, a subject that has been mentioned earlier this evening. As a Queenslander, I am convinced that rural Queenslanders will feel the brunt of the Government's decision to make TAA a public company. Once it goes public it will be unable to resist the pressure to withdraw from unprofitable country routes. As a public company, the first priority of TAA will be profits rather than service. The Holcroft report concluded that TAA was losing about $11m a year on its Fokker Friendship services. When the profit motive is the main consideration, the re- structured TAA will drop unprofitable routes, such as the Fokker services, as soon as it can. This is bad for Queensland. The Minister for Transport's own party supporters in Queensland recognise this consequence. At the weekend, the Queensland Young Nationals, the young Johs and Flos of the National Party-most of whom are in their forties-called for direct subsidies to be provided for services to inland areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Courier-Mail reported Mr Behan, the Young Nationals' president, as urging National Party federal parliamentarians-and that includes the Minister-to stand up and be counted on the issue, because they care about Queensland. Naturally, Mr Behan was concerned, as are we in the Opposition, about the anomaly of inland air travellers paying a 45 per cent loading above what is charged travellers on jet routes. For example, the economy fare from Brisbane to Rockhampton is $75.60, compared with a fare of $110.30 for Brisbane to Emerald, yet the distances are roughly equivalent. Mr Behan said that it was imperative that National Party parliamentarians adopt an aggressive stance, not a regressive stance, on the issue. The Queensland Minister for Transport, who is a Liberal, has given the Federal Government this warning:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Federal Government's decision to make TAA a public company gave TAA an open ticket to operate only on profitable routes, Queensland would fight. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Prime Minister knows nothing else, he should know what sort of fight Queenslanders are capable of. The Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Mr Casey, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We will not stand aside while TAA sacrifices people on western and northern routes on the altar of profitability. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the views of representatives of the three political parties in Queensland, and they are unanimous. The Minister for Transport will be biting off more than he can chew if he pursues this course. There is no way in which he can persuade Rupert Murdoch to fill the vacuum unless, of course, he will be prepared to amend the legislation to make the loan guarantee conditional upon the company's flying the unprofitable air corridors as well as those that are profitable. Frankly, I cannot see that happening. </PARA>
<PARA> I will close on another note-a plaintive appeal on behalf of the consumers, the people of Australia who have had their own airline, TAA, for so many years and who will not benefit by its being taken away. I appeal to Government members of integrity to consider that it is not mud-slinging by honourable members on this side of the chamber to say: 'Look at what has been happening in the Senate in America, with senators in that country, which this Government so often lauds, calling for an investigation because they are dissatisfied with Mr Murdoch's moves regarding this loan and regarding the purchase of the Boeings'. I ask this House and this Parliament to stand by that regard and that concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 1 deals with the short title of the Act and Clause 2 deals with the commencement of the Act. It provides that the Act should come into operation the day on which it receives the Royal Assent. I want to express briefly the Opposition's rejection of that proposal. We believe that because of the seriousness of the inquiries being conducted in the United States of America into the loans that are the subject of other clauses of this Bill and the magnitude of those inquiries, the date on which the Bill should come into operation should be delayed until the outcome of those inquiries is known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter I want to refer to is clause 3-interpretation. Reference is made to the definition of a 'relevant subsidiary'. Clause 3 (1) states:</PARA>
<PARA> ''relevant subsidiary'' means a body corporate that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ansett; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) owns or operates, or is to own or operate, aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that the purchase of a number of different types of aircraft is to be guaranteed under this legislation. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) nowhere in his address to the Parliament or at any stage since has advised the Parliament if any other companies or airlines are proposed to be established or for what purposes the aircraft which are the subject of the loans are to be used. I simply say that that information ought to be provided. I ask the Minister to take the request on board and in his comments a little later to explain the relevance of those words. Is it proposed that other companies be formed which, at this stage, the Parliament is unaware of? Are other services, whether international services or other domestic services, to be provided which the Parliament also has not been advised of? Is there an understanding that loan guarantees provided under the Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill are for the purchase of aircraft which are to be used only in the provision of domestic airline services? I would like the Minister to answer those points in his reply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise a couple of points in relation to clauses 1 to 3. The honourable me-ber for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) in his speech raised the matter of the report that Ansett Transport Industries Ltd presents to this Parliament. Clause 3 provides the following interpretation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 3. (1) In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears-</PARA>
<PARA> ''Ansett'' means Ansett Transport Industries Limited;</PARA>
<PARA> ''relevant subsidiary'' means-</PARA>
<PARA>The clause continues. From the information that I have been able to glean from this debate, there seems to be some doubt because of the changes that have occurred to Ansett Transport Industries Ltd since the last takeover challenge on the stock exchange as to whether we are dealing here with an airline or whether we are making allowances to guarantee funds to a company that does not have to report to this Parliament as to how it is spending the money. This Parliament should have the opportunity to assess the operations of Ansett Transport Industries as an airline rather than Ansett as an overall industry which deals with everything under the sun. That is one aspect that concerns me. The other matter which concerns me is, as the member for Shortland said, the problems in America at the present time regarding the inquiries into the loan itself. From reading Press reports, we find that the interest rate being obtained by Mr Rupert Murdoch is rather favourable, one could say, to him and to his fellow shareholders. I am concerned that from the inquiries in the United States there may be changes to the interest rates and to the total structure of that loan. I would like it clearly stated by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) just what would happen if there was a dramatic change in the terms of the loan from the United States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One matter needs to be made perfectly clear. The Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill is substantially in the standard form of such legislation that has come before the Parliament on previous occasions but takes account of certain technical points which have been raised in recent guarantee negotiations. In particular, the conditions on which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has to be satisfied are the standard conditions. They provide adequate protection in the public interest. The provision of guarantees on borrowings by airlines to finance the purchase of equipment enables the airline to obtain cheaper finance than would otherwise be available and possibly to borrow larger amounts than would otherwise be available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point is that the wholly owned subsidiary of Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd that will be seeking to finalise its borrowings, in the final analysis, will be subject to the Treasurer's approval of the terms and conditions of the borrowing. Before the loans can be finally resolved the legislation naturally has to be in place. Although the Commonwealth has maintained a long-standing principle to provide a guarantee for approved loans, before the final negotiations can be brought to effect it is necessary for this legislation to be in place. Once the subsidiary has completed its negotiations with the lending institutions, the Crown Solicitor and officials of the Treasury will be preparing documentation for the Treasurer. If honourable members read the Bill they will find that the Treasurer is then empowered, under this legislation, to make a determination as he thinks fit. There is nothing new in the procedures under this legislation, but it probably guarantees the proper procedures more finely than any other legislation before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> So until the negotiations and loans are consummated by the principals of Ansett Transport Industries, or whoever undertakes the negotiations, the documents will not be available to the Treasurer. The Treasurer will then use the best offices of the Crown Solicitor and advice from his own Department before making a decision as to whether he approves the loan. So it is quite wrong to suggest that the guarantee in any particular case will be automatically given because this Bill passes the Parliament. This Bill empowers the Treasurer to give approval to loans that meet the obligations under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4. (Guarantee of certain loans). </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="1495" SPEAKER="Morris Mr P.F." NAMEID="HI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SHORTLAND">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr MORRIS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Shortland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.22)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 4 is a major clause of the Bill and deals with the definition of the aircraft. Clause 4 (1) (b) in particular defines the aircraft being purchased and continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>or in connection with the purchase by the relevant subsidiary of related spare parts and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>That very provision is the subject of inquiries by federal government agencies in the United States of America. I will return to that later in the debate. Another matter I quickly want to deal with concerns the aircraft being selected and the guarantees being provided. I put it to the Parliament that there has been a bipartisan approach to the subject of the deregulation of air cargo. In this Bill guarantees are being provided to a company to purchase new passenger aircraft. I am reliably informed that at present the same company-Ansett Transport Industries-is purchasing from United Airlines in the United States, two Boeing 727 100 series aircraft, the fin numbers of which are N7402U and N7407U and that these aircraft are being converted to pure cargo configuration for use in Australia. One would have thought that that would rate a mention in the address of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) and certainly in the documents attached to this legislation. Again it will have a bearing on the liquidity position of Ansett and upon its borrowing needs. But no mention of that is made in the Minister's speech. More importantly, other Australian companies which are also involved in pure air cargo operations are being prevented by the Government from carrying out negotiations for the purchase abroad of pure cargo aircraft. The giving of this preferential treatment to Ansett is again at the expense of other pure air cargo companies who are seeking to expand and to participate in air cargo traffic. The other point I made earlier is that the 737 jets which will be purchased as a result of the loan guarantees are noisy old technology aircraft which were introduced in 1971. They are considerably noisier than the wide-bodied aircraft being brought in and they will cause a fairly sharp increase in noise pollution levels at Mascot Airport. This is firstly, because of their high noise levels and old engine technology and secondly because of the more frequent aircraft movements. </PARA>

<PARA> For the purposes of sub-section (2), the amount of a borrowing in a currency other than the currency of the United States of America shall be taken to be the amount in the currency of the United States of America that was equivalent to the first-mentioned amount at the date of the borrowing-</PARA>
<PARA>On 26 March 1981 the Australian Financial Review reported Senator Proxmire of the United States of America as seeking a new move against this loan. He said that he was disturbed by recent allegations made to him that part of the $200m loan for the five 767s may be going to rebates to the airlines for buying the United States aircraft. It concerns me a little that with this type of approach being taken perhaps we are guaranteeing money that has been used specifically to put a rebate in for the purposes of obtaining a sale rather than guaranteeing money that is definitely for buying the aircraft. If there is a change to the actual loan in the United States, what will happen to that first-mentioned amount in that Bill at the date of the borrowing? Will it still mean that the amount originally intended to be borrowed will be borrowed or will there be some protection for the Australian public if there is a variation in the loan in the United States? That is a question I would like the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) to cover. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is very important to make this position perfectly clear. The Bill authorises the Treasurer to guarantee loans up to $490m subject to certain conditions. It does not specifically refer to the Eximbank loans or any other specific loans. It empowers the Treasurer to guarantee loans properly approved of proposed lenders. I think it is far too specific to be assuming that this Bill will be referring to that loan or any other particular loan. I know that the matter is in the news and is being used by the Opposition to try to emotionalise this whole area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) referred to freighters. It is proposed by Ansett Airlines of Australia to purchase two Boeing 727 100 aircraft for freight purposes. These have not yet been approved and are not subject to guarantee under this Bill at all, nor will they be, as freight will be outside the airline policy. Under the new two airlines agreement quite specifically freight and air cargo will be removed, so it will be a free market place and it will be quite in order-if that Bill passes through this Parliament and receives the support of the Opposition-for other companies like Interstate Parcel Express Co Pty Ltd to be given a go. Companies which want to import jet aircraft such as 727s or whatever will be able to get into freight operations. The real test will be whether the Opposition is prepared to support a new two airlines agreement which takes freight out of that agreement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 14 November 1978, I raised the question of the rates of interest that were being paid. The then Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon), indicated that the information was private and confidential and, therefore, it could not be made available. Yet on this occasion we find that nowhere in this Bill, the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) or anything associated with the legislation is there any indication of what are the rates of interest. So, the only conclusion I can come to is that, if I ask the Minister for Transport the same question, I will get the same reply that I received some two years ago, that is, that the information is private and confidential to Ansett Transport Industries Ltd and that the Treasury is aware of the information. Therefore, we and the public have to be satisfied with the response that the Treasury and, I assume, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Transport are aware of the rates of interest. But that is not good enough. The Parliament is entitled to know. One can pick up a newspaper and read what the interest rates are. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to quote from the newspaper reports in this respect because the newspaper cuttings that I used in my second reading debate are now in the hands of Hansard. But this information is common knowledge in the American Press. The whole crux of the inquiries taking place in the United States today is the propriety of the loan, the propriety of the rates of interest and whether Ansett Transport Industries Ltd received very, very, favourable treatment. One of the joint owners of Ansett, a person by the name of Murdoch, is also the owner of a newspaper in New York.</PARA></TALK.START>

I draw attention to the fact that the rates of interest are a contentious subject. They are well known to the American public and have been set out in the United States media. I hope that the Minister in his reply will indicate what the rates of interest are or give us some very good reasons why he cannot disclose that information when everyone knows what it is. I draw attention to the fact that the interest rates are so low that people in responsible positions, such as members of the United States Congress, have referred this matter to committees and it is at present under investigation. I suggest that my remarks in regard to the joint owner of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd are relevant in this debate. I am questioning whether the decision to delete the rates of interest from the Bill and from the Minister's second reading speech has any relevance to the great support given to the Government parties in the last general election, in the 1977-78 general election and in the 1975 general election.

<PARA> I now deal with clause 4 (1) (a) which states:</PARA>
<PARA> A relevant subsidiary has entered into an agreement to borrow money. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again I raise the question of the right of the Ansett company to borrow money at very favourable rates of interest with the support of the Parliament of Australia when, on a occasion in 1978, the Australian Government was guarantor for a similar loan of some $11m. On that occasion TAA used its own resources to purchase aircraft. At that time, a subsidiary of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, namely Associated Securities Ltd, went broke and a great number of shareholders and debenture holders who had money invested in that company suffered great loss. Ansett was able to borrow money whereas it should have been able to use its own money, the money that it had accrued as reserves from its transport operation. I again make the point that TAA was able to use its own money for the purchase of aircraft. We have to be satisfied and the Government has to be satisfied that there is a need for this money to be borrowed overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party Government of 1972-75 on a number of occasions required Qantas Airways Ltd to use its own reserves to purchase aircraft instead of going to the loan market. It was able to do this because of the standing of Qantas at that time. History will tell us whether that was good or bad. I am not convinced that Ansett does not have reserves of its own which it could use instead of borrowing money from overseas. The same can be said as far as TAA is concerned. I have quoted the case of two years ago when TAA used its own money whereas Ansett borrowed money which we believe was used to help bolster up the failing finance company, ASL. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones), I think I should make it quite clear that, until this legislation is passed, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is in no position to guarantee any loan whatsoever nor would the company be able to finalise the terms and conditions of loans with lenders. The purpose of the Bill is to provide legislative authority from the Parliament to the Treasurer to guarantee loans up to a specified amount-an amount specified in the Bill-by Ansett or one of its wholly owned subsidiaries to finance the purchase of aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation normally requires that the financial interests of the Commonwealth are protected by providing that the Treasurer is: (a) to be satisfied that the terms and conditions of borrowing are reasonable; (b) to approve the form and issue of any instruments; (c) to be given appropriate security normally in the form of a mortgage over the aircraft and parts; and, (d), to be given undertakings by Ansett and the relevant subsidiary relating to insurance, legal costs incurred by the Commonwealth, access to accounts and disposal of and movements outside Australia of the aircraft during the currency of the guarantee. Once the legislation has been enacted, Ansett will be able to enter into detailed negotiations with the lenders concerning the proposed documentation and to finalise the terms and conditions. The drafting of the documentation is heavily dependent on the legislation. Detailed negotiation of the documentation cannot be finalised prior to the passage of the legislation. The normal documentation associated with such borrowings is a credit loan agreement between Ansett and the lenders, a guarantee agreement between the Commonwealth as guarantor and the lenders--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 5 deals with the conditions of guarantees and clause 6 deals with the delegation of powers by the Treasurer. I want to draw attention, firstly, to clause 5 (e) (i), which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>officers of the Australian Public Service will have full access at all reasonable times to the financial accounts of Ansett and of the relevant subsidiary when authorized in writing by the Minister for that purpose . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the Committee that that provision, which is a standard provision in these Bills, has been a meaningless provision to date. That is not my claim; that is stated in the report of the Holcroft inquiry, the report of the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review Committee in 1977-78, and in the report of the inter-departmental committee on the role of Trans-Australia Airlines referred to earlier in this debate by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). If that clause is to be included in the Bill it must have meaning and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) must carry forward the responsibilities. It is paying lip service to public accountability to put that clause into the Bill and then to pay no further attention to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to an earlier section of clause 5; that is, sub-clause (a). Without going into the preamble it states that the Treasurer must be satisfied that the terms and conditions of the borrowings are reasonable. A series of loans is involved here. The proposed loans should have been itemised. It is nonsense for the Minister for Transport to say to the Parliament: 'We could not tell you the interest rates as they have not yet been finalised'. They have been published in many of the financial papers across the globe. One can read about them in the Australian Financial Review, the Washington Post or the Wall Street Journal. They are published there as accurate figures. Details of the amounts involved in each of the loans, the interest rates and the period of the loans have been published. That information should have been provided at least in the Minister's second reading speech. It does not need to be in the Bill. That information should have been made available. We should not have to go looking for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that this is a standard Bill and there is nothing different about it. Again, that is nonsense. It displays the hapless Minister's lack of appreciation or lack of advice. This Bill is different. It does not name the subsidiary involved, which has been done in all other loan guarantee Bills relating to Ansett. Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd is the other company that is always named. I asked earlier and I ask again: If the Treasurer is satisfied that the terms and conditions of the borrowings are reasonable, why are not the parties who are to be the subject of the guarantees listed in the legislation? Why the subterfuge? Why the secrecy about it? It ought to be written into the Bill, as has been the practice in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, all of these Bills in the past have stated the percentage that the loan guarantee being provided forms of the purchase price of the aircraft and related spare parts and equipment. That is not the case with this Bill. That provision has been deleted. The obvious question to ask is why. The Minister said that the Bill is no different. The Bill is quite different, as I have pointed out. But most important of all are the circumstances in which this Bill is being put to the Parliament, the manner in which it is being put to the Parliament and the investigations which have been carried out by Federal Government agencies in the United States on behalf of the lending authority and on behalf of the United States Senate. So we should not have any more of the cant that the Bill is not different. </PARA>
<PARA> There are startling contradictions in the Minister's statement. We have put clearly, with absolute proof in the form of evidence, that the loans which are the subject of these guarantees are loans which have been negotiated with Eximbank. Those loans and the stage which the negotiations have reached could not have been arrived at without there being an exchange or provision of credentials from this Government through Ansett to Eximbank, to that Government agency. There has had to be communication with this Government. It should not be suggested that Ansett has gone along and said: 'We might get a loan from the Australian Government'. The Australian Government has had senior Treasury officials sitting in on all of the inquiries and investigations that have been going on in the United States; yet the Minister tells us, as he said a while ago: 'There is nothing to say that the loans for which the guarantees are being provided will be Eximbank's'. For the benefit of the Minister, I will read from a transcript of the Press conference of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) last Friday morning. He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We have to get this legislation through before Easter, because the guarantees are needed. The Ansett group, in fulfilling that loan with the Eximbank and we are not--</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Chairman, I ask you to excuse the language but this is taken from the speech of the Prime Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>prepared to run the risk of going over the time scales in relation to that because that would probably force Ansett into a renegotiation with Exim and that would have all sorts of complications and difficulties which nobody would want. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the authority making this money available is the United States Eximbank. That is the reason why this Bill has been advanced in this manner and that is the reason given by the Prime Minister. Are we now to believe the Minister for Transport, with all his difficulties and deficiencies, is right and the Prime Minister is wrong? Somebody has to be telling an untruth. I leave it for the Parliament to judge for itself. If the Government proceeds with this clause-that is, if the Treasurer is satisfied that the terms and conditions of the borrowing are reasonable-it is taking reckless and irresponsible action. Information has been made available widely in the US in regard to this loan. I say again that the terms and conditions of the borrowing must be reasonable. In dispute is the provision of the amount of $34.2m in loans by Eximbank to Ansett Transport Industries. That amount of $34m is not for the purchase of aircraft, associated spares and related equipment. It is vaguely described as being the subject of credit memorandums in excess of the cost of its planes, installed engines and other items enumerated with the bank. In the case of the Boeing and General Electric credit memos, the bank apparently is financing for Ansett a vaguely described list of items, such as advertising-honourable members know what 'advertising' means; that reference is to kick-backs-publicity and parts that will 'support' Ansett's planes. That is the crucial part of the whole question. Throughout the Minister's discussion tonight in the Committee he has had the opportunity, as he has now, to refute what the Prime Minister said and the urgency claimed by him and to tell the Parliament what is the solid evidence for that urgency. We do not believe there is urgency. We believe that a scandal is attached to the whole transaction. The Government would do a great service to the people of this country if it did as we asked and simply held fire. It should wait until the matter is cleared up, get the preliminary reports and be satisfied. There would be no problem. That is all we are asking it to do. </PARA>

<PARA>One of the reasons why I have been somewhat reluctant to go into details is that some of these negotiations will not be completed until this legislation is in place, although preliminary negotiations have been concluded. I will answer two questions of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). The company is expected to be a new subsidiary of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, called Ansett Aviation Equipment Pty Ltd. There is no great secret in relation to this matter in spite of the fact that there is an attempt to create some doubt and to suggest some sinister motives on the part of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In August 1980 the Government agreed to Ansett Airlines of Australia purchasing five Boeing 767 wide-bodied aircraft, 12 Boeing 737-200 aircraft, and four Boeing 727-200 aircraft for its re-equipment program. These aircraft are currently due for delivery as follows: Four Boeing 727-200 aircraft between June 1981 and August 1981; 12 Boeing 737-200 aircraft between June 1981 and June 1982; and five Boeing 767 aircraft between November 1982 and August 1984. The cost of these aircraft, spare parts and equipment is currently estimated to be about $577m, of which up to 85 per cent is to be financed through loans from Export-Import Bank and commercial banks. The Exim Bank portion of the financing is for an amount of up to $289.5m. Of this amount $200m is to be provided at an interest rate of 8 per cent in respect of the purchase of the 767 aircraft; $34.5m is to be provided at an interest rate of 8.375 per cent in respect of the purchase of the 727 aircraft and $55m is to be provided at an interest rate of 8.4 per cent in respect of the purchase of the 737 aircraft. Each tranche of the loan is to be for a term of 10 years from the date of delivery of the relevant aircraft. I assure the honourable member for Shortland that there is no great secret about it. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) will approve the loans if he is satisfied with the terms and conditions of the negotiations. </PARA>

Whether the Treasurer (Mr Howard) will have any more success than the Minister for Transport is a very moot point. As the guarantors of this loan, it is something we should be taking into consideration. Are Murdoch and Abeles the sorts of people we should be doing business with? We have seen clearly in the past that they are prepared to flout the instruction to give this information. Will they make it available in the future? As the guarantors of this very large sum of money we should address ourselves to this matter and be concerned about it.

<PARA> Notes: (a) Administered directly by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. This covers only rental, cleaning, transport, utilities, telephone and other similar charges.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) An additional centre is to be established in Melbourne at a location yet to be determined.</PARA>
<PARA>The final expenditure for each Centre in 1980-81 will be determined by the differing timetables for their establishment and the length of operations during the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Each centre generally has a core staffing of two full-time employees, a Co-ordinator and a Typist/Receptionist. The smaller Launceston and Woodville Centres have only a Co-ordinator/Receptionist. At Parramatta, there is also a Community Information Officer. A number of Centres have received financial grants from sources outside of the Migrant Resource Centre program which have enabled the supplementing of the core staffing. The use of volunteers has also been actively encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) These details will not be available for several months until information is built up from 'activity registers' which were introduced recently on a triad basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Enquiries mainly concern immigration, health, social security, employment, education, accommodation finances and the use of the centre's resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) I refer the Honourable Member to Section 6 of the Galbally Report which sets out the general objectives and functions of Migrant Resource Centres. Within that framework the specific programs provided at each Centre are, however, matters for individual managing bodies to decide.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The degree of community involvement with the centres is increasing as the services and facilities they provide become better known.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The main control over funds is through a formal funding agreement between the Commonwealth and the managing bodies of the centres which are required to provide the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs with audited statements of their financial affairs within 3 months of the end of each financial year. Payments to the centres towards operational expenses including staff costs are made quarterly.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The Department is represented on the managing body of centres but otherwise exercises no direct influence on their everyday activities.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) I refer the Honourable Member to the survey into the Information Needs of Migrants in Australia which addresses the question of the sources of assistance used by recently arrived migrants.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) The Government is committed to giving continuing support to programs established following the Galbally Report subject to evaluation demonstrating that they are needed and effective.</PARA>

<PARA> Information on so-called hidden unemployment can be obtained from a special survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics entitled 'Persons Not in the Labour Force' (Catalogue No. 6219.0). This survey was last conducted in September 1980 and showed that 73,700 persons (equivalent to 1.1 per cent of the total labour force) in that month were classified by the ABS as 'discouraged' from seeking work. The main reasons this group of persons gave in the survey for not looking for work were: they believed there were no jobs in their locality or line of work (60.5 per cent); and that employers considered them too young or too old (23.8 per cent).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In respect of each of these items, for which the Minister for Science and Technology has responsibility, I am advised that the figures as rounded are correct.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Of the $475,000 appropriated to my Department for water resources research, $450,000 is for meeting the costs of the Australian Water Resources Council's research program and $25,000 is for a grant to support the program of the Water Research Foundation of Australia. The Government is also providing about $550,000 this year under the National Water Resources Program on a dollar for dollar basis with New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia for Murray Valley salinity research and investigations projects. Further, the 1978-79 CSIRO Annual Report tabled last year indicates that 1.7 per cent of its research budget for that year was for water resources research, namely, about $2.76m.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In relation to marine research, I am advised that funding priorities are determined on the basis of advice and information obtained from a number of sources including the Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee, which is a sub-committee of the Australian Science and Technology Council, and from the Antarctic Research Policy Advisory Committee. In relation to freshwater research the program of the Australian Water Resources Council comprises projects negotiated with research institutions on the advice of specialist committees of the Australian Water Resources Council in accordance with priorities reviewed every three years, having regard also to related water research in progress throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Priorities are based on the best information available and this will continue to apply.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Water Resources Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council recently recommended two benchmarks relating to salinity in drinking water; 500 parts per million (ppm) as a long-term objective for drinking water of excellent quality and 1,500 ppm as the maximum level for water of satisfactory quality. Figures published by the River Murray Commission indicate that average weekly salinity levels in the River Murray at Mannum, where water is diverted for Adelaide's water supplies, have varied between 552 ppm and 630 ppm from the beginning of 1981 to the end of March. As most River Murray water for Adelaide's water supplies is blended with water from other sources, generally of lower salinity content, the salinity level in water supplied in Adelaide is lower than the River Murray recordings referred to above. The blend varies according to seasonal conditions; it is now about 40 per cent to 50 per cent River Murray water, depending on the location of the Adelaide reservoirs, and I have been informed that the current average level of salinity in Adelaide's water supplies is about 460 ppm. While salinity in the River Murray is a cause for concern, the salinity content in Adelaide's water supplies is well within the safety limits indicated in the benchmarks referred to above.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to salinity in irrigation water, a 1974 publication of the Australian Water Resources Council provided benchmarks for the tolerance of various crops. These were based on information from research work in the US which indicates that most orchard crops of the kind grown in the Murray Valley tolerate salinity in irrigation water of up to an average for the growing season of about 700 ppm before crop yields decrease. A yield decrement of up to 10 per cent can be expected between this level and 1,100 ppm, and so on. Grapes are more tolerant to salinity in irrigation water than the other orchard crops. The River Murray Commission's water quality monitoring network indicates that weekly average salinity levels at points where water is diverted for most of the orchard crops in South Australia ranged from a minimum of 360 ppm at Berri to 564 ppm at Waikerie since the beginning of 1981. Salinity levels in irrigation water used for orchard crops in New South Wales and Victoria are lower than those current in South Australia. In adapting the US benchmarks to Australian conditions, adjustments would be necessary for a number of local characteristics, including soil permeability, seasonal conditions, farm management skills and irrigation practices. All factors considered in the current severe drought, it would seem that some yield decrement might be experienced this year in orchard crops in South Australia, but not of the magnitude implied in the question by the Member for Hawker.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In relation to water quality, the River Murray Commission has only been given responsibilities comparatively recently on an interim basis, pending the completion of a new River Murray Waters Agreement. During this time, it has set in train action to provide basic data on which to base future considerations and operations in this area. For example, it has established a water quality monitoring network on the River Murray and it has completed a feasibility study on the development of a mathematical computer model to determine the effects of various management strategies on water quality in South Australia. The proposed River Murray Waters Agreement will provide a firm basis for the Commission in taking account of water quality issues in its operations. One will only be able to judge the effectiveness of the Commission in dealing with salinity and other water quality problems in the river after the new Agreement has been in operation for some time. In the meantime, I do not believe that a national initiative is necessary.</PARA>
