<PARA>Proposed Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans-Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans-Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA> Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines would inevitably result in:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the creation of a private monopoly of major airline services in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) higher domestic air fares.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will reject outright any proposal to sell Trans-Australia Airlines.</PARA>

<TITLE>Plant Breeders' Rights</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognize that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection, storage, and research has been publicly funded.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognize that any system giving 'property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Recognize that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) subordination and/or curtailment of public breeding programmes,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) farmer unrest at seed prices,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) monopoly control of seed production and sales has passed into the hands of giant petrochemical and drug corporations also marketing crop chemicals,</PARA>
<PARA> (v) increased uniformity of crop varieties leading to a vulnerability to pest and disease attack.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Reject any proposal to legislate for any system such as the drafted Plant Variety Rights Act, which gives exclusive ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned by the threats to women's health and lives posed by Toxic Shock Syndrome, and urge the following steps to be taken as a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under ''Cosmetics'' as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to: (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed. This campaign of public education would necessitate multilingual distribution of the information where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take immediate and positive action to avert possible threats posed to women's health by implementation of the above measures.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr HUNT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is very concerned about the continuation of this dispute and the hardship and suffering it is causing people right throughout Australia, particularly those people living in the outlying areas who have not available to them any other means of transport. The Government has, therefore, decided that the Royal Australian Air Force services will be made available to those people living in the outlying regions of Australia, such as the Northern Territory and north Queensland, who are in urgent need of travel for medical, compassionate and other special reasons. If this dispute is not settled today the Government will locate RAAF aircraft at Townsville and Darwin to service the surrounding regions and will cover such routes as Darwin-Alice Springs-Adelaide and Townsville-Darwin and Townsville-Brisbane. Steps will be taken immediately to implement the necessary arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both the Premier of Queensland and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory have been in touch with me, expressing their very deep concern about the difficulties that some people are experiencing in some remote locations. They have sought assistance. It is expected that the RAAF can provide a range of services on a continuing basis within 24 hours. In the event of any breakdown in the services presently being provided by Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia to Tasmania and by MacRobertson Miller Airline Services to the north-west coast of Western Australia, which have been given a limited dispensation by the hostesses, the RAAF resources will also be utilised in the same way as they will be for the Northern Territory and Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> It is my hope that this dispute will be settled as soon as possible. It is causing a tremendous amount of damage to this country, including to tourism. The losses of revenue that have been occasioned both TAA and Ansett are of the order of $11m. Of course those losses will be recouped through future fare adjustments. I think it is high time we saw a sense of responsibility in the leadership of the hostesses' union and a number of other unions around this country that are causing a lot of discomfort to people generally.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the events of the last few days have indicated that the proposition put forward by the honourable member is certainly a feasible one in terms of administration. In the longer term, however, I understand that there would have to be additional facilities for Customs, quarantine etc., in order to cope with the mix of passengers on such aircraft. I have initiated discussions between the airlines to ensure that there is a way through the problem that has been concerning the Western Australian people for some considerable time. Where we can use excess capacity on international services from Perth to the eastern States, we should endeavour to do so, so long as we do not disrupt the regular scheduled services that the Western Australians have come to expect. That is the only concern I have in trying to achieve that objective which has been sought by a number of people from Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is the Treasurer aware of reports that these tax concessions may now cost as much as $30m a year, or 15 times more than originally estimated? Is this estimate correct? If so, does the Treasurer agree that these measures are extremely generous and unprecedented in Australia? In the light of their rapidly escalating cost, does the Treasurer still propose to proceed with these measures in their promised form?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do recall the questions referred to by the honourable member. The honourable member's recollection of the revenue cost amounts coincides with mine. I have seen reports suggesting that the revenue cost will be higher than I said it would be in those answers. I agree with him that these concessions are particularly generous. I do not venture a view about precedent without taking the matter on notice. The legislation covering this matter is due to be introduced into Parliament before the House rises for the winter recess. Then it will be possible for the House to know the precise terms of what the Government is proposing. In saying that, let me make it clear that the Government is keen-it was keen at the time the commitment was made, and remains keen-to give significant assistance to the Australian film industry. It is an industry which has been extremely successful in recent years and has been a source of very considerable pride to all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has decided to meet an urgent request from the Polish authorities for credit assistance to enable the continuation of Poland's traditional purchases of wool, skins and hides from Australia. This assistance will take the form of credit guarantees for up to $A40m of export credits which the Polish authorities are currently seeking through the private banking system in Australia. The credits will be fully underwritten by the Government, using the facilities of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. The credits will finance purchases which are urgently required to maintain the operation of key enterprises in Poland. As with a number of other Western countries which have similarly decided to respond to Poland's request for assistance, Australia has taken this action to help Poland in its current difficult economic situation.

Given that the mall is said to have a market value of $75m to $80m, is it the Government's intention to put it up for auction or tender, or has some cosy deal been arranged with some of the Government's friends? Did the Minister feel under any obligation to consult with the people of Canberra, through the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly, before agreeing to this further erosion of their rights?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had discussion on these matters. A report was prepared by Mr Justice Bowen and the Government has accepted that report in relation to Ministers. It has applied it in relation to Ministers and public servants. It is in the process of being applied in relation to the Parliament. At the appropriate stage there will be a full debate about the Bowen report. It is worth noting that the Bowen report, having very carefully gone into these matters, rejected the notion of a public register.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said on a number of occasions that it is very difficult to know where these things end. I am not speaking now of a particular case. Is it just a question of the member? Is it a question also of a member's family who can have ownership of certain things in his or her own right? When does a child become an adult and have a right to a private life of his or her own? There are many questions here which are questions of privacy for individuals, not all of whom are members of this Parliament but who might be related to a member of this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bowen report quite clearly went into all these matters in great depth. If the honourable gentleman wants to have a further debate on that report I think, subject to what my colleague who is handling this matter says, we will be able to expedite that more quickly to make sure that these matters can be fully debated.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the particular instances that the honourable gentleman mentioned, I still regard the original question that he raised as offensive and despicable. I regard the implications that he made in the question on this occasion as it refers to honourable members as despicable.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr HUNT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1978 the Government set up a study by the Department of Transport and the Bureau of Transport Economics into the general aviation industry and the level of cost recovery that should be obtained from that industry. That report has been made public and is currently in the hands of the general aviation industry. I am well aware of the concern being expressed by sections of the industry about the possible serious impact of those recommendations on the general aviation industry should they be implemented. At a meeting of the Aviation Industry Advisory Council recently I advised the industry that it should endeavour to make a report upon the study by 30 April. I have since had representations from most of the constituent organisations of the general aviation industry seeking an extension of time because they have not yet been able to make a formal response to those recommendations. I have decided that they should be given until at least 30 June to make a formal response to that study.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like also to give an assurance that the Government will not be taking any actions at all that will cause serious damage to the general aviation industry. It is a very important element of the civil aviation industry in this country. However, we have adopted the principle of cost recovery. We are applying it to international aviation and to domestic civil aviation. We are cost recovering to the extent of about 30 per cent in regional aviation. Currently the level of cost recovery in general aviation is of the order of 14 per cent. I recognise that there would be very serious problems if we endeavoured to recover the recommended amount. I am sure that the Government will take those considerations and observations of the industry into account before making a final decision on the study.</PARA>

Whilst I do not believe it would necessarily establish a healthy precedent and therefore would not be something that the Government ought to entertain as a reason to make some adjustment to grants to the New South Wales Government because of the cost of that legislation, I think nonetheless the introduction of that legislation indicates the potential expenditure of several million dollars for blatantly party political purposes. Both the Liberal and National Country parties in New South Wales have declared their total opposition to that legislation and have indicated that they will not register as provided under the legislation and will thereby not receive the benefits of public funding of political campaigns provided for in that legislation.

Over the years the period has fluctuated to a greater or lesser extent under all governments.

The financial priorities in every area have to be taken into account.

I think that by any standards the community would be appalled at that kind of industrial record of a union which seeks registration under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in order to obtain the benefits which that Act bestows upon it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As soon as I took over the portfolio of Industrial Relations I obtained a briefing on where we stand in the preparation of the case. I have since had a more detailed briefing. I expect to be meeting with counsel engaged by the Commonwealth in Melbourne on Friday, when I will go through with them the voluminous evidence which has already been obtained. As the honourable member for Curtin is aware, we are dependent to a considerable degree on the assistance of those employers who have been hurt and damaged by the industrial action of the BLF. Notably, we are obtaining the assistance of the Master Builders Federation. I had intended to meet with representatives of the Federation tomorrow; but unfortunately, because of the airline strike, that will not be possible. I have been assured by the Federation that it is as anxious as the Government to gather the evidence together and put it before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> In many respects it is a mammoth task. A great deal of detailed evidence has to be analysed, recorded and then put into proper legal form by way of affidavit. I cannot say that the application will be made within the next week or so, but I can assure the House that I will be proceeding with this application as expeditiously as I can and with the utmost seriousness. I conclude by mentioning that the Prime Minister in the last day or so has written to all Premiers seeking their support in seeing that this union is properly isolated in the industrial movement of Australia in the event that it is deregistered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The governments of Australia and Mexico have agreed in principle to enter into an agreement on co-operation in science and technology. The possibility of concluding a science and technology agreement with Mexico has been under active consideration since late 1979. Before then Australia and Mexico had encouraged contacts at individual scientist and inter-agency levels with the aim of promoting and fostering ad hoc bilateral relationships between the scientists of the two countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recognition of the trend towards closer co-operation between Australia and Mexico, the Mexican Embassy approached the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1979 to raise the question of a formal science and technology agreement between our countries. With discussions under way, Mexico further demonstrated its interest in the possibility by sending a science delegation to Australia in May 1980, visiting various research establishments in several States. The delegation included a number of high level Mexican scientists, and the visit generated strong interest in and support for closer links with Mexico from the Australian scientific community. The visit was followed up in November 1980 when a member of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation executive visited Mexico to examine areas of mutual scientific interest for exchanges of scientists and for setting up co-operative research programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has now agreed in principle to enter into a formal science and technology agreement with Mexico; discussions on the text and substance of the agreement are now in progress. Areas of co-operation can be expected to include solar energy research, agricultural and animal husbandry studies, dry land farming, work in arid zones, marine research and industrial science. It is planned that as the level of co-operation grows between Australia and Mexico, the basic agreement will be supplemented by a series of specialist protocols between co-operating agencies, and these will serve further to strengthen and expand the developing bilateral relationship. The Australian Government welcomes the forthcoming science agreement, the first and so far only bilateral agreement to be concluded between Australia and Mexico, as an indication of the importance attached to closer relationships between the countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -by leave-The Opposition welcomes the announcement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) of the arrangement to enter into an agreement with Mexico on co-operation in science and technology. We note that the matter has been under consideration for more than a year, and accordingly we expect that a detailed agreement could be ready for signature in the not too distant future. I add that the Australian Labor Party pioneered a most active policy of relations between Australia and the Latin American states when it was in office. Those initiatives were based on our realisation of the growing importance of the whole region which stretches south from the United States of America to Cape Horn. In that large area of the world, the nation which has grown faster economically and emerged on to the world scene more rapidly than any other is Mexico. Mexico is now the fifth largest oil producer in the world and has the sixth largest oil reserves in the world. Like Australia, Mexico is a major energy producer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Similarly like Australia, Mexico has large areas of tropical and desert regions. It has a population of 70 million, which population is growing rapidly. It currently has an impressive annual economic growth rate of about 8 per cent. Its foreign trade runs into billions of dollars a year. But in that context the two-way trade between Australia and Mexico was only $40m. Clearly there are great economic opportunities in the Australia-Mexico relationship. It is to be hoped that the science and technology co-operation flowing from the proposed agreement will be followed by other bilateral agreements to expand and strengthen relations between Australia and Mexico. Australia has special knowledge in a variety of fields. It could be of benefit to Mexico. There will be many benefits, not the least of which would be solar energy research, arid zone agriculture, the livestock industry and industrial science. </PARA>
<PARA> We note with pleasure that Mexican technicians and students are already studying in Canberra, Brisbane and Adelaide in fields such as agriculture, livestock, dairy production, dry farming techniques, astronomy, economics and mathematics. We also note that the Mexican's are interested in upgrading their sheep breeding facilities. Australia could certainly assist in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the agreement. We note that there should be opportunities to do more. We hope, for example, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will instruct his officials to investigate the possibility of establishing a bilateral cultural agreement if he has not already done so. The Labor Party believes that science and technology agreements and cultural exchange arrangements are some of the most effective, if perhaps unspectacular, ways of strengthening the fabric of international co-operation. We urge the Government to be most active in these fields. In conclusion, we welcome the agreement. We wish Australian and Mexican scientists and technologists success in their future co-operation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For some time now interest rates in this country have been at record high levels, the highest in our history. This, in itself, is disturbing enough. But it is tremendously disturbing that in addition, instead of signs that interest rates will fall in the near future, there are instead more and more indicators that the general level of interest rates will rise further in the near future. Indeed, reports of particular interest rate rises occur almost daily. It is increasingly clear that such rises are attributable to the Government's attempt to impose a restrictive monetary policy on the nation. Indeed, for those borrowers without substantial economic power-that is, low and middle income earners, home buyers, small businessmen and consumers-a credit squeeze is very much in place. The imposition of that credit squeeze is not attributable simply to the operation of market forces and therefore beyond Government control. Rather, it is very much the result of this Government's monetarist policies and its associated foreign investment policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The evidence of increasing interest rates is undoubted. Over the last year bank home mortgage rates have risen by 2 per cent. Bank interest rates for small overdrafts-that is, for amounts less than $100,000-have risen by about 2.5 per cent to three per cent. Bank overdraft rates for large overdrafts over $100,000 which are not controlled by the Government have risen substantially and are still rising. The prime rate for borrowings by major corporations is up to 15 per cent and may well go further as the seasonal liquidity squeeze accentuates. Building societies and finance companies have also generally matched, if not bettered, the increase in bank interest rates. The prospect of a further rise in home mortgage rates charged by the banks and building societies is indicated by the fact that since the rise of one per cent in the bank mortgage rate last December there have been various further developments.</PARA>
<PARA> Bank deposit rates have increased substantially after being decontrolled by the Government in December of last year. Building society deposit rates have tended to rise as a consequence. The rise in the Australian savings bonds rate of 0.75 per cent a month ago has increased the competition for funds. Banks are now in the position where they can lend to a prime corporate borrower at 15 per cent but can charge 'only' 11.5 per cent for a home mortgage loan. The pressure from banks for a further rise in the mortgage rate is therefore very substantial. There is, accordingly, increasing expectation of such a rise. Indeed, only yesterday a major economic commentator in Australia, Mr Allan Carroll, speaking at the housing industry conference, forecast a further rise of between a half and three-quarters of a per cent in mortgage interest rates later this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of increasing interest rates on home buyers in the building industry is substantial. The effect on home buyers is to put lower income earners out of the market. Even the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) got round to acknowledging that fact yesterday in a speech which was read for him at the Housing Industry Association Conference in Sydney. The Housing Industry Association has calculated that 4,000 potential home buyers are put out of the market for every 0.5 per cent rise in interest rates. So the 2 per cent rise in the bank mortgage rate which has occurred over the last year means that 16,000 potential buyers per annum have been put out of the market so far. This, of course, is because the level of repayments has been increased so substantially by the increase in interest rates. On a typical $30,000 loan over 25 years, monthly payments have increased by $43 so far-that is, over the last 12 months with the 2 per cent rise in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Each 0.5 per cent rise in interest rate adds $11 a month to the monthly repayments on a $30,000 loan over that period. So with such substantial increases in repayments, many workers are simply unable to buy a home or maintain payments on a home. I am sure that members of parliament have by now received protests from people who have been put in the position where they feel they have to sell their home because of the increase in interest rates that has occurred and their total inability to meet the repayments which have been increased as a consequence. Thus inevitably the number of home loans has already begun to fall. The total number of loans by building societies in February of this year was 36 per cent less than in February of last year. Total lending for home purchasers from all sources was 7.2 per cent less in February of this year than in February of last year. It is clear, therefore, that interest rate rises are having a substantial impact already and any further round of mortgage rate rises will do great damage to the building industry and to the prospects of the average Australian being able to buy a home. </PARA>
<PARA> A further development of importance-of course this is a closely associated development-is the slowing in the rate of growth of the money supply. Since the election in October last year the Government has undoubtedly set about intensifying or applying a monetary squeeze to slow the growth of the money supply considerably. It was therefore found that over the three months to February of this year the seasonally adjusted annual rate of growth of M1, one of the measures of the money supply, was in fact negative. It grew at a rate of minus 6 per cent. In other words, there was a substantial decline in the actual level of money supply as measured by M1. In March the rate of growth increased, but that was not because the Government wanted that increase; rather it was because of a large capital inflow in that month which added substantially to the money supply. Even so, for the three months to the end of March the seasonally adjusted annual rate of growth of M1 was still negative at minus 1 per cent and M3 growth, which is another measure of money supply, was only 9 per cent which is anything but rapid growth. Thus, the money supply figures show that the volume of money in the community has been severely restricted in recent months, thus making it more difficult to obtain credit. This creates increased pressure for interest rates and also denies credit to many who would like to obtain it. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for these developments are principally centred on the Government's policy. It is not something which is attributable to the mystical workings of the market, but it centres directly on the Government's monetary policy and capital inflow policy. The Government has pursued a monetary policy for this year which aims at the rate of growth of money supply being kept in the range of 9 per cent to 11 per cent. It has also pursued, as part of its monetary policy, a process of deregulating interest rates-that is, taking away the regulations which apply to bank interest rates in respect of deposit rates so far. Of course, that occurred last December. In addition, the Government's capital inflow policy has been to encourage unlimited inflow of foreign capital to finance resource development in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been successful in encouraging a very large increase in private capital inflow. In the nine months to March last year the amount of net private capital inflow was $660m. In the nine months to March 1981 that figure went up to $3,943m. That is a tremendous increase which has implications for the rate of growth of the money supply. It tends to add to the money supply. I say 'tends' because it is offset to some extent by the balance of payments current account deficit, which has been substantial this year. Therefore, the full impact of that capital inflow has not fed directly into the money supply because it has been whittled away by that current account deficit. Had there been current account stability and no deficit we would have had a fantastic increase in our money supply through private capital inflow and that would have had tremendous consequences for monetary policy in this country. Already it has had significant consequences but they would have been much more horrendous but for that deficit in our balance of payments current account. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for that private capital inflow having such a significant impact is that not only do we have that feeding into the money supply but also it is in the context of the Government maintaining a set monetary target. The Government says we can have the volume of money increasing by only 9 per cent to 11 per cent and even if we have a large increase in money coming from overseas we will still have only a 9 per cent to 11 per cent increase. That means we must chop back on the amount of credit which is developed domestically. We then have to apply more intense pressures on banks to limit their lending and we brought about a situation in which interest rate increases are far more likely to occur. The cutback in bank lending and the increases in interest rates are not at all surprising; they are directly attributable to Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The money supply targets which I mentioned of 9 per cent to 11 per cent are very tight; that is, they are tight in the context of the inflation rate and the expected or desired level of economic growth in this country. At present the inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index, is 9 1/2 per cent but the inflation rate, as measured by the implicit price deflator of gross domestic product, is running at 11 1/2 per cent. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has said in the past that the implicit price deflator is a more appropriate measure of inflation, and that in looking at the underlying rate of inflation we should use this implicit price deflator for the total amount of goods and services in this country rather than just consumer expenditure. By that measure, inflation is running at 11 1/2 per cent. So, inflation for the economy as a whole seems to be well into double digit figures. In that situation, to be operating a monetary target of 9 per cent to 11 per cent and insisting on achieving it, as the Government appears intent on doing, certainly is restrictive indeed because it leaves little or no room for the financing of economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The maintenance of such a tight money supply target, in the context of a high capital inflow this year, means that the prospects for economic activity in certain areas of the economy are not very good at all. One of those areas is housing. The Minister for Industry and Commerce acknowledged that fact yesterday. A speech that was read for him at the Housing Industry Association Conference in Sydney, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> However, the resource development program could bring in its wake additional problems for your industry. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the housing industry. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In particular, there could be a substantial increase in competition for private capital funds and skilled labour as well as the growing demand for public funding of infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>There the Minister for Industry and Commerce is acknowledging that the funding of this large capital inflow for resource development is taking away the possibility of funds being available for the housing industry, thus providing problems in that area. Of course, this is a tremendously important development. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also bear in mind that the Government's policy in respect of applying tight monetary targets is based on a belief about the working nature of monetarism which simply is not upheld by the experience of countries which have applied it or, for that matter, by economic theory. No country which has applied the Friedmanite policies this Government is increasingly adopting has been able to point to dramatic economic success as a result. Certainly they have not been able to point to a reduction of inflation to the normal levels of the 1950s and 1960s and the restoration of full employment. There is nothing of that kind at all. In fact, the situation is quite the contrary in countries such as the United Kingdom which have pursued those policies even more single-mindedly than the Fraser Government. There we see a dramatic effect, a disastrous impact, on the economy with large increases in unemployment and only small compensating reductions in inflation. In Australia the Fraser Government also has pursued this largely monetarist policy since it has been in office. But inflation is still running at near double digit figures and we still have unemployed half a million people. </PARA>
<PARA> How are we to say that these monetarist policies will work? They simply have not worked anywhere and they will not work in the future. To adhere to them in the rigid and doctrinaire way which this Government is increasingly tending to do means that all we will do is bring about spiralling interest rates, restrictions on the rate of possible economic growth and higher unemployment. The Government, by deregulating bank interest rates also as part of its Friedmanite policies, has brought about a further impetus to increased interest rates. The deregulation of bank deposit rates frees the banks to go out in the market and offer higher deposit rates and therefore to spur the building societies and the finance companies to increase their deposit rates. They are all competing for funds. Therefore, a competitive spiral of interest rate increases has developed because of this deregulation of bank deposit rates. All of those factors have been important. </PARA>
<PARA> I note here that if, after the Campbell Commission of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System reports, the Government decides to deregulate bank lending rates, we must expect a very substantial rise indeed to occur in home mortgage rates. If we have deregulation of bank mortgage rates at the same time as bank mortgage rates are way below the rates being charged in the unregulated area, then we must expect as a consequence the banks to take action to increase those mortgage rates considerably. The Government's inadequacy in this area is enormous. Its response to this whole area has simply been to say that the situation is regrettable, that it is concerned, but to claim that no alternative policies are available. Time prevents me from spelling out detailed alternatives at this stage. Let me say that the policy response of saying that what we have to do is to cut back in the public sector to overcome this interest rate pressure is an absurdity, which I hope I will have more time to expound on at some future date. Let me simply say that there is no evidence whatever that increased public sector activity is causing higher interest rates at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the last point made by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis): There is not necessarily a correlation between an increased public sector and interest rates. But this does depend, as I will no doubt hear the honourable member for Gellibrand say when he eventually expands on this matter, on the way in which the Government will raise its money. There was quite a lot in the speech of the honourable member who just preceded me in the debate that is worthy of comment. He has made a speech which belies the general attitude of the Australian Labor Party in that he appears to be responsibly looking for solutions which would enable more money to be available for people for investment and for the development of Australia. If that is really what he wants then that is also what I want. We want to have enough money around to accommodate the growth that is very strong in this society at the present time. I am not running away from that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Almost at the end of his speech the honourable member talked about what he calls Friedmanism. Of course, we saw Professor Friedman in this country in the past two or three weeks and we listened to some of his theories. We are fairly well aware of what they are. Certainly, one of the things that he has said-the honourable member for Gellibrand seems to disagree with this-is that there is a correlation after some time lag between an increase in the money supply and inflation. If there is one thing that has been proved in this country-I think it has recently been proved also in the United Kingdom, despite what the honourable member for Gellibrand has said-it is that there is after a time lag an increase in inflation following an increase in the money supply. I do not propose to go into the mechanisms that bring that about. The mechanisms are documented. Whatever they are, the process works. Maybe the honourable member for Gellibrand at some time in the future will be able to show us graphs which demonstrate that on some occasions it does not work. The fact is that it does work. The bitter fact of experience in this country is the prime reason the Government is very keen to see that the money supply does not blow out too far. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not want to accommodate rising inflation for all the very good reasons that on so many occasions this Government has enunciated. We see inflation as being a very destructive factor in our economy if it is allowed to run rampant. We saw what happened in the early 1970s when it was allowed to run rampant. I use the word 'allowed' advisedly. We saw inflation creating havoc in this economy, not just because of the way in which it reduced the levels of savings of old people who had put some money away but because of the very reduction in confidence and investment that it brought about. People frankly found that they needed more money every month to invest in productive enterprises for the future production of this country. As I said, inflation is a chaotic indicator to which we must address ourselves. It is the very first thing that we must get rid of. If we do not, we will never succeed in having the sort of good growth in the economy that we are sustaining at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, if one were cynical one would say that the Labor Party wants a higher money supply in order to sustain higher wages. Whilst I do not have any worry about higher wages I say that what we really need is higher wages as a reward for higher productivity. I am not referring just to the wages of wage and salary earners; I am talking about the wages that flow from profits. Surely, that is what we are looking for. Higher wages just in money terms are, in fact, counter-productive. Again, in accordance with those points that I made about inflation they just slow down the economy in the long run, leaving more people worse off, in particular through increased unemployment. Again, that is experience; that is not something that we are theorising about. It is an experience that we in this country can look back on over many years. We can look at the numbers, look at what has happened and look at correlations. </PARA>
<PARA> I just wonder in any case whether the Labor Party is really interested in an increase in the money supply, despite what the honourable member for Gellibrand has said, for the purpose of allowing people to borrow. After all, it is the Labor Party, or certainly a very big section of the Opposition, which deplores profits, deplores people making profits, deplores companies increasing profits. After all, profits are in general use in this country for further investment and the creation of employment. The Labor Party has this great political hang-up in this area. I suppose it arises from the very roots of the party when there was a genuine confrontation between the haves and the have-nots. That situation does not apply any more as one learns when one visits countries such as Japan and Germany. </PARA>
<PARA> People who work for companies in free societies, first of all, have the choice to get out of that situation and start their own businesses. That is what traditionally has happened in many cases in Australia. Secondly, people ought to understand that if the company for which they are working is making a profit they in turn benefit. They benefit through better job opportunities and through better real wages. It is this productive capacity of the country in which the Liberal Party and the Country Party are so interested. The attitude of the Labor Party seems to differ from ours as has been shown by the actions it has taken. Really the record of the Labour Party just demonstrates that it has in the past-it was in power for three years-discouraged investment. It has not had the feeling that it is good for people to save, that it is good for people to make profits so that investments can be made. That lack of investment in the early 1970s really was one of the very major factors in slowing down this economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Thankfully private investment is up very strongly at the present time. In the December quarter last year, for instance-I just cite a statistic-expenditure on non-dwelling construction was 36.5 per cent higher than a year ago and expenditure on other plant and equipment was 17.8 per cent higher. That increase is much higher than the rate of inflation. That is the sort of productive capacity through investment that this Government is looking for. What we are really interested in is full employment with strong growth going right across the country. It is our policies that are ensuring that that is happening at the present time. The Australian Labor Party has an identifiable policy. Despite the fact that the honourable member for Gellibrand raised this matter today and appeared to want an increase in the money supply for the good of the people, I really do not think that he does. </PARA>
<PARA> Admittedly, under our Government the money supply has been relatively tight recently, and the figures show that. It is a seasonal occurrence which we expect every year; there is always a rundown in liquidity. It happened last year, the year before and the year before that. It has happened in most years. Of course things were much more bumpy under the Labor Government. In 1973 the money supply expanded by 26 per cent, whereas in 1974 there was a terrible credit squeeze. Thank heavens, under the present Government we are managing to keep the money supply on a much more even keel so that people can make decisions with a bit more confidence. But I agree that at the present time there are conditions in the economy which, if not managed carefully by a responsible administration, could cause problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The run-down is accentuated a bit this year because of much higher levels of company taxes and provisional taxes than we expected. Basically that means that that amount of money will go out of the banking area and into the Government's coffers. The Government will be running a very strong surplus, as it has traditionally in this quarter. In that respect, money is being sucked out of the system and into the Government's coffers. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that, there are two or three ameliorating circumstances. First of all, even though provisional and company tax levels have risen strongly this year because of better profits made last year, as of today only about half of what we think will be coming in has been paid across. About $2 billion has been collected and about another $2 billion is to come in. So at least some of it is there. Also, the major trading banks are running at a seasonally high liquid and government securities asset ratio of about 22 per cent, so they have three or four per cent that they can run down under the normal arrangements and that will be available. In addition to that, the private sector overall is fairly well prepared for the June quarter tax payments because in the next four months about $4.5 billion in Treasury notes and Government bonds will mature. That will make some funds available-again on a seasonal basis-that are not available as of today. We think that, although the money supply will be fairly tight within these constraints on money supply of a growth rate between 9 per cent and 11 per cent for the full financial year, there will not be undue strain on the system. Nevertheless, I reiterate that the Government is concerned, as it should be concerned, to ensure that, whilst keeping the money supply tight for the reasons that I mentioned earlier, enough money is available for people to make reasonable demands for growth. </PARA>
<PARA> As I believe I said earlier also, what we are trying to do is to accommodate the strong growth in production in Australia. The latest figures indicate that non-farm product may be rising at a rate of over 4 per cent, which in historical terms is really very good-it is certainly the best figure for quite a long time. We need to accommodate that, but we want to remember that we have to bear down on the inflation problem. The inflation rate is probably under 10 per cent although as the honourable member for Gellibrand just said, the level of the implicit price deflator appears to be a bit higher than that, so perhaps 10 per cent is a bit lower than the true situation. Whatever the true situation is, it is a fact that this Government wants to keep bearing down on inflation. It is something we cannot tolerate, nor do I believe any other party should tolerate it. Of course, the history of the Labor Party indicates that it was quite happy to have rampant inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gellibrand mentioned the interest rate rise as something which perhaps should not have been allowed to occur. He appears to fear that we may be approaching-I must say I hope we do-a situation in which interest rates are basically deregulated. He fears that because he sees a deregulated interest rate structure necessarily pushing up interest rates. I think he sees banks or anybody else lending money as greedy and having some power over the market. He sees the effects of deregulation leading to higher repayments for people borrowing money. Again, we all agree that we do not want people to have to pay any more than necessary to borrow money, perhaps especially the people purchasing houses, who are committed long term, who usually have limited resource bases-in other words, normally one or two salaries or wages are earned in a family. </PARA>
<PARA> We understand quite well that a one or two per cent increase in housing loans interest rates is absorbed with great difficulty by the private sector, but what we do not want to run away from is that when interest rates were increased we were in a situation in which the small fellow, the battler, who was seeking to borrow money through the bank simply could not get any money. The banks were in a situation in which, because of the price they had to pay for money outside, or the encouragements they had to give people to leave money with them, they could not find money for the small borrower. They were being forced into the higher interest rates area of the banking system of offering loans of over $100,000, or into channelling money through their finance companies so that they could obtain an even higher rate of interest. The sooner we realise in Australia that we should free interest rates, that we should allow interest rates to meet a market level, the better off we will be all round. When one holds out against a change that is obviously necessary it is particularly difficult when it does occur. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that we could do to lower interest rates would be to let the money supply blow right out. It is a matter of balance. What should we do? Should we bring interest rates down now by suddenly increasing the money supply and making it far more available, perhaps by printing money, or should we adopt a more responsible approach? Should we say: 'Let's keep bearing down on inflation; let's worry about people's investments; let's worry about jobs in the long term and let's worry about the overall growth of Australia'? It is that latter option that the Government chooses. That is why money is not completely freely available. Bearing that in mind, I reiterate that the Government is keeping a very close eye on the situation. We are in roughly the same situation with respect to borrowing as we were in last year. I could talk about quite a number of other things in relation to who is getting the money and who is not. But, basically, we do not see that there will be undue strain in the system in the weeks ahead, towards the end of June. Of course, that is what is to be expected under responsible management. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is discussing this matter of public importance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The developing credit squeeze resulting from the Government's doctrinaire monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we are discussing the extreme monetarist policies of Milton Friedman, of which the best examples in the world today are the policies of the Thatcher Government in the United Kingdom and the Fraser Government here in Australia. Of course, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) would have known that one of the major issues to be discussed in this matter of public importance would be interest rates, the fact that interest rates in Australia today stand at the highest level ever in the history of this country. Yet, on this very important economic policy issue, the Treasurer has abdicated his authority. He has slunk out of the House and has left the whole issue to a backbencher, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury), to protect his back. That is a most extraordinary situation. In other words, the Treasurer is not prepared to come into this Parliament and back up his own policies, the extreme monetarist policies of Milton Friedman. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the issue is the developing credit squeeze. The fact is-the public realises this, or is beginning to realise it-that this squeeze will become more and more extreme as time goes by. For example, by 30 June when all of the large companies start drawing upon the banks to pay their tax bills the supply of money will be very tight indeed. This will have a tremendous effect and will create great hardship for the ordinary people, the small people, the home owners and the prospective home owners of this country. This credit squeeze is widened by interest rate rises, declining building society and bank loans for housing and the continuing contraction of the money supply over the last three months, Ml being the most sensitive indicator. The latest figures which have just been released show an increase. But that increase was purely because of a tremendous inflow of overseas capital to this country in the last month. The position for the general public and the economy is all the worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the interest rates issue. We should keep in mind that the Government promised in 1977 to reduce interest rates by 2 per cent. That is why the Treasurer is not in the House to answer for his own policies today. At a time when the interest rate on bank overdrafts of under $100,000 and home loans stood at 10.5 per cent the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his election policy speech undertook to reduce interest rates by 2 per cent. In other words, he said that the interest rate on bank overdrafts under $100,000 would be reduced to 8.5 per cent. What is it today? It is 12.5 per cent. Far from reducing interest rates by 2 per cent, the Government has done exactly the opposite; it has increased them by 2 per cent. Before the last election the interest rate on overdrafts over $100,000 was 12 per cent to 12.5 per cent. It has now increased to 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government deliberately carried out a policy of allowing the money supply to blow out prior to the election purely for electoral advantage. It is now applying the squeeze in the most harsh way which must create a great deal of hardship. Building society interest rates have increased by one per cent and the pressure is on for them to be increased further, just as the pressure is on for overdraft rates to be dramatically increased. I say once again that the Government's own policy, as announced in 1977, was to reduce interest rates. No wonder people no longer consider it worth accepting the word of this Government. It is a government wracked by internal dissension, as evidenced yesterday. The words of the Government cannot be relied on, particularly when they are enunciated by the Prime Minister. Nobody takes his word any longer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government deregulated interest rates on deposits. I sat in the chamber when the Treasurer made that announcement. He stated that the Government would depend upon the banks' using their new found power responsibly. If they did not use it responsibly interest rates would again be regulated. However, the chase is on to get deposits. Added to that, interest rates charged by banks are being steadily increased. As I said before, there is great pressure to increase them further. It is not that the Government does not have the power to regulate deposit and lending rates. It has those powers under the regulations contained in the banking Act. Furthermore, it also has the power under the Financial Corporations Act to regulate the interest rates of non-banking institutions such as building societies and merchant banks. The legislation was introduced and passed in the Parliament by the previous Labor Government. This Government has flatly refused to promulgate that legislation and to use the instruments it has to protect the public against the excessive, all-time high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Loans from building societies and overdrafts are declining. As evidence of this credit squeeze, special reserve deposits were increased by one per cent from 5 per cent to 6 per cent from 6 January 1981. I am referring to the funds called up from the trading banks by the Reserve Bank of Australia and held in trust by the Reserve Bank, thus removing finance from within the system. At the same time, the Government has increased the interest rate on Australian savings bonds from approximately 10 per cent to 12 1/4 per cent. Once again, this is drawing more finance from the economy. I have already said that liquidity will be tightened further in June when companies utilise overdrafts for tax payments. A very good example of the hardship that this will create is the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> A 1% rise in mortgage rates would mean an extra $5.50 a week or $22 a month in repayments for a person with a $30,000 loan over 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA>I am speaking of housing loans. A $30,000 housing loan today is not large. It is comparative chicken feed, particularly when one considers the cost of housing in Sydney. The total repayment over the life of the loan would rise by almost $7,000. In addition, about 8,000 hopeful new home owners will be priced out of the market by this Government's high interest rate policies and by its deliberate credit squeeze restricting the amount of funds available for home mortgages. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last year interest rates on home loans have increased three times. They are now 2 per cent above their level in March last year. This has meant an extra $43 a month or $10.70 a week in repayments by home buyers with very modest loans of $30,000 over 25 years. These are the issues which we are bringing to the House today. It is extraordinary that on these important issues, the interest rates being charged today which are the highest in the history of the country and the draconian credit squeeze dictated by the policies of Milton Friedman which are followed by this Government, the Treasurer has completely abdicated all responsibility. He has refused to come in to the chamber to answer very important charges about the hardship that he is causing through the policies that he has introduced. He has let a minor backbencher protect him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always interesting to hear the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) working himself into a lather over economic matters. He criticised my good friend the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) for leading for the Government in the debate. The closest the honourable member for Chifley has ever got to an economic argument is the name of his electorate. I think that the former Labor Treasurer and Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, would turn over in his grave if he heard the extraordinary potpourri of ideas and issues that has been put before the House this afternoon by the honourable member for Chifley. The Labor Party is engaging in its annual seasonal charges about interest rates and the tightness of credit. Opposition members say that the big credit squeeze is coming. The last big credit squeeze occurred in 1974 when the honourable member for Chifley and his friends were in office. It was an enormous credit squeeze. It put many people out of business and caused the biggest lift in unemployment the country has seen since the Depression. It followed an expansion of the money supply in 1973 in a manner which was totally auncontrolled and which led inexorably and inevitably to an increase in inflation and unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Currently the situation is well under control despite an alarmist headline in the Australian Financial Review yesterday which stated 'Government losing the money battle'. If that headline were anywhere near true it would make a total nonsense of the suggestion in the matter of public importance that the Labor Party has put up today. The article in the Australian Financial Review accuses the Government of moving in precisely the opposite direction by increasing the money supply far too quickly. The honourable member for Gellibrand and the honourable member for Chifley say that we are squeezing credit and we are squeezing the money supply in a doctrinaire manner allegedly dictated by Professor Friedman. The Government's policy on money supply has been quite consistent over the last five years. There has not been a credit squeeze since the 1974 credit squeeze of ill-fated memory. It is absolute rubbish to say, as the honourable member for Gellibrand said, that everybody is about to fail to get a loan. Last week, in the property section of the Sydney Morning Herald the Property Editor, Mr John Rich, said:</PARA>
<PARA> However, a spokesman for the Australian Bankers Association said that it was not true to say that money was tight. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian banks had loaned $359m to owner-occupiers of houses in February compared with $328m in February 1980. This $39m extra had more than offset the $16m decline in home loans by building societies during the month. </PARA>
<PARA>What did the building societies say? The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> A spokesman for the NSW Permanent Building Society said there was no doubt that less finance was available from societies because of the drain on their deposits as users fulfilled tax commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> This was seasonal. All the indications were that it would soon be easier to obtain money. </PARA>
<PARA>Every schoolboy knows that at this time of year businesses have to pay large amounts of money in tax. They go to their bankers and they say: 'We want to use up some of our overdraft because we have a big tax bill'. Obviously that puts a bit of a squeeze on the borrowing system. Many borrowers always find it harder at this time of year to get money, to get their overdrafts extended. That is as it should be because other borrowers are coming in seasonally and it is necessary to try to maintain an even control over the flow of money. This Government could take the advice of the Opposition and panic at this stage as the Labor Government panicked in 1973. We could let a lot more money out to meet this seasonal demand. If we did this we would be doing it at the same time as there is a big union campaign to get wage increases much higher than productivity increases. Our friends the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union and others are pushing for a 35-hour week across the whole of industry. If there were an expansion of the money supply at this time it would be totally irresponsible. It would mean that that extra money would not be going into real development and real new projects for new job creating activities but it would go into excessive increases in wages-which occurred in 1973; it has all happened before-which would result in higher prices and inflation and we would be back in the same sort of trouble that we were in before. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole business of controlling the money supply is not a doctrinaire matter; it is a matter of practical experience where we have to keep judging it carefully all the time. In the last Budget the Treasurer (Mr Howard) set down a target for the increase of money supply in Australia of between 9 per cent and 11 per cent. That was the target range. Because of the increasing rate of development in Australia which is showing up in more jobs and in more people doing things we are at the upper edge of this range. The Government is certainly finding it difficult to stay within that range of 9 per cent to 11 per cent. Bear in mind that we are at the upper end of that range because it is recognised that there is a lot of extra activity and there is a need not to bring in what the Opposition calls a squeeze. This is fully recognised by the Government and by the Treasurer. It is a good idea to have in the Financial Review the following warning headline 'Government losing the money battle'. That will make people more concerned about controlling the money supply and will make absolutely certain that we do not make the mistakes of 1974-let the money supply out in a panic and let all these wage demands come in and be met by employers who would find it easy to extend their overdrafts and their borrowings, easy to give in to union demands and easy to allow those people in key areas, who can squeeze extra money out of the system without producing extra goods, to destroy the economy at the expense of more unemployed and at the expense of those on fixed incomes and those who do not have the industrial muscle to squeeze out that extra amount. </PARA>
<PARA> That is at the heart of this whole argument. The points that have been put up by speakers from the Opposition have included the usual collection of whinges about particular issues without linking the whole lot together. That is something which the Opposition never did when it was in government. It agreed with a whole lot of people who came along wanting things, but it never did its sums. If one does not go through the whole thing and do one's sums and know what one is finishing up with then one will get into real trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> A point made even today by the honourable member for Gellibrand was that we have this unconscionable, extraordinarily and unnecessarily large inflow of foreign capital. It is the old story of hate the foreigner. If there were not an inflow of foreign capital to assist us with our development does the Opposition think we would have as much money as we now have for housing projects? Where would the money come from? The Government has quite sensible controls over foreign investment. There are rules as to how much foreign investment there can be in any company. There are rules over property purchases by foreign investors. There are sensible rules designed to ensure that Australians retain a stake in the ownership of this country. If we want to cut that off even further we would have to find more local capital for these projects; we would have to squeeze heavily on the housing sector; and we certainly would not be able to buy as many houses or get as much money for housing as we can now. The honourable member for Gellibrand comes up with a whole lot of disconnected requests. There are contradictions in them. If the Opposition wants to stop foreign investment, fair enough, but we will not get development, we will not get more jobs and we will not have as much money for housing which will lead to a generally depressed economy. That is a squeeze of another kind which we certainly do not want. </PARA>
<PARA> There is just one other aspect of this irresponsible attack by the Opposition to which I want to draw attention. In every debate we have had in this House on industrial relations-the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) is at the table at the moment so it is a good time to bring this matter up-the Opposition has argued the case for the organised trade union movement. It has always argued that case regardless of its merits. It has come in as advocates. While pressing for excessively high wages and a 35-hour week at the same time it is pushing for increases in the money supply which will make the campaign successful. So it has a double-edged campaign to destroy the Australian economy. It does both things at the same time. It argues the case for organised trade unionism in all its forms and at the same time it says that we should push up the money supply to accommodate those demands. The end result of that is economic and financial disaster of a kind we have already seen in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to pass on my abundant thanks to whoever was responsible for bringing on these Bills this afternoon instead of at 10 o'clock tonight which is what I was told. That saves me and the House from the danger that the subjects will be stale when I speak on them. At least I will have the advantage of freshness in dealing with the matter now. The Designs Amendment Bill 1981 follows the recommendations of the Designs Law Review Committee chaired by Mr Justice Franki. I assure the House that there has been no precipitate haste in rushing into this legislation. There has been haste in bringing it on this afternoon, but not in preparing it. The commission was given to the Franki Committee by the Gorton Government on 13 October 1970. The Committee reported to the then Labor Government in February 1973. Now, a mere eight years later, legislation is brought into the House. The parent Act is the Designs Act 1906. The Act has been amended from time to time since 1906, as recently as 1979. No substantial amendments have been made since 1968 and this Bill constitutes a fairly comprehensive revision of the Act. Its purpose is to extend patent protection to designs. Since 1906 the whole concept of design had broadened but on the whole the Committee reported in a fairly conservative fashion. For example, in the 1906 Act the definition of 'design' was as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . an industrial design applicable, in any way or by any means, to the purpose of the ornamentation, or pattern, or shape, or configuration, of an article, or to any two or more of those purposes;</PARA>
<PARA>The definition adopted in this legislation is an amalgam of the recommendation of the Franki Committee and the words found in the United Kingdom Registered Designs Act 1949. The proposed definition in the Bill is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ' ''Design'' means features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament applicable to an article, being features which in the finished article can be judged by the eye . . . but does not include a method or principle of construction.'</PARA>
<PARA>In the original Act 'article' means 'any article or substance'. In this Bill 'article' will mean:</PARA>
<PARA>any article of manufacture and includes a part of such an article if made separately. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a slight broadening of the definition. It has to be made clear that the legislation covers only manufactured articles-that is to say, design in a comparatively narrow sense. It does not cover artistic designs such as television logos that are not capable of being affixed to a specific article. That is covered by section 17 (2.) of the 1906 Act, which provides:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the regulations may exclude from registration designs for such articles or for articles included in such classes of articles, being articles that are primarily literary or artistic in character, as are specified in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, would cover much of design, as we commonly use the term, for example as found in television or in computer software operations and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of the legislation is to bring up to date the Act of 1906 in conformity with the changes in the law that have been partly brought about in Great Britain as a result of case law. The most important, I think, has been the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of Utilux Pty Ltd v. Amp Inc., reported in (1972) R.P.C.103. In that case it was held in effect that if an article was made in a certain shape, not in order to make it appeal to the eye of a customer, but solely to make the article work or to perform functional requirements, no design exists within the meaning of the definition in the Registered Designs Act. The Franki Committee report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems likely that these events will induce more manufacturers in the United Kingdom to seek to rely on copyright protection rather than design protection wherever a design incorporates any functional features. We have taken account of the judgment of the House of Lords in our recommendations with respect to the definition of design and the recent decisions of the Chancery Division have had a material effect on our views with respect to the problem of dual protection. </PARA>
<PARA>The report went on in paragraph 255 to state:</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to us that a person should be able to make whatever use of an article he pleases if, in accordance with the usual practice in the industrial field, he finds on a proper examination of the records that the article is not covered by any patent or design protection in Australia. We think it would be highly undesirable for a manufacturer to be placed in a position where, having found that no current letters patent or registered design would prevent him from manufacturing an article, it would nevertheless be unsafe for him to proceed because there might be in existence an artistic work in which copyright might subsist. In addition, at least in most countries, there is no copyright register that can be searched and so there is no way a manufacturer can ascertain the position concerning copyright. This position is made even more unsatisfactory by the fact that copyright might continue to subsist for a very long period, if not indefinitely in the case of engravings and photographs, where the period is dependent upon the date of publication. In cases where the date of publication is relevant, it may be very difficult or, for all practical purposes, almost impossible for a prospective manufacturer to ascertain whether copyright subsists or not, particularly in view of the requirement that a publication that is merely colourable shall be disregarded. In our view a manufacturer should be able to ascertain with a reasonable degree of certainty whether he is free to manufacture an article or not. The existence of the problem of uncertainty has been forcibly brought to our notice by certain comparatively recent cases in the United Kingdom, and several people drew our attention to the problem during public sittings of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The major subjects dealt with in the report of the Franki Committee have been, firstly, the definition of design and the treatment to be accorded to functional features; and secondly, the requirements for registrability of a design, the extent of protection afforded by the expression 'fraudulent imitation' and the protection if any under the Copyright Act which designs applied to industrialised articles should enjoy. This is often referred to as dual protection. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an important addition to the Act in proposed new section 18, which is found in clause 11 of the Bill. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> An application for registration of a design shall not be refused, and a registered design is not invalid, by reason only that the design consists of, or includes, features of shape or configuration that serve, or serve only, a functional purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be diverted to hear that this amendment comes out of a decision of the English Court of Appeal in what is known as the rocking horse case. There was a shifting of one rocking horse from one base to another. It was held that nevertheless it was appropriate for it to be covered by the design legislation, despite the change of base. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn with mild relief to the Patents Amendment Bill 1981, which amends the Patents Act 1952. Its main aim is to amend section 160 of the 1952 Act to provide for extensions of time to be granted where there is a failure to file within the 12 months priority period which is described by international Convention. This, it is hoped, will cover situations such as the disruption of mail by airline strikes or by the mail hold-ups such as the legendary delays at the Redfern Mail Exchange. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of absolute priority in granting patent rights is an extremely important subject. I draw the attention of the House to an article in the Scientific American for January 1981, by David A. Hounshell, entitled 'Two Paths to the Telephone'. It records the extraordinary coincidence, something which abounds in the history of invention, where virtually identical inventions of enormous significance were filed in the patent office on the same day. I refer, of course, to the telephone. Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray both submitted the telephone-that invention which has had such an enormous impact on us all and made the life of politicians miserable-within hours of each other on 11 February 1876. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the United States Patent Office in Washington, D.C. That case can indicate more dramatically than anything else, I think, the enormous significance there is in obtaining a priority in patenting. The name of Alexander Graham Bell has been immortalised and the name of Elisha Gray is one of those extraordinary historical might-have-beens-a character who has been virtually forgotten and pushed to the sideline, like members of the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is another point about patents that I want to draw to the attention of the House. Patent protection has been enormously significant in encouraging the development of invention. The classic case, which is often mentioned and worth repeating, is that of penicillin. When Sir Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928 he thought it would be of some significance to the world, but declined to patent it; he thought it should be available to all without cost. He did not want to benefit financially; he thought it better that penicillin be given freely to the people of the world. Because it was not patented, absolutely no interest was shown in the commercial development of penicillin throughout the 1930s. There were a few minor experiments conducted with it but it was only after it was patented during the Second World War that there was a serious interest in the exploitation-I do not use that word in its pejorative sense-of penicillin. It has been asserted that since the Second World War penicillin has saved more lives than were destroyed in that war. It has had an extraodinary impact on the world since 1944, when it became available in large commercial quantities. Whilst I am not an unqualified supporter of the pharmaceutical industry, I am very conscience of the significance of patent law and the importance of securing adequate rewards for people who develop new processes. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the House also to probably the most important recent case on patent law, Chakrabarty's case in the United States. Its full name is Sidney A. Diamond, Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Petitioner v. Ananda M. Chakrabarty et al. The citation is the United States Surpreme Court Reports 65 L Ed 2d-that is, the second edition-144, 100 S Ct. This is a terrible system of citation and much more complex than ours. The case was decided on 16 June 1980. The summary of the case note reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Decision: Live, human-made micro-organism, held patentable . . . </PARA>
<PARA>SUMMARY</PARA>
<PARA> A microbiologist filed a patent application relating to his invention of human-made, genetically engineered bacteria capable of breaking down multiple components of crude oil, a capability possessed by no naturally occurring bacteria. A patent examiner rejected the microbiologist's patent claim, ruling, among other things, that the bacteria, as living things, were not patentable subject matter under 35 USCS * 101, which provides for the issuance of a patent to a person who invents or discovers 'any' new and useful 'manufacture' or 'composition of matter.' The United States Patent and Trademark Office Board of Appeals affirmed, but the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals ultimately reversed, holding that the fact that micro-organisms are alive is without legal significance for purposes of the patent law (596 F2d 952). </PARA>
<PARA> On certiorari, the United States Supreme Court affirmed. In the opinion by BURGER, Ch. J., joined by STEWART, BLACKMUN, REHNQUIST, and STEVENS, JJ., it was held that a live, human-made micro-organism is patentable subject matter under 35 USCS * 101, such a micro-organism constituting a 'manufacture' or 'composition of matter' within the meaning of * 101. </PARA>
<PARA>Under Australian law it seems certain that the capacity to patent micro-organisms or other living things already exists. It has always been the practice under Australian law to allow for the patenting of hybridisation of plants or breeding of animals. It is true that many people do not avail themselves of the protection of the law. Nevertheless, it has been the practice of the Australian Patent Office to accept such patents. All the Office asks is that there is an element of originality in what is actually done, that it has some commercial significance, that it is essentially new and that it is capable of replication. If those criteria are present then it is possible to patent things relating to the creation and the development of life forms. </PARA>
<PARA> That opens the door to the biotechnology industry, about which my colleagues have heard me utter one or two words in the last few weeks. I hope that it will be possible before long for the House to have some understanding not just of the legal significance of biotechnology vis-a-vis the patent law, and also that it will be possible for us to understand and investigate through a parliamentary select committee what the long term significance is, including the ethical issues such as the implication of cloning, aging and genetic engineering. Section 160 of the Patents Act 1952 is amended to provide a new sub-section (3) as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The time for the doing of an act or the taking of a step may be extended under sub-section (1) or (2) for a further period although-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that time has expired;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that time has previously been extended under this section or another provision of this Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the act or step is in relation to a patent application that has lapsed; or</PARA>
<PARA> (d) that further period has expired. </PARA>
<PARA> (3A) In determining whether to grant an application under sub-section (2), the Commissioner shall have regard to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the nature of the error, omission or circumstances, as the case requires, upon which the application is founded;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the reason for that error or omission or those circumstances, as the case requires;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the time at which the application under sub-section (2) was made;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the length of period for which the extension is sought; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) such other matters as he considers relevant. </PARA>
<PARA>The amending Bill goes on under a further proposed sub-section (3) to state:</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A person who made application under section 160 of the Principal Act before the commencement of this section for an extension of the time within which to do an act or take a step, being an application that was refused before, or is refused after, the commencement of this section, shall not, by reason only of the making or refusal of that application, be prevented from making a further application under any provision of the Principal Act as amended by this Act for an extension of the time within which to do that act or take that step. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the third of the Bills being debated, which is the Trade Marks Amendment Bill 1981. This amending Bill is based on the parent Act, the Trade Marks Act 1955. I must confess that I find myself less happy with this Bill than with the others. Essentially it is a re-writing, and I think an extraordinarily cumbersome re-writing, of section 103 of the Trade Marks Act 1955. It follows a report of the Industrial Property Advisory Committee. I was fascinated to count that the original section 103 of the principal Act runs to 31 lines. The amendment runs to 260 lines and I cannot for the life of me think that those 260 lines represent an improvement. I think it is one of the most abominable pieces of drafting that I have ever read. I am glad that the team that drafted this legislation was not given the task of drafting the Lord's Prayer, the Gettysburg Address or the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. It is a very bad piece of drafting. It intends to amend the provisions of the Trade Marks Act in respect of prohibiting the importation of goods and, if applicable, services bearing a registered trade mark. This Bill has also been considered by a committee as has the Designs Amendment Bill which went through the Industrial Property Advisory Committee. The Trade Marks Amendment Bill also went through a committee under the chairmanship of John Stonier. On page 39 of its report that committee sets out a whole series of recommendations, I think quite elegantly, in five paragraphs. To save the time of the House I ask leave to incorporate that page in Hansard. These recommendations set out what the committee thought should be done to section 103. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>PART III: RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>In the light of what is set out above this Committee makes the following recommendations-</PARA>
<PARA> 3.1 The provisions for seizure and forfeiture of goods under Section 103 should be confined to goods the importation of which infringes a trade mark registered in respect of those goods. </PARA>
<PARA> 3.2 The entitlement of the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark to invoke Section 103 by notice in writing to the Comptroller-General of Customs should be continued and should be available to every such person, whether or not he is a manufacturer, dealer, or trader in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 3.3 A similar entitlement should be available to a registered user of a registered trade mark where he has called upon the registered proprietor to give such a notice and the registered proprietor has refused or neglected to do so within two months after being so called upon, but not in any other circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> In cases of this kind, the registered user's notice shall cease to have effect (except with respect to already seized goods) upon a Section 103 notice subsequently being given by the registered proprietor. </PARA>
<PARA> 3.4 The seizure machinery under Section 103 should be operative on the basis of a general notice of objection establishing to the satisfaction of the Comproller-General of Customs the identity of the trade mark as a registered trade mark and of the person lodging the notice as the registered proprietor (or a registered user who is entitled to give such a notice in accordance with 3.3 above). </PARA>
<PARA> 3.5 The procedures which are available and apply following the seizure of any goods pursuant to a notice of objection given under Section 103 should be as set out in paragraphs 2.41 to 2.54 (inclusive) of this Report. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do make that observation. The Bill is an extraordinarily cumbersome piece of work. The intention of the Bill is to try to make the law somewhat more flexible concerning the importation into Australia of goods which bear an Australian trade mark and which, in fact, have been made overseas by Australian companies. As we know, in the last few years under the deplorable policies of the Fraser Government many Australian firms have moved off-shore-possibly 600. So it would not be too surprising if we saw a product coming in which bore, for instance, a Dunlop Australia Ltd trade mark but which was known to have come all the way from Indonesia or somewhere else in South East Asia. It would be understandable if there were some confusion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The new Bill provides that, where goods have been seized, the Comptroller-General of Customs gives the owner of the goods an opportunity to object and to explain the circumstances under which the goods have been seized. If the person who is the true owner of the trade mark objects and gives notice to the Comptroller-General of Customs that he will institute proceedings, the goods can be held. If the true owner does not so proceed, then the Comptroller-General may exercise his discretion and release the goods. Proposed new sub-section (12)-a very important sub-section-of proposed new section 103 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Comptroller-General of Customs shall release goods seized . . . to the owner on the expiration of the period of one month after the giving of a notice . . . to the objector or the objectors unless an objector has, before the expiration of that period-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) instituted an action or proceeding for infringement of the relevant trade mark in respect of the goods; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) given notice in writing to the Comptroller-General stating that that action or proceeding has been instituted. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the obligation is on the proposed objector. If the proposed objector does not seek to enforce his own rights in the court there is no reason why the Comptroller-General should have to carry the bag for him. So it is a matter of putting responsibility where, I think, it should properly lie. Another provision states:</PARA>
<PARA> Without limiting the relief that a court may grant apart from this section, where an objector has instituted an action . . . in respect of goods seized . . . the court . . . -</PARA>
<PARA> (a) may, at any time, if it thinks just, make an order, subject to such terms . . . as the court thinks fit . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of the House to the second reading speech of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson). I am sorry that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) is at the table at the moment because I raised this matter personally with the Minister for Science and Technology. I thought that the Minister was given a bum steer in his second reading speech. The main argument that is put in the speech-it is put twice-concerns the common law remedy known as 'passing off'. I point out to the House that there is no such thing in common law as a remedy called 'passing off'. Passing off is the offence. There is a remedy in common law against passing off. One cannot describe passing off as a defence. I find it extraordinary-perhaps not so very extraordinary considering how badly drafted the Bill is-that material has been fed to a Minister of the Crown which shows a complete misunderstanding of the nature of a Bill. At common law there is an offence of passing off. But if a plaintiff wanted to secure damages as a result of such an action he would have to prove that his products were identified with the trade mark. He would have to prove that he was going to suffer some loss and prove somebody else was holding himself out as a rightful user of the trade mark when he did not have the right to do so. The legislation means that instead of going through that procedure, which I agree is somewhat cumbersome, it would be possible for this to be handled administratively. </PARA>
<PARA> On the whole, I am not terribly keen about procedures whereby things are taken away from the courts and handled bureaucratically within an administrative system. I think, in this case, it has the merit of common sense. In the circumstances and to the extent that we are able to understand what the Bill actually means, we propose to let it go through. It ought to go back to someone else who could have another look at it and perhaps between here and the other place it could undergo some redrafting. I understand the Senate is doing a lot of redrafting in another matter which is now before that chamber. I do not see why this Bill should not join the queue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to follow the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) in this debate. He is very knowledgeable, particularly on matters of history. I have certainly enjoyed his running through some of the historic events associated with these amending Bills. In fact, there are certain historic reasons why these Bills are before the House today. Because of the expansion and the rapid advancement in technology since the turn of this century Bills associated with design, patents and trade marks are necessary. I will come to that matter later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we look at the oldest of the Acts concerned, the Design Act 1906-I know it has been amended since 1906-it shows why Bills such as these became necessary at the turn of the century. Business has now become more international and has expanded to a great extent. There are greater complexities in deciding who owns designs and who owns patents and who is able to obtain designs and who is able to obtain patents. Of course, the Bill dealing with trade marks is necessary to protect the rights of people who design and manufacture goods. We have a very international situation in business today. That situation will become even more international. Therefore the Bills and the protection that they will afford to various people will become more important. Of course, there is a strong relationship between the Designs Amendment Bill and the Patents Amendment Bill because they both protect inventors, designers, manufacturers and the people to whom inventions and designs have been assigned. These Bills will give significantly greater protection to the consumer. I think we in this Parliament will have to give more time to the question of protecting the consumer, the people who need protection in these complicated situations. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to devote most of my time to the Trade Marks Amendment Bill. Strangely enough, this is the Bill that the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) said that he was least happy about. Yet this Bill can give a great deal of protection to the Australian consumer. The Trade Marks Act, which this Bill seeks to amend, is a tool which has been used by many Australian manufacturers to stop imported goods being made available to the Australian consumer. At times goods can be brought in at a price cheaper than that of the same product manufactured in Australia. Yet, the imported goods are of the same quality and bear the same name as the goods manufactured in Australia. Often the legislation has been used by Australian companies to protect their monopoly situation in Australia from overseas companies which belong to the same international group as the Australian companies. It is for this reason that I offer my congratulations to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) for at last bringing this Bill into the Parliament. I intend to give some recent instances of where the Trade Marks Act has been abused. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="837">Mr BRADFIELD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member dealt quite adequately with the drafting of the legislation and I accept what he had to say. Drafting is more in the honourable member's line of expertise than mine. I am more interested in the practical application of the Bill. Regardless of whether the drafting is lengthy or not I am sure for practical purposes the Bill can certainly do the job for which it was designed. Like the honourable member for Lalor, I must refer to section 103 of the Trade Marks Act simply because this is the main section of that legislation with which this Bill deals. Indeed, basically the whole of this Bill is concerned with section 103. That section, of course, deals with the importation of goods bearing trade marks. It deals with the protection that is afforded to the Australian manufacturer the name of whose product is registered in Australia and bears the same name as an imported product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to give a few instances of how the legislation has been used. I would like to refer to the motor tyre industry as an example of the way in which goods have been protected or kept from the Australian consumer. Before I was elected to this place I happened to be employed in that industry. I know of many instances in which high quality imported tyres bearing the same name as the Australian manufactured product were all of a sudden seized on the wharf. The Australian manufacturer, using the trade marks legislation, had the goods seized. The imported goods were of high quality and usually available at a cheaper price to the Australian consumer. That is probably the reason they were purchased overseas in the first place. Yet, the consumer has been denied a quality product which has a price advantage over the Australian product. The Australian business which chose to import the goods has been financially disadvantaged because the goods were seized. As a result the Australian manufacturer of the same goods was in a monopolistic situation. I have mentioned the tyre industry. However, this sort of thing happens in most industries-the automotive industry, the electrical appliance industry and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> In the international business situation today companies bearing the same name manufacture in different countries. The Trade Marks Act was used by companies to keep goods in the countries where those companies wanted the goods kept. As a result it has been impossible for anyone to move goods from one country to another. The honourable member for Lalor mentioned the fact that the problem is probably due to Australian companies going overseas. That is not right. This would be only a minute part of the problem. The problem is one of big international companies-the companies that the honourable member does not like-which have been able to use this situation to protect a situation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like briefly to congratulate the Minister for introducing this legislation. I think the Australian consumer will benefit considerably from the protection afforded the Bills. I think the legislation can only be of advantage for Australian industry. I support the three Bills introduced by the Minister. They are complicated Bills but they are very necessary. They are necessary in particular because they will keep business in Australia competitive and protect the Australian consumer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that when I agreed to speak in this debate I thought we would also be discussing a fourth Bill which is associated with the three Bills before the House-the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Amendment Bill. I understand that that is not the case. Therefore I shall confine my remarks to the three Bills which have been referred to by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) and other speakers. The legislation, which obviously goes to particular questions of industrial design, patents and trade marks, is of some importance because it touches on the question of industrial innovation and technology and the need to provide appropriate protection for people, particularly in relation to design and patenting for innovation and changes that might be brought about. The honourable member for Lalor spoke about the importance of looking at this legislation within a national context and the need to protect Australian industrial design and Australian patents against what clearly is a highly competitive situation internationally. Very often companies and designers in Australia are not able and have not been able to achieve that protection within the parameters of existing legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly questions of technology are rarely questions of technology alone. One has always to look at technology not only in terms of its relationship in this case with the law that exists but also in terms of property relations. If I could speak in rather general terms about the legislation, one of the concerns that I certainly have is that we have not had in this country a history of being able to develop what I would call indigenous technology or to establish a situation of technological sovereignty. I believe not only this legislation but also other legislation which is being introduced by the Government is designed to try to move us rather further in that direction. I believe that that is extremely important. The Australian economy is currently passing through an important period of restructuring-that restructuring is occurring as a result of international pressures-which, in part, is taking place on the basis of the argument that Australia ought to structure its economy in a way which gives it the maximum international comparative advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> The two areas around which it has been suggested that the Australian economy ought to be restructured, and in which it has a comparative economic advantage, are the areas of resource development and the development of high technology industries. It is that second category which is more relevant to this legislation. It is of concern to me that historically we have not been able to develop technology in this country for a number of reasons, some of which are related to the systems of protection which exist, including the extent to which a technology development in Australia can be protected against international competition. To some extent these Bills deal with legal matters related to that. As I suggested, one cannot separate the legalities of a situation from economic policy, market forces and property relations. Property relations are not simply a matter of trade marks-not simply a matter of the registration of a design. They also involve access to capital and the way in which capital may be integrated internationally. I think the honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield) referred to the way companies were able to operate through their international relationships to ensure access to, for example, Australian markets and very often override areas where Australia may have had a comparative economic advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst these Bills are important in terms of the legalities of the situation, the problems that companies will face if they are to develop and establish leadership in technological innovations will go beyond what these Bills will be able to achieve, or even Bills in relation to international incentives would be able to achieve. I believe that these are extremely important issues that this Parliament ought to be addressing itself to. We ought to set as an objective for Australia the achievment of a much greater degree of technological sovereignty. These Bills are important to that in terms of certain legalities, but to spell out a policy on technological sovereignty would involve canvassing issues which go well beyond these Bills. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The fundamental goal of this Government in the health area is to ensure that all Australians have proper access to health care services of high quality at a cost the individual and the community can afford. A large and increasing amount of scarce resources is being allocated to the health area to maintain the high quality services we have all come to expect. Clearly, if this level of quality is to be maintained, given priorities in other areas, every effort must be made to ensure that the resources allocated to the health area are used in an efficient and cost effective way. It is not an exaggeration to state that the health care delivery system could become a bottomless pit down which an ever increasing proportion of the gross domestic product could be poured without any real increase in the health standards of Australians. All of us, whether we be providers or recipients of health care, should be conscious of the cost of health services. For example, health professionals should become aware of the high cost of some individual services that they provide or seek access to when simpler procedures would be as effective. Equally individuals should become aware of the cost of the services they use by contributing to the cost of such services. Those responsible for the operation of health institutions must also be fully responsible for ensuring that they provide services on the most efficient basis possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For many years concern has been expressed about the nature and distribution of the institutions, particularly hospitals, which provide our health care services. Hospitals consume by far the greatest amount of resources allocated to health care. They are expensive institutions to run. In many cases they are not physically located to ensure easy access by the community which they serve nor do they necessarily provide the types of services required by that community. Duplication of services between hospitals exists, particularly in the area of high cost technology. Regrettably many hospitals compete with others in an attempt to provide all services without any regard to duplication, needs, priorities or costs. If hospitals are to be used effectively, it is important that those people admitted actually require the services provided. It is important to ensure that where a person can be adequately cared for at home appropriate support services are available. For too long hospitals generally have concentrated on providing services within the hospital rather than in the community. The Commonwealth has reacted to this and through the domiciliary nursing care benefit and the home nursing subsidy schemes, has attempted to encourage people to remain in the community rather than be institutionalised where this was not required. More needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises too that private hospitals form an integral part of the hospital system in any one State. It is important that a balance between public and private hospital beds be maintained. The Commonwealth believes that any growth of private hospital beds should be consistent with overall State priorities for hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth also recognises the important role of private doctors in providing health services in the community. In the great majority of cases general practitioners provide primary health care services on the most cost-effective basis. The Government therefore believes that the important role of general practitioners should be enhanced, wherever possible, and should continue to be the first point of contact for patients with the health care system. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to ensure that these general objectives are met the Government believes that firm measures should be adopted so that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) States fully accept their constitutional responsibility for the provision of health services and determine their own priorities as to how funds are to be allocated to the different parts of the health system. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) All Australians become far more responsible for their own health care needs and lifestyle and more aware of the full cost of the health services available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Special assistance schemes designed to cover people's hospital and medical bills are only available to those in genuine need, namely eligible pensioners and the disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Those people in the community who can pay their own way should be required to contribute to the costs of the health services they receive-either by personal payment or through health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> (v) Health insurance should be available to all at a reasonable cost and should have wide coverage in order to support the community rating principle. </PARA>
<PARA> (vi) Government assistance towards the health costs of those who can afford to contribute towards their health services should be restricted to those who are willing to help themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> (vii) The important role of the private sector of the health care delivery system should be fully acknowledged and action should be taken to ensure that the private hospital sector continues as a viable complement to the public system. </PARA>
<PARA> (viii) Providers of health care services should be more aware of the costs they generate. </PARA>
<PARA>Concern over Australia's burgeoning health bill and significant doubts as to whether the large sums of taxpayers' funds allocated to health were being spent properly led to the Commonwealth establishing the Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals in 1979. The Government believes that the Commission's report has shown that the Government's concern was justified. The health care delivery system in this country is extremely complex and its many parts are interrelated. It is therefore essential that any review of a major part of that system, such as public hospitals, should be carried out in the context of the Commonwealth's overall health policy. The Government has done so over recent months. I believe that the Commission's report has provided a sound basis on which to develop an equitable and responsible health policy. The co-operation of all those involved in the health and care delivery system will, however, be required if that policy is to benefit all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>Public Hospital Funding Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>At present, under the hospital cost sharing arrangements, the Commonwealth shares with the States the agreed net costs of operating their public hospitals systems. Honourable members will be aware that these agreements are due to expire on 30 June 1981 except for South Australia and Tasmania. The agreements with South Australia and Tasmania expire on 30 June 1985. In 1976, these agreements were re-negotiated with the States to remove the open-endedness of the original agreements negotiated by the Whitlam Government. History shows that the decision to re-negotiate the agreements was correct at a time when hospital costs were accelerating. Since 1976 growth in recognised hospital expenditure has slowed down markedly. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the considerable success of these agreements in slowing down the rate of growth in hospital costs the Jamison inquiry was highly critical of them. The inquiry said that the agreements concentrated on reimbursement of expenditure. As a result little account was taken of the relative needs within and between States for hospital and health services, their distribution and their accountability. States with the most expensive and inefficient hospital systems at the commencement of the cost-sharing arrangements received proportionately more funds than States which had attempted to move with the times, to remove wasteful and inefficient services and facilities, and concentrate on services appropriate to the communities that they serve. The Commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Cost-Sharing Agreements have rewarded the expensive and punished the efficient and have perpetuated rather than solved some of the main problems in Australia's health system. </PARA>
<PARA>I should point out also that even in those States which have made attempts to remove waste and inefficiency, there is still much more work to be done. Today, the members of the community cannot be expected continually to support, by way of taxation and their own personal expenditures, any wasteful and inefficient public hospital systems in Australia. In the face of the evidence produced by Jamison and earlier inquiries, failure by the Commonwealth to ensure that efficiencies are effected would mean that it would be abrogating its proper responsibilities. The Commonwealth cannot stand on the sidelines and see taxpayers and health fund members bearing increasing costs because of inefficiencies, inequities, and unnecessary duplication in public hospitals. On the basis of its criticisms of the cost-sharing agreements the Commission of Inquiry recommended that the agreements due to expire should not be renewed. The Government has accepted that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> In its consideration of the funding arrangements that should replace the existing hospital cost-sharing agreements the Commission found that a major factor behind such inefficiencies was the divided responsibility between the Commonwealth and States. The Commission therefore recommended that the States should be required to take up their full constitutional responsibility for the provision of health care services. The Commission also recommended that the level of Commonwealth funding for the States' health services should be altered so that the amount of funds provided was based more closely on States' needs-as determined by their respective populations and taking into account recognised measures of efficiency. The Commission recognised also that there was a need for States to be able to use health funds provided by the Commonwealth for priority areas in their health service system rather than be confined to narrow program type funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been considering a range of options aimed at overcoming the problems highlighted by the Commission in this vital area. It agreed with the Commission that the responsibility of the States should be more clearly defined and that they should be required to take up their full responsibilities for the provision of health services. It also agrees that a new method for determining funding levels should be introduced. In reaching this decision the Government has been mindful of the warning of the Commission of Inquiry that one should hasten slowly. Quite clearly in a situation involving hospitals where there is a large capital investment and where some communities have become used to facilities or services-even when they are not needed-dramatic changes cannot be made overnight. The Jamison report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . sharp, sweeping changes can be disruptive and impractical . . . Much can be gained from continual small measures, rather than from sweeping structural change. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has therefore decided that the funds it provides for public hospitals, the general Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme should be included in general revenue grants. This will afford the States the greatest possible freedom as to how the moneys to be allocated are spent. There will be no requirements laid down as to the services to which they should be allocated. The States will be totally responsible for making such decisions. Further, the Government has decided that, at least for the initial period of the new arrangements, the amount to be included in the general tax sharing arrangement should be identifiable as representing the Commonwealth's contribution to the cost of the health services provided by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the importance of ensuring that funds for health services allocated to the States are appropriately based, the Government has also decided that the determination of an appropriate mechanism for allocating funds between States in the longer term should be referred to the Grants Commission. The Commission will be asked to look specifically at relativities between States and to design incentives for States to correct inefficiencies in their health systems. The Commonwealth firmly believes that the peoples of each State will, as taxpayers, fully support the Government's decisions since the proposed measures are designed to ensure the maintenance of the high quality of health care delivery systems in Australia while protecting the position of all taxpayers by ensuring that the greatest value possible is received for each dollar spent on health services provided by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the House's attention to the fact that the Commonwealth has decided that the position of eligible pensioners and their dependants should be protected at all times under the proposed funding arrangements. The Commonwealth will continue to meet this responsibility in the hospitals area by requiring States to provide free public hospital accommodation and treatment for such pensioners. The Commonwealth will also ensure that free hospital services will continue to be provided to the disadvantaged. The Government will consult with the States on the question of appropriate administrative arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth holds the view that there should be consistency between the definition of the disadvantaged used by States in relation to public hospitals and that followed by the Commonwealth in relation to the bulk billed medical services provided to them. The Government believes that only eligible pensioners and their dependants and the disadvantaged as defined should be protected in this way. It further believes that all other persons should be required to contribute towards the cost of services received in institutions particularly hospitals and that States should take appropriate actions to ensure that they do. The Government recognises that such actions should result in increased revenues being raised for both inpatient and outpatient services particularly if the States raise the bed day charge in public hospitals from $50 for a shared room and $75 for a private room to a level which more closely approximates the actual daily bed cost involved. </PARA>
<PARA> As any increases in revenue resulting from such actions would reduce the net operating cost of the States' public hospital systems, the Commonwealth is of the view that its funding in this area can be appropriately reduced on a progressive basis without jeopardising the quality and standard of care now provided in public hospitals. The new arrangements will, from the Commonwealth's point of view, apply from 1 September 1981. The Government has therefore decided that the funding to be allocated to New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory that represents its interest in the provision of health services should be equal to the sum necessary to maintain in real terms the funding provided in 1980-81 for public hospitals, the general Community Health Program, and the School Dental Scheme, less a share of the revenue the States could be reasonably expected to raise through the introduction of appropriate inpatient and outpatient charges in 1981-82 and the user pays principle in public hospitals. It is expected that the funds to be allocated to South Australia and Tasmania will be based on the existing hospital cost-sharing arrangements. However, the Commonwealth will be seeking to adjust those agreements to ensure that conditions relating to free access to public hospitals are uniform across Australia. The resultant total sum involved is expected to be about $1,250m. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that if the States accept the Government's view that free access to public hospitals should be restricted to eligible pensioners and their dependants and the disadvantaged as defined by the Commonwealth, they will not be required to introduce a means test. I further emphasise that no State will be required to introduce inpatient and/or outpatient charges for any or all persons. However, should any State decide that free public hospitals should be provided to all persons it will be required to meet the extra cost involved out of its own resources. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of the Aged, the Chronically Ill and the Disadvantaged</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>As I emphasised earlier, the Government will be acting to ensure that free access of eligible pensioners and the socially disadvantaged to public hospitals is maintained. The Government will also continue to protect the position of such people in relation to their medical costs. It has therefore decided to retain the present arrangements in relation to eligible pensioners and their dependants. However, it has decided that new arrangements should be introduced for the disadvantaged. The Government has decided to do so because of a dual concern, namely, that bulk billed medical services provided under the existing disadvantaged arrangements are growing at a rate which indicate that those services have been made available to persons who could not normally be regarded as disadvantaged; and people in genuine need are not always able to gain the protection of those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that the following groups in the community should be regarded as disadvantaged: All migrants and refugees in their first six months in Australia; current unemployment and special beneficiaries who meet the pensioner health benefit income test; and other persons who meet a specified income test. In respect of bulk billed medical services received by such people a Commonwealth medical benefit of 85 per cent will be payable as is now the case in relation to eligible pensioners. Doctors will be able to bulk bill the Government for such services or a disadvantaged person may take a doctor's account to a health fund for payment of the appropriate Commonwealth medical benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that the current Commonwealth medical benefit for services provided to the disadvantaged is 75 per cent of the schedule fee. This new arrangement means that the insured population, eligible pensioners and the disadvantaged will receive benefits for scheduled medical services at approximately the same level. This new arrangement will operate from 1 September 1981. It is expected that a maximum of one million people will be eligible for assistance under this scheme. I now seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a statement of the main details of the new arrangements to apply in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH</PARA>
<PARA>Definition of the Disadvantaged</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Under the Commonwealth definition of the disadvantaged the following would be included:</PARA>
<PARA> Migrants and refugees in the first six months in Australia-(no income test);</PARA>
<PARA> Current unemployment and special beneficiaries (including dependants) with private incomes below the PHB limits. </PARA>
<PARA> This group would not become PHB 'pensioners' and would not qualify for other Commonwealth 'fringe benefits';</PARA>
<PARA> A married couple who have a joint income less than the cut-out point for unemployment benefits for a married couple (rounded up to the next whole dollar) plus $20 and twice the rate of additional benefit for each child. On this basis the income limit is $160 a week for a married couple plus $20 for each child. </PARA>
<PARA> For a sole parent, with one child, the income limit will be the same as for a married couple. For each additional child, the limit will increase by $20. </PARA>
<PARA> For single people, without dependants, the income limit will be 60 per cent of the income for a married couple i.e. $96 per week. </PARA>
<PARA>Overall approximately 1 million persons are expected to be covered by the new arrangements. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members will be aware that the assistance provided by the Commonwealth to help cover the hospital and medical bills of eligible pensioners is considerable. The cost of such assistance on the medical side alone is now running at $300m annually. Despite this the Government believes that further assistance should be given to protect the aged and chronically ill in relation to the cost of nursing home care. It has therefore decided that it will take over full responsibility for the payment of nursing home benefits from 1 September 1981. At present the Commonwealth pays nursing home benefits only for uninsured persons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The estimated cost of this decision is $120m annually. This is expected to take the Commonwealth assistance to nursing home patients to about $560m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to increase its assistance for the aged and the chronically ill through greater support for organisations providing home nursing services. The Government believes that such services increase the quality of life of people receiving them and help contain costs by keeping people out of institutions when there is no medical reason for them to be there. As honourable members may be aware, a number of home nursing services have expressed concern at the restriction imposed in 1976 on the number of nurses the Commonwealth will subsidise under the Home Nursing Subsidy Scheme. Recognising the important work carried out by these organisations, the Government has decided that this restriction on the number of nurses subsidised by the Commonwealth should be lifted as from 1 July next. The immediate effect of this will be that additional Commonwealth subsidies will be paid in respect of about 195 nurses. The estimated full year cost of this decision is $1m. </PARA>
<PARA>Health Insurance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As I stated at the outset, the Government believes that health insurance should be available to all Australians at a reasonable cost and should have a wide coverage of the population in order to support the community rating principle. Regrettably, the combination of free public hospitals to all people irrespective of their incomes and the existing Commonwealth medical benefit arrangements has resulted in a gradual erosion of health fund membership and, as a result, of the community rating principle. If this trend were to continue it could threaten the Government's health insurance policy, the viability of the health funds and the position of those dependent on insurance-taking special account of the aged, the chronically ill and families with children. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to arrest that trend and bring about an increase in the numbers of people insured the Government has decided that the following major changes should be made to the present health insurance arrangements: Firstly, tax rebate separate from the existing concessional rebate arrangements will be introduced for the cost of basic hospital and medical insurance with registered health funds with effect from 1 July 1981. The rebate will be set initially at 32 cents in the dollar. Full details of this decision are to be announced by my colleague the Treasurer (Mr Howard) later today. Secondly, Commonwealth medical benefits will be restricted to those people with at least basic medical cover with a registered health fund. Thirdly, a flat rate Commonwealth medical benefit of 30 per cent will apply to all scheduled medical services and the existing 0-$20 arrangements will be abolished. Fourthly, the Government's payment to assist health funds to help cover the hospital costs of the chronically ill will be set at $100m. Fifthly, the basic level of medical insurance will be increased from 75 per cent to 85 per cent of the schedule fee with a maximum payment of $10 per service and, sixthly, current insurance tables classed as optional to basic will be prohibited. Unless indicated elsewhere, the commencement date for implementation of these decisions is 1 September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members will be aware, basic health insurance covers benefits in medical and hospital insurance as defined in the National Health Act. Basic medical insurance will, as from 1 September next, provide to the insured contributor medical benefits at 85 per cent of the schedule fee with a maximum patient payment of up to $10 a medical service at schedule fee levels. Basic hospital insurance provides hospital benefit at the level of charges on insured persons for shared ward accommodation in public hospitals and other such approved charges-for example, out-patient-in public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition the Government has decided that it should enter into urgent discussions with the health funds to establish a mechanism to protect members of registered health funds in the event of the collapse of such a fund. The Government is concerned to ensure that health fund members are not financially disadvantaged should any funds cease operation. However it would expect that such a mechanism would be fully financed by the health insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated earlier, the Government believes health insurance should be encouraged. The decision to introduce a tax rebate is a major step designed to promote that objective. It will significantly assist all those who take out health insurance. These decisions are based on the Government's firm view that community support towards health costs through insurance should be based on: the community rating principle; and significant Commonwealth subsidisation that is financed through the general taxation arrangements. The Government firmly believes that such support, when coupled with special arrangements to protect the more needy sections of the community, is the most equitable and responsible means of providing health insurance cover. </PARA>
<PARA>The Private Sector</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government fully recognises the valuable role played by the private sector of the health care delivery system. It believes that a strong health insurance industry underpins the continued viability of the private sector. The Government is particularly aware of the importance of private hospitals, particularly religious and charitable hospitals. Private hospitals are an essential component of Australia's health care delivery system that should be maintained and strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that possible action by the States to confine free access to public hospitals to those in genuine need and possible State action to increase public hospital charges will considerably strengthen the position of private hospitals in the medium to longer term. However it is aware of the increasing cost of servicing surgical beds in private hospitals when compared with medical and other beds and that action is required to ensure that such beds continue to be available to the community. The Government has therefore decided to increase the present $16 per day bed subsidy for surgical patients in private hospitals to $28. The existing bed day subsidy level of $16 will be retained for other private hospital patients. </PARA>
<PARA>The Control of Health Services Costs</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As I stated at the outset, the Government is keen to ensure that health services are not unnecessarily requested by consumers or ordered by providers and that abuses do not occur. As part of this the Government has been carrying out an ongoing review of the Commonwealth medical benefits arrangements for some years now to ensure that benefits are paid only where services are reasonably required for medical treatment and to prevent abuse. Recommendations on further changes to the medical benefits schedule are currently being finalised by my Department for submission to me with a view to implementing changes as from 1 July next. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also taken action to reduce the incidence of abuse by those few people in the health care profession who may seek to misuse or defraud the system for their own gain. A major example was the establishment of medical services committees of inquiry in 1977. These committees are effectively a peer review system designed to prevent over-servicing by doctors. The Government has recently agreed to a number of changes to the committees' operation which should considerably increase their effectiveness. I will be announcing details of these changes when I introduce the necessary amendments to the Health Insurance Act later in this parliamentary session. In addition I am currently examining, in conjunction with the Attorney-General, a number of other suggestions designed to strengthen further the effectiveness of these committees. Subject to the outcome of discussions on these proposals I would expect that the resultant changes would be introduced as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jamison inquiry made recommendations in the area of salaried medical practice. The Government has considered these recommendations and has decided that it should consult with the States on the matter. However, the question of the administration of hospital systems is primarily a matter for the States. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The overriding aim of the Government's health policy is that all Australians should have access to high quality health care. At the same time, individuals should be encouraged to be more responsible for their health care needs. The system must be equitable, paying particular attention to the capacity of individuals to contribute towards their health costs. But it is also important that all governments ensure that the high costs involved in maintaining that system do not cripple the general community. The Government's health policy, therefore, should also be responsible, providing adequate checks and balances to prevent abuses. The decisions I have spelt out today will ensure that both these objectives are met through special assistance to help cover the hospital and medical costs of those in genuine need; ensuring that those who are in a position to do so should contribute towards the cost of the health services they receive; the promotion of insurance for those providing such a contribution through subsidy arrangements financed through the adoption of health service funding arrangements designed to minimise waste and inefficiency in costly institutions; and acting to ensure that consumers and providers of hospital and medical services do not abuse the health care delivery system. I commend the statement to the House. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As my colleague the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) has just informed the House, the Government has decided to introduce a new concessional rebate for health insurance contributions. My colleague has explained the nature of this new concessional rebate, which will be rebatable outside the $1,590 rebate block at the standard rate which is presently 32 per cent. I emphasise that the tax savings from this new concession will not depend on a taxpayer's total rebatable expenditure exceeding $1,590.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government believes the introduction of a concessional rebate for health insurance will be widely welcomed and will, it believes, be of particular benefit for Australian families. In considering the introduction of this new concession the Government has given very great thought to the question of tax indexation. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated in the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of September 1980 the existing policy of half-tax indexation will provide taxation reductions of about $500m in a full year commencing in July next. As honourable members will be aware, there are significant arguments for and against tax indexation and I shall not weary the House today by canvassing all of those arguments. It is true, as members of the Government have frequently stated in the past, that tax indexation does oblige governments to legislate tax increases and, to that extent, has been a discipline. It could equally be said, however, that to the extent to which either expenditures or revenues are automatically indexed, the Budget flexibility available to a government to respond to changed economic circumstances is thereby reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has now decided that discretionary adjustments to taxation scales and allowances are preferable to tax indexation. However, the Government is conscious of the precise terms of what was said in the Prime Minister's policy speech and accordingly I confirm that half-tax indexation will apply from 1 July next, thus providing in full the benefit of some $500m foreshadowed in that speech. However, that tax indexation adjustment will be the last indexation adjustment. Future taxation adjustments will be determined-usually in the Budget context-on a discretionary basis and in accordance with economic considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> As with similar rebates in respect of special categories of expenditure the medical insurance rebate will generally speaking be recieved on assessment. As a consequence, the revenue impact of introducing this new concession will be negligible in 1981-82. The full-year cost of the new concessional rebate for health insurance will be in the order of $600m. Legislation providing for the half-tax indexation adjustment will be introduced into the House later this session. I shall also, at a later date, be providing details of the half indexation factor to apply in respect of 1981-82 and details of the impact of half-tax indexation on taxation scales in that year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to place the two statements that have been made today in the background of the last 18 months of indecision in the field of health. In a sense tonight's decisions flow from the problems of that accumulating indecision. These problems flow from 18 months in which no decisions of any significance in the health field have been made despite considerable disquiet amongst most health care organisations. Throughout 1980 we were assured that no decisions could be made because the Government was waiting on the Jamison report. Certainly the Government displayed great impatience to get the Jamison report, compelling the Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals to report prior to effective completion of that report. There is the pathetic note in Volume 2 of the report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of time constraint for the presentation of the Report imposed in the Letters Patent, this Volume is not in a form as refined as the Commission otherwise would have arranged. Detailed editing and normal proof reading have not been possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Anyone who has read that massive document knows of its state of incompletion and knows that there was not an opportunity to finish it off as the commissioners would have preferred. The Government was impatient to get that report in December 1980. But has displayed no impatience whatsoever in the past four months. It has had that report now for four months. We know that it has caused deep internal divisions within the Government. We gather that the manic obsession of one man to get his own way within the Cabinet has led to conflicts between him and his Minister for Health of which I shall give examples in a moment. Of course, it has been climaxed by this afternoon's confusion because this statement has been put off again and again as the Minister's office tried to put together all those last minute pieces of paper reflecting last minute revisions in the document. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) told us in his statement concerning the Jamison report:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Commission's report has provided a sound basis on which to develop an equitable and responsible health policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Anybody who has read the Jamison report knows that the statements that have just been made derive not at all from the Jamison report. Indeed the Government has deliberately ignored the major findings of the report in the two major decisions that the Government has made. In this gobbledegook-that is what the first half dozen of these pages are-the Minister has assured us that that report has provided a sound basis for his policy. Let me just take the two major examples. Jamison opposed the absorption of hospital costs into general revenue grants to the States. Yet the Government has ignored him. Let us see what the Liberal Minister for Health, Mr Borthwick, in Victoria-he is no friend of the Australian Labor Party-had to say about the way the Jamison report has been used by this Government. Let me quote from a statement published in the Age on 14 April 1981. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> He said it suggested that Mr MacKellar had used the Jamison inquiry into hospitals, released in January, ''as a cynical exercise and not as a genuine method of arriving at more efficient and equitable means of health funding''. </PARA>
<PARA>And this is the important point:</PARA>
<PARA> ''The Jamison inquiry was a joint exercise between the Commonwealth and the States aimed at finding a rational basis for the funding of health services. Your Government's proposal to make critical decisions in this area without consulting the States is outrageous,'' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The important point is that the Jamison committee was a joint committee. Its terms of reference were provided by the States and the Commonwealth to find an agreed and rational policy on hospitals. Yet this Government has rejected the major finding of the Jamison report on hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, regarding health insurance, even the Jamison committee, during its discussions on all the reactionary alternatives that it could find, did not contemplate a general deductibility health insurance scheme, but the Government has opted for one. Let me make it quite clear where this Government stands in relation to Jamison. It has ignored the major recommendation in relation to hospitals. The proposal which the Government has come up with in relation to health insurance was not discussed by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me outline what the Minister has done in relation to hospitals. His general assumption is stated thus:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has therefore decided that the funds it provides for public hospitals, the general Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme should be included in general revenue grants. </PARA>
<PARA>That proposal has been opposed by Jamison. Let us look at what Jamison said about that proposal. He opposed the proposal on the following grounds:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's view is that the existence of some form of identified funding for health services has come to be generally accepted as a means of ensuring that a high standard of health care is available across State boundaries for the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the basic reason. Because of a concern for a national hospital provision Jamison opposed the major proposal which the Government has made this afternoon. Of course, it is not just Jamison. Every major national health organisation is this country has opposed the proposal. Let me start with the Australian Medical Association. The AMA recommended:</PARA>
<PARA>The present Commonwealth-State hospital cost-sharing arrangements be replaced by special purpose grants rather than the absorption of the health budget into general purpose payments to the States. These special purpose grants are designed to maintain national health care standards. </PARA>
<PARA>So the AMA in its submissions to the Government quite clearly opposed what has been the major proposal today regarding hospitals. The Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia also opposed what has been the Government's major proposal. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>The proposal for absorbing hospital funding into the general revenue grants to the States would seem to have serious disadvantages. Without the Commonwealth placing conditions upon its hospital grants to States there would no longer be a national hospitals policy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Hospital Association also opposed the proposal. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The AHA supports the end to the Cost-Sharing Agreement, but only when an adequate block grant formula is developed. </PARA>
<PARA>So there we have it. All the major national organisations oppose the proposal that has been introduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just discussing it. The Jamison committee also opposed the proposal but, even more interestingly, it appears that the Minister opposes the proposal that he introduced this afternoon. In the Age on Friday, 27 February, the Minister is reported to have told a back bench committee of his own party something which has not been denied in the Age, even though the Minister has had some months in which to do so. Numerous other statements have confirmed his position. Let me quote the article at length. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr MacKellar told Wednesday's back bench committee meeting that there needed to be a national approach to hospital care. If hospital grants were absorbed, a national approach would be destroyed, and standards and conditions would vary. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member can check with Michelle Grattan. The Minister is reported to have stated that a national approach to hospital care would be undermined if there were an absorption of grants. The statement has never been denied. So there we have the reported, undenied view of the Minister himself. Jamison and every major health organisation in the country is opposed to what has been announced today. Even the Minister seems to have doubts about his own policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is, of course, no doubt to be explained by what we were told in the House yesterday-that one man in the Government has an obsessive determination to get his own way despite the views of his Ministers and despite the views of most informed national providers of health care in this society. Those groups and the Minister for Health, I think, have very good reasons for the positions they took. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me suggest some of the reasons why it is unwise and likely to be disastrous for this country to abandon a major Commonwealth input to priorities in relation to hospitals, the community health programs and school dental services. First of all, the point has been made in numerous statements that there should be a national provision. Surely, at the end of the twentieth century we should have advanced sufficiently far to have some notion that in the field of health there is a need for a national provision, a national overview, of hospitals and health services in this country. This is undermined by the decision that has just been made. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, if one is concerned with efficiency in health services then surely the system of insurance or health cover, which is a Commonwealth responsibility, should also be linked with responsibility in relation to the hospitals themselves. As we know, at the moment many of the problems arising in the hospital sector are arising because of problems and faults in the health insurance system. Those two have to go together. For the Commonwealth Government to go on retaining the health cover system while handing back the responsibility for hospitals to the States is clearly to introduce inefficiencies into the system. This divorce between the responsibility for national health cover and responsibility in relation to hospitals will clearly lead to inefficiency. Let us admit quite clearly that there will have to be, however it is done, an interdependence in these responsibilities. But this Government is giving away major elements whereby the Commonwealth can make an effective contribution to an inevitable interdependence. As things are at this stage in this society, we will never get rid of Commonwealth involvement in the health field. But by these decisions, we are giving away a major way in which the Commonwealth can participate effectively in that inevitably interdependent relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> Again we see this interdependence in another weakness that has arisen. We will have the most complex administrative procedures to ensure that the Commonwealth will cover all those patients in public hospitals who are pension beneficiaries or disadvantaged persons. I am happy with some of the decisions that have been made in that field but, because of the division of responsibility, there will be the most horrendously complex system whereby the Commonwealth will meet its funding commitments to all those groups for hospitals which are now fully in the hands of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the decision on absorption will also lead, quite clearly, to the ending of the free public hospital system in this country. No doubt some members on the other side of the House will be happy that the experiment in free public hospitals in this country has been brought to an end. Quite clearly, it is the intention of the Government to enforce, squeeze and compel the States to charge for in-patients-a proposal that was opposed by Jamison-and to charge for out-patients. There will be a deliberate squeezing on the hospitals. On the Minister's calculation, he hopes to squeeze back about $250m, which the States will have to make up in charges or, as some State Ministers are contemplating, covering costs by hospital levies and hospital taxes. The Government probably will get its dual taxation out of this, in a sense, by the back door. But if we look at the figures, making allowances for inflationary expectations, something like $250m will be squeezed out next year. That means that something like five million bed days will have to be paid for by people who do not pay for them at the moment. Two million of those bed days will be in Queensland because Queensland, as honourable members know, has one of the most developed public hospital systems in this country. So it is not surprising that State Ministers are fairly critical of the way in which they are being squeezed by these policies. As I have suggested, it may not be just hospital charges that are affected; it is known that many of the States are looking to add hospital taxes and levies to the program. </PARA>
<PARA> Another consideration is that by putting the Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme into the same grant, quite clearly the Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme will be deeply disadvantaged. The reason they will be disadvantaged is because of the institutional demands of the hospitals. It is inevitable that the kinds of pressures under which the hospitals exist and the influence they will have with State governments will mean that those smaller and less institutionalised programs, such as the Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme, will tend to go to the wall. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Donald Cameron" NAMEID="9F4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But they will be forced to. If honourable members understand the sorts of pressures applied to the limited funds by high-cost institutions, such as hospitals, honourable members will see that the inevitable victims will be those weaker, smaller and much less institionalised services. Of course, that contradicts what the Minister says in other parts of his statement. At various parts of his statement the Minister made the point that he wants to encourage deinstitutionalisation. Yet the effect of this hospital decision will be to threaten the whole development of the Community Health Program and, I think, to undermine the position of the School Dental Scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not surprising, therefore, that, the Minister for Health in Queensland-in another non-Labor State Government-has said:</PARA>
<PARA> It has been stated by the Commonwealth that the states will be forced to means test at public hospitals. This statement would indicate that the commonwealth has absolutely no idea of what's involved in the running and operation of a public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland, over a period of 35 years has exercised stringent, but successful, cost-containment measures in the administration of its public hospitals and this factor must be recognised by the Commonwealth Government in any new funding arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it is not recognised in the funding arrangements announced tonight.</PARA>
<PARA> One might also ask the Treasurer (Mr Howard) whether he has thought through the economic effects of these redecisions. If one examines reports from Canada and the United States of America it is clear that general revenue grants, compared with specific purpose grants, have detrimental effects on the macro economic situation. For instance, the evidence from Canada and the United States shows that general revenue grants do not stimulate as much tax effort by the States as do specific purpose grants. The evidence from Canada suggests also that general revenue grants do not stimulate as much State current spending as do specific purpose grants. Of course, that is because the States too often-again this is because they are subject to many of these immediate local pressures-put their money into capital expenditure. That is the last thing we want in the development of health services in the country at this time. But the Canadian evidence shows quite clearly that under these general revenue grants current spending may be affected but that capital spending tends to go up. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;States get pressurised more in relation to capital spending, and all the evidence suggests that this is so. General revenue grants do not seem to reduce State Government deficits as much as specific purpose grants. So if those analyses from Canada and the United States are correct, the general management of the economy will decline as a result of the decisions announced tonight. Finally, let me remind honourable members of what the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said about hospitals in that major philosophical utterance that he delivered in Adelaide earlier this year. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the process of change be a deliberate and considered one so that those things which most Australians value highly are not lost or damaged in the process. </PARA>
<PARA>The appallingly dramatic changes that will be imposed in the next 12 months in the hospital system are certainly a classic example of a very significant and massive change, although certainly not a very considered one. People who have looked at these proposals have suggested that even if it is intended to move to absorption into general revenue funds, clearly it should have been done over a number of years. If that were to be done, and if there were a commitment to some notion of gradual change and to making sure that the changes were deliberate and considered ones, then a timetable should be worked out for this move, rather than having a dramatic and dislocating move. I think honourable members will learn tomorrow and in the next week the kinds of dislocations that this move provides to the whole health scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the other major aspect of the statement that the Minister made. I refer to insurance. Quite clearly the proposals that have been made tonight are designed simply to drive or to induce more people to obtain private health insurance. There are something like 3.5 million people who are not covered by insurance. The Government has designed a series of proposals which have one specific purpose-to drive and to induce people in taking out health insurance. In this, of course, the Government has some limited support from Jamison. Jamison did not ask himself the central and fundamental question that the Commission should have asked on health insurance; that is, what is the best health insurance system for this country?</PARA>
<PARA> Jamison asked a much narrower question which no doubt was conceived by the Government: What is the best way of propping up the private insurance industry in this country? The answer that he came up with was a series of sticks and carrots. The sticks were to beat people into private health insurance and the carrots were to induce them in. We have been shown some splendid sticks and some splendid carrots tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the sticks in this proposal. The Government has proposed to force, compel or push people into private insurance by stating, first of all, that there will be no Commonwealth medical benefit for the uninsured. Even though all Australians are taxpayers, they are not to get any part of that taxpayer benefit unless they have made a contract with a private insurance agency. Despite the fact that all Australians pay taxes, they are to be denied any tax benefit if they are uninsured. They will not get the Commonwealth medical benefit if they are not insured. Of course, there is quite a generous Commonwealth medical benefit for those who are insured. But all taxpayers who have contributed to the general funds will not get any medical benefit unless they have made a contract with a private health insurance fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Government envisages the imposition of hospital charges. I do not quite know how some of these charges are to be imposed. The problems are pretty daunting and this was one of the reasons why Jamison refused to go along with such a proposal. We have seen some of the things that have happened recently in America in relation to the notion of injured and sick people turning up at hospitals and not being admitted until they have shown that they could pay for the treatment. This process is now being adopted in this country, except in relation to the very poor. I admit that the Government has made that special provision, although, as I said, it has quite horrendous problems in administering those complex income tests. But hospital charges will be implemented, again designed primarily to force people into private health insurance. These charges will apply not only to in-patients but also to those people who have been using the outpatient services. A lot of private doctors have been very worried about this use of out-patient services because people have been flooding off to the hospitals. I do not deny that this causes problems in the hospitals, but I do not believe that imposing these sets of charges is the way in which to solve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> By denying Commonwealth medical benefits to the uninsured and by imposing hospital charges, and possibly by means of other results of the Government's decision on hospitals, the Government hopes that people will be forced to insure. As I have said, I think it is very likely that the Community Health Program in the States will be completely undermined by the decision because of the effective institutional pressures of the hospitals. So again we will have another pressure forcing people towards insurance as a result of the demise of the community health centres. On the carrot side we have some classic carrots because the Government decided that it could not just beat people into private insurance; it had to provide some inducements as well. First of all there is the minimum inducement of increased basic cover: That is, instead of a 75 per cent return on insurance, 85 per cent of the standard fee will be returned and there will be a maximum contribution of only $10 per service. So there is an improvement from 75 per cent to 85 per cent so it will be somewhat more worth while to have insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the real carrot, the great and outstanding carrot, is to have a separate tax rebate of 32c in the dollar. This will cost some $600m. While the rebate system in itself is not individually regressive or individually unfair, in aggregate to the community, it is quite clearly regressive because of the pattern of insurance in this society, a pattern which will basically continue whatever these inducements and sticks. I think the Government will have some success but, I suggest, not very much success. If we look, for instance, at the present rates of medical insurance we find that only 52 per cent of people with gross weekly incomes of between $120 and $159 are insured. At the well off end of the scale people receiving gross weekly incomes of $300 and more, 83.5 per cent are insured. That means that the use of this rebate in aggregate across the community favours the rich as against the less well off. We will leave the really disadvantaged alone because there is a separate provision for them. But, this kind of rebate is a redistribution to the better off in aggregate-that is, in total across the community. We have a pattern of health insurance in this country which is now culturally entrenched and will not be much changed by these measures. There is a close correlation between one's income and whether one has insurance. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with what the rebate does in a moment. I am glad the honourable member asked that question. Let me finish the point I was making. In this society there is a relationship between private health insurance and income. It is an almost perfect-but not quite perfect-correlation. The higher one's income the more likely one is to be insured; the lower one's income the less likely one is to be insured. So this kind of tax rebate system is over the whole community regressive and inequitable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me tackle the question that was asked by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron). The cost of this rebate amounts to $600m. One thought the Government was being generous. For one moment one thought that some strange shaft of lightning had hit this contemptible government. But we find the explanation for its actions if we look at the statement by the Treasurer. We now learn that half tax indexation will last merely for this year. The Prime Minister made a promise during the election campaign on half tax indexation adjustments. I said in the very first statement that I made in this House that with this Prime Minister we had to read the fine print of every pledge. If we read the fine print of the pledge made by the Prime Minister in September 1980 we will find that the reference to half tax indexation did refer to the next 12 months only. It was suggested-certainly the headlines suggested-that it was a much more extensive and generous promise. If we look at the fine print we will discover that it was to last for 12 months only. Now we are told it will apply for only 12 months because it involves almost exactly the same amount of money as this rebate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Half tax indexation is to disappear next year and the money involved will be taken up or covered by this rebate scheme. There has been a switch. We have been given the rebate and the half tax indexation has been taken away. The Government has not added at all to its commitment to the taxpayers of this society. It has simply done a con trick. It will go out tomorrow-the Minister is probably out already-talking about the Government's great generosity. But quite clearly it is a con trick because it has cancelled out what was a clear promise made by the Prime Minister which most people accepted would involve a pursuit of half indexation for at least the three years of this Parliament, whatever the actual fine print of the Prime Minister's pledge. But no. The money is needed in order to fund this rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go one step further to answer the question of the honourable member for Fadden. If we consider most of the implications of these changes we find that health insurance rates will have to go up. It is impossible for me to calculate tonight what the percentage of that rise will be. I will not suggest figures because it is difficult given that I have had the statement for only an hour and a half. Let there be no doubt that there will be a distinct increase in health contribution rates. The obvious reasons for that happening are that all hospital charges will go up and the medical rebate has been raised from 75 per cent to 85 per cent. There is no way of escaping an increase in contribution rates. When the whole exercise is finished we will probably find that with half-yearly in- dexation gone, and the increase in the contribution rates people will be even more disadvantaged than the proposal would appear to mean on the surface. </PARA>
<PARA> What have these proposals achieved? They are primarily designed to benefit private hospitals, private insurance and the well off sector of the community and to provide a limited protection for the clearly disadvantaged. On the other hand the result of these proposals will deny effective free public hospital treatment to the people of this country. They are regressive and unfair across the great broad swath of income taxpayers. They have been proposed-as nearly every proposal has been proposed by this Government in the health field-not in pursuit of a better health care provision for this country but simply in terms of the limited financial vision of this Government. This is why the fifth Fraser health scheme will be as much a failure as the previous four. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The health services arrangements which have been announced to the Parliament by the Government today are nothing more than a great medical confidence trick. They represent a snide strategy to promote the fortunes of private medicine, private hospitals and private health insurance organisations. The arrangements will be a bonanza for them. But the people who will have to pay will be not so much the poor people as the people who are not so well off in the community, who will be unable to insure themselves, who will take the risk of not insuring themselves and who will therefore not have available to them the various forms of government subsidies and concessions announced tonight but who, nonetheless, through the taxation system will subsidise these changes. The most miserable aspect of the proposals which have come before us is the shoddy way, the deceitful way, in which the Government has sought to shoot through the last rites on tax indexation on, believe it or not, a health insurance Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will go through a number of the objections which the Opposition has to these proposals. First, the proposals will set back health services funding by more than a decade. They will take us back to the pre-1970s period when the community was expressing widespread dissatisfaction and anger at the deficiencies in the health insurance and health services arrangements. We will go back to the situation in which, because of the high cost of health insurance, the people who are less well off but who will miss out on the benefits of cover as pensioners or as disadvantaged persons will play Russian roulette with their health, will face the risk of catastrophic health charges confronting them at some stage in their life. That is no exaggeration, that is not drawing a long bow; that is a replay of the conditions which arose in Australia in that period before the introduction of the original Medibank program. The complexity of the arrangements will ensure, as did those circumstances applying to health insurance more than a decade ago up to the introduction of the original Medibank scheme, that particular groups will be massively disadvantaged by the new complex system-people such as migrants, who will not understand the processes. </PARA>
<PARA> I move to the more substantial objections that we have. Those I have mentioned are substantial enough, but these are the ones that outrage us. These proposals are a golden handshake for private medicine and private hospitals in this country. They are nothing more than an hydraulic lift to promote the fortunes of those groups. Let us look at what will happen with these changes. If the Government has its way, some two million people will be locked out of the public wards of public hospitals. Where will they go? Will they go to the private wards of public hospitals? More likely, as a result of certain changes I will mention in a minute, they will go to private hospitals. It means very simply that if they go to either of those sources of treatment private medicine will derive much greater profit. No wonder the Australian Medical Association tonight was trumpeting its satisfaction with what the Government has done. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that people will be forced out of the private wards of public hospitals into private hospitals, the private hospitals also will enjoy a bonanza. There is no doubt that will happen, for a number of reasons. There will be a substantial increase in the cost of bed occupancy in shared or single room private accommodation in public hospitals. That will make the small private hospitals a better proposition for many people. Again, there will be a generous increase in subsidies for private hospitals-a 75 per cent increase in the bed day costs of those private hospitals. That will make it more attractive to go to those places. That will pump up costs in an unbelievable way. It is bad medicine. It is bad health services planning. As the gentlemen from the Department of Health would well understand, it will do nothing to contain the increases in health services costs in this country. That is where the rip-off is taking place. As those gentlemen will understand, what it will do will be to promote the surgery mills, the playgrounds of the sporting surgeons in this country. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not rubbish. When I was Minister for Social Security in charge of the administration of health insurance, Department of Health officials told me constantly that the greatest worry they had was the surgery mills in those small private hospitals in the community ripping out clean organs to make profits for the hospitals and for the doctors using them. Let us look at conditions in Australia, at the extraordinarily high rate of elective surgery procedures undertaken. The Australian rate for tonsillectomies is about 20 per cent when the rate should be only about 6 per cent. Why? The reason is fee for service and the small private hospitals. It is profitable to perform them. The more they take out, the more they make. If we have too many doctors they will undertake too many procedures. An article by Paul Ormonde in the Melbourne Herald stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Manager of a country hospital estimated that in the past 10 years, 3,000 tonsillectomies and 3,000 appendicectomies has been performed. The population of the town was 5,000-the hospital service area population 20,000. This rate is twice the national average. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) said 'Rubbish'. If anyone here is to pontificate on rubbish, no one is better qualified than he is. Let us look at the condition of women in Australia today. Australia has more than four times the number of gynaecologists and obstetricians in proportion to population as have England and Wales. Australian surgeons perform-honourable members will not be surprised at this-four times the number of gynaecological operations as do British surgeons. The consequence of that will be that more than 40 per cent of Australian women between the ages of 20 and 24 years today can anticipate hysterectomies in the course of their lifetime. It is bad medicine. But it is also bad business for the community because it will promote private hospitals as blue chip corporate investment. That is where the action will be. </PARA>
<PARA> We already have the Hospital Corporation of America moving into Australia-a big multi-billion dollar transnational health services corporation. It has been brought into several Australian hospitals so far. Of course, the director with his special skills was brought straight from Kentucky Fried Chicken in the southern states of the United States of America to become director of this health services organisation. It is a big money winner. That organisation is operating in Adelaide, among other places, with a $3.5m hospital with 68 beds and elaborate facilities. Of course, it charges like a wounded bull. It will be able to charge even more woundily as a result of the proposals because there will be more subsidies. The price of competitive hospital services in the public sector for private beds will be pushed up higher. It will be able to get that subsidy, lift its prices, keep them below the charges, pace-set in the public sector for private beds. There will be a real bonanza. The community will be ripped off. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in the proposals attends to the problem of cost escalation. They will make public hospital private treatment much more expensive. On my calculations there will be an increase of at least $20 a day. The objective of the Government is to lift the charges from $50 for shared accommodation and $75 for single accommodation for private rooms in a public hospital to $150 a day or thereabouts. The average cost of a bed day is about $150. I repeat: The proposals will push up health insurance costs, they will allow private hospitals to push up their prices and they will push patients out into commercial medicine. They will downgrade the role of the public hospital services in this community. They will reimpose the stigmatisation of public hospital treatment. Once again, public wards will be recognised as paupers hall. People will go there with a stigma, with a tag attached stating: 'You are different from the rest of the community, you are not as well off'. They will go in with a sort of crestfallen feeling, a loss of self-confidence and of self-respect. We will return to the grim old days that existed in this country before the introduction of the original Medibank scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I make this point too, which will probably escape the Minister for Health (Mr Mackellar). Doing this, restricting to a very small focus the sorts of people who can use public ward treatment and public hospitals, is very bad in terms of medical training in this country. It will mean that at teaching hospitals the range of medical experience available to undergraduates at our medical schools will be enormously limited and in consequence, their skills, their qualities and their abilities will be diminished. As I said, there will be a tremendous boost to private health insurance. Commonwealth medical benefits will be available only for those in funds. So much for the great freedom-loving Government which is opposite; so much for freedom of choice and individual rights. What the Government is doing is holding a gun at everyone's head and saying: 'Get into a fund or we will not give you a Commonwealth benefit even though you paid it with your taxes'. That is the most obnoxious part for me. The arrangement is going to punish those who pay their way but who pay their way without joining a fund. They will get no Commonwealth subsidy, but they are going to be told that they will have to subscribe to the cost of that arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be savage penalties imposed on States like Queensland. I will tell the House what is going to happen in Queensland. About one million bed days of public ward treatment will be either terminated to meet the demands of the Government or else met at the cost of the State Government of Queensland. An average additional cost of $70 a day will work out at $70m a year. That is the sort of penalty that this Government, which claims it is concerned about co-operation with the States, is going to impose on Queensland where we have had for more than four decades free hospitalisation which was introduced, I might add, by a socialist State government, but which has been preserved by a succession of governments regardless of their colour. The Government wants the standard of services in Queensland turned back by more than four decades. Let us see what the Liberal Party Health Minister in Queensland said tonight. A newspaper report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government had brutally and deliberately set about wrecking the public hospital system, Queensland Health Minister Brian Austin said tonight . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government was now faced with its greatest crisis in health care since federation, he said in a Brisbane news release. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Government is trying to achieve. Its action will have devastating consequences on that State. </PARA>
<PARA> The retreat from any direct involvement in the provision of the nation's health services is inexcusable. One thing we sought to do in government was to provide not only universal cover with the original Medibank health insurance program but also to involve ourselves co-operatively-that is, in support of the States-to provide improved community health services, improved public hospitals, the initiation and the development of community health centres and the provision of school dental health services. All these are vital areas, especially in the more needy suburbs and communities of this country. The funding is all going to be buried into general funding arrangements with the States. We know what is going to happen in the conservative States which give a much lower priority to the needs and the rights of people in this country. The promotion of improved quality and comprehensiveness, adequacy and satisfaction in those services will expire. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned that this will be a more costly program. The cost of health insurance is going to increase. The contribution rates of hospital insurance will increase by about 40 per cent. Medical insurance rates will increase by about 15 per cent. The increase will be about $2 a week. Of course, there will be some offsets with the tax rebate, but at best it will be of the order of 50c to 60c a week. It will not get one anything better than a one way trip on the Manly ferry, and I doubt that. In June contribution rates are to go up and probably this will eliminate any benefit. Certainly with other cost increases there will be disadvantages. I mentioned that it will be more costly. It will raise private hospital fees by $20 a day. The effects of the health insurance changes in one quarter will be to add half a per cent to the consumer price index. On top of that, hospital fees will add further to the consumer price index. It is a poorly thought out arrangement. It is an arrangement which not only disadvantages people but also works quite contrary to the management of the economy as the Government declares its intent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will, in some respects, give a windfall gain to some States. For instance, if the Government is determined to destroy free public ward treatment against the wishes of the State the result will be that where the patient was fully cost shared between the Commonwealth and the State he will be pushed into private accommodation. It will mean that the States will pick up half of the contribution-half of the $50 a day or whatever it is at the moment. It will mean that the Commonwealth will have to meet 30 per cent of all the medical charges where before it was cost sharing. That is a much more unsatisfactory way. It will mean that the States will make savings because private medical practitioners are providing services for those patients. </PARA>
<PARA> When we put all these things together, they are the ingredients of even more confusion, more dissatisfaction and clear evidence that the Government once again, with the latest in this long chain of changes to health insurance, has not thought through properly the implications of what it has put forward. The explanation is simple. The explanation is this: There has been, not uncharacteristically within the ranks of the Government, a massive brawl as to exactly what the changes were to be. The Minister had been proposing that there ought to be block grants identified for health services purposes. (Extension of time granted). I thank the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair). The Prime Minister, in his well-established, obstinate way, was determined that the money should be absorbed in the general allocations to the States. The Prime Minister, after brawling last night and brawling this morning-they will all be punch-drunk the way they have been brawling lately-won out. The consequence is that we have those proposals before us. They will be as confusing and as unsatisfactory as have been all the other changes in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the tenth point I want to make, and that is the shockingly snide effort of the Government to try to slide through, in the course of the deliberation on health services and health financing Bills before the House, the termination of tax indexation. Taxpayers are going to be some $500m a year worse off. They are not losing full indexation, but they are going to lose half tax indexation. We all remember the promise of the Government in 1975. The Prime Minister in his policy speech said:</PARA>
<PARA> We will encourage people's initiative and enterprise, not batter them into the ground with punishing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We will reduce the tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We will fully index personal income tax for inflation over three years. </PARA>
<PARA>He added for good measure:</PARA>
<PARA> It will make government more honest with your money. They will no longer be able to rely on the secret tax increase of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Fancy anyone believing the Fraser Government would be more honest with one's money or honest with anything. Look at its record. What happened, of course, was that we got the warning-the Gold Coast by-election. The Prime Minister in a television interview on Channel 7 said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think one of the problems of full indexation is that I don't believe people understood it. I think the reductions in tax went passed almost unnoticed . . . you have to expect politicians to want people to understand that when they have reduced taxes, when the election comes around they will remember it . . . I think every one had forgotten it by the time the election actually took place. </PARA>
<PARA>So that is the basis upon which the Government makes great decisions of principle. The consequence is that there will no longer be any tax indexation. The facts also are that we have never had full tax indexation in the history of this Government. It has been much, much less. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows the effect on taxpayers of the elimination of any tax indexation at all. </PARA>

It totally ignores the problem of excess doctor supply, excessive medical treatment initiated by private practitioners and the lack of control over private hospitals. It promotes private health insurance funds in spite of public dissatisfaction with them. Every second Australian believes private health insurance does not give benefit for money and two out of three flatly oppose the present system.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill seeks to give effect to a decision of the Government to establish an independent tribunal to determine the remuneration to chemists for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. Under present legislation, the rates of remuneration payable to chemists for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits are determined by the Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements. This Committee comprises four representatives of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and four Government representatives under an independent chairman. The framework within which the Joint Committee must operate has proven difficult in relation to the formulation of chemists' remuneration. There have been three inquiries into pharmacy earnings, costs and profits since 1964-65 and no agreement has been possible between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia on the results of any of those inquiries. The Government believes that the most appropriate mechanism to overcome the existing problem is the establishment of a tribunal sitting in a public forum.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall that during 1980 the parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts conducted a detailed inquiry into the 'Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme-Chemists Remuneration'. In its report tabled in this House on 17 September 1980, the Committee recommended amongst other matters, that a tribunal be established to replace the existing Joint Committee. The Bill now before the House reflects the Government's acceptance of the parliamentary Joint Committee's recommendation on this particular matter. The Government currently has the other recommendations of that Committee under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that there are a number of advantages to be gained by establishing a public tribunal. First, it will remove from the political arena the question of the level of fees paid to chemists for the dispensing of pharmaceutical benefits. Both the chemists and the Government will be bound by the tribunal's decisions. Secondly, it will provide a forum in which all interested parties may publicly argue their case whilst ensuring that the levels of chemists' remuneration are determined by an independent body. Thirdly, it will remove the need for the Government to finance cumbersome and costly inquiries of the sort that have been conducted since 1964-65. </PARA>
<PARA> I inform honourable members that the results of the latest inquiry in 1977-78 were not acceptable to the Pharmacy Guild and an interim settlement was arrived at. Under that settlement there was to be a study of alternative methodologies for determining chemists' remuneration and a review of the level of remuneration to be completed by 1 July 1981. However within the existing framework it has not been possible to reach agreement on methodology. I would draw honourable members' attention to clause 10 of the Bill, which provides that the Tribunal shall complete its first inquiry and hand down its findings and the reasons for them by 1 July 1981. I am aware that this will place a large workload on the Tribunal but I think that it is essential that the earlier promise to pharmaceutical chemists be kept. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the tribunal is to consist of a chairman, appointed by the Governor-General, and two other members appointed by the Minister for Health. The Bill also provides that the chairman is to be a Deputy President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The other two members will necessarily be persons who have business and accounting skills so that they can make a worthwhile contribution to the deliberations of the tribunal. Proposed new section 98BB does however allow the tribunal to continue to perform its functions in circumstances where one or both of the members other than the chairman have not been appointed. In order to expedite the first review, which as I have said must be completed by 1 July 1981, the tribunal in the first instance will be constituted only by the chairman. I can inform honourable members that the Government would be in a position to submit a name to the Governor-General for appointment as chairman as soon as the Act receives royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA> The function of the tribunal, as provided for in proposed new section 98B, is to determine the manner in which the Commonwealth price of all or any pharmaceutical benefits is to be ascertained for the purpose of payment by the Government to approved chemists for the supply by them of pharmaceutical benefits. In fulfilling its function the Bill requires the tribunal to hold an inquiry at least annually. These inquiries are to be conducted in public and I see these public hearings as very important. It means that all interested parties will be able to make submissions to the tribunal for consideration at a public hearing. I would point out that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts was critical of the existing system under which only the Government's and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia's views are considered to the exclusion of other interested groups. This is because the existing Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements operates in private and its findings are not open to public scrutiny. The Bill before the house removes these anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA> The chairman of the tribunal will of course bring any proposed inquiry to the attention of the public by extensive advertising in the media. Notwithstanding the requirement for public hearings, the Bill allows the tribunal the discretion to determine that, because of the confidential nature of a submission, a hearing or part of a hearing should be conducted in private. It is proposed that the tribunal will decide the criteria that it considers appropriate in determining the fees or other amounts to be included in the Commonwealth price of pharmaceutical benefits. In deciding the criteria the tribunal shall take into account any principles determined by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as being appropriate for fixation of award wages or salaries. The tribunal will not be bound to act in a formal manner and will not be bound by any rules of evidence but may inform itself of any matter as it thinks just. In accordance with the proposed legislation, the tribunal shall act according to equity, good conscience and the merits of each case without undue emphasis on legalism. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other matters which I should mention. First, the Repatriation Act is also being amended to allow the tribunal to consider the level of chemists' remuneration for pharmaceuticals dispensed under the Repatriation Benefits Scheme. The second point is that the tribunal will be serviced by the Department of Administrative Services. This is consistent with that Department's present servicing role of the two existing independent tribunals established under the Remuneration Tribunals Act. Finally, I would draw honourable members' attention to the provision in clause 3 of the Bill which would amend the definition of British Pharmacopoeia. This amendment is necessary because the publishing authority of that publication has been changed from the General Medical Council of the United Kingdom to the Medicines Commission of the United Kingdom. The British Pharmacopoeia is the basic reference standard for drugs and medicinal preparations that are available as pharmaceutical benefits. This Bill is an important measure and will pave the way for more orderly administration of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Repatriation Act 1920 in relation to pharmaceutical benefits and to reduce delays to certain applications for review by the Repatriation Review Tribunal. In the first instance, the proposed amendment will enable the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, that is to be established by the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1981, to determine the level of remuneration payable to pharmacists who dispense prescriptions under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme currently administered under the medical treatment provisions of the Repatriation Act 1920. To achieve this, the Bill inserts a new section in the Repatriation Act 1920, section 109, which empowers the Minister formally to establish a Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to provide pharmaceutical benefits to persons eligible to receive medical treatment under the Repatriation Act and associated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill empowers the Minister to request the proposed Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to extend its inquiry to include the level of remuneration payable to pharmaceutical chemists under the Repatriation Scheme. The Bill will provide for the retrospective application of the Tribunal's function to 1 May 1980. This is to honour an undertaking given by Mr Justice Ludeke, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements, that should a subsequent inquiry modify his decision to reduce dispensing fees they would be adjusted accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The other part of this Bill provides for the amendment of the Repatriation Act 1920 to reduce delays occurring in certain cases that are the subject of an application for review by the Repatriation Review Tribunal. The current provisions of the Act governing the review by the Repatriation Commission of a decision which is the subject of an application for review by the Repatriation Review Tribunal are contained in section 107VL of the Act. These provisions require the Tribunal to refer back to the Repatriation Commission any additional evidence presented to the Tribunal which had not been considered by the Commission or a Repatriation Board but which the Tribunal considers would have been relevant to the making of the original decision by the Commission or Board. This requirement has led to protracted considerations of certain claims and, as the amount of additional evidence being presented has been considerable, the resulting delays have been unacceptable. The proposed amendment will assist in reducing these delays in finalising reviews, by conferring on the President of the Tribunal and the Tribunal itself a discretionary power to consider further evidence in a hearing rather than the Tribunal having to refer such evidence, if relevant, back to the Commission. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the House concurs in the resolutions transmitted in message No. 70 of the Senate relating to the time and place of the Joint Sitting for the purpose of choosing a person to hold the place in the Senate rendered vacant by the death of Senator John William Knight. </PARA>
<PARA>I comment very briefly that this will be the first Joint Sitting of the Parliament for a purpose related to the appointment of a senator to replace a deceased senator in either of the two Territories. The only other occasion on which the two Houses have met for the purpose of joint consideration of matters has been within the terms of the Constitution. This procedure that we will be embarking on on 5 May, therefore, is unique and has something of an historical significance for that reason if for no other. </PARA>
<PARA> It was felt by the Government that it was appropriate, as the purpose of the meeting is to elect a senator, that the meeting should take place in the Senate. However, as the House of Representatives is the paramount House within the Australian Constitution it was felt that it would be appropriate that Mr Speaker sit alongside Mr President during the proceedings. Of course, it will be a matter of each member having a right to exercise the same rights and privileges and, of course, voting capacity as if he were in his own chamber. That means that, significantly, the members of this House will have a major part to play in terms of the result of any proposals that might be put to the Joint Sitting of the two Houses in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I see that there is a peculiar significance in the reasons for this meeting, it being for the purpose of electing a senator to replace one who has died. In those circumstances the Government has felt it appropriate that the meeting be held in the Senate. Of course, it is only relevant to mention that the other occasion on which the two Houses met conjointly they met in this chamber. Then, of course, it was for a matter related to the purpose of this chamber which we felt was appropriate at that time and we agreed with the proposal of the then Government for that reason. I commend this motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition concurs with the motion. It is important to note-the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) has already drawn this to the attention of the House-that the proposal to have a Joint Sitting in the Senate next week is certainly different from the proposals that we were obliged to consider in 1974. I think it ought to be placed on record that the proposal for next week is to fill a casual vacancy caused by the untimely death of the late Senator John Knight. It is to fill a Senate casual vacancy in respect of the Australian Capital Territory. Accordingly, it is appropriate on that basis that both Houses meet in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I immediately disabuse the minds of some who feel that the important House of the people-the House of Representatives-is being somewhat usurped for all time and that future joint sittings will necessarily have to be held in the Senate. Again I agree with what the Leader of the House has said. That is not the case. We need to draw the distinction between a casual vacancy in the Senate being filled pursuant to the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act and a Joint Sitting which is obliged to be held pursuant to section 57 of the Constitution. We have the constitutional requirement that, where there is disagreement between the Houses, particularly in respect of legislation, and where there has been a double dissolution and there is still a disagreement, there be a proposal for a Joint Sitting pursuant to section 57 of the Constitution. The precedent established in 1974 would be, I submit, continued; that is, Joint Sittings for that purpose would be held in this House. The rules pertaining to Joint Sittings adopted in 1974 would continue to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> The appointment of a chairman of that sitting would be the subject of resolution of those present and entitled to vote at that time. I just make that point because it was thought by some people, even those in the Parliament, that perhaps there would be some change of operation in the future. I just draw that distinction. The procedures for a Joint Sitting in respect of a double dissolution pursuant to section 57 of the Constitution do not apply in this case. This matter relates to a vacancy in the Senate for a territorial senator. The rules proposed on this occasion merely relate to that matter specifically. </PARA>

<PARA> (j) Until one of the persons proposed obtains an absolute majority of the votes cast, or (as the case may be) is chosen by lot to hold the vacant place, successive ballots shall be taken, and at each such ballot the name of the person who receives the fewest votes at the preceding ballot shall be excluded. </PARA>
<PARA> (k) If on any ballot it is necessary to decide which of two or more persons is to be excluded from a subsequent ballot because of the number of votes for such persons being equal, a special ballot shall be taken at which the names of only those persons shall be submitted, and the name of the person having the fewest votes at such special ballot shall be excluded; but if on any special ballot it shall be necessary to decide which of two or more persons is to be excluded from a subsequent ballot because of the number of votes for such persons being equal, the scrutineers by drawing lots shall determine which of such persons shall be excluded, and the name of the person last drawn shall be excluded. </PARA>
<PARA> (1) If at any ballot, other than the first ballot or a special ballot, the names of only two persons are submitted and the number of votes for such persons is equal, the scrutineers shall, by drawing lots, determine which of those persons shall be chosen to hold the vacant place, and the person whose name is first drawn shall be deemed to have been duly chosen. </PARA>
<PARA> (m) As soon as any person obtains an absolute majority of the votes cast, or (as the case may be) is chosen by lot to hold the vacant place, the Chairman shall declare that such person has been chosen to hold the place of the Senator for the Australian Capital Territory whose place has become vacant. </PARA>

<PARA>I briefly advert to some of the contents of the rules because I think it is worth drawing the attention of honourable members to them. Item No. 1 sets down the purpose of the meeting; that is, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) has identified, to choose a person to hold a vacant place in the Senate caused by the very regrettable and tragic early death of our former colleague, the late Senator John Knight. No other matter shall be considered at the Joint Sitting. The second matter within the proposed rules to which I might also draw the attention of honourable members is that, in any matters of procedure that are not specifically provided for in those rules now presented to this House, the Standing Orders of the Senate shall be followed as far as they can be applied. Honourable members will recall that in 1974, although the meeting was held in this chamber for reasons that have recently been adverted to, the Standing Orders of the Senate were applied. As I said, the Chairman will be Mr President or, in his absence, Mr Speaker. It has been suggested, and I believe it is appropriate, that Mr Speaker should sit alongside Mr President during the conduct of the Joint Sitting. The Clerks and matters relating to the minutes are identified as well as the procedures for the election of the person to hold the vacant place in the Senate. As I said, on any question arising in the Joint Sitting, each senator and member, including the Chairman, shall have one vote. The procedures and rules have been drafted by the Clerks of the two chambers. They are akin to those that were set down at the time of the 1974 Joint Sitting. The second occasion for a Joint Sitting, therefore, puts into folk lore the proposed rules. This House might well consider it suitable that these be adopted, perhaps with some modification, in our Standing Orders. Whether that would be appropriate I suggest is a matter that the Standing Orders committee might well consider at a later time. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

As the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) has explained, the Joint Sitting relates to the filling of a casual vacancy. Our party, of course, does not even expect a contest for the filling of that vacancy. We accept the nominee. There will be no problems about the Joint Sitting, nor should any votes be necessary. We assume that there will be no other candidates. I can envisage circumstances in the future, when a vacancy involving an independent senator or member with no party affiliation may have to be filled. That may create some interesting problems.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend three pieces of legislation to cover the Joint Sitting of the Senate and the House of Representatives which is to be held to choose a senator for the Australian Capital Territory in the place of the late Senator Knight. The three Acts involved are the Evidence Act, the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act and the Parliamentary Papers Act. These three Acts were amended in 1974 in relation to the Joint Sitting of the Senate and the House of Representatives which was then held pursuant to section 57 of the Constitution. The amendments then made were limited to Joint Sittings pursuant to section 57 of the Constitution and do not apply in relation to the Joint Sitting to be held pursuant to the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act. That Act was amended last year to provide for the filling of a casual vacancy in respect of a senator from the Australian Capital Territory by the Senate and the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the present Bill will be to extend the changes made in 1974 to cover any Joint Sitting of the Senate and the House of Representatives pursuant to an Act. The effect of the changes in relation to each of the three pieces of legislation concerned will be as follows: With regard to the Evidence Act, the effect of the amendment will be to provide for judicial notice of the signature of the officer presiding at a Joint Sitting held pursuant to an Act and to provide for copies of official records of proceedings of such a Joint Sitting to be admitted as evidence thereof. In relation to the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act, the effect of the amendment will be to provide authority for the broadcasting of a Joint Sitting held pursuant to an Act and to give protection against legal proceedings in respect of matters so broadcast. </PARA>
<PARA> In referring to broadcasting, I intend also to cover the televising of a proceeding, since the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act was amended in 1974 to permit the televising of parliamentary proceedings. In relation to the Parliamentary Papers Act, the amendment now proposed would provide for authority for the publication of the proceedings of a Joint Sitting held pursuant to an Act and for protection against legal proceedings in respect of the publication of the proceedings of such a Joint Sitting by the Government Printer. The amendments are of a machinery nature, but it is desirable that the changes should be made before the Joint Sitting takes place next month. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has no objection to the Bill. The legislation has already passed the Senate where the Opposition concurred with the terms of the Bill. As the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) said, it is necessary to amend the existing Act in order to provide for the judicial notice and the protection that is already applicable in respect of Joint Sittings held pursuant to the Constitution. As I have said in earlier debates, the proposed Joint Sitting will be held pursuant not to the Constitution but to an Act of Parliament, namely the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973. The operative words are that the Joint Sitting will be held pursuant to an Act of Parliament. Accordingly, as this has never been done before, we have to make provision, as the Minister said, to cover the broadcast of proceedings, the Hansard record and the Parliamentary Papers Act. By doing so we give protection to the broadcasting and televising of proceedings. We provide authority for the publication of the record of proceedings and give protection in respect of any legal proceedings in respect of that publication. We give judicial notice of the signature of the officer presiding over the Joint Sitting to provide for copies of the official record of proceedings, as such, to be admitted as evidence in relation to the parliamentary proceedings generally. Accordingly, it follows that we are required to pass this legislation with which the Opposition concurs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the adjournment of this debate I was saying that I thought underlying these Bills was an important theme of technological sovereignty. It is important at the present time that Australia seeks to achieve national independence in relation to technology as a fundamental goal. The legislation is not inconsistent with that end and in particular cases it will benefit the end. Perhaps the reason the original designs legislation was introduced in the early part of the century was that at that time there was within Australia a strong spirit of nationalism, a commitment to the development of all its resources, including human resources, and, therefore, a recognition of the importance of design not only in terms of industry and commercial application but also as an expression of the initiative, intelligence and creativity of the Australian people. I was suggesting that, of course, this legislation will not be enough to achieve that objective. It is important that resources be provided to those people who have a capacity to design and who have original ideas. Australia has a long history of people who have been inventive and creative, who have not had resources given to them initially, at a time when they are developing an idea, or perhaps even after the idea has been demonstrated they have not been able to develop that idea to the maximum extent because they have not been able to get the kinds of resources that are available to major corporations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent years a great mythology has been associated with so-called economies of scale. In this country we have seen firm after firm consolidated in terms of takeover bids, and giant firms have been created. In the process, very often as a result of that consolidation of firms, technology and ideas that have been developed in a particular firm have been either lost in a larger firm or they have even been transferred overseas where transnational corporations have been able to make use of Australian technology. Ultimately the benefits have not come through to the Australian people. One ought to recognise that very often the greatest creativity is to be found in the smaller firm. Creativity and initiative are not always associated with the largest and more dominant firms. Indeed there is some evidence to suggest that major corporations very often have had an interest in the prevention of the development of new technology and new designs because they would perhaps run against the interests of that corporation in a narrow economic sense. </PARA>
<PARA> I think also of the great example of the Australian Aluminium Co. which was an Australian Government corporation established at Bell Bay in Tasmania by the Chifley Government which went on to develop a basis of an aluminium industry in this country. Unfortunately that company was sold off in the 1950s by the Menzies Government to Comalco Aluminium (Bell Bay) Ltd which, as we all know, is a derivative of a multinational corporation. People think of it as having some Australian character, but it is simply a subsidiary of overseas corporations; I think the Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation Ltd of the United Kingdom and the Kaiser Aluminium and Chemical Corporation of the United States of America. In a very interesting article which I read as a result of a paper presented at a conference I learnt that before the Australian Aluminium Co. was taken over and became part of a multinational company it was leading the world in terms of technologies in relation to aluminium refining. In buying that company the multinational corporation was able to get access to technology in relation to that industry which at that stage was very much in advance of its time. </PARA>
<PARA> The absurd situation arises at this point in our history where we are paying hundreds of thousands-perhaps millions-of dollars to expand the aluminium industry in this country, almost completely in a situation of foreign ownership and control. In the process we are buying back technology to establish that industry; whereas if we had gone on in the aluminium industry with a government corporation which we started in the 1940s we would be in a much stronger position than we are at present. We would have much greater control of the aluminium industry at a time when obviously there are very good reasons for developing an aluminium industry in Australia. I take that example, which is a bit remote, I admit, from the legislation, simply to make the point that when one is talking about industrial design and the way in which designs may be registered, and when one is talking about patenting, one has to recognise that one is not dealing simply with a legal matter; one is dealing with the legalities of that matter in the context of social structure and in the context of a world in which increasing consolidation of companies into giant international corporations threatens the possibilities of innovation and makes it extremely difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> Countries that have had populations much less than that of Australia have been able to develop a world reputation in terms of their mastery of particular technology. I believe we ought to be seeking to learn from Sweden, Switzerland and from countries that have developed high standards of technology but very much in terms of the control of people within those societies and those national governments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Japan certainly has a national pride. In relation to these questions of design and patenting and the protection of technology Australia needs to develop some pride and some national direction. When we think of industrial design and technology we tend to think of it in terms of physical examples. When we are talking about protecting technologies we are thinking of protecting perhaps a new chemical that has been produced or a new drug or some physical process. I put it to the House that more important than any physical design is the way that we design social processes. The modern corporation is becoming an inappropriate form of social organisation to encourage new initiative and new designs. As a social process, the modern corporation is highly bureaucratic, centralised and authoritarian as a structure. Whilst very often it has resources to establish the laboratories and the capacity for producing new products in a narrow sense these major corporations tend overall to reinforce the direction in which the society has been moving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will give just one example which is associated with the automobile industry. In that industry we have developed over a period a form of travel and communication which has been not only highly appropriate to urban societies but also has shaped the kind of cities that we have. Where has one seen those major companies that dominate the automobile industry looking forward to the need to find alternative forms of communication and travel? They have been much too devoted to preserving their own situation in the world and in preserving their own type of technology in a basically unchanged way over a very long period, rather than really taking us on to more energy efficient technologies which will be absolutely essential in the last decades of the twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe these Bills are important in the sense that they protect design and they assist in enabling Australians to patent particular designs that they may be responsible for. One hopes that the Government in its approach to technology will take a whole issue and the whole theme of technological sovereignty seriously. One hopes that the Government will not only legislate in this area but also go on to legislate in other areas in order to ensure that the resources are provided to enable people to develop new technologies in Australia and, when it has done that, ensure that technology is not simply the subject of a takeover and transferred overseas and developed to its full commercial form so that it benefits some other country rather than the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson), when introducing the Trade Marks Amendment Bill, referred to the necessity to protect trade marks and said that the way to achieve this is through section 103 of the Trade Marks Act. This section, in some circumstances, prohibits the importation of goods bearing a trade mark which is registered in Australia. The Minister then detailed the correct and incorrect use of this prohibition power. I wish to quote his comments. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The registered proprietor or registered user of the trade mark can notify Customs that he objects to goods bearing the mark being imported. This objection enables Customs to seize such goods. It is not hard, for example, to see the value of this remedy where pirate goods bear forged or falsely applied trade marks. Section 103 effectively protects the proprietor or registered user against encroachment on his rights by unscrupulous overseas manufacturers. However, the use of section 103 to prevent the import of genuinely marked goods has caused concern. This includes cases where the trade mark was applied overseas by the same company which is the registered proprietor in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Many object to this use of the section, saying it goes too far beyond the ideas behind protecting trade marks and abuses the purpose behind protecting trade marks by registration. The use of section 103 in relation to importation of goods was therefore referred to the Industrial Property Advisory Committee for review. That Committee's recommendations have generally been accepted by the Government. This Bill is designed to amend section 103 to implement the report. The Committee's key recommendation is that the provisions for seizure and forfeiture of goods under section 103 should be confined to those cases where importation infringes a registered trade mark. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 103 will no longer be available to prevent the import of goods bearing a genuine trade mark applied overseas by the Australian registered proprietor. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope the Minister's assurance is correct. My involvement with this section of the Trade Marks Act began some two years ago when a constituent of mine wanted to import secondhand Cessna aircraft from the United States. He received a letter from the Rex aviation company, the proprietor or controller of that trademark in Australia, an importer of Cessna aircraft, saying that the company would use section 103 against anybody who imported Cessna aircraft without the company's authority. I understand that other agents and registered trademark holders of other makes of light aircraft sent out similar letters. The threat of that legal action made it impossible for anybody to import a secondhand aircraft, even though it was the genuine article-a genuine Cessna or a genuine Beechcraft. </PARA>
<PARA> To me, my constituent and others, that was a completely inappropriate use of that section. It was a restraint of trade rather than a protection of a genuine trademark. I complained to the Minister of the day, as I know others did. I am very pleased that the Ministers involved have acted, that a review has taken place and that we now have this amending legislation before the House. I congratulate the Ministers involved, including the present Minister, for their action. I say again that I hope that this inappropriate and unfair use of that section of the trade marks protection legislation will not stand-that is, people will not be prevented from importing goods. </PARA>
<PARA> If it were to continue some absurd situations would develop. A person who actually is the owner of a secondhand piece of machinery, aircraft, car-whatever it may be-could be prohibited from importing what is his own article. It would mean that the Ford company, for instance, as the holder of the Ford trademark of Australia could prevent any Ford motor cars, new or secondhand, from being brought in to the country by the owners of those cars. A person returning from overseas could not even bring a Slazenger tennis racquet or a Roller camera into the country if that provision were carried to the absurd lengths that applied to the secondhand aircraft which my constituent wished to import. Therefore, I strongly support the legislation. I hope that the amendments have been drafted in a way that will overcome the problem I have raised. I congratulate the Minister. </PARA>

They are important Bills, as everyone has agreed. I am delighted at the degree of unanimity that all speakers have shown in this important debate. I hope that it heralds a bipartisan view on the importance of increasing our technological base in Australia. I do not always agree with the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), but I agree with the points that he made about the importance of industrial property Bills and their influence in increasing technological independence in Australia. It is an aim which I will pursue as hard as I can because I believe we must achieve a much better technological base so that we can compete on the export market with new products, new processes, and be independent of overseas technology. We should encourage our own technology. We are a very inventive nation-we have always been an inventive nation-but up until now we have not been a good entrepreneurial nation.

<PARA> The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and the honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield) made some very good points on the Trade Marks Bill. I can assure the honourable member for Murray that the cases he cited can no longer occur under this legislation. The legislation can no longer be used as an artificial tariff barrier. That is what it was. The legislation has been carefully drafted, I am assured, to prevent that from happening. A number of honourable members will have had representations from people who would want this artificial barrier to continue. When this Bill becomes law what has happened in the past will no longer be possible. I thank those two honourable members for their comments. The honourable member for Barton made some very interesting comments on the tyre industry and the effect the Trade Marks Act had on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lalor gave a most interesting and informative speech, as he so often does in this place. I know he had very little warning that the Bills would be brought on-I might say that I had the same problems as the honourable member for Lalor-but he made a good speech. I commend him, particularly for his comments regarding the problems of the patentability of living organisms. The subject of the patentability of living organisms has been specifically referred to the Industrial Property Advisory Committee on its review of the whole patent system. But it is already practice that the Australian Patent Office patents methods which use micro-organisms for new processes. The production of antibiotics is one, and a simpler example is the production of bread and cheese in other forms. There have been a number of cases involving patents. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has mentioned one in the United States of America. </PARA>

<PARA> I was also interested in the comments made about the importance of small businesses in the innovative process. There is no doubt that small firms must innovate to survive. This year Australia joined the International Patents Co-operations Treaty which has been used predominantly by small businesses in Australia. The International Patents Co-operations Treaty provides a simplified method of applying for patents in overseas countries. It is just one other way in which we can help small businesses. Small businesses have many problems. One is in obtaining venture capital, and the Government is looking at ways and means in which venture capital can be made readily available to small firms which wish to innovate and produce new products and processes. I thank those who have spoken in this debate. I am pleased to see interest being shown in this complex matter, but the speakers in the debate realised that it is an important matter for Australia and for our technological independence in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point I raise with the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) concerns the Designs Amendment Bill. The report of the Designs Law Review Committee-the Franki report -indicated that the Bill was not intended to cover fashion design, which is a very important area of industrial property. Can the Minister give some indication as to where he thinks protection is found for design, for example, of clothing? This is not made at all clear. I suppose that in a way one could read it into the words of the Designs Act as amended, but the Franki Committee considered that it should not be covered in that Act. I would like the Minister to make some comment on that matter. The second point I raise is a fairly complex one which concerns the Patents Act. I direct the attention of the Minister to what he said in his second reading speech. When dealing with the provisions in the Bill he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Time limits should not, however, be inviolate. An applicant who fails to observe them may incur the loss of all or part of the potential rights to a patent. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions already in the Patents Act allow the Commissioner of Patents, under certain conditions, to extend the times laid down. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the paragraph to which I want to draw the Minister's attention:</PARA>
<PARA> The most important of these is section 160, which allows time extensions in circumstances beyond control or through an error or omission by the person concerned, or his agent or attorney. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been drawn to my attention, through the courtesy of the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), that there is an inconsistency there. He has received a letter from a patent attorney from Adelaide. I will read the relevant part of that letter. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> On page 4 in the marked paragraph the Minister indicated that the Government accepted the IPAC recommendation that extensions should be granted for the Convention period if failure to file in time was beyond the control of the applicant, his Agent or his Attorney. In fact that is not quite how Section 142AAA reads in the Patents Amendments Bill of 1981, and if you read the marked paragraph 2--</PARA>
<PARA>The marked paragraph 2 is the one I have just read-</PARA>
<PARA>you will see that there is apparently a drafting error requiring that the circumstances should also be beyond control of the Agent or Attorney. Even this is trivial alongside the inconsistency whereby an extension can be obtained if the error was an error or omission on the part of the person concerned or the Agent or Attorney, if the Convention application passes through the relatively new PCT route, but not if it passes through the old traditional route. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the wording of section 160 (2) of the 1952 Act which is retained; it is not altered by the amending Bill. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> (2.) Where, by reason of-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) an error or omission on the part of the person concerned or of his agent or attorney; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) circumstances beyond the control of the person concerned,</PARA>
<PARA>an act or step in relation to an application for a patent or in proceedings under this Act (not being proceedings in a court) required to be done or taken within a certain time has not been so done or taken, the Commissioner may, upon application extend the time for doing the act or taking the step. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will find in proposed section 142AAA (2), these words:</PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of sub-section (1)-</PARA>
<PARA>It is similar to the earlier part-</PARA>
<PARA>circumstances shall not be taken to be beyond the control of a person or persons unless the circumstances are also-</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat the words 'are also'-</PARA>
<PARA>beyond the control of any agent or attorney of that person or of those persons. </PARA>
<PARA>It looks as if in section 160 (2) there is a single precondition and in section 142AAA (2) there is a double precondition set-up. I would like the Minister to resolve that point. The final point, the Minister will be relieved to know I want to raise concerns that infamous section 103 of the Trade Marks Act 1955. Sub-section (5) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Where an application has been made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, whether before or after the commencement of this sub-section for a review of a decision of the Comptroller-General of Customs made under sub-section (2), a person is not entitled to appeal to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs against that decision. </PARA>
<PARA>I quite understand that there needs to be some change in relation to that matter. It is no longer in the empire of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs; it is part of the empire of the Minister for Science and Technology. I assure the Minister that sub-section (5) has fallen down the memory hole completely. I have been through it many times and there is no comparable proposed sub-section in the Bill. Whilst I can understand that there needs to be some alteration of wording, mutatis mutandis, I cannot see why it has been dropped out altogether. It seems to me to be a reasonable provision and I cannot see why it is not in the Bill. </PARA>

The second related to an inconsistency in the proposed new section 142AAA of the Patents Act. There is, in fact, no inconsistency. The Commissioner of Patents has a discretion to decide whether an error or omission on the part of a patent attorney is, in fact, an error or omission. Those discretions are as wide as provided in section 160 of the Patents Act because proposed new section 142AAA is legislated outside the Paris Convention. It allows for grounds for an extension which are not allowed for in the Paris Convention.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this health policy debate earlier tonight the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) reaffirmed my worst fears about him and, indeed, about the Australian Labor Party; that is, they are quite adamant that they will return to a universal health system or return to Medibank. I only hope that the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition is promulgated in detail to every Australian. The Labor Party's policies when in Government between 1972 and 1975 differed very little from its policies today. The Leader of the Opposition was responsible for and was the architect of Medibank. He has not changed one iota. I think that he knew little about the provision of health services and health care when in government and he knows less today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At one stage he spoke about two million people being locked out of our public hospitals. That is utter rubbish. In my view people who can afford to pay should pay. Health and hospital services will be available to all Australians. Of course, we have a welfare state Bill Hayden. We know the mess that we got into between 1972 and 1975 as a result of that. He would certainly close private hospitals. There is no doubt in my mind, after listening to the Leader of the Opposition, that he would squeeze them out and eventually close many of them down. No one condones the fact that many unnecessary operations are carried out. There is no doubt that certain elective surgery often should not be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition made some reference to the tax rebate that was proposed in this policy which will eventually be enshrined in legislation as being almost worthless. That is absurd. There will be a rebate-that is, money in the hand-amounting to 32c in the dollar on all hospital and medical insurance that is paid for by Australians. In other words, at the end of the financial year Australians will receive money back for the money that they have paid out for hospital and medical insurance to the extent of 32c in the dollar in the form of a rebate, depending on the amount of basic cover which they hold. That, I believe, will be a great saving and a great bonus to them. If one rids the speech of the Leader of the Opposition of the rhetoric one finds that the Labor Party wants to return to the original Medibank days. His final comment in his speech was that in government the Labor Party would introduce a universal health scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I want now to cite some figures showing what happened with health costs in three years under a Labor Government and in the ensuing three years, under a Fraser Government. This will remind the House of how dangerous the policy of a universal health scheme called Medibank was. Under Labor annual health expenditure rose from $2,500m to $5,600m in three years. It more than doubled with an increase of 125 per cent. In the three years following, under the Fraser Government, annual health expenditure rose from $5,600m to about $8,000m, which was a 40 per cent increase. Under Labor, the cost of health care to Commonwealth outlays rose from $780m to approximately $2,900m which was a 277 per cent increase in that three-year period. In the following three-year period under the Fraser Government there was a net reduction of 1.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that there was some shift of those costs from the public to the private sector. This clearly spelt out to many people their total health costs. Under the proposals that the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) announced today there will be a further movement towards people at least understanding more fully where health costs are. The Jamison inquiry was set up about 18 months ago. It looked at scores of options which were considered and canvassed. From its considerations and from the Government's consideration of the recommendations and findings of that inquiry has come the package which the Minister for Health announced today. Health costs will not go away but the public must be made more aware of the cost of health services. Under Labor's Medibank, as I said earlier, health costs got out of hand. Services were free at the point of delivery. Of course, we know what happens when that situation exists. People have no appreciation of the costs. In addition, the deliverers of health services also tend to be rather lax. As a result overall costs get out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA> There is ample evidence in Western countries that the health of a people will plateau and regardless of extra money spent the mortality and morbidity rates will not reduce. There is a mistaken belief in our community that money will always buy good health and longer life. I do not believe that is the case. Therefore expenditure must be watched closely, efficiencies introduced and value obtained for the health dollar spent. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to outline some of the clearly stated general objectives in health care in the Government's very acceptable statement that was presented in the House today. First of all the States should be more responsible. They have the constitutional responsibility for the provision of health services. They ought to be able to determine their own priorities, and that is what this Government is working towards. Individuals should be responsible for health care and aware of health costs. Welfare and help should be directed to those in need. The handout mentality must be diminished and eventually stamped out. People who can afford to pay for their health costs should be made to pay for those costs. Health insurance should be available to all, and community rating should be pursued. The healthy and the young healthy in particular should support the rest of the community by contributing to health insurance. There ought to be government assistance directed only to the insured. This, of course, will be a considerable incentive for people to take out hospital and health insurance. The private sector must remain strong. I think this is an important plank of the free enterprise system. Indeed, it was the private sector in particular that came under strong attack by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in his speech tonight. Deliverers of health care must be more aware of the costs of the services they order. There is no doubt in my mind that so many deliverers of health care in this country are not aware of the extent of the costs of the services that they order. </PARA>
<PARA> Hospital costs, of course, virtually come under two headings-the capital cost of establishing hospitals and the recurring costs of running them. I believe there has been too much political patronage in the States in relation to the building of hospitals and, indeed, the rebuilding of some hospitals. In many areas throughout the Commonwealth hospitals are situated in close proximity to other hospitals. Many examples of this can be found in all States. We all know of small towns with 20 or 30-bed hospitals which are located just four or five miles from each other. The States, mainly I believe for political reasons, seem to want to build or rebuild some of those hospitals. I do not believe the Commonwealth ought to be involved in that sort of operation. Hospitals have become what one might call sacred cows. Apparently they must remain whether they are needed or not. The cost sharing arrangements that the Commonwealth had with the States have been far too open-ended. It has been too easy for the States to include in their Budgets extra personnel and items such as cars and other equipment. Of course, the States are paying only 50c of every $1 expended. The States have been spending too many 50c dollars with the open-ended 50 : 50 cost sharing arrangement which has existed now for a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new arrangements the Commonwealth's contribution to the States will be included in the general tax sharing arrangements although the amounts will be identifiable as a certain percentage. The allocation of funds to the States in the longer term will come under the scrutiny and control of the Commonwealth Grants Commission which will determine relativities between the States. I believe the Grants Commission is an ideal body for this purpose. It is a body that has been highly respected in this place and, I believe, throughout the Commonwealth. It is respected, non-political, independent and, I believe, free from political influence. I look forward to the implementation of the arrangement under which the Grants Commission will establish relativities between States in respect of the disbursement of funds from the Commonwealth for hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise one matter which I do not think has been canvassed by the Minister or other speakers in this debate. This matter concerns hospital accounts. I believe fully itemised accounts should be provided to all hospital patients whether or not they pay that account. In other words, a pensioner or a disadvantaged patient who does not pay an account ought to be aware of the extent of the costs that he has incurred as a patient of a hospital. There ought to be an awareness not only from the patient's point of view but also from the health workers' point of view. The doctors and the nurses who order and administer the treatments should know the costs. It is not uncommon these days for a patient who is hospitalised for three or four days to receive an account in excess of $1,000. Of course the cost depends on the extent of the diagnostic tests, the X-rays, the drugs and the treatments administered. Patients, who do not know the cost of the services and who do not pay, often never know the extent of the bill that they have incurred. Doctors, pathologists, nurses and radiologists who order services are quite often oblivious to the very high cost of services that they so readily order. If costs are to be curtailed I believe all delivers and recipients of services must be made aware of the costs. Most large institutions today have computerised account systems. I do not believe the issue of these details would be a great burden to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make reference to a recent statement which appeared in the Brisbane Courier-Mail of Wednesday, 22 April, attributed to the Queensland Minister for Health. The article in that paper headed 'Knives are our for our free system' stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Adequate health care should be available to all, irrespective of race, colour or creed. It is recognised that some people abuse the present free public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the individual who uses the free out-patients or the free hospital system, who can afford to pay, needs to examine his own conscience on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is an absolutely ridiculous statement to make. It is a naive statement. I really do not believe the Queensland Minister for Health believes the people who are abusing the system, the people who can afford to pay, will examine their consciences and indeed decide in future to pay for services that they are accepting free today. Tens of thousands of people in Queensland are abusing the system. Middle income and upper income people who are accepting free hospitalisation, free outpatient services, free diagnostic services, free X-rays and free drugs can well afford to pay for these services. Queensland has a means test on dental care but not on hospital care. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some comments on the statement made by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) supplementary to that made by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar). His statement and my comments relate to matters of taxation. The two tax matters referred to by the Treasurer were the introduction of a tax rebate of 32c in the dollar for health insurance costs and the abandonment of tax indexation. The first point I make is that the benefit of the introduction of the 32c in the dollar tax rebate will depend on the extent of the rise in health insurance charges. So, whether it will be of particular benefit to families, as the Treasurer says it will be, highly dubious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> More importantly, the Government can be seen to have reduced subsidies for health care but compensated for that reduction in subsidies, at least partly, through the introduction of a tax deduction. It is important to note that tax deductions are, in general, a less satisfactory form of government assistance than are subsidies for a number of reasons. Firstly, the result is that the extent of government assistance to this activity is hidden when it is in the form of a tax rebate or concession. We know that the cost now will be some $600m. That figure was given to us in the Treasurer's statement. But, how will he know what the cost is in a few years time? We simply will not know the cost. It will not be published and unless the Treasurer is prepared to tell us in response to specific questions we will not have that figure available to us. If it were in the form of a subsidy that figure would be very obvious to us in the Budget accounts each year. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the tax deduction is less equitable because only those with taxable incomes several hundred dollars above the tax free zone will be able to claim all the rebate. Those with no taxable income will not be able to claim any part of it. This is particularly relevant for the low income taxpayer with a dependent spouse. The House should note that if a low income earner with a dependent spouse earns below $6,541 a year, he will not be able to take advantage of the tax rebate at all. So, this tax rebate which is put forward as being a great boom to taxpayers will be of no advantage to a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and earning less than $6,541 a year. Even then he will have to earn up to approximately $7,000 a year before he will be able to take full advantage of the rebate. So, this tax deduction is not one which will be available in full to many low income earners. A third reason for a tax deduction rather than a higher subsidy is clearly to reduce the size of the public sector; that is, it is based on ideology rather than practical common sense and equity. </PARA>
<PARA> In a system of subsidies, as we have in this area, why should we not give all the assistance in that way rather than do it partly by way of subsidy and partly by way of tax indexation? If a government is to promote activity in some areas-such as assisting people to take up health insurance-where it can give subsidies or tax concessions, it does seem curious for it to give both. Why do it on both sides? No real reason for doing that is put forward in either of the statements by the Minister for Health or the Treasurer. It means that we will have an administratively cumbersome approach because we are giving assistance in two ways rather than in one way. It means also that the initial cost of health insurance will be much higher when the assistance is given partly in the form of a tax concession or rebate rather than in the form of a subsidy. It has both an inflationary impact and an impact in regard to the taking up of health insurance by low income people. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government takes the approach of giving all the assistance by way of subsidy, then quite obviously the cost of health insurance will be less than it would be if the assistance were given partly by way of subsidy and partly by way of tax deduction. With that lower cost there will be less impact on the consumer price index and will be less inflationary inpact, which should be of interest to a Government which says it is concerned to beat inflation first. As the Government is anxious to get people to take up health insurance, the lower the initial cost of that insurance, obviously the greater the likelihood that people will take it up. In view of the large initial cost of health insurance a tax concession may still not be enough to induce people to take up health insurance. They are frightened by the initial high cost and therefore are likely to take the gamble. Under this new system, they may face horrendous bills for their health care if they do gamble, as I am sure many of them will do when faced with the large health insurance costs which otherwise they would have to pay. The Opposition has a number of reservations about providing assistance to people in the area of health insurance through tax deductions. It would be much better to offer a higher subsidy, as happened previously. </PARA>
<PARA> The abandonment of tax indexation is an extraordinarily important development. The Government has attempted to hide it away in a supplementary statement on the matter of health finance. Presumably the Government hopes that by hiding this statement in this fashion the political flak from the abandonment of tax indexation will be considerably reduced. It is obvious that tax indexation has nothing to do with health finance, so why has the Government attempted to do it in this way if it is not simply to hide from the Australian people what is going on? Of course, the Government hoped that it would be able to reduce hostility in this way but, as we have already mentioned, this tax rebate must be seen as compensation for increased health costs, not as compensation for the loss of tax indexation. There can be no argument that it must be associated with the tax rebate. Saying it is a tax rebate which is compensation for the loss of tax indexation is an absolute absurdity. The tax rebate for health insurance is a compensaion for the increased costs of health insurance which will come from the other measures announced by the Minister for Health. The abandonment of tax indexation must be seen as something which is not in any way compensated for by the tax rebate. It is something which should stand on its own. The Government's attempt to associate it with the tax rebate is simply a diversion. </PARA>
<PARA> Indexation is a very important aspect of taxation in this country. If applied in full it prevents the proportion of income being paid in tax from increasing automatically because of inflation. This happens because under a progressive income tax system the higher the income, the higher the proportion of income paid in tax. If incomes go up with inflation and there is no adjustment to the tax schedule through tax indexation then taxpayers automatically move into higher tax brackets and therfore pay a higher proportion of their income in tax. If tax indexation is fully applied, the tax schedule is adjusted in accordance with inflation and taxpayers whose incomes move up in line with inflation do not move into higher tax brackets and do not pay a higher proportion of their income in tax. That is the theory of tax indexation. The Fraser Government in its early days was very strong in its support for tax indexation. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) said earlier tonight, the now Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made great play of tax indexation when stating his policy in the 1975 election. He promised:</PARA>
<PARA> We will fully index personal income tax for inflation over three years . . . It will make government more honest with your money. They will no longer be able to rely on this secret tax increase of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister put his reform of full tax indexation in quite dramatic terms-terms which will now come back to haunt him. Of course, this promise was never fulfilled to the full extent. Full tax indexation never applied in any year even though supposedly full tax indexation was introduced in 1976. Because of discounting from the consumer price index for price rises attributable to Government action-that is for devaluation, oil price rises, other indirect tax increases and health insurance cost increases-full tax indexation never applied. Then, after two years of supposedly full tax indexation it was reduced to half tax indexation and then it was suspended altogether in 1979-80. What was supposedly half tax indexation was reapplied this year and we see now that after next year it will not exist. The actual degree of tax indexation for each financial year of the Fraser Government has been: In 1976-77, 92 per cent; in 1977-78, 79 per cent; in 1978-79, 35 per cent; in 1979-80 it did not exist at all; and, in 1980-81-the current year-it is 39 per cent. The average for the five years is 49 per cent. We can see that even while we supposedly had tax indexation the Government placed substantial reliance on the secret tax of inflation, to use the Prime Minister's words. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of non-application of full tax indexation on taxpayers has been substantial. It has meant that they have been forced to pay a higher proportion of their income in tax. That is the reason that four out of five taxpayers are now paying more of their income in tax than they paid in 1975. Of course, the situation for the other one-fifth of taxpayers who are paying less of their income in income tax than they paid in 1975 arises because of a discretionary change to the tax system which was introduced in 1977 and which gave substantial tax concessions to high income earners. The rest of the taxpayers are paying more of their income in tax because of the small measure of benefit they received from that discretionary change and the secret tax of inflation which has occurred through the non-application of full tax indexation in any year in the five years of the Fraser Government. In future the non-existence of tax indexation will have a severe impact on taxpayers unless there are fully compensating discretionary changes. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is intended to introduce fully compensating discretionary changes, why make the change in the first place? Discretionary changes are quite possible with the system of tax indexation, as has already occurred with the change in the schedule in 1977-78 to which I referred. The impact of non-application of tax indexation will clearly be to raise the tax burden on taxpayers. This is what the Treasurer meant in his statement on taxation last month in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . personal income tax would under present policies be likely to assume a greater share of that overall burden. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer was saying that the personal income tax burden will be increased. Hence, we not get, a month later, the complete abandonment of tax indexation. The House should also note that the effect on taxpayers of non-indexation will be to cause a higher percentage increase in taxation for low income earners than high income earners. That was fully set out in the table incorporated in Hansard earlier tonight by the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> The importance of maintaining tax indexation relates not just to keeping the tax burden down but also to other matters. It is a supportive mechanism for wage indexation. If we support wage indexation full tax indexation is a very necessary compliment. In fact, the present Prime Minister recognised this in his earlier days when he said in his 1975 policy speech in announcing his reasons for supporting full tax indexation:</PARA>
<PARA> It will support wage indexation. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, it did not take him long to ditch wage indexation-about two months. But that system has limped along since despite government antagonism. But the total removal of tax indexation represents another nail in the coffin of wage indexation. I note also in passing that if the Price Justification Tribunal were abolished tomorrow that would also be a further nail in the coffin of wage indexation as another supportive mechanism would have gone by the board. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has made the point also that tax indexation is a supportive mechanism for an anti-inflation policy. He claimed this in 1976. So, his abandonment of it now means that he is walking away from something which he originally said was important the prevention of inflation. The abandonment of tax indexation has been announced thin this House tonight without reason. There is no reason in the Treasurer's speech for abandoning tax indexation-a system which was said by the Prime Minister to be of enormous importance to the economic health of this country. Yet now we see it abandoned without any reason being given at all. There is simply a canvassing of one reason in favour which is supposedly the discipline for government, one reason against, a supposed inhibition on the Government's Budget flexibility-this is nonsense-then we have the statement that it will be better for the Government to make discretionary adjustments. The Government simply does not say why that is the case. As the Leader of the Opposition said tonight the reason is that the Government sees political value in going back to the old system of secret taxes by inflation because it is not getting enough credit, as it sees it, for tax indexation. It prefers the old system of tax increases by inflation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the statement of the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) this afternoon. It is the product of a great deal of thought and much hard work. It responds to the report of the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals in a way that that report clearly demonstrates was required. The fact is that spending in the health area over the last decade has been increasingly unrestrained and uncontrolled. There has been, regrettably, a great deal of waste of money. The community and governments hoped that that maney was spent in areas of real need and areas that required these huge sums of money. The percentage of the gross domestic product spent on health has steadily increased without, regrettably, an equal improvement in the health services provided. As the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) said in his speech, more money does not necessarily mean better health services. Anyone who has any doubt about this ought to make reference to the Jamison Report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cite just a few examples from the report which I think leaves nobody who has read it in any doubt as to the need for reform. For example, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Information provided to the Commission shows a general over-supply of hospital beds in Australia, significant differences in total provision between States, mal distribution of beds within the States and a close relationship between the supply and use of hospital beds and facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>The report states further:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has sufficient evidence to show that medical technology is proliferating, without proper assessment, and that avoidable variations in staff numbers exist between hospitals of equivalent size and function. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA>The States have been encouraged by the hospital cost-sharing agreements in particular to devote a large share of their health budgets to hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA>The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA> The present budgetary processes are cumbersome and time consuming. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has had evidence of the year-end spend up by hospitals irrespective of needs so that funds will not be reduced in the following year.</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that that is a common syndrome in many publicly funded institutions. The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the attitudes and efficiency of some hospital administrations has not been impressive. The Commission has evidence of ridiculous and unsubstantiated demands for additional staff, inefficient allocation of staff and rostering of overtime, and reluctance to introduce measures with proven cost savings such as contract cleaning. Other examples of wasteful practices include rosters deliberately organised to ensure that certain employees had a guaranteed overtime component in their wages, whether the hours needed to be worked or not, and arrangements for payment of salaries and allowances in excess of award provisions, sometimes with authorisation from the hospital's board but commonly without approval of the appropriate health authority. The Commission regards these as manifestations of poor managerial control and of a total lack of appreciation of the managerial function in publicly funded institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no surprise that the Commission as a result of that and many other pieces of evidence was led to conclusions similar to those following a nationwide survey of the health services. It found:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . health authorities and hospital managements in general have not taken enough trouble to promote cost constraint-they must take more action; financial efficiency has taken second place to spending in many hospitals-this situation must be altered; the present system of funding encourages-</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat the words 'the present system of funding encourages'-</PARA>
<PARA>and promotes expenditure with little consideration of need-need must always be the main consideration;</PARA>
<PARA> No doubt when this Parliament and the State parliaments have voted sums of money for the delivery of health services they had hoped-they ought to have hoped-that those sums were based on the needs of the community. Regrettably, as the Jamison report manifestly demonstrates, that has just not been the case. This uninhibited spending, of course, as the report says, has been based upon the fact that those who deliver the health services have not had to consider the source of their money; they have had to think only about the spending of it. As the honourable member for Petrie remarked, the cost-sharing arrangement has meant that the States and the hospitals have been spending only 50 cents. They have had no inhibition upon them. The new arrangements will ensure control. The States will know the amount they are getting to spend. They will know that an upper limit is provided. The set percentage means that there will be a finite sum for them to spend. At the same time time they will, in a sense, have greater flexibility. In the areas of public hospitals, community health and the school dental health service they will be able to decide how the funds are to be spent. We hope that they will spend them where the need is greatest. The new arrangements will encourage them to spend carefully. They will know that their funds will not be topped up on a 50-50 basis. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes will be effected upon the basis that eligible pensioners and the disadvantaged will continue to receive free hospital services. I believe it is important to repeat that the aged, the chronically ill and the disadvantaged will be protected. I am glad that disadvantaged people have been defined. Previously the determination of who was a disadvantaged person in need of health services has been in the hands of those delivering medical services. It has commonly involved the general practitioner. The definition now provided is, I believe, a reasonable one. It is far better than the disadvantaged person be defined by the Government and that the deliverer of the medical services does not have to concern himself with the definition. It is important to mention the greater support to be given to organisations providing home nursing services. I consider that we should always try to keep people out of institutions. It is true that this contains costs and that is an important consideration. I also believe it is important in that it allows for a quality of care which cannot be provided even in the best of institutions. I welcome the increased subsidy which will, in the next financial year, be paid in respect of 195 additional home nurses. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to health insurance. The existing arrangements have, as circumstances now clearly show, encouraged people to opt out of the health insurance system. One must admit that for many people that was a sensible and logical thing to do. This has meant that free health care has been provided irrespective of income and commitment. It has led to a gross over-use of the free hospital out-patient facilities. I am sure that many honourable members have received complaints from their constituents to the effect that obviously affluent people have been holding places in the out-patients queue at their local hospital ahead of them. Those who most need health services have had to do the paying. The young and healthy-in the present circumstances one cannot criticise them because they have made a logical decision- have not been paying for health insurance. This is unfair and inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA> The older members of the community require about three times the amount of health services that the average member of the community requires. The ones having the greater need have been paying for health insurance. With a smaller proportion of the community having to provide health insurance, the premiums payable have been consequently higher. People who are fit, young and in the work force have not been paying. As I have already said, one can understand their not doing so but it is unfair. It is a little like not paying one's life insurance premium and expecting to collect benefits when one is older. In time the younger people will make demands upon the health services. If the present system had remained they too would be faced with heavy health insurance premiums at a later stage. There is no question that we have to get those who are able to pay for their health costs to do so. It is highly desirable that we encourage them by various means back into the health insurance system. </PARA>
<PARA> At present only 60 per cent of those who ought to be covered by health insurance are covered. In one State the figure is under 56 per cent. The Jamison report itself recognised this. The Committee's 22nd recommendation proposed that people be encouraged to take out health insurance by limiting medical benefits only to those who are insured. The Committee also recommended that a form of health insurance ought to be devised which has equity, freedom of access, payment by those who can afford it and which promotes universal participation. I have no doubt that the new scheme will result in everyone other than eligible pensioners or the disadvantaged moving into the health insurance system. This is as it ought to be. It is consistent with the criteria of equity, freedom of access et cetera that the inquiry recommended. The denial of benefits to the uninsured is a strong argument in favour of insuring. Equally, the tax rebate is a generous incentive. It is worth pointing out that a tax rebate, unlike a tax deduction, does not give an added benefit to those on higher incomes. I congratulate the Minister, who has worked very hard over a number of months, and the Government on the measures they have announced this afternoon. I commend the work they have done and the results they have produced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposal which has been brought into the Parliament this afternoon by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) is the fifth Fraser health plan. I say it is the fifth Fraser health plan because it is obvious that the proposal is not one with which the Minister for Health is happy. The decision has obviously been made in the Cabinet by the supporters of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasury who have decided to dump Australia's health system in the basket. The Minister opened his speech to the Parliament by saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fundamental goal of this Government in the health area is to ensure that all Australians have proper access to health care services of high quality at a cost the individual and the community can afford. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's 28-page speech proposed a system which will ensure that people in the community can either not afford a health service or will not have a high class health service. The Minister, by his complete dismantling of the health system in this country, in my view has done the Australian community a great disservice. After this proposal there is very little else that the Government can give away either to the private sector or the States. I think that is a very sad thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister talked about the important role of the private sector in health care delivery. It is this obsession with the private sector which, in my view, has caused a number of problems for the Australian community. The Government has attempted to prop up the health insurance funds over many years. Recently I received a letter from the Minister for Health in which he said that the Government's hospital reimbursement fund would make the health funds viable. Obviously it has not made them viable and the Government has now decided on a plan which will compel people to be members of health funds. I find it interesting that the honourable member for Chisholm (Mr Harris), who came into this place as the doyen of the private enterprise sector, is now suggesting to us that there should be no free enterprise in the private health plan area; people either join a fund or they make sure that they do not get sick. There will be no middle ground any more in this country if these proposals are put into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this evening the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) stated in this Parliament that 3 1/2 million people in this country at present are not insured. If this Government has its way it will make sure that every last man, woman and child gets themselves insured. Of course, that will mean that many of the Government's friends who are doing quite well out of these health insurance funds will do a lot better than they have been doing in recent years. In fact it does not take one long to cast one's mind back to the scandals that one read about in regard to the large health funds-how they were buying jet aircraft to pilot their executives around the country; how they were entering into massive superannuation payments with regard to the chief executives of a couple of the health funds in Sydney. After the fat was removed from a lot of them they had to cut back on these perks that they were giving to their executives. Honourable members can be assured that when this plan is put into effect they will be back on the gravy train once again. It is rather ironical that even in the days when Bob Menzies was Prime Minister of Australia at least one could get the Commonwealth benefit if one went into hospital, even if one was not in a health fund. Under the free enterprise Fraser Government a taxpayer, if he is not in a health insurance fund, will not even be able to get back in the form of a Commonwealth benefit the money that he has paid to the Commonwealth Government. I think that is a ridiculous situation. It is a terrible proposal for a government which says it believes in freedom of choice to put forward. In the health area there will be very little freedom of choice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Health said how important it is that the private hospital sector should be encouraged. Previous speakers have said that as well. The Government and the Minister should have taken cognisance of the overseas studies that have looked at the private sector of hospitals, particularly in America. I commend to the House an article in the annals of the American Association of Social and Political Sciences entitled 'The Political Economy of Nursing Homes'. That article points out quite specifically how the private nursing home and private hospital operators manage to rip off the system very well. In fact they got to the extent where even the Nixon Government in America was doing its very best to curtail their operations. We have been very fortunate that large American private hospital operators have not really got their hooks into the Australian hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jamison report very trenchantly came out in opposition to allowing large private hospitals to have a big say in the Australian health delivery service. This is not what the Minister for Health has proposed tonight. Under that proposal private hospitals will be not only given as much help but also as much money as they need. The Minister has proposed doubling the daily bed benefit to private surgical hospital entrepreneurs. That is a sad state of affairs when the profit motive will be what determines whether or not people are interested in health care. I thought health care was about care, not the maximum amount of money that one can take from people in beds. This Government has done a terrible thing to the Australian population by putting the health service of this country into that sort of situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard from the honourable member for Chisholm some suggestion about the disadvantaged and who they are. The fact that the Government has continued to use that word suggests that we are back once again to the old nineteenth century proposal of health care as a charity-the old hospices that were run by charitable institutions for the poor people. The Government is getting back to a definition of what that would be-health care as a charity, not health care as a right, as if it is not the right of every Australian to have a fair chance to receive medical aid if he needs it, not whether he can afford it. The fact that one can afford it should not even enter into the discussion. Today the Minister talked about the disadvantaged in the following terms, when referring to the bulk billing system:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that bulk billed medical services provided under the existing disadvantaged arrangements are growing at a rate which indicate that those services have been made available to persons who could not normally be regarded as disadvantaged; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Minister said happened. The reason he gave was the number of people who had been claiming the bulk bill disadvantaged proposal through their local doctor had increased. This was not because there had been an over-utilisation of the service. The reason was that after six years of this Government there are many more disadvantaged people in this country than there had ever been in the past. In fact if the policies of the Fraser Government are allowed to travel on in the way in which the Prime Minister would like, they would ensure that the majority of people in the country became disadvantaged. We would have a small group of advantaged people such as the Prime Minister and the wealthy people, and the rest of the people could not even afford to become ill or to take their children to the doctor if they needed treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot even accept its own definitions at times. We have heard from the Minister and from previous speakers that we have to be able to define who are the disadvantaged; we have to have some sort of formula. Honourable members can bet their lives that the formula would exclude anyone who is in dire straits. The Government has said in the past: 'We will allow the doctor to be the person to decide'. After all, if someone comes into a doctor's surgery, in many instances the local doctor knows that person's economic and family circumstances. Ministers have on many occasions in this House said that the doctor is the one who should make that decision. Now the Government is saying that the doctors cannot be trusted to make that decision any more; we are going to have some bureaucrat in the Health Department in Canberra, the most affluent city in the Commonwealth, making a decision about who is going to be disadvantaged in Sydney, in the Kimberleys, in Melbourne or anywhere else in Australia. That is a ridiculous situation. It does not quite gel with what the Minister said in his speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth also recognises the important role of private doctors in providing health services in the community. In the great majority of cases general practitioners provide primary health care services on the most cost effective basis. The Government therefore believes that the important role of general practitioners should be enhanced wherever possible . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, not to the extent to allow them to make a decision as to who is disadvantaged and who is not. That would be up to some bureaucrat in Canberra. Quite frankly I would not like to leave to the bureaucrats in Canberra the decision as to who was disadvantaged. It has been said on many occasions that the facilities provided in this city tend to isolate people considerably from the real world, from electorates such as mine and electorates such as that of the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) who is sitting next to me. These are the areas in this country where we find the real disadvantaged people. People on the spot there should be able to make the decisions about such matters, not people from the Health Department or whoever the Government decides will be making that definition. The Minister has not been very precise as to how that definition will be arrived at and who will arrive at that definition. To bring down an important statement such as this and not get to that point leaves a lot to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of who is disadvantaged really is at the nub of what we are going to be providing in the health care delivery service in this country. If, as the Minister said, it is about whether the people have an income test that is equivalent to the pensioner health card, how does that help a single income family with eight or nine children? How does that help low income families who have been hardest hit by the policies of this Government and who, it would appear once again, will be hit even worse? How can they afford the $600 or $700 per annum that it costs to insure oneself under a private health scheme? If one has young children, under this scheme that the Government is proposing, one must ensure that one does that. A person who has a number of children who become ill-if the Government has its way by making the States charge what are to be their costs in the hospitals-and who is on a low or medium income in this country will be unable to afford these costs if they are not insured. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said in his speech that the States should be pressed to ensure that they charge the real cost of hospital care. We are all aware that the real cost of hospital care is about $150 per head per day. That is considerably more than the $50 a day that is now charged for public beds or the $75 a day that is charged for shared beds. The cost of being in a hospital under these proposals being forced upon the States by the Commonwealth Government will triple the cost to the individual health consumer. The people who will be hit hardest are the people in this country who are the least able to afford it-the working people, the people with large families, those who are out of work and those who are on the lower social-income levels. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the Government has even recognised that by undertaking to give some benefit back to people who insure themselves. The Government has looked at giving back a flat benefit of 32c in the dollar on the tax scales. It has also said in the statement which was made at the same time by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) that it will take tax indexation away from people but will give them 32c in the dollar back on their health insurance. Of course, that gives a disproportionately higher amount of return to a person on a high income than it does to a person who has a large family and is earning $120 to $150 a week. A rebate of 32c in the dollar will not be of much value to that person. It would be of much more value to the people who are on incomes in excess of $20,000 and $30,000, as are most of the Government supporters. </PARA>
<PARA> The main area in which I am interested regarding the issue which we are debating tonight is the way in which Government has absolutely sold out to the private hospital and nursing home proprietors. It has given a paltry $1m for home nursing services and $120m to nursing home proprietors. The Minister for Health has successfully covered up the report of the Auditor-General that showed there was iniquitous massive overcharging of the Commonwealth in the nursing home area. I am sure, from the statement brought down by the Minister tonight, that the proposed inquiry and the moves to request repayments from those people will not be proceeded with. The private hospital and nursing home proprietors in this country will sit back tonight and throw champagne parties while they live off the people who are in their establishments. </PARA>

<PARA> I commend the Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals, Mr Jamison, and the other two commissioners, Dr Yeatman and Mr De Boos, for their comprehensive inquiry and report. That is the basis upon which the Government has made its changes to hospital financing arrangements, and medical and hospital insurance arrangements. I commend the present Minister for Health for his patience and perseverance during this difficult decision-making period. </PARA>
<PARA> The most significant recommendation that has been made by the commissioners-it has been accepted by the Government-is that the open-ended 50-50 cost sharing arrangement provided by the previous Labor Government has to go. Under that arrangement there was no financial responsibility-or, one could say, the Commonwealth had all financial responsibility but no authority. With the various ruses that the States were able to operate, it was not a 50-50 arrangement. It was more like a 60-40 arrangement. There was no incentive for the States to be efficient or accountable. I am not being critical of the States in that regard. If that sort of arrangement were provided, any level of government or any organisation would naturally take that option. </PARA>
<PARA> When the decision was made to end the cost sharing arrangements, when considered together with the federalist philosophy of this Government that hospitals are a State government responsibility and, therefore, should be allowed and encouraged to be responsible, it was inevitable that either the absorption or general revenue grant approach or specific purpose grant approach, or a combination of the two, would be introduced. I think it is this compromise between the two that we have before us in this statement. It is a compromise. It is a general revenue grant, but it has a percentage identifiable as being the Commonwealth Government's contribution to health care. The Minister stated that at least for an initial period that identifiable percentage will remain. I suggest to the Minister and the Government that they should keep that initial period with that identifiable percentage for as long as possible for practical and political reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister stated that the formula to be used is to be that provided in the 1980-81 financial year in real terms less the revenue that could be reasonably expected to be raised through more realistic hospital bed and out-patient charges. The Commonwealth Grants Commission is then to determine an appropriate formula for State payments in the longer term. I hope that the Government is not too hasty with its phasing-in arrangement and that, during that period, recognition is given of the policies that have operated for many years in the various States and the problems that some of the States have, or would be confronted with if the phasing-in were too hasty. At the end of that period when the formula is applied there should be an allowance or recognition for geographic isolation, which is more apparent and real in some States than in others, and for population movement, et cetera. Beyond that I presume and hope that the formula would be basically an equal per head allocation throughout the States of Australia and that any additional services or facilities that any State desired to have would be paid for by that State from its own sources. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, as pointed out in the report of the inquiry, per head payments in the highest State can be almost double the Commonwealth commitment in the lowest State. The States should also be forced to charge a more realistic amount for hospital beds and generally be more efficient and responsible. That, together with the provision of tax rebates for health insurance payments or premiums and the payment of government rebates through the insurance organisations-as was the case and as was quite well accepted up until 1973-should make those who can afford it pay either directly or indirectly. For those who are in genuine need arrangements will be negotiated with the States and those payments will be covered, as is now the case, by the Commonwealth. Two particular groups are involved. They are the eligible pensioners and the disadvantaged. The Minister and the Government are attempting to achieve a better definition of this disadvantaged group. In the statement the groups are identified as all migrants and refugees in their first six months in Australia, current unemployment and special beneficiaries who on an income test would qualify for the pensioner health benefit card, and other persons who meet a specified income test. As I have not been privy to the additional information that the Minister had incorporated in Hansard, I am not aware of the actual provisions that apply to the last group but it is very much the key group. This group can, quite often, be the most disadvantaged-more disadvantaged than pensioners or people receiving some form of unemployment benefit. The group comprises, for instance, low income or single income families, dependent children, people with chronic illnesses, and people suddenly faced with large payments because of disasters or traumatic experiences. With the flat rate 30 per cent government rebate on medical insurance they could face very large expenditure. I hope that the Government will be flexible and sensible with its definition and its criteria for that group. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the House to the plight of unemployed people in Australia. The benefits to which the unemployed are entitled are miserably low, as we know-$36 weekly for those under the age of 18 years, and $53.45 for those over the age of 18 years. Both married and single recipients of the benefit receive $10 weekly for each dependent child. Benefits are withdrawn on a 50 per cent basis per dollar earned for private incomes within the ranges of $6 to $50 and thereafter benefits are withdrawn on a dollar for dollar basis. The rest of the population is taxed at 32c in the dollar, so why must the unemployed, one might ask, pay substantially more?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further inequity can be seen when one considers the method of taxing the unemployment benefit recipients who are paid the $10 weekly dependant's allowance and do not have this allowance taxed. Yet unemployed persons pay full tax on all money received for dependent children. This is done in the mistaken belief that their unemployment is a temporary contingency and that the unemployment benefit is a temporary benefit. One has only to consider the amounts paid in tax to see the enormous differences paid out when the dependant's allowance is taxed. A single pensioner with six children pays no tax, whilst an unemployed beneficiary pays $771.84. Married pensioners in a similar position pay $484.16 in tax, whilst the unemployed pay the staggering $1,482.56. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter simply to ask the question: Why are the unemployed singled out for what appears to be an iniquitous burden? I am pleased to note that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is in the House and perhaps he might be able to give me an explanation for the differential treatment of various classes of beneficiary which occurs. As we are all aware unemployment, particularly in Australia, is no longer a brief stage in the lives of many people. For many people, it may be an almost permanent state due to the shortsightedness and callousness of this Government's policies. In today's circumstances people are unemployed for increasingly longer periods, particularly unemployed people with dependent children. This issue is raised with me by social workers at the North Richmond family community health centre. I point out to the House that that centre is located in the Highett Street, Richmond, Housing Commission estate. Thousands of single parents and low income people are living in that estate and in that area. The social workers at the centre have had a large number of cases of people receiving the unemployment benefit who have dependent children for whom the next meal and the next rent payment almost invariably represent a crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that economists talk a great deal about marginal costs but when it comes to people in this community for whom the marginal costs mean the difference beteen misery and a sense of security it seems that marginal costs are of very little consequence. I would be very interested to hear from the Treasurer (Mr Howard) just what his justification is for that differential in treatment which exists between the various classes of beneficiaries. I make a suggestion to him of why that is so. It is for the same reason as we have different health treatment for the so-called disadvantaged people and the working poor. It is because one class of people is regarded as undeserving and the other is regarded as deserving. I should have thought that that kind of philosophy should have gone out at some time in the eighteenth century or certainly by the middle of the nineteenth century. I will say one thing for the Fraser Government-it has a great sense of history. It keeps throwing up history, as we have seen it do again and again. The Government treats history as though it somehow relates to the current circumstances. I would be interested to hear the Treasurer explain why the distinction is made on the basis of any contemporary logic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the time available to me tonight I wish to bring to the attention of the House and the people of Australia an organisation known as the Children of God or the Love Family, an evil society that should be banned from this country. The world head of that organisation is an outlawed American by the name of Father David Berg. That man is now barred from re-entering the United States of America and divides his time between living in Switzerland and living in Italy. While an American citizen he was charged with incest and he has a hatred of Americans. It is estimated that his yearly income from the Children of God societies spread throughout the world is of the order of $50m. He is a friend of Libya's Gaddafi.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A young lady, a university student from my electorate, was standing at a bus stop in the city of Sydney recently when she was approached by young men playing musical instruments. They stopped and struck up a conversation with her, eventually inviting her to join them for coffee. Afterwards she was asked to hold hands in prayer, take Christ to heart and to give away her Catholic religion. She was then invited to dinner and accepted, going to a house at 37 Christie Street, St Leonards. She was impressed with the playing of music and noticed some attractive girls who apparently were conducting a so-called escort service. Within 40 hours that attractive, fine young Australian lady was under the influence of those people and was asked to sever all relations with her family. Fortunately, her mother heard of the situation, travelled to Sydney and rescued her daughter from that dreadful, iniquitous society which has a large underground movement with houses in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the society is established in Melbourne also and in other cities throughout Australia. The authentic Bible is misinterpreted by the cult. It uses post office box numbers for its address. There is a branch at Hurstville. Ten per cent of the income from the organisation is paid to Father Berg and is spirited out of the country. The escort service provided by the Children of God is nothing more than prostitution in the name of religion. The organisation is hell-bent on dragging fine young Australian girls and boys down. Fortunately, the young lady from my electorate came out of the spell quickly and was assisted by a Christian gentleman in Melbourne who has had considerable experience with the organisation and has been able to rehabilitate many young Australians who previously were under the influence of that evil organisation. Sometimes that takes some years to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the organisation is masquerading as a religious organisation. Many fine young Australians, both girls and boys, are being spirited into the Children of God movement. They are lost to their families forever. Let that be a warning to parents of young people to warn their children against having anything to do with that society. It is a filthy, rotten organisation and should be banned from this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this Year of Disabled Persons we continually hear members on the Government side of the House detailing what should be done for disabled people. They do not really do anything but they do make a lot of noise. Tonight I challenge the Government, the Liberal-National Country Party coalition-I am glad to see that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is at the table-to stop talking and start doing, to remove the duty and sales tax from imported wheelchairs and accessories. I specify the Amigo chair, which looks more like a golf buggy than a conventional wheelchair. It is highly mobile and can be turned in limited areas, such as in a lift. Its seat resembles that of a normal office chair. It can be rotated through 360 degrees so that it can be backed up to a table and the user can turn the seat through 180 degrees to sit at the table in a chair which looks very little different from any other dining chair or conference chair. Furthermore, it is powered by a battery called a gel-cel which requires no maintenance and contains no acids and therefore can be turned upside down with impunity. This is the only battery which, under international aircraft regulations, can be carried aboard passenger aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australians manufacture a great variety of wheelchairs. At the march of disabled people held in Melbourne on Saturday, 21 March there were numerous electric wheelchairs to be seen and hardly any of them were exactly the same. Therefore, there is a great range manufactured, and it seems that they are largely manufactured on a one-off basis. The Australian wheelchairs are all powered by ordinary wet-cell batteries, usually two of them. They are very heavy and many of them are not capable of being transported in the boot of a car, as is the Amigo chair, which is easily disassembled to place in a car boot. The Australian chairs that can be disassembled are still very heavy because of the weight of the batteries. Therefore, even though the Australian chairs and the Amigo chair can all be designated as wheelchairs, they are, in fact, very different pieces of equipment. The Amigo chair is designed for use inside buildings and for persons who have some limited mobility. It is useful for travelling inside hospitals, libraries, factories and large offices, or for moving from one place to another in a self-driven car, for attending conferences or for air travel. The heavier Australian chair is designed largely for outdoor use. It is heavier, sturdier and far less easy to transport by air. There is no similar or equivalent wheelchair manufactured in Australia. So, if the duty and sales tax were removed we would not be creating unfair competition with the Australian manufacturers. No Australian product remotely resembles the Amigo chair, nor has it the flexibility for plane or car travel. </PARA>
<PARA> I think in the International Year of Disabled Persons the Government could make some generous gesture-it has not made very many lately-and take the sales tax and duty off these wheelchairs. They cost $1,600 to manufacture, but with the duty and sales tax they come to $2,700. That puts them out of the range of the average person who struggles to buy one. We stand up and put one foot in front of the other without thinking about it. But if we could not we would start thinking about using a wheelchair in which we could get around in a manner similar to other people. Dr Ford, who works at the Caulfield Hospital, has an Amigo chair. He is a man who for years has battled strongly against a disability, and it was not really until he got the Amigo chair that he was able to walk-he calls it walking in his chair-as we do. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the International Year of Disabled Persons. The Government has spoken so much about what it is going to do but so far, with a quarter of the year gone, it has done nothing. The removal of sales tax from these wheelchairs would be a gesture that would be appreciated all over Australia. The cost would be negligible to the Government. I assure the Government that the benefits given to the disabled would be tremendous. I urge the Treasurer to pick up this matter and to salvage something out of a week that has not been very good for the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak tonight about a problem experienced by many elderly pensioner couples in our community. This problem occurs when an elderly pensioner couple is separated by illness, one of them having to enter a nursing home. In this circumstance the patient's pension goes toward the cost of the nursing home or private hospital, which frequently absorbs the whole pension. The remaining partner is left to maintain the home and himself or herself on one pension. The costs of running a home do not go down by half when one person is not there. Water rates, municipal rates and other costs stay the same. A telephone becomes even more vital and household costs such as electricity and heating continue. Transport costs also increase when visits to the hospital must be made regularly. The enormous financial strain on a pensioner in this situation is compounded by loneliness and anxiety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this context I would like to discuss the Government's $40 a day subsidy to nursing homes, which is withdrawn when a patient goes home for a visit at the weekend or overnight. I will refer to a specific case in my electorate-Mr and Mrs Urquhart of Boronia. Mrs Urquhart is a patient in a private nursing home. She is 68 years old and has chronic rheumatoid arthritis. Although she is confined to a wheelchair, she is quite mentally alert. Mr Urquhart has heart trouble and is not physically well enough to care for his wife at home. They are both aged pensioners. However, Mr Urquhart would be able to care for his wife at weekends and for other short periods with the help of his family. The problem is that if Mrs Urquhart leaves the nursing home, her family must pay the $40 a day subsidy to secure her place in the hospital. This is clearly an impossibility for an aged pensioner who is finding it an enormous strain to maintain a home on a single pension. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am aware that abuses of the subsidy system could occur, I maintain that we have a moral responsibility to patients in this position. Present Government policy is condemning these people to end their lives in an institution, when there are people wanting to care for them but who are financially penalised so grossly that they are unable to do so. All modern sociological research indicates that patients' well-being is best served in a non-instititionalised environment, and that wherever possible the home environment is best for the elderly. It is time that the Government took account of these findings in planning social services for the elderly. The care of chronically sick elderly patients must be reviewed to take into account the family unit and the best interests of this unit. Some freedom and flexibility can be allowed for by more sensitive and creative planning of care for our elderly citizens caught up in the web of bureaucracy. Schemes have been devised for prisoners in our State penitentiaries to spend weekends at home. Surely our elderly and sick can be catered for in this need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members may be interested to know that this evening I received a letter from a gentleman named Mr Allen McCann, who is an ordinary member of the Campbell-Russell sub-branch of the Returned Services League, advising me that he intended to put a motion before the monthly meeting of the sub-branch at 12.30 p.m. tomorrow. If the motion is adopted by the sub-branch, it will lead to my being investigated by the Australian Capital Territory branch of the RSL with a view to having me expelled from that organisation. The motion accuses me of engaging in conduct subversive to the objects of the League. It was accompanied by a supporting statement which set out my actions in supporting the efforts of the organisation known as Women Against Rape to participate in the annual Anzac Day march. The statement also criticises me for not following the forms of the League in pursuing my goals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I intend to attend the monthly lunchtime meeting tomorrow to deny these charges and to defend my position. I am disappointed at the action of Mr McCann, whom I have always regarded as a friend. However, I am not surprised that the action has been initiated. It was a fairly predictable reaction from the RSL. I am sure-I will say this-that it would be more beneficial to the League if it were to examine its own policies, actions and attitudes rather than spend time examining mine. I think it is ironic that as a member of long standing-I have been a member of the League for something like 35 years-I should be called upon to defend my actions in supporting democratic rights of dissent and freedom of expression of Australian citizens. These are the principles for which our soldiers fought and died and which I serve to defend.</PARA>
<PARA> I have received many expressions of support, including a copy of a letter from a Liberal Party supporter. The original was sent to Sir William Keys and claims that the RSL owes me and the members of my electorate an unreserved apology. The League's actions remind me of its action in expelling members who first spoke out against Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war in the 1960s. I was also very interested to read a copy of a speech by one of my colleagues, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent), in which he said that members of two well-known fascist organisations-the organisation of Ravna Gora Chetniks and the organisation of Captive Nations-many of whose members fought beside Hitler's nazis in Europe, were allowed to march with the Anzacs in Melbourne last Saturday. I am looking forward to my meeting with the Campbell-Russell sub-branch of the RSL tomorrow at lunchtime. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In another place and in Press releases Senator John Button has been impugning the integrity of journalists who work in the Press Gallery of this place. As an ex-journalist, I say that it seems strange that Senator Button would have set out on this campaign of attack on the journalists who work under very difficult conditions in the Press Gallery of this place. He suggested that newspaper journalists are allowing themselves to be crudely used by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I would have thought that the evidence quite clearly shows that the Prime Minister is subjected to what could be described as some healthily cynical and critical journalistic endeavours as a result of interviews and discussions with journalists in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that for Senator Button to say that it is overdue for journalists to take some action about the way in which they are being manipulated by the Prime Minister indicates a view which is not only inaccurate but also which is insulting to members of the Press Gallery who do, under difficult conditions, a job in reporting to the people of Australia what happens here. I do not mind if Senator Button does not like what the Press Gallery puts out. On many occasions I do not like what the Press Gallery puts out. There have been many occasions when I would have criticised members of the Press Gallery. There have been some occasions when there has appeared to me to be the intrusion of personal attitudes in what some members of the Press Gallery have sent out of this place. That is bad luck for me. But I do not believe it is right or proper for Senator Button to allege that journalists are allowing themselves to be manipulated by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the editorial which appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 22 April which recommended to the honourable senator: 'Button up Senator!'. I support the Daily Telegraph's proposition. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> But we resent most strongly and reject utterly yesterday's statement by Senator John Button in which he attempted to cast doubt on the integrity of this and other newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that unless the media are in support of a party, a senator, a government or its leader or the Leader of the Opposition there is a willingness and a readiness to question the integrity of the journalists simply on the basis that they are not evidently supporting the position of the person doing the criticising. It seems to me that if there have ever been attempts to subvert the Press Gallery of this place those attempts, which I hope were effectively resisted, took place during the three years 1973, 1974 and 1975 when the prospect of highly paid jobs in the service of the Government was held out continually to journalists who worked in the Press Gallery of this place. There were 27 jobs for Press secretaries in the Government at that time. Twenty-seven journalists were invited to work for the Government at quite high remuneration. It seems to me that if one wants to endeavour to subvert people here then holding out the offer of well-paid jobs may be a way to do it. I believe that the journalists were not, in fact, subverted. I believe that it is unfortunate that their integrity should be attacked in this way. I do not believe that it is proper that this sort of attack should be made. I totally support them, as a former journalist and as a former district committee member of the Australian Journalists Association. I was a member of the State executive of that union. I believe that it is wrong and improper for the integrity of journalists to have been attacked. I support wholeheartedly the attempts journalists make to report this place accurately. I have some criticisms, but certainly not in terms of criticising the integrity of members of the Press Gallery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) is concerned about the 27 Press secretaries of the Whitlam Government, then he ought to take a look at the 34 Press secretaries in the Western Australian Government and the Government Information Unit. He may then come to a different conclusion about that matter. He should also reflect on the fact that the period of the Whitlam Government was the most open period of any Australian Federal government. There was easy access to government information to which the public had a right, as did the Press. There has been unquestionably a period of a high degree of manipulation of news by various means since that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter I wish to raise in this House was reported in The Age of 28 April. The newspaper carried a report of a request by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to seek United States State Department intervention in the District Court of Pennsylvania requesting it not to assume jurisdiction over an action initiated by the Conservation Council of Western Australia. Honourable members would be aware that the Council alleged that bauxite mining operations of Alcoa Australia (Western Australia) Ltd threaten our jarrah forests and water supplies. The action is against the parent companies of the companies mining in Western Australia's south west. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a great deal of alarmist nonsense talked about this matter by the Western Australian Government and, recently, the Australian Government. In the first place the action, even if totally successful, would not stop bauxite mining in the south west. From the parent company's point of view, the worst possible thing to happen would be for it to be obliged to sell up its 51 per cent holdings in the Australian company. One can readily imagine a number of companies operating in Australia which would be willing to buy. As I have said, that is the worst possible and most unlikely outcome of the case from the company's point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it has been argued that it will affect the North West Shelf project by reducing south west demand for gas. That is more nonsense. At the very worst, it might cause a rescheduling of the State Energy Commission's allocation of gas which might indeed produce a windfall for the SEC if that gas is bought at something like today's prices and delivered to the consumer in the 1990s at the then prices. The Attorney-General has a concern for Australian sovereignty. He ought to extend that concern to a much wider range of Australian controls over aspects of foreign investment in this country and to what amounts to individual sovereignty in our domestic legal system. It is time that this Government and the Western Australian Government recognised that this problem is a direct product of an inadequate access for Australian citizens to their own courts for a reasonable range of what are commonly called class actions. The type of class action attempted by the Conservation Council in the United States Federal Court ought to be available to it here. The Government has had before it quite an extensive review of the matter in a discussion paper by the Law Reform Commission which was printed in June 1979. One of the interesting features of that document is that it points out that current permissive American law on class actions and the more restrictive Australian law on representative actions-or the rather toothless power of intervention by government agencies such as the Trade Practices Commission, in a state of demise, and various consumer protection authorities-stem from common roots in the British judicial system of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. </PARA>
<PARA> The evolution of class action type procedures in the Australian judicial system was largely curtailed by a British case in 1910 which severely restricted the use of representative actions to secure damages. As a result of that court case there has been very little attempt to change Australian judicial procedures in this direction either by legislation or by the interpretations of courts. The matters which the Law Reform Commission raised are complex. I do not deny that. </PARA>
<PARA> But, as the Commission pointed out, the matters are not intractable. The Government ought to press the Commission to a conclusion and bring down a final report on the matter. Better still, it ought to present to the public evidence of its own intention to improve public rights in this area. I suggest that this would be a far more sensible and constructive way for it to proceed in this matter than the way in which it has chosen to proceed to this point. What goes for the Australian Government on this matter, as I said, goes for the Western Australian Government as well. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The recommendations of the National Women's Advisory Council have been carefully studied; those concerning the handicapped child's allowance will be taken into account in any review of that program. The following specific comments are offered:</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendations (a), (c) and (f) would involve a fundamental change in the purpose of the handicapped child's allowance. Currently the allowance is paid to assist parents who have a severely or substantially handicapped child in need of constant care and attention to care for the child at home rather than place him in an institution. The allowance is not in the nature of compensation. Neither is it intended to meet the full cost of caring for handicapped children; rather, it is to assist in meeting the special costs involved.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation (b) concerns assessment guidelines devised by the Department of Health. The question of whether a child is severely handicapped or substantially handicapped is assessed by a medical officer on the grounds of information supplied by the parents and the child's own treating doctor as to the child's medical condition and his capacity to cope. Where appropriate, further examination may be sought. The nature of the assessment involved is thus a matter of professional judgment.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation (d) would also involve amending the Social Services Act; at present the rate of the allowance is reviewed each year in the Budget context.</PARA>
<PARA> Concerning recommendation (e), entitlement to the allowance is generally not affected by the child's absence from home provided the absence is of a temporary nature and the institution concerned does not receive handicapped childrens' benefit or nursing home benefit for the child for the same period.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 24 February 1981:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the Government accept the recommendation in report No. 10 of the National Energy Advisory Committee that Governments should give closer attention to the impacts of equity participation by foreign consumers in new coal developments, particularly in relation to the terms of contracts and prices negotiated by such joint venturers; if not, why not; if so, what action will the Government take, through which authority and when.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1763" SPEAKER="Howard The Hon J.W." NAMEID="ZD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="HAWKER">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In examining proposed foreign investments in new coal projects, including proposals that incorporate equity participation by foreign customers, the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Government give full consideration to all of the benefits and costs associated with customer equity participation, including arrangements for the sale of the output from the projects. As part of this examination process, advice is sought from all Government departments and bodies whose responsibilities may be affected by the proposed investment, including the Australian Taxation Office. The Government is well aware of the implications of foreign customer equity participation, and in order for such participation to be approved it must comply with the foreign investment policy requirements and must not be contrary to the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA> Further scope for protection of the national interest against any adverse export pricing implications of foreign customer equity participation is provided by Regulations 9 and 11 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. These Regulations prohibit the export of certain raw or semi-processed minerals and metals, and of hydrocarbons and nuclear sensitive material unless permission is granted by the Minister for Trade and Resources or an authorised person. This export control power may be used if the need arises to ensure, amongst other things, that fair and reasonable world market prices are paid in respect of exports of Australian coal.</PARA>
<PARA> Additional protection is provided through the taxation arrangements applicable to joint ventures involving customer participation. Where, for example, non-arm's length sales are made, Section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act provides that the Taxation Commissioner has power to determine a taxable income so that an appropriate amount of income tax is payable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My department does not have details of the quantities of cimetidine dispensed in Australia since its introduction. Since cimetidine was listed as a pharmaceutical benefit on 1 August 1978 there have been 125,883 pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions for cimetidine tablets 200mg (each for 150 tablets) processed for payment up until 28 February 1981. This figures does not include supplies of cimetidine from hospitals or under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or on private prescritpion.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee has not received any reports of Australian patients suspected of having developed stomach cancer while using cimetidine.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No. None of the evidence reviewed by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee to date supports the view that cimetidine causes cancer. Nevertheless that Committee and its sub-committee, the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee, will continue to monitor reports and review the literature on this subject and the honourable member may be assured that appropriate action will be taken as considered necessary.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The most recent figures available indicate that 414 babies died in 1978 as a result of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I should make it clear that the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&amp;MRC) does not itself initiate research but responds to applications made by researchers. These applications are assessed by an independent scientific committee, and, after this peer review process, the most outstanding research projects are supported to the limit of available funds. On this basis of scientific merit, the NH&amp;MRC has provided the following funding for direct research into SIDS:</PARA>
<PARA>$  1976  40,000  1977  100,000  1978  110,000  1979  130,000  1980  180,000 1981  280,000</PARA>
<PARA> To this must be added a portion of a $237,000 Program Grant awarded to Professor G. D. Thorburn of the Department of Physiology, Monash University, which will be expended on SIDS research.</PARA>
<PARA> There are however other research projects throughout Australia related to SIDS funded other than from Commonwealth Government funds, e.g. a 3 year grant of $146,349 from the U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to Dr D. Megirian of the University of Tasmania. I do not, however, have detailed information as to the extent of such research.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Under the hospital cost-sharing agreements between the Commonwealth Government and each State Government, whereby the Commonwealth Government meets 50 per cent of the agreed net operating costs of recognised (that is, public) hospitals, the States have undertaken to provide surgical aids and appliances free-of-charge when these are considered necessary by the hospital in the ongoing treatment, care, rehabilitation, etc., of in-patients and registered outpatients of recognised hospitals. The types of aids and appliances supplied differ to some extent among the States.</PARA>
<PARA> Each State has decided and listed the items to be provided generally to patients of its recognised hospitals. Those items have been accepted for the purpose of the cost-sharing arrangements. The Commonwealth has always given consideration to any reasonable State request to extend or vary the list of agreed items.</PARA>
<PARA> According to the agreed lists, the position in each State regarding the supply of catheters, stomal appliances and wheelchairs to patients of recognised hospitals is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>New South Wales</PARA>

<PARA> In addition, in the context of the 1980-81 Federal Budget, there was an announcement of a new Commonwealth program under which a range of aids to daily living are to be provided to disabled people not eligible for assistance under existing Commonwealth, Commonwealth/State or State funding arrangements. This new program is currently being developed by my Department with a view to its introduction later this year.</PARA>
<PARA> Items to be provided under this new Program of Aids for Disabled People include aids for incontinence and wheelchairs (the latter on loan indefinitely). They will be available on prescription and without charge to enable disabled people to live in the community, whether their disability is permanent or of indefinite duration.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS7">Mr Thomson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The service pension was introduced for those veterans who served in a theatre of war to compensate for the indefinable and intangible effects of war service. Eligibility for the service pension is, therefore, dependent upon service in a theatre of war which is defined in section 23 of the Repatriation Act 1920 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ' ''Served in a theatre of war'' means served at sea, in the field or in the air, in naval, military or aerial operations against the enemy in an area, or on an aircraft or ship of war, at a time when danger from hostile forces of the enemy was incurred in that area or on that aircraft or ship of war by the person so serving.'</PARA>
<PARA> The extension of eligibility for the service pension to persons who did not serve in a theatre of war would be contrary to the purpose of this benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Members of the Forces, regardless of the terms of their engagement, who served on Rottnest Island, may be regarded as having served in a theatre of war, provided service there was for a continuous period of not less than three months between 3 September 1939 and 5 May 1944.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Eligibility may be conceded to a member of the Forces who served during World War II on other Australian island possessions at a time when danger from hostile forces was incurred in the area concerned. The declaration of certain areas at certain times as theatres of war is related primarily to known enemy activity in and around these areas. In many cases, an island itself was not subject to enemy activity and may be considered not to have been a theatre of war. However, a veteran who served on such an island may be deemed to have served in a theatre of war, not because of actual service on the island, but because the veteran's passage to the island may have been through an area of known enemy activity. In determining eligibility for the service pension, on the basis of such service, it is necessary to consider each case on its individual merits. For this reason, and because there are a number of islands involved, it is not practicable to provide the precise information requested by the honourable member.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) The health and safety problems likely to be encountered by Commonwealth Public Servants and others in the operation of visual display units have been considered by the National Health and Medical Research Council which has produced an occupational health guide on 'Vision and Eyesight Tests for Visual Display Terminal (VDT) Operators' and a draft occupational health guide on the 'Use of Screen-based Equipment'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the time of the 18 October 1980 Federal election there were 95 Foreign Affairs, Immigration and Trade posts overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Electoral Office, on the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs, appointed Assistant Returning Officers to issue and receive postal voting papers at overseas posts where such appointments were considered necessary to meet the needs of potential voters-54 such appointments were made. The appointment at Bonn also serviced the Cologne post and for the purpose of the election the two posts were treated as one. Appointments were also made at Cocos (Keeling), Christmas and Norfolk Islands and the R.A.A.F. Base Butterworth.</PARA>
<PARA> All other overseas posts (excluding Tehran) were supplied with Postal Vote Application Forms (and with Street Lists and Lists of Polling Places, to assist potential voters to determine the Subdivision and division for which they were enrolled). These posts were instructed to forward any completed Postal Vote Application Forms to the nearest post at which an Assistant Returning Officer had been appointed, for him to issue the appropriate postal voting papers direct to the voter concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> The following statistical information and cost details in respect of the 18 October election have been compiled from information supplied by the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Resources and the Australian Electoral Office. The cost details include overtime worked by Australian based staff as a direct result of federal election related activities; employment of locally engaged staff to work wholly on federal election related activities at the busier overseas posts, e.g. London, Port Moresby, Singapore, Athens; overtime worked by locally engaged staff as a direct result of additional work load created by federal election related activities; air freight of election material to overseas posts; advertising costs associated with advising potential electors of the election and of the availability of postal voting facilities at overseas posts; hire of accommodation and equipment at some posts; printing of postal vote application forms and posters advertising the availability of postal voting facilities in London; miscellaneous payments for postage and stationery, as well as the cost of supplying updated microfiche electoral rolls for use at posts where Assistant Returning Officers were appointed. The cost details do not reflect normal salaries of officers (both Australia based and locally engaged) employed on federal election related activities; the cost of the voting materials and forms used at overseas posts; the cost of cables despatched to posts or the return to Australia (for destruction) of the microfiche elector rolls and return of postal ballot papers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Committee of Inquiry into Electricity Generation and Sharing of Power Resources in South-East Australia has been acquiring information relating to its terms of reference since its inception in April 1980. In view of the technical complexity arising from these terms of reference it is not considered likely that the Committee's report will be available before mid 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As a relatively early final report is anticipated from the inquiry, there would be little advantage in asking it to produce an interim report. While the inquiry is directly concerned with the possibility of further integration of the particular States existing and planned electricity systems, the future pattern of development of the electricity supply system within a particular state is primarily a matter for the State Government concerned.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) There are no estimates available on a common basis of salinity control costs in the various categories of uses of River Murray water. However, this financial year the Commonwealth is providing assistance to the three States on a dollar-for-dollar basis for salinity control works to implement the Maunsell plan of action for dealing with salinity and drainage problems in the Murray Valley, as follows: New South Wales $2.23 million, Victoria $1.473 million, and South Australia $2.325 million. In addition, the River Murray Commission has budgetted for an expenditure of $118,000 this year on salinity control works within this area of responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no evidence to suggest that irrigated agriculture in South Australia is likely to become non-viable in the foreseeable future. To the contrary, salinity control works now being undertaken in all three States, together with proposed new water quality functions for the River Murray Commission, could lead to a gradual reduction in salinity in River Murray water used for agriculture in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Estimates are not available to enable the costs to South Australia of salinity in its water supplies to be compared with those of the other States. The Commonwealth does not have responsibility for advising what control South Australia has on action of upstream States which worsen salinity in the Murray nor for paying compensation or seeking compensation from other States in relation to salinity problems in South Australia. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth is making a significant financial contribution towards the cost of improving water quality in South Australia by funding salinity control projects in all three States, works undertaken by the River Murray Commission and by assistance towards the cost of filtration plants for Adelaide's water supplies.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes. I have been advised that the Commonwealth has no legal obligation to compensate South Australia for water quality problems in the River Murray in that State.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) and (7) Action now being taken by the Commonwealth and the States in the control of salinity in the Murray Valley and proposed water quality responsibilities for the River Murray Commission should tend to ensure that river water quality in South Australia does not decline to a point where alternative sources of water or desalination measures are necessary.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The decision of the High Court in F.C. of T. v Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation Limited is reported in volume 80 of Australian Tax Cases at page 4373.</PARA>
<PARA> The report discloses that the case involved the application of section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act by the Commissioner of Taxation. That section applies where, among other things, an Australian business is either controlled principally by non-residents or is carried on by a company which controls a non-resident subsidiary and, because of those circumstances, the business produces less taxable income than might otherwise be expected.</PARA>
<PARA> The High Court held that the provisions of section 136 did not apply to the particular facts of the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation case. The majority of the Court found as a fact that, in the years in question, the business of the company was controlled principally by directors who were residents of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated in my statement to the House of 12 March 1981, section 136 is under review with particular regard to the abovementioned case.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is no information on this matter contained in the published report of the case. The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that he is precluded by the secrecy provisions of the income tax law from commenting on it.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The last OECD Survey of the Australian economy, released in June 1980, canvassed a number of issues relating to the pricing of energy resources and concluded that ''. . . the pricing of some energy forms, particularly electricity, may not in some areas be ideal for proper resource allocation and would appear to involve undue subsidies'' (p. 55).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) This conclusion by the OECD reflects its concern that the pricing of energy resources in general, including electricity, should be such as to ensure efficiency in the allocation of those resources.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that resource allocation issues should be properly taken into account in energy pricing, as is evidenced by its policy of import parity pricing of indigenous crude oil.</PARA>
<PARA> The determination of the terms and conditions under which electricity is made available to particular consumers by State electricity authorities is the responsibility of the State Governments concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Government is anxious that a fair share of the income generated by projects developing our minerals and energy resources accrues to Australians or is otherwise spent in Australia. Such projects, of course, generate considerable expenditure in Australia for the purchase of goods and services and the payment of wages and the effects of this flow on to the economy generally. Beyond that, the Government's foreign investment policy stipulates that, wherever practicable, Australians should have the opportunity to participate with foreign investors in major projects and this is a significant avenue for a share of the benefits arising from the development of national resources to accrue to Australians. Taxation of the income generated by major projects-both at its source and again if repatriated abroad-is another important avenue through which benefits accrue to Australians. The States, too, have a role to play through the terms and conditions applying to the provision of projects' energy and infrastructure requirements.</PARA>

<PARA> Australia signed the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978 (STCW), subject to ratification, on 30 November 1979. The Convention relates to both international and domestic shipping. It is necessary, therefore to ensure that not only Commonwealth legislation but also State and Northern Territory legislation gives effect to the requirements of the Convention before Australia ratifies the Convention. Action is proceeding through the Marine and Ports Council of Australia (MPCA) to develop the appropriate legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth enabling legislation is contained in Navigation Amendment Act No. 98 of 1979 and subsidiary legislation in the form of regulations and orders is well under way.</PARA>
<PARA> The States and the Northern Territory are also working towards adjustment of their legislation which will complement the Commonwealth legislation to give complete coverage for all of the requirements of the STCW Convention and thus allow for its ratification by Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2). It is not possible to estimate with accuracy the additional cost of paying an income tested age pension to men aged 60 to 64 years because of the lack of data on their income distribution. In addition, it is not known what effect the lowering of the pensionable age would have on workforce participation rates of men aged 60 to 64 years.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also not possible to estimate with any accuracy the extent of any savings that would result from younger unemployment beneficiaries getting jobs consequent upon any reduction in the workforce participation of men aged 60 to 64 years. It is expected, however, that substantial additional costs would be involved. The estimated cost of paying an income test free pension to all men from age 60 gives some indication of the order of magnitude of the maximum gross costs which could be involved in lowering the pensionable age for men from 65 to 60.</PARA>
<PARA> The additional cost of paying an income test free pension to all of the 288,000 residentially qualified men aged 60 to 64 years would be about $550 million in a full year. This cost is additional to the estimated $300 million annual cost of existing payments to some 110,000 male invalid and repatriation service pensions and unemployment and sickness beneficiaries aged 60 to 64 years. These costs are based on the estimated number of residentially qualified males aged 60 to 64 years in the population, and male pensioners and beneficiaries aged 60 to 64 years as at December 1980, and pension rates applicable from November 1980. The costs are gross costs in that they make no allowance for the additional revenue that would result from the inclusion of the payments in income for the purpose of income tax.</PARA>
<PARA> The actual gross costs that would be involved in lowering the pensionable age for men from 65 to 60 could be expected to be somewhat lower than the maximum cost set out above, particularly in the short-term since many older people would have already planned their retirement on the basis of age pension eligibility at age 65.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) These analyses provide a means, albeit elementary, of assisting field staff in the screening of income tax return data with a view to the selection of taxpayers for audit/investigation examination. Although the analyses are considered to be quite effective in achieving this purpose, research is being carried out to develop more sophisticated screening methods.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) In recent years taxation officers have carried out a number of specific projects designed to detect instances of tax evasion in the building and construction industry. While these projects have been spread over a wide area of Australia it was considered that the results obtained would not form a sound basis for measuring the extent of tax evasion in the total industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) In addition to audit and investigation operations, the Taxation Office undertakes a number of information matching programmes whereby data (e.g. details of dividend and interest payments) are obtained from exterior sources and matched with information disclosed in income tax returns. The purpose of these programmes is not only to detect tax evasion but to encourage the highest possible level of compliance from taxpayers through the knowledge that such programmes are conducted. Enforcement activities also include action to detect persons who are obliged, but who have failed, to lodge income tax returns.</PARA>
<PARA> Statistics relating to the revenue results achieved from all enforcement programmes were detailed in the Commissioner's 59th Report to Parliament.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr Street</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) As I understand the article, the allegations concerning 'factionalism, deliberate nationalism, nepotism (&amp;) sexism' refer to the permanent staff of the UN secretariat and not to any 'weakness in Australia's diplomatic voice'.</PARA>
<PARA> As for the alleged ''lack of expert advisers and under representation'', it will be appreciated that it is not possible, given the need for financial restraint, for Australia to be represented at all United Nations conferences by specialists. In 1980 there were over 200 UN conferences and this figure does not include meetings of the specialized agencies. No member state is represented by specialists at all UN conferences. This is a fact of life not only for Australia but, to varying degrees, for all members of the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA> In this respect, the question refers in particular to the fields of outer space and the high seas. The chairman of the major sub-committee of the United Nations Committee on Outer Space is Professor J. H. Carver of the Australian National University, who is only one of a number of experts who represent Australia at UN conferences on outer space. Australian delegations to sessions of the Conference on the Law of the Sea include specialist representatives drawn from the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Treasury, Defence, Trade and Resources, Primary Industry, Attorney-General's, National Development and Energy, as well as from State Governments and the Australian mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The article also refers to Australia's non-representation on the ''committee which is drafting the final agreement on rights of the sea''. I believe that this is a reference to the Drafting Committee of the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea. This Committee has only 23 members, and Australia is not one of them. However, Australia is a member of other important committees of the Conference, in accordance with the UN practice whereby membership of key committees is distributed equitably among all UN member countries.</PARA>
<PARA> On those occasions when it decided not to send a specialist representative from Australia to a United Nations Conference, members of our permanent missions to the United Nations, who themselves have considerable experience-and often specialist training-are guided by detailed briefs which draw on expert advice available in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) Yes. Dr D. J. McKay, in charge of the Sterility Unit of the National Biological Standards Laboratory (NBSL), attended the 2nd International Kilmer Memorial Conference on The Sterilisation of Medical Products, in Washington, USA on 16 and 17 October 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> The conference, amongst other matters, reviewed the official requirements for sterilisation and sterility testing used in different countries. Dr McKay (and his official counterparts from USA, Canada, Great Britain and a number of other countries) attended so that industry could be adequately informed of Australia's official requirements. Fares and expenses for the officials from other countries as well as Dr McKay, were met, it is understood, by Johnson and Johnson Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Sterility Unit, NBSL, has tested up to date 2423 tampons representative of all suppliers of the Australian market for the presence of staphylococci. Mr Tribe, Chief Inspector, NBSL, inspected the manufacturing practices at Johnson and Johnson.

<PARA> (4) It is understood that this is factual.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) There was and has been no conflict of interest. The association of tampons with the toxic shock syndrome has been recognised only recently and was not a matter of concern in Australia at all when the invitation to the USA was accepted in April 1980.</PARA>

<PARA> Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO); South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO).</PARA>
<PARA> Kampuchea's seat in the Non-Aligned Movement has been kept vacant since 1979, pending a resolution of the competing claims by the regimes of Democratic Kampuchea (DK) and the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK). Chile has not attended NAM meetings since the overthrow of the Allende regime in 1973, but has not been expelled from the Movement. At the NAM Foreign Ministers' meeting in New Delhi in February this year, St Lucia was welcomed to NAM membership. Also at that meeting, Belize (formerly British Honduras, which is expected to attain its independence this year) was granted special status (honorary membership) with the right to address the meeting. Malawi was not represented at the New Delhi meeting. Burma withdrew from the NAM after the Havana Summit meeting in 1979, and at present appears to have no intention of rejoining the Movement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Bureau of Meteorology's official temperature observations for Hobart are taken at the Tasmanian Regional Office of the Bureau which is located about one kilometre to the south of the Hobart city centre. The site is well exposed in all directions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The prevailing wind streams over southern Tasmania are westerly and therefore the observing site is often on the leeward side of Mount Wellington. However I am informed by the Director of Meteorology that the flow of air over mountains often leads to a warming of the air on the leeward side. This effect, known as the Foehn wind effect, is characteristic of nearly all mountain areas and would tend to make the temperatures registered in Hobart higher than on the windward side of Mount Wellington.</PARA>
<PARA> Statistics on temperature at various locations in the Hobart area show there is very little variation from the readings obtained at the Bureau site and these official recordings are therefore a good representation of the temperatures experienced by the majority of the population of Hobart.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) In USSR at present there are 18 reactors in various stages of construction at 11 different sites, but specific information such as the actual date of starts of construction of individual units is not always available. Additional manufacturing capacity is being commissioned in the Atommash reactor plant at Volgodnsk where plans call for the production of seven 1000 MWe pressurised water reactors (PWRs) in the 1981-85 period. The capacity of this complex will eventually be 8 reactors per year. Upgrading is also under way on other nuclear equipment manufacturing plants such as the Izhorsk factory in Leningrad to produce components for the 1000 MWe PWR systems. Reactors of the smaller 440 MWe PWR class will be manufactured by the other Comecon partners in future. Czechoslovakia for instance plans to produce three or four 440 MWe PWRs annually, plus equipment and components for a further 8 reactors per year to be sent to the USSR.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Details of the latest five year plan (1981-85) have not yet appeared in the literature. Draft plan guidelines, to be presented for adoption at the 26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (February 1981), were reported to include 24,000-25,000 MWe of new nuclear capacity within the USSR by the end of the period. Nine stations were mentioned specifically.</PARA>
<PARA> Within the past twelve months Communist news agencies have quoted overall targets of 100,000 MWe nuclear generating capacity within the USSR and 37,000 MWe capacity within other Comecon countries by 1990.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to Mr Kerin's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The product known by the brandname Compudose consists of a silicone rubber implant impregnated with oestradiol-17B and is designed to allow removal prior to the slaughter of the treated animal. It is claimed that this form of administration ensures that the oestradiol levels in treated animals are not in excess of natural levels at the time of slaughter. The product has not been evaluated for use in Australia by the relevant subsidiary committees of the Australian Agricultural Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council. These committees make recommendations to the States which have the responsibility for the registration and control of veterinary drugs.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1796" SPEAKER="Howard The Hon J.W." NAMEID="ZD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="HOTHAM">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Taxation Office has used computers to issue notices of assessment since 1966. The rate of issue of notices is marginally higher in 1980-81 than it was in 1979-80 but the reasons for this are more related to earlier lodgment of returns and growth in the taxpayer population than to the use of computers to prepare the notices. The overall effect of these changes is that slightly more tax becomes due for payment by 31 March which is the earliest due date for payment by persons subject to provisional tax. Most taxpayers have not been affected but some have been required to pay a little earlier than in previous years.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In performing his statutory functions, the Commissioner of Taxation must have regard to the fiscal requirements of the Budget which are framed on the assumption that taxpayers will meet their obligations as they become due and that most of the tax due in a financial year will be collected within that year, i.e., by 30 June. For these reasons it is the established practice to grant extensions of time to pay only to those taxpayers who are able to demonstrate that they are experiencing serious financial difficulties caused by unforeseen circumstances. This procedure seems to be no more than fair to the great majority of taxpayers whose financial affairs are arranged so as to enable their taxation commitments to be promptly met.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) (i) 800 sheep; no cattle. (ii) 600 sheep; no cattle. (iii) 1,600 sheep and 150 cattle.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) 200-400 sheep are driven across the bridge four or five times per week.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes, for shearing, crutching and similar activities. Sheep are taken across the Barton Highway by trucks once every 3-4 months.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The approximate current values of buildings on the three areas of land referred to in question (1) are: $30,000, $300,000 and $460,000 respectively. The approximate value of improvements to the property such as fencing, roads, dams, irrigation works and pasture is of the order of $200,000; $500,000 and $600,000 for the three areas of land referred to in (1).</PARA>
<PARA> (5) CSIRO requested the National Capital Development Commission to provide a safe means of moving stock across Kuringa Drive because certain facilities such as animal handling yards and weighing equipment occur only to the north of Kuringa Drive. 40 to 50 crossings of the bridge are made each day by trucks, tractors or other farm vehicles.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Senators and members have always been able to engage relief staff directly to cover absences of electorate secretaries, though it is only since May 1979 that relief has been approved for electorate-legislative assistants, either from the relief pools or by direct engagement.</PARA>
<PARA> Relief pools have not been abolished because there has been little change in the demands placed on them by senators and members for relief staff. For example, records held in my department show that, for the nine months to 31 March 1981, 77.5 percent of all relief was sought from the pools and only 22.5 percent was recruited direct by senators and members.</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the pools is to ensure so far as possible that members always have a full complement of staff. Pool requirements are kept under constant review and, should there be a change in the pattern of demand, I will take appropriate action to adjust their size.</PARA>
