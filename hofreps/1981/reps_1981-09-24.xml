<TITLE>Community Youth Support Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Victoria respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the serious youth unemployment problem is a direct result of the community's failure to create sufficient jobs.</PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances the decision to abolish Community Youth Support Schemes (CYSS) is a socially retrogressive step. The CYSS Projects provide valuable support services and work training for many young unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned are concerned that the closure of CYSS Projects may lead young unemployed to become involved in anti-social behaviour such as crime, vandalism, prostitution, rebellious behaviour and mob action. There is the even more frightening prospect that many more young people will give up hope of obtaining a job, become idle and even contemplate suicide.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government reverse its decision to abolish CYSS Projects and provide sufficient funds to enable the various CYSS Centres to continue their valuable work with the young unemployed in the future.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Division of Ballarat respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) that the action of the Government in terminating the Community Youth Support Scheme will have serious effects upon the life possibilities of a significant number of young people who, through circumstances totally outside their control, are not able to find any form of paid employment,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the action of the Government fails to understand that many unemployed youth do not fit into the retraining initiatives proposed and that part of the need within the total context of school-to-work transition is to have support structures based around the Community Youth Support Scheme model,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that the failure to provide such supports will place many young people in a position of high vulnerability to crime, violence, vandalism, drug abuse, and even suicide, and that the incidence of homelessness and family breakdown will be further aggravated.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned members of the Warragul and district community, are concerned about the Budget decision to abolish CYSS.</PARA>
<PARA> In doing so, we believe that the Government has, in effect, turned a blind eye to the social and economic problem of increasing youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> Without CYSS or a similar alternative, the government has taken away the only form of support being offered to the unemployed youth of Australia. The Government has taken away the place where young unemployed people come for various reasons, from general support, counselling, skills training etc., to help with employment issues, the only place where they can even chat and drink coffee with those in similar circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has allocated more money into Training Programs. They can be no solution standing alone as they are not jobs, nor apprenticeships, which are sorely needed, and they do not necessarily offer any guarantees of being better equipped for employment.</PARA>
<PARA> A Community Youth Support Scheme is still greatly needed and in abolishing the program, the Government is not fulfilling its obligation to the youth and future leaders of this country.</PARA>

<TITLE>Defence Service Homes Loans</TITLE>
<PARA>To The Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the members of the Women's Services of the 1939-45 War not at present considered eligible for Defence Service Home Loans should qualify as 'Australian Soldiers' under the Defence Service Homes Act. They volunteered for service with the Naval, Military and Air Forces, serving wherever they were sent in whatever capacity they were required and yet they are refused Defence Service Home Loans.</PARA>
<PARA> They took the oath to resist His Majesty's enemies which meant to fight His Majesty's enemies, and although not used in actual combat in war zones, they were available for that use and had a sufficiently grave need arisen would have been used, to serve with distinction as have women in other lands.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Acts and Regulations of the period, the women of the Military Forces had enlisted for service anywhere, some of the Naval women to sail in any waters, others with service on warships optional, while the women of the Air Force could have been sent to Papua New Guinea or other territories under the control or care of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Ex-servicemen of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force who volunteered in the 1939-45 War but were not sent to War Zones are granted home loans. Not to grant eligibility to all Ex-servicewomen of 1939-45 War is unjust and unfair.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you favourably consider amending the Defence Service Homes Act by repealing Sub-section 4 (2A) (b) (c) (d) of the Principal Act as amended by No. 137 of 1978, and grant eligibility to all members of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service, and the Voluntary Aid Detachment of 1939-45 War</PARA>

<TITLE>Tertiary Education</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. the proposal to introduce fees for higher and second degrees will mean that access to post-graduate and recurrent education will be limited to the rich; Australian research and ability to cope with technological change will suffer; this proposal must be seen as a step in the direction of the introduction of fees for all tertiary students.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. the proposed introduction of a loans scheme for students will mean graduating with a heavy debt or being denied a tertiary education if loans are refused because a student is seen as a ''poor risk'' (particularly affecting women and those doing non-vocational courses); only the rich will be able to get a tertiary education without course restrictions and the burden of indebtedness.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. in regard to the proposal to restrict eligibility for TEAS and the foreshadowing or reviewing TEAS levels only in the light of the availability of loans, it should be noted that any further downgrading of TEAS, which is already inadequate, can only further limit access to education.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. the proposed restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance to those needing qualifications for employment will severely restrict access to a full high school education and necessary bridging education to tertiary education for those who left school early.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. the proposal not to fund 30 Colleges of Advanced Education if they are not rationalised is an attack on teacher education. This attack will create teacher shortages in the mid 1980s, restrict access to education now and endanger the future quality of teaching available to Australian children.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) post-secondary tuition fees not be introduced for any courses or for any category of students;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the TEAS scheme be extended so as to more fully meet the real financial need of students;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that a comprehensive loans scheme not be introduced;</PARA>

<PARA> (i) the financial situation of students enrolled at Australian post-secondary institutions is already extremely difficult (as indicated in the Commonwealth Department of Education's 1979 survey of student incomes and expenditures) and any substantial increase in the financial commitments of students would gravely worsen their financial difficulties.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I ask a question of you. In view of the secrecy that appears to surround the current deliberations of the Privileges Committee and the effect that secrecy could have on the decisions this House may have to make on any recommendations of the Committee, I ask: Have any persons appearing before the Committee been instructed that they cannot consult with their own counsel about matters which transpire before the Committee? If this is so, will it create the impression that the Committee is conducted in the context of a secret court? Lastly, will the evidence of the proceedings of the Privileges Committee be made public prior to the House being called upon to make a decision upon any recommendations that may be placed before it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="Mr SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the honourable gentleman is under a misapprehension about the role of the Speaker in relation to privilege matters. The Speaker has an obligation under the Standing Orders to ascertain the material raised by the person who brings up the matter of privilege, and out of that material the Speaker is obliged to decide whether or not there is a prima facie case. In the instant matter I did look at the material-I had had the opportunity of seeing it before, it having been brought to my attention-and I found there was a prima facie case. Then, under the Standing Orders, I gave the honourable member for Dundas an opportunity to consider the motion he would bring up. In the event, the motion was brought up and voted on by the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want the honourable member and all other members of the House to know that the Speaker is the servant of the House, and the Standing Orders make provision for the Privileges Committee to examine a matter. The conduct of this matter is in the hands of the Privileges Committee. The Committee is entitled to make preliminary reports and a final report. It has the exclusive right to the conduct of the matter before the Privileges Committee. Certainly, there is no means whereby the Speaker is authorised to attempt to influence in any fashion the findings of the Privileges Committee. When the findings come before this chamber the members of parliament in the chamber will be able to make up their minds on the basis of the report. At this stage, I can go no further than that.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1737" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be adopting the same approach at this meeting. If anyone shows an interest in Australia's position, I will point out how, over the last 10 or 12 years, general tariff levels have been reduced very significantly in Australia, how we use quantitative restrictions or non-tariff devices to a much lesser extent than most other countries and how we do not have voluntary restraint arrangements, which most of the other advanced industrial countries have, which they practice very greatly and which impinge upon our exports as they impinge upon the exports of many other countries. I think one point does need to be emphasised. I can well understand those who argue for lower levels of protection and freer trade. I believe that all of us would understand and know that that will assist in promoting healthier and stronger industry in Australia and in increasing productivity around the world. It will assist in enabling those who can do things well to do more of them and to do so more competitively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time, obviously, a movement in that direction, as we had with the textiles, apparel and footwear industries, needs to be gradual and within the capacity of domestic industries to absorb the structural changes which are necessary if that kind of movement is to take place. I think the changes in the textiles, apparel and footwear industries are classic examples and the decisions we took a year ago are a very good example of how it is possible to free trade, to provide preference for developing countries, and to provide greater access to our market for imports and, at the same time, to do so in a way which has encouraged continuing investment. But the industries know that substantial restructuring is still required and inevitable as a consequence of our decisions.</PARA>
<PARA> The other point that ought to be made is that the arguments for a lower level of protection stand in their own right philosophically and on their own logic. People sometimes say that this is a highly protectionist country, more protectionist than any other, and in trying to reinforce that argument do Australia a grave disservice because that wrongly describes the Australian position relative to what is done in many countries of Europe, in Japan and in many cases even in North America. The Australian markets are open and therefore, in the process of arguing for lower levels of protection, there is no need to criticise the access that is already available to the Australian market. I have had prepared recently a lengthy document on this subject. If the honourable member would like a copy of it, I would be very happy to make it available to him. I know that he would understand that I am not casting him in the role of the kind of person I was mentioning in the last part of my answer, one who criticises his own country unjustly in order to make a point that stands on its own logic in any case.</PARA>

All honourable members would be aware that on some occasions building projects, even small domestic projects, can be much more readily achieved and more speedily accomplished if a cash payment is made rather than a cheque. The extension of the sales tax to this area certainly will bring money to the Government's coffers. On the other hand, I am bound to say that the amount of money that will come in by way of increase in this particular area will not be significant and, therefore, this will not be an important area in relation to the Budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although I do not agree that the Air Safety Investigation Branch report on the Advance Airlines of Australia crash suggests that there was gross incompetence or any dereliction of responsibilities by the Department of Transport for the safe operation of the aircraft which was involved in the crash, I have reconsidered my decision not to institute a board of accident inquiry into this tragic accident.

<PARA>I feel that there is a public interest in this matter that should be resolved by a board of inquiry. The circumstances of the accident were of such tragic consequence to the relatives and friends of those who were lost in the accident that I believe there should be no lingering doubts about the way in which air safety surveillance is conducted in this country. Although the Department of Transport has a record second to none in civil aviation air safety, I believe that if there are doubts in people's minds they should be tested before a board of accident inquiry.

Since that date 225 applications have been received for certification as qualifying Australian films. Of this number of applications, 130 certificates have been issued and six applications have been rejected. In the light of the success of the Australian film industry, it may be of interest to honourable members to know that of the 225 films, 107 have been applications in respect of feature films or animated feature films. So far 80 applications have been processed and have received provisional certificates. Applications have been received in respect of 91 documentaries. Forty-one have been processed and have received provisional certificates. Two of seven applications for mini-series of television dramas have received provisional certificates and seven of 14 applications in respect of telemovies have also received certificates. The total budget of the films in respect of which provisional certificates have been granted would, if those films are produced in accordance with their budgets, have amounted to the order of $114m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of the outstanding applications, 59 are currently being processed and 30 are still to be processed. Thirty-three of those are applications that were received in July, 33 were received in August and 23 in September. Honourable members would be aware also that after my predecessor made a statement late last year a large number of applications were received. Of the 91 that were notified prior to 24 June, nine have withdrawn their applications. There are 82 proposals in respect of which we have not had formal applications under the legislation. Since 24 June there have also been a number of other proposals which have been informally notified to my Department, but as yet no formal notification has been received.</PARA>
<PARA> These figures show the great strength of the Australian film industry, the initiatives that are being taken and the encouragement that is being given to people to develop worthwhile film proposals. The applications are being processed as quickly as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the statements that were made by the new Australian Labor Party Senator Jones in his maiden speech in the Senate last week. I am advised that the allegations are completely incorrect. The facts are that during the normal summer wet season a small quantity of uranium ore, which was being stockpiled at the Ben Lomond uranium prospecting operation near Charters Towers, developed minor seepage. I am advised that the Queensland Water Quality Council took water samples at the time from the nearby Keelbohorn Creek and the Burdekin River beyond Ben Lomond. Tests have shown that levels of radio activity were much below the safety levels quoted by the National Health and Medical Research Council for drinkable water. In fact, I am advised that the creek water is under continuous monitoring with samples being taken every three weeks in the wet season and every six weeks in the dry season. At no time have any levels of gross alpha or gross beta radio activity been found in the creek water. It is perfectly drinkable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of the honourable senator's statement a story appeared in a Singapore newspaper following which the Singapore Department of Primary Production sought clarification from the Australian High Commission. Singapore authorities have been advised of the facts and have been reassured. I suppose the only other point to make is that this was a shoddy and completely irresponsible statement for this honourable senator to make. He is either dimwitted or dumb-I am not sure which-and he has certainly done irreparable damage to the reputation of the beef industry. I have to reassure the beef industry of the facts in relation to the matter. It was totally irresponsible of this honourable senator and scandalmongering of the worst type.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Transport whether it is correct that, as a result of Government Budget policy of increasing existing sales tax and imposing sales taxes on commodities that were previously tax free, private bus operators will now be required to pay 17 1/2 per cent sales tax on motor oil and grease and on the purchase of new buses and parts? Will this impose an additional expense of more than half a million dollars per year on the cost of providing these services? Do these bus operators provide services in country areas and in out of town, newly developing suburbs of the major cities? If so, what will the Government do to give some relief to these operators so that they can continue to provide a service for the people who so badly need it? Is it also a fact that government buses and transport systems do not have to pay these taxes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first question is yes. The answer to the second question is yes. The answer to the third question is yes. I assume that, as with any form of tax, the private bus operators would absorb that tax within their normal operating costs just as they have to pay rates, rents, company tax or whatever. This adds to the broadening of the base of the tax system of this country. This has been sought by many sensible people in this country for some time. I am certain that it will not result in the curtailment of bus services in the country areas.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to inform the House that Mr Harold Gibson Weir has ceased to hold the office of Commonwealth Parliamentary Librarian. Mr Weir has been absent from duty since early July this year and on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Medical Officer is currently on sick leave pending retirement. Mr Weir was first recruited to the Commonwealth Public Service in August 1965 when he joined the Department of Labour and National Service. His first appointment to the parliamentary service was in January 1968 when he joined the staff of the Department of the Parliamentary Library to establish the Education and Welfare Group of the Legislative Research Service. Under his direction that group became a highly effective element in the Research Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In June 1973 Mr Weir left to take up a position with the Australian Institute of Criminology where he was subsequently promoted to Secretary of the Institute. He returned to the Parliamentary Library in August 1976 as Assistant Parliamentary Librarian and was appointed Parliamentary Librarian in 1978. In that capacity he worked strenuously to ensure that all parliamentarians received prompt and impartial service. Under his administration the Department of the Parliamentary Library underwent change and development to a degree probably not known since the inception of the Legislative Research Service in the mid-1960s.</PARA>
<PARA> During his time as Parliamentary Librarian the resources of the Library have greatly increased and there are better career opportunities for staff than ever before. Technical advances have been very considerable and at the national and international level the Department is recognised as one of the best of its kind. I greatly regret that ill health has caused his early retirement and I wish to pay tribute to his most valuable contribution to the working of the Parliament. It is true that during his period as Librarian the Library continued its course of transformation from what one might call a library in the strict sense into an intellectual resource centre for members of parliament. I wish Mr Weir and his wife a long and happy retirement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Commonwealth housing grants to the States have had a pretty good airing in this House in recent times. However, I make no apology for raising the question again as there are few matters which so directly affect the welfare and security of so many people. During the last few weeks, we have witnessed the unedifying spectacle of the conservative Minister for Housing in this Government (Mr McVeigh) and the conservative Minister for Housing in the Victorian Government trading vitriolic abuse. Both have been frantically trying to duck-shove responsibility for the tragic decline in public housing in Victoria. Mr Kennett described the Budget allocation to public housing as 'an absolute disgrace' and accused the Federal Minister of deliberately misleading the public. The Federal Minister, for his part, accused Mr Kennett of 'arrogance and ignorance' and questioned his common sense, his compassion and his sincerity. The odd thing is that, despite their positions being poles apart, both of them are right. This Government has applied a continual squeeze on finance for public housing. This Government has callously abandoned thousands of families who find great difficulty in paying the inflated prices charged for private accommodation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Taking into account repayments of capital and interest, the States received a total figure of only $17.7m in this Budget-a decline of $45m from 1980-81. The further back one goes, the more dramatic the decline becomes. In the last full year of the Labor Government, 1974-75, the States received almost eight times the amount, in real terms, that they will receive in the current financial year. Home ownership in Victoria has begun to decline rapidly. Mr Kennett is corrrect when he states that the Federal Government seems to have abandoned the Liberal Party's stated philosophy of support for home ownership. In reality, of course, all that this Government is doing is implementing the Liberal Party's unstated philosophy of 'grab what you can and the devil take the hindmost'. </PARA>
<PARA> Now let me turn to Mr Kennett, a most unlikely fellow to be posing as the sword-bearer for the under-privileged in our community. Victorian members will know Mr Kennett better as an immature politician with a right-wing philosophy so extreme that it was a severe embarassment to his Liberal Party colleagues. His appointment to the Ministry came as something of a surprise. I think one could have got a shorter price about the Ayatollah Khomeini becoming Pope. His career as a Minister has, to date, been concerned mainly with attempts at self promotion. In that respect, the Federal Minister's description of him as 'a political pup baying at the moon' is fairly near the mark. Certainly, Mr Kennett and his Liberal colleagues in Victoria have little to be proud of in their housing record. Given all the rhetoric we have heard from Mr Kennett, the Minister for Housing in the conservative Government in Victoria, it comes as quite a shock to find that his Government failed to spend $16m of money allocated to it for welfare housing in 1980-81. One wonders what Mr Kennett is on about, if not just playing politics, when at the same time as underspending Victoria's allocation for welfare housing, he attacks his colleagues in his own party in Canberra for cutting this year's money. </PARA>
<PARA> As one who is always seeking low cost housing for constituents and who is continually being told by the Victorian Housing Commission that no emergency housing is available, I believe that Mr Kennett stands condemned for failing to spend Victoria's full allocation. These are fine words from Mr Kennett, but no action. He and his Government stand condemned for their failure to meet their obligations in the area of welfare housing and for failing to recognise that a home is vital to a family's security. One wonders what this Government has against the family. In the words of Mrs Rhonda Galbally of the Victorian Council of Social Service, there has been a real increase of only 1.5 per cent in spending on housing in the Victorian Budget at a time when families in Victoria are breaking up because of the pressure from cutbacks in health, housing and education, not to mention the State gas and electricity increases. It is also a savage indictment of both conservative governments that the Victorian Government has had to set up a $1m pool to bail out families in danger of losing their homes through the savage interest rate increases. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent study conducted by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's division of building research found that only about half of Australia's families can now afford to buy a house. It now takes, on average, four years' pay for the average family to buy a home. The study said that the equivalent time before World War I, was about 18 months. No progress has been made in the last 50-odd years. Many people in the housing industry are now thoroughly alarmed by the decline in the industry. The Real Estate Institute of Australia said in a statement dated 25 August that the home ownership rate is falling and will continue to fall because too little finance is available for housing. The Institute went on to predict that the recent Federal Budget would have the short term effect of making home ownership even more difficult. Mr Kirkby-Jones, the National Executive Director of the Housing Industry Association, was a good deal more blunt in his Press statement of 19 August 1981. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget contains no relief for potential first time home buyers or for families experiencing financial hardship with greatly increased mortgage repayment burdens. The absence of even a token interest subsidy scheme shows the Government's insensitivity for thousands of Australian families who have been forced out of the market place by the current record level of interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on in his statement Mr Kirkby-Jones said that the Government will not heed industry advice and will not act to restore home ownership opportunities. He added:</PARA>
<PARA> The demand for new housing is strengthening as a result of considerable growth in nett immigration to around 120,000 and increasing family formation. In such a wealthy country, access to decent, safe and affordable housing should be the right of all citizens. The failure on the part of Governments to respond to the Housing aspirations of ordinary Australians will no doubt invite a serious political backlash. </PARA>
<PARA>Concern was also expressed by the Federation of Terminating Housing Societies of Victoria. The Federation's Executive Director, Mr Cameron Algie, was reported in the Melbourne Sun of 17 August as forecasting a social emergency due to the latest interest rate increases. Mr Algie said that hundreds of home buyers would face eviction because they could not afford to pay the new interest rates. That is already happening in Victoria and in other States. He predicted the creation of a new class of poor, and pointed out that even a modest home loan of $25,000 would need an income of at least $260 a week to service it. The Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies has also expressed alarm at current trends. The Association's Executive Director, Mr Larkey, was reported in the Australian of 16 July as saying that home finance would tighten even more unless the pressure for funds was eased. Mr Larkey went so far as to question the seriousness of this Government's commitment to home ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> The list of people involved in the industry who are deeply worried about the Government's priorities seems endless. Many builders in my electorate have also contacted me, including my son. They are worried about both the short and the long term prospects facing them. Once upon a time it was said that full employment and home ownership were the two most basic credos of any Australian Government. It was thought inconceivable that any government would dream of abandoning either. Under this Government history is well and truly being made. The full employment ideal has been thrown out the window and it seems clear that home ownership is now to follow it. Both have fallen victim to ideological obsessions. Both have fallen victim to an alien philosophy which ruthlessly sweeps aside even the most basic aspirations of the Australian family. It will be to the everlasting discredit of both Ministers if they allow their squabbbling and name calling to prevent them from carrying out their duty to work together in the interests of the community. If their responsibilities of office provide insufficient motivation, they would both do well to ponder the words of Mr Kirkby-Jones: 'The failure on the part of governments to respond to the housing aspirations of ordinary Australians will no doubt invite a serious political backlash'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes left to me I make the comment that the Government is now adjusting supplementary rental assistance in a way which discriminates against poorer pensioners and benefits pensioners paying higher rents to private landlords. In a complicated formula, it will refuse help in meeting rent costs to needy pensioners who are renting from State housing authorities. Under the new means test a pensioner paying $26 a week in the private sector will get $8 a week supplementary assistance, while a pensioner paying $26 a week for a housing commission home will get nothing. Previously both would have been paid $5 a week towards the rent. There is no connection, as the Government seems to imply, between capital grants used in building public housing and the present ability of a pensioner to pay rent. It is an unfair practice to give supplementary assistance to one set of housing authority tenants while denying it to others in the same block of units paying the same amount of rent. Supplementary assistance has been available to only 400,000 of the poorest pensioners. If the Government had indexed this payment, which has not been increased since 1974, it would now be worth $10 a week. Instead, the Department of Social Security has taken the cheap way out; it is confining its payments to tenants in private housing. The landlords will raise the rent, and they are the ones who will make higher profits out of the extra money that is being put into supplementary rental. The money being provided by the Government will not build any more housing, it will not help any public housing tenants--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fortunately major Australian companies and particularly the insurance industry have been in the forefront of Australia's capital accumulation and investment in recent years. This has been mainly through selling superannuation and life insurance policies. Unfortunately, it is by no means clear that those who make those investments-some 42 per cent of the work force-do so with the clear intention of owning a share in their nation's development. This is, therefore, the essence of the problem which has been faced by my colleague Mr John Moore, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, and myself. Our solution to this difficulty rests upon the need to develop a concept known as Trust Australia. This concept is basically a new financial philosophy. We believe that the individual must have the right to sell capital-as well as labour-in the capital markets of the nation at the going market price. Unfortunately we regret that at present access to the market for all Australians remains limited and is by no means equal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of reasons why this is the case. Firstly, there is a fundamental lack of knowledge and information on how the financial markets work. Secondly, there is a lack of shop front facilities, especially in large communities such as Liverpool in the metropolitan area of Sydney; an area, incidentally, which has a population of over a million people and the largest family consumer income in the Commonwealth. Yet these people have little access to the stock market at present. Thirdly, the cost structure related to equity investments adds considerably to the difficulties of the individual. I hope that the Industries Assistance Commission investigation of the stock market will identify and provide some solutions to these problems, not least of which is the difficulty of high commission rates, high stamp duty and high registration and transfer costs, especially on script. If Trust Australia is to be developed it must be accepted by the Australian people that the Government has a role to help create the conditions, climate and opportunities for all our citizens if they wish to play a more direct role in financing Australia's development. However, no Government can act alone. We need the support of the entire finance industry, especially the stock exchanges and finance institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Four specific groups in the community can be identified as representing potential investors. The first group is those who are already involved, the 4 per cent I spoke of before. There is a case for encouraging them to make larger investments in Australia's development. The stock market has suggested that to encourage them the simple solution is to lift double taxation on dividends. On the surface that has a very real attraction. However, one must ask whether the cost to revenue would equate with the advantages to be gained or would we tend to merely assist the large investor at the expense of those who had no equity. The second alternative is the establishment of a national trust to be called Trust Australia or to permit a range of trusts, all financed by the private sector-I emphasise that they should not be controlled or established by the Government-to work within the legislative umbrella of Trust Australia. An Act of the Parliament would establish the guidelines under which organisations could act to attract capital investment and receive a form of taxation deductability for the individual investor. Trusts, operated by the private sector within this context, would have the capacity to draw on the saving power of the vast majority of the Australian people, most of whom at present have no access to the finance market to the extent that we consider necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The French experience in this area is particularly worthy of consideration. In 1976 the Assembly passed legislation called the Monory Act. In the first four years of its activity about 850,000 additional Frenchmen participated in national capital formation, half of whom were new investors. Of these, some 750,000 chose to invest through specialised mutual funds. The capital raised by French companies rose from 1.5 billion francs, or $2.7 billion, in 1977 to 4.56 billion francs, or $A8.7 billion, in 1978. That was a growth of over 300 per cent in such a short period. This demonstrates so clearly that provided we are prepared to give people the encouragement they will come forward and make investments in Australia's future. </PARA>
<PARA> The third consideration is the mobilisation of funds from specialised groups. This relates to the difficulties of pensioners. At present means test anomalies and the attitudes of pensioners towards fringe benefit entitlements remain a major disincentive to major investment from that section of the community. Many pensioners have significant capital at their disposal which is not being utilised in the national interest. There are literally boxes under the beds and non-interest bearing deposits. They have been the subject of comment in this House in recent weeks. Surely pensioners, as well as the citizens of all other age groups, have a right to feel that regardless of age or infirmity they too can make a tangible individual contribution to the development of their nation? To achieve this, therefore, serious consideration must be given, within the Trust Australia framework, to enabling them to make investments which will be tax deductible up to $1,500 and the income not necessarily count against access to fringe benefits as they do at present. Another possibility that needs to be considered is whether there is a case for selling to pensioners, if they do not qualify, the right of access to fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth matter that needs to be examined is worker participation. There is undoubtedly an important link between the success and profitability of companies and employees' own livelihoods and prosperity. There are potential gains in employee morale, reduced labour turnover, higher job satisfaction and, possibly, better industrial relations from the development of programs for worker participation based on the provision of shareholdings for individuals within companies. This can be achieved either by large companies offering shares to their employees, or by enabling small businesses, which are the major employers of the Australian population, to encourage their employees to enter into equity investments such as Trust Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Those companies which have in recent years entered into worker participation programs have demonstrated quite conclusively that their profitability, progress, level of industrial relations and so forth have significantly improved as a result. This is an area which deserves the most careful consideration by government. It is worth while noting that a recent survey of major companies shows that 19.4 per cent have some arrangements for employee share participation while another 24.8 per cent are actively considering this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The questions I have raised this morning I believe are of fundamental importance to the development of a young and a vital nation in which every Australian must have the opportunity to share, in a direct way, the risks as well as the benefits of nation building. It is not satisfactory that some 75 per cent of all equity capital in 50 of Australia's leading companies should be provided by a handful of institutions. The existing restraints on market freedoms must be removed to ensure that the individual has the right to invest in Australian equities and be a true shareholder in the prosperity of this nation. It is time for Australians to be prepared and encouraged to invest in their country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance this morning concerns an unfortunate saga which began some 12 years ago when a man of my intimate acquaintance, Sergeant Christopher Jones, who is the secretary-manager of the Parramatta Police Citizens Boys Club was involved in a traffic accident, while driving a police car, with a man whom I do not intend to dignify by naming. That man has carried out a continual vendetta against Sergeant Jones since that date 12 years ago alleging police suppression. The charges, in fact, have been investigated by two coronial inquiries instigated by the New South Wales Government. In both cases, Sergeant Jones was cleared of all charges. In the last case the man making the charges was branded as a very unreliable witness whose obsession with police suppression led to his evidence being of no use whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While that is bad enough in itself-that a man of high repute could be subjected to this sort of charge-my real grievance concerns an irresponsible use of parliamentary privilege in the New South Wales Parliament. I am pleased to see that the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) is at the table because he and I have discussed this matter of parliamentary privilege before. I am sure that we share equal views about the right of all parliamentarians to use parliamentary privilege. It is a privilege, but it is one which should be used with an enormous amount of responsibility, with sensitivity and discretion. I am pleased to say that since I came to this Parliament four years ago, to my knowledge, I do not think anybody has used parliamentary privilege in any way other than that. I cannot ever remember in my experience here any sort of unmitigated attack being made on a person outside this House. </PARA>
<PARA> On 5 March 1981, which, to my mind, was a day of infamy in the New South Wales Upper House, a Dr Derek Freeman, a member of the New South Wales Parliament, did his number upon Sergeant Christopher Jones. I would describe what he did as probably the worst attack that I have ever heard made on any person. It was a vicious, unmitigated assault upon a man of the highest integrity and of the most excellent human qualities. It was not a matter of exaggeration or distortion of facts; it was a vicious assault, a farrago of unmitigated, unsubstantiated and unwarranted lies. He accused Sergeant Jones, among other things, of embezzling $200,000 from the Parramatta Police Citizens Boys Club, of residing in a house that was the prize of an art union conducted by the Parramatta Police Citizens Boys Club and many other associated matters.</PARA>
<PARA> The damage to the character and the reputation of Sergeant Jones, his wife and young family is incalculable. The second aspect of those charges made by Dr Freeman in the Upper House on that day was the way in which they were picked by the unprincipled Press of Sydney. I have here, sir-and I hold it up for you to observe-the headline on the front page of the Daily Mirror which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Policeman named $200,000 missing-MP</PARA>
<PARA>The Sunday Telegraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> Angry cop denies police boys' swindle. </PARA>
<PARA>That was on page 5. It is a very prominent article. Page 2 of the Sun Herald of 8 March 1981 states:</PARA>
<PARA> 12-year feud-chance of a probe</PARA>
<PARA>Those blazing headlines destroy the character of a very decent man who, in his 12 years in Parramatta, has become a legend almost in his own lunch time. He is a man who devoted his life to the good of hundreds of people who go to the Police Boys' Club for all sorts of training including character training and physical training and all the associated benefits that come from the police boys' movement. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of other things that they do at that Police Boys' Club are worth a mention. In the last 12 months Sergeant Jones, through a couple of his associates on the board of the Police Boys' Club, of which I am a director, I might add, have managed to place 300 young people in employment. These were kids who could not get jobs. Sergeant Jones has done a great amount of work in that area in terms of breaking down barriers between delinquent children and their parents, getting kids to go to school by giving them a new sense of responsibiltity and involving himself in the drug problem which occurs in most suburbs of the size of Parramatta. In fact to my knowledge he physically removed a couple of drug dealers from the area. The amount of good that that man has done for the young people of Parramatta is just inestimable. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Press to pick up these unwarranted charges and highlight them, as it did with sensational headlines, to me was like jackals baying at the moon, taking up this chorus of vilification that was orchestrated by Dr Freeman in the upper House. A couple of weeks later, after all these charges were investigated by the internal affairs department of the New South Wales Police Department, after Sergeant Jones was the subject of investigation by the Taxation Office and after Mr Wran instituted his own inquiry into all these charges, a complete and utter denial of every charge was made by Mr Wran in the Parliament of New South Wales. Every one of them was found to be unwarranted and unfair. The day Mr Wran made those denials in the Parliament, the gentleman who instituted them-not Dr Freeman but the man involved in the accident 12 years earlier-was ejected from the New South Wales Parliament for his unruly behaviour in the gallery. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst part of the whole deal was this: Although the Press made these sensational charges with headlines, smearings and innuendoes all over the front pages of its papers, when the charges were found to be absolutely groundless, the denials were a long time coming. The only denial I saw was on about page 20 of the Sydney Morning Herald where it sought to give a meagre denial of about three or four lines. That was the only item that countered the sensational headlines produced some months before. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this matter on Sergeant Jones's life has been profound. He was a man of outstanding record in the New South Wales Police. He had been decorated for valour and also for good conduct. He was well on the way to becoming a man of higher station than the sergeant who was the secretary/superintendent of the Parramatta Police Citizens Boys' Club. The effect on his health of this continuing vendetta conducted against him has been so profound that he has been invalided out of the New South Wales Police Force on medical grounds. The damage to his family is also profound. His children have had to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, if I may use that term, with all the sorts of cruelties that children can heap on their school friends, perhaps not with any evil intent but just in the manner of school children. </PARA>
<PARA> Sergeant Jones now finds himself outside the police force because of these charges which have been made against him in an irresponsible and vicious way. But the big loser is the Police Boys Club in Parramatta and the young people who belong to that organisation because they have lost not only a man who organised their club for them and made it a great success-one of the most successful of such clubs in New South Wales-but also a great friend and a man to whom they turned for counsel, advice and leadership. I think that that is the great measure of the crime that has been committed, not only by the gentleman who has been conducting this vendetta for 12 years, but also by this man in the Upper House of New South Wales who sought to sully the unfettered right that all parliamentarians have to come into parliament and make charges, grounded on fact, against people who do not have the opportunity to answer. I hope that somewhere along the line some parliament in Australia will have a look at the libel laws, the defamation laws, and arrive at some method of penalising or disciplining members of parliament who do not respect the great privilege that they are given in terms of parliamentary privilege and who use it, as this man did, to launch a vicious attack upon a very decent human being. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a sad day for Parramatta that we have lost the services of Sergeant Jones. I believe that he is shifting to another State to start a new life. I wish both he and his family luck in that new life. In closing, I reiterate my firm criticism of Dr Derek Freeman. I hope that his own conscience will prick him to get up in the New South Wales Parliament and make some sort of retraction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In coming weeks, the Government is to announce the much awaited review of Australia's international aviation policy. Already there have been discussions with the States as to what form the new review will take and who will undertake that review. The decisions that will be made by means of this review are certainly vital to the Australian travelling public and, indeed, to the future inflow of visitors to this country. My purpose in rising today is to ask the Government to open this inquiry so that it can be as wide and as far-reaching as possible and to plead that the inquiry not be enclosed within the Department of Transport but will, for the first time, give priority to the industry, tourist concerns and other interested bodies so that they have a real chance to take advantage of it to make sure that Australia is not disadvantaged by an inverted closed shop operation. I am afraid that we have already seen evidence of what can happen by virtue of the International Civil Aviation Policy which was wreaked on Australia a few years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has been prepared to look at the question of deregulation for our domestic operations. I believe that this should be pressed until we can get some sanity prevailing on the international front as well as the domestic front in the coming years. The same attitude must surely be very clearly examined in light of our future international policy, even at a time when it is claimed that international traffic is on the decline. All State Governments have given an indication that they are not happy with the present policies regarding our international traffic, even though there has been a little loosening of the regulations on fare policies in recent months. The travel industry has indicated that it is not happy either and now we really do have a chance to rectify this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there has been a decline on some routes in international aviation traffic and some of the big names of international aviation are in serious loss situations, I do not believe that this is a reason to close up the shop to competition for Australia. Rather, we should go out and fight harder in that international market place. It is interesting to note that while some of the traditional international airlines, such as Pan American and British Airways, are reporting record losses, the airlines which are prepared to take the situation head on overseas are doing exceptionally well. The protectionist pundits-we have them in Australia, including in the Department of Transport-would have us believe that deregulation in the United States of America has wreaked havoc in the industry there. There have been massive changes in the nature of the operations in the United States. It is true that some traditional airlines have been forced out of routes they should never have been on in the first place. New airlines have emerged, route structures have changed, airlines have amalgamated, and the only ones, apart from the profitable airlines, to have benefited are the fare paying passengers and the allied tourist industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give honourable members an example of that. Los Angeles to New York for $176 with no restrictions is a most reasonable fare. It is a similar flight to the Sydney to Perth sector. On the international front, the United States to Europe fares vary between $400 and $800 return-a seven-hour trip each way or 11 to 12 hours from Los Angeles and San Francisco to Europe. Since these markets have opened up, there have been most substantial increases in traffic-29 per cent per year, for example, on the New York to London route; 60 per cent on the London to Los Angeles route. This, is new traffic; traffic that was generated by the free market forces; traffic that would not have travelled previously without these incentives, even though fares there previously were much more reasonable than many of those operating into and out of Australia at the moment. The efficient airlines operating these services are indeed profitable. We hear about the tremendous opposition our own carrier faces in operating into and out of Australia. Twenty-six airlines, it is said, compete every day. But on the North Atlantic run from New York to Europe there are no fewer than 42 carriers operating into London alone. The figures I am quoting here are not mine but those of the United States Department of Transportation and the British Civil Aviation Authority, along with International Air Transport Association traffic reports. </PARA>
<PARA> It could be said, of course, that London, New York and Los Angeles traffic could not be compared with traffic into and out of Australia, and there may be some arguement there. Perhaps we should examine a more comparable market, one more in line with Australian conditions-for example, the United Kingdom to Miami, Florida market. In 1979, 272,508 passengers travelled from the United Kingdom to Miami. In 1980, the market was opened up to competition and in the first full year of operation 594,393 passengers were carried by five airlines rather than two, an increase of 118.1 per cent in that 12-month period. That again was new traffic with all airlines being profitable and the Miami tourist industry booming like it never had before. In 1979, the total British traffic to Australia was 288,278-an increase on the previous year of about 90,000 passengers, but certainly not nearly the spectacular growth on some of those other routes opened up by the free market forces. Two airlines in Britain have already approached the authorities there for rights to Australia with fares of about $900 return. It is interesting to note that the price being quoted by, say, British Airways for operations in the free market on the London to Miami route is about 3c per mile per passenger, but on the restrictive form of airfares operating from London to Australia at the moment the cost per passenger mile is 6c-twice as much. But there again, British Airways, which has just announced a massive $240m loss for the past year, admits that the kangaroo route is the backbone of its operations and that without it British Airways would collapse. The question we should ask is: Are Australian passengers and visitors to this country in fact subsidising this inefficient, bureaucratic British aviation monster? Unfortunately, the rip off would appear to go on. On the other hand, predictions on the growth of United Kingdom to Australia traffic should the free market forces be allowed to operate indicate most conservatively indeed that an increase of 30 per cent per year would be expected compared with the growth of 3 per cent in 1979-80 and 10 per cent in 1980-81 and the expected growth of 10 per cent this year. That sort of market stimulation would increase traffic to Australia from the United Kingdom by 160,000 passengers on the kangaroo route alone. The catch cry of 'Open Our Skies-Tourists Create Jobs' is well known in Australia. While not advocating full open skies, it is obvious, I would think to the meanest intelligence, that a loosening of the system could do marvels to the economy and to the employment situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In answer to a question on notice No. 2824 printed in Hansard of Tuesday of this week, we had an indication of the type of thinking which pervades those who control our international civil aviation. I asked in that question whether Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd had applied for rights from Hong Kong to Brisbane and, if so, why that application was rejected earlier this year. The answer was that such an application had been made but that the present level of traffic was not considered sufficient to justify such a service. The only question I would like to ask is: Who said so? The other gem from the Department of Transport is the vexed question of Japan to Australia fares. This has taken years to resolve and now an advance purchase fare is in place. The usual restrictions apply-a minimum stay of 21 days is required. But of course the Japanese get only two weeks holiday a year and usually take a seven to 10 day package tour. Can the Japanese tourist boom really exist for Australia under these conditions?</PARA>
<PARA> There are anomalies in Australian international aviation policies. Splits are appearing in some of the more ridiculous structures. Admittedly, there have been some improvements, but we are still a long way from topping up our true potential. There must be a freer regime than presently exists. There must be proration of fares to allow a greater flexibility for our international passengers to travel around Australia. There is a very great argument to allow the domestic airlines to operate regional routes. There can also be the possibility of a common market between Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands so that we can all benefit from tourism. What a wonderful boost for the Pacific island nations that would be in aid terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The international market is tougher than it has been for years but we cannot afford to let go the gains that we have made during the past few years because of our protectionist policy. We have the infrastructure ready to be used. This year we have a world market of 400 million international travellers to draw from. People want to come to Australia. They should not be burdened by distance or high air fares. As we always repeat in this House: For every extra 25,000 international visitors coming into Australia another 1,400 jobs are created. If we could have just half of one per cent of that international travel coming into Australia our employment problems would be virtually solved. </PARA>

<PARA> First of all, like every other response of the Fraser Government to unemployment, CYSS is a band-aid rather than a cure. In a society as deeply injured by unemployment as this society, particularly by youth unemployment, even band-aids are better than nothing. It is true that CYSS does not provide work. It does not create jobs, unlike some similar community-based schemes that I have seen overseas, particularly in Canada. The guidelines of CYSS have been unnecessarily restrictive and we have complained of this before. They prevent job creating activities. They prevent the production of goods for sale as is done under one of the Canadian schemes of this type. The guidelines are also restrictive on job search and placement. But none of these weaknesses in the scheme are justifications for ending it. All of them are simply arguments for improving the Community Youth Support Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, CYSS has distinct advantages. First of all, it is the only one of the Government's schemes to emphasise the supportive role for the young unemployed, a role in order to sustain morale and confidence and to give young people out of work a sense of personal worth against the undermining effects of unemployment. Indeed, all the evidence suggests that CYSS gets at the most vulnerable and the most disadvantaged, groups amongst the young unemployed. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) quoted one young person who said to him: 'Where do you go when you have nowhere to go?' One of the places to which they can go are the Community Youth Support Scheme projects scattered around this country. One great advantage of CYSS, unlike any of the other schemes, is this whole support role for community youth support schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The second, and I think equally great advantage of CYSS, is that it is the only one of the Government's schemes to involve the community generally and directly in the experience of youth unemployment. This community involvement is very valuable for the young but it is as valuable for the community members involved. Unfortunately, the nature and distribution of youth unemployment in this society enables many of the well-off and affluent to avoid the problem altogether, to avoid in fact the greatest social evil at present in this society. The Community Youth Support Scheme tends to break down this distinction by bringing many community members who previously had no serious experience of unemployment to a realisation, through their support work in CYSS, of the nature of the problem that this society is facing. I believe CYSS clearly benefits not only the young unemployed but also, the community in helping to bring home very clearly to many members of that community the problems of youth unemployment in this society. </PARA>
<PARA> We can list very obviously and very clearly the achievements of the Community Youth Support Scheme. Something like 130,000 young people have been assisted in the five years in which the scheme has been operating. At the present time some 274 projects are operating around Australia, which are doomed on 31 October. Today in South Australia, my State, there are 26 CYSS projects-18 in the metropolitan areas and eight country projects-with something like 5,000 participants. In my electorate, which is one of the most severely hit by youth unemployment, we have some five projects-all are invaluable in shoring up youth morale. It is true that I share one of those five projects with the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson). I hope that he is actively working to see whether we can maintain the schemes in that area. These five schemes are all invaluable in shoring up youthful morale and compelling the community to face up to the problem of youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> These schemes have been evaluated. Evaluations have pointed out the particular role that CYSS contributes to the problem we face. An evaluation was conducted by the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs in August 1977. It found, firstly, that CYSS had provided considerable gains for participants in terms of personal and social development, confidence, morale and motivation. In many cases CYSS played the role of getting these people ready to go into the training schemes that were then provided. Many of the young people who came into CYSS are disenchanted by the whole school process and by the training process, and CYSS acts in many ways as a stepping place into the sorts of job training schemes that have been advocated. If CYSS were not there we would not get many of these young people into further job training opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, a majority of CYSS participants came from underprivileged areas and many had severe social problems. We must recognise that unemployment is not just a problem of getting jobs; it is all the social and psychological problems that flow from the lack of a job, particularly for people in underprivileged areas without very many back-up resources. It was discovered in this evaluation that most of the participants in CYSS had been unemployed for longer periods than the average unemployed young person registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. A more recent survey in 1980 through the University of Melbourne and the Swinburne Institute of Technology showed that participation in CYSS had reduced the incidence of anti-social activity, especially crime, amongst the unemployed youth involved and that CYSS participation had improved the self-reliance, confidence and self-esteem of those involved due largely to the supportive social framework provided at the projects. There is evaluative evidence of the contribution these projects have made to these groups. Yet all of this is to be ended when youth unemployment is as high as ever. </PARA>
<PARA> At least 120,000 young people at the moment are unemployed in this country. Something like 15 per cent of all teenagers outside educational institutions are unemployed. In my electorate the figure is 30 per cent for those outside educational institutions in the 15 years to 19 years age category. The average duration of teenage unemployment, that is, the long term unemployed which these schemes have been particularly getting at, has been growing. The average teenage unemployment duration is now 25 weeks in this country. For the somewhat older participants in CYSS, that is, the 20 to 24 year old group, the average duration of unemployment is now 35 weeks. There is no real promise that in the next year those figures can be seriously eroded. </PARA>
<PARA> It is argued by the Government that it will direct CYSS resources and money to better schemes providing training for jobs. I am afraid that that is mostly cosmetic poppycock. There is not much point in starting with training people for jobs which are unavailable. In fact, we can build up whole problems of resentment. In South Australia, if all the job training programs in the Budget got under way, they would provide only 1,000 places whereas at the moment 5,000 people are involved in the CYSS projects. Again, CYSS gives invaluable support from the first day of unemployment. From the very moment a young person is unemployed he can go and make full use of CYSS facilities. Yet nearly all the other training schemes usually require a waiting period, sometimes up to several months, before people can move into them. Of course, none of the training schemes talked about provide the supportive role that CYSS provides. It may be that some support is provided, but that is secondary to the whole job training process, whereas the role of CYSS is to put the supportive process at the very forefront of activity. As I said, I am glad that there is a widespread coalition which is quite bipartisan moving against this decision. We all should realise that we are creating in this society a generation of the unemployed and unemployable. Unless we bring all the resources of this society to bear on this problem to relieve its human and social repercussions, that generation will in future wreak great havoc on this society as it moves through it. CYSS is one of the ways in which we can cope with that massive social problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say at the outset that I agree with many of the points made by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) in his comments on the Community Youth Support Scheme. I think there will be some kind of vacuum when CYSS ceases to operate, and I hope that somehow the Government can find a way of filling that vacuum. It is a very important issue for the young people directly involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today I want to comment on a subject that I think is very important, especially for the functioning of this House and of the Senate. It concerns the fundamental difference between the executive arm of government and the role to be played by ordinary private members of this House and of the Senate and the dangers that I see in any further extension of the power and the influence of the executive arm of government over the role of ordinary members of this House and of the Senate. Parliaments were created to ensure that the interests of the members of the general community and their views are taken into account when governments determine their policies and the actions that they take as governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Absolutely essential to our role is the real independence of the private member. If he is controlled by the executive arm, if he is not free to criticise, he cannot fulfil his duty and his responsibility to the people who elect him. Members must always be free to criticise and to question, when necessary, the government of the day and its actions, no matter whether they be members on this side, the government side, or on the Opposition side. Of course, we on the government side live in the hope that it will not be necessary at any stage to criticise the actions of government, but inevitably there will be occasions when a member must be prepared to speak out in a forthright manner on behalf of the constituents he represents and to criticise policies or actions, because governments are only human and they make mistakes. If that occurs, there must be disagreement and there must be criticism. Therefore, members must always be vigilant and watchful to protect that right to an independent view and to independent action. </PARA>
<PARA> I see real danger in reports that are now circulating that the Government is considering increasing the number of parliamentary secretaries to Ministers. Under the Parliamentary Secretaries Act, No. 160 of 1980, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has been given, I think wrongly, extraodinarily wide powers to appoint any member of this House or of the Senate as a parliamentary secretary to a Minister. I refer briefly to the relevant part of the legislation. Section 3(1) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister may appoint a person who is a member of either House of the Parliament to be a Parliamentary Secretary to a Minister of State. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 3(2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The appointment of a person as a Parliamentary Secretary to a Minister of State may be revoked at any time by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Then the Act goes on to establish the fact that secretaries are not to be remunerated for their functions. Of course, that is required under the Constitution. But those powers of appointment of parliamentary secretaries by a particular member of this Parliament, the particular member being the Prime Minister, I think is wrong in the sense that they are far too wide. The act says that the Prime Minister makes the appointment, not the Governor-General as is the case with Ministers. It is not an appointment by the Minister concerned; it is an appointment by the Prime Minister. I believe the situation in the United Kingdom is that the Minister directly affected-that is, the person for whom the secretary will act-has the right to appoint an individual. Here the Prime Minister has the sole right to hire and fire; that is, to appoint or to revoke the appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> The second criticism I offer is that there is no limit to the number of members of this House or of the Senate who, in theory at least, can be appointed under that legislation as secretaries to Ministers. I think that is a fundamental flaw in legislation and perhaps it is evidence of our sloppy legislative system that we can allow that kind of provision to go through this House and the other place. Under the United Kingdom Ministers of the Crown Act a maximum number of holders of all ministerial positions is set. That includes a range of people-Ministers, secretaries of state and parliamentary secretaries. But in Australia there is no such limit. In addition, the rights and duties of parliamentary secretaries have not been prescribed, at least not under the legislation or under subordinate legislation of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> So, we must ask the question: What are the rights, the obligations and the duties of people who have been appointed or who may in the future be appointed as parliamentary secretaries? Can they criticise government policy? Are they free to raise in this place and in the party room important issues which affect their electorates? If the duties, responsibilities and obligations of parliamentary secretaries who have already been appointed or who may be appointed are set out in some written form, are prescribed in some administrative way by the Prime Minister, by Ministers or by the government, I believe this House is entitled to know just what those functions, responsibilities and duties are to ensure that there is no real conflict between the role of the parliamentary secretary and his responsibilities as an ordinary private member. I believe the legislation is deficient in that it should have set out just what the duties of these parliamentary secretaries are. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this issue just to underline to honourable members the dangers of this system, especially the extraordinarily wide powers vested in the Prime Minister of the day-I emphasise 'of the day'-whoever he may be. Of course, I am not directing my remarks to the role of the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and how he might use that legislation. At present, a limited number of people have been appointed as parliamentary secretaries. The whole subject of the extension of executive influence, control and power over ordinary back bench, private members of the Parliament, whether they be in this House or in the Senate, is an issue that I believe goes to the very reason for our sitting here representing the communities and the electorates that we represent. As private members we must always be free and independent to question and criticise. If we are not free to do that we canot carry out our functions as ordinary members of the Parliament. So, there is this very clear division between the government-that is, the Executive, the Ministers who are appointed by the Prime Minister or by the party system-and the ordinary member of the Parliament. I think these appointments have clouded that clear distinction between the role of a person who happens to be a member of this place and is appointed a member of the Executive and the role of a person who has not been so appointed but who sits here as a private member to carry out his function of representing the people in his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise, of course, that the pressure placed upon the Government and upon Ministers is great. We are living in a very complex world. It is a much more difficult job to be a Minister of the Crown these days, I am sure, than it was, say, at the time of Federation. There are all kinds of pressures placed upon Ministers, upon the Prime Minister, particularly, and upon leaders of parties. That has manifested itself in illnesses in recent times of these people who carry out very important functions in this country. They carry very heavy burdens as a result of the positions that they hold and the duties that they carry out. The important question is how we can reduce those burdens and the weight that these people carry. At the same time, there are also fundamental and important principles-very high principles-which should not be overlooked. I therefore raise this issue and I trust that members of this Parliament will distinguish the role of private members as distinct from that of the Executive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to deal with the subject of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission's report which was presented to Parliament yesterday. Education, today, is a subject which is much in the spotlight and a subject that needs careful consideration. We know from the Government's budgeting efforts that universities and colleges of advanced education around Australia are getting $54m less than the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission said was necessary to maintain the current levels of quality and activities that were needed in education. We know that directions have been given for amalgamations to take place. This is having a drastic effect around the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One section in the report is of particular concern to me as I represent the electorate of McMillan in which is situated the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education. The news for that college in this report is not good. This is something that I wish to highlight to the Government and to the Parliament. I will read from the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The situation in Victoria is an evolving one, and is complicated by uncertainties as to the consolidation of certain colleges. Although VPSEC did not wish to vary its proposals as a consequence of discussions with the working party, it provided additional information relating to staffing issues which had not been available at the time of the Council's consideration of VPSEC's proposals. As a result, the Commission has concluded that the grants proposed for the Bendigo College of Advanced Education, SCV Rusden/Burwood/Toorak/Prahran College of Advanced Education, and the successor to the SCV Melbourne, could prove insufficient to cover the costs of transition to a lower level of activity. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is insufficient money available for the retrenchment proceedings that this Government has initiated. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances, the Commission believes that it would not be prudent at this stage to recommend increases in the grants for Footscray Institute of Technology, Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education and Swinburne Institute of Technology at the levels originally proposed. </PARA>
<PARA>What procedures have been carried out needs to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to this report being presented, the Government gave its guidelines for funding and what was required. Because of that, in the short time available, the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission and the Advanced Eduction Council were required to put in a lot of work and make a lot of assessments about what the funding and the procedure would be. This required colleges to put forward proposals to VPSEC. These proposals had to be considered. Colleges had to take part in the considerations and put their planning forward for the future. No doubt, the college of advanced education in Churchill in my electorate was very much involved in this. Many, many hours of work were spent to come up with the proposals that were eventually put forward by VPSEC. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it appears, from what has happened, that much lobying has taken place since July-August when many of the recommendations were put forward. It has been discovered that the Government's actions and amalgamations will lead to some rather drastic redundancies in many colleges around Victoria. Therefore VPSEC said that it would require somewhere between $5m and $10m extra to cover the costs of these extra stipulations that had been imposed by Government policy. The Government took a rather head-in-the-sand approach to education in solving this problem. Rather than making more funds available to rectify a problem that it had created, it is now, according to this report, appearing to take the line where other colleges are to be deprived of the funds that had been granted to them, that had been agreed to and that had been worked out after many, many hours of discussion and work. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that needs to be made is that, in these proposals, all colleges of advanced education have had the opportunity to put their cases forward to VPSEC to deal with the Advanced Education Council. Everybody in education has had a democratic opportunity to put something forward. Whether they agreed with Government policy or not that is the way it has been. It now appears that the Footscray Institute of Technology, the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education, and the Swinburne Institute of Technology will be deprived of this democratic right. This report has come out without any consultation and has overruled the decisions made after long periods of planning and after programs have been put into place for education for 1982. This planning has been turned completely upside down by this Government. Why has this been done? It has been done because the Government is not prepared to make enough funds available to carry out its policies. It is willing to turn the planning upside down in respect of three colleges and take away their democratic right to negotiate for their rightful share of funds. This is happening because the Government is not prepared to put enough money forward. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at a couple of points to highlight the situation. Let us consider two colleges, one in Bendigo and the other in Gippsland. In Bendigo the allocation of funding works out at $6,020 a student as against the figure for the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education of $4,745 a student. It appears, from those figures, that Gippsland is a very efficient college and is running its business very effectively. In fact, it was able to run its college for $1,300 a student cheaper than was Bendigo. Yet, we find in the report that the funding that has been taken from a college like Gippsland is to be paid across to a college like Bendigo because of the redundancy requirements and because of the money that is required for the staff cuts that will have to be made in many parts of the State. This is a definite case of democracy gone mad. The Government seems to be prepared to put forward policies based on the fact that it says: 'There is X amount of dollars. You work out how that money will be spent'. Many, many hours, through the proper channels, are spent organising and meetings are held to decide how the money will be spent. But when pressure is put on the Government and it is decided that there is not enough money to cover the staff cuts and the amalgamation problems that the Government has created by its direction, rather than putting forward extra money, the Government decides that these colleges will suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it quite clear. The Latrobe Valley area which is part of my electorate where this Institute is situated is one of the fastest growing areas in Victoria. It is the only really fast growing area in Victoria. It is also one of the fastest growing areas of Australia. This area needs a college that is growing, not a college that is being treated in this harsh manner. Much of the funding that was to be made available for that college was to increase the engineering area of that college and to upgrade overall the college so that it could keep up with growth in the area. This policy that the Government is putting forward will set that area back. The $400,000 cut that has been imposed upon that college will mean, from information that I have been able to find this morning, that no contract teachers who are involved in that college will be re-employed in 1982. How can any college in a fast growing area possibly plan for the future with this type of approach. How can education in vital areas be considered seriously by this Government when it takes this approach. The Cabinet of this Government has often been called a cow shed Cabinet. As a representative of a rural electorate and a farmer, I would like to give a little advice to this cow shed Cabinet. I will draw an analogy between a farmer buying a tractor and the actions of the cow shed Cabinet--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that I will have only four minutes of the allotted 10 minutes in which to speak in this grievance debate. I could spend 44 minutes on what I have to say. The matters that I want to mention represent a grievance of the most profound nature. They relate to the further penalties which I have exposed over the last week or two on people who live in the areas that produce the great wealth of this nation. I have been accused of being parochial and of repeating the same old comment, but the same old comment is as valid today, if not more so, as it has been since this country was founded. I speak not of people who are Martin Place farmers. I speak of people out in the back blocks not only of Queensland but also of every other State in this nation who are sustaining the industries that pour millions of dollars into the Commonwealth Treasury to sustain this great capital city of Canberra and everything that goes with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw attention to a particular grievance relating to telephone charges. It was with a great deal of joy that, after a great many experiments and a great deal of investigation, it was found that radio telephones were a goer. We thought that all of the difficulties, particularly in the central part of Queensland, were over. Believe it or not, there was no telephone-no telecommunications at all-west of the town of Winton. At long last the viability and the technical feasibility of radio telephones was achieved; but what happened? The charges were equally as high as the cost of the installation of conventional telephone lines though maintenance through storms and so on was eliminated-the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) would know about this as he has just told us he is a farmer-and there were difficulties with static and the rest of it. A thing of the past. We thought that all our problems were over; but were they? Only this morning a chap named Don Alexander, a genuine grazier, a fellow who roughs it right out in the bush with so many of my people, gave me some information on this subject. I wish I had half an hour in which to put just this case. The licence fee for his radio telephone, which was installed by him and a group of people in the area, has increased 500 per cent-from $80 to $400. I appeal to the Government to look at this matter and take steps immediately to rectify the situation regarding this very vicious imposition on these people. With due respect to the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair), we will be meeting with his senior officers within a few days to discuss these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I want to mention-I note that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) is present-relates to the real possibility of the termination of Trans Australia Airlines services in areas of inland Queensland. The Minister has created a vigilance group. I want the House and the nation to understand that we will meet and look very closely at this whole situation. In the half-minute remaining I point out that the one matter which occupies the minds of every person who lives in the areas affected is the sustaining of the standard of aircraft and the frequency of our services. We ask the Minister and the Government to look not only at the report of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, which says that if an airline shows a loss over a period of six months it can terminate its services, but also at the other requirement of the report, which is that if such a company shows a loss it should be subsidised by the Government. I appeal to the Government to do just that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to report to the House about the shortage of air traffic controllers in Australia-the reasons for the shortage, the effect of the shortage and the actions being taken to overcome the problem. The matter has been of considerable concern to the Queensland Government, tourist interests and honourable members on both sides of this House in recent weeks. There has been justified concern about the circumstances which have led to the three-hour closure each night of Brisbane Airport since 10 September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Reasons for the Shortage of Air Traffic Controllers</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that since the early 1970's the total number of air traffic controllers in Australia has increased from just over 1,000 to the present level of 1,156. Although we have a shortage of controllers to meet rapidly increasing aviation needs, we have more air traffic controllers today than ever before. The 1,156 controllers is below the number now needed to meet all the operational requirements resulting from industry growth rates and to introduce revised procedures with the support of industry at major general aviation airports. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had an analysis made of the national statistics on air traffic controller requirements, availability, recruitment, training and wastage from 1974 to the present time. The analysis shows, firstly, that in the mid 1970s the margin of trained controllers over actual requirements was eliminated. While the numbers of air traffic controllers available have continued to rise, the requirements for air traffic control services have increased at a faster rate over recent years. Taken in conjunction with the wastage rate, the result will be a shortfall of the order of 110 controllers by the end of the year. I must point out that the requirements include 19 Australian air traffic controllers serving in Papua New Guinea in fulfilment of our obligation to that country to the end of 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Because it takes three years to train an air traffic controller-one year where a recruit has substantial aeronautical experience-the numbers required for recruitment must be anticipated more than three years in advance. The recruitment of air traffic controllers declined steadily from 1974 to 1976 when there was no intake. The trainee recruitment then rose to a peak in 1979 and has maintained a level of the order of 110 to 120 each year since. However, the major benefit from the increased recruitment since 1978 will not be felt until early in 1982 and subsequent years. My department's air traffic control training school has been operating to planned capacity since the beginning of 1979. It is expected that, from next year onwards, between 80 and 90 air traffic controllers will graduate each year. Plans to increase the training capacity further in the short to medium term are now in hand utilising a new system of progressive training which will enable six courses, each of 20 trainees, to commence in the next six months. Against the annual graduates has to be offset the wastage from retirement, resignations and long term illnesses, et cetera. Wastage has been of the order of 3.5 per cent each year to 1978. There was a significant decrease in 1979 followed by an increase to 3.8 per cent in 1980, which was the highest rate in recent times. The increase was due in part to the resignation of seven controllers to take up contract appointments overseas. The wastage for 1981 is again expected to be of the order of 3.5 per cent. However, in Queensland the wastage has been over 8 per cent for the past year. This is three times the rate of the previous years in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>The Problems Arising from the Shortage</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In view of these circumstances, my Department had no alternative but to plan for the closure of Brisbane airport for a period from 9.00 pm to midnight which balanced the available manpower with the minimum disruption to the industry. The three hour closure of Brisbane airport affects one Trans Australia Airlines flight and one Ansett Airlines of Australia flight each night which normally arrive at 9.30 pm, as well as additional Ansett and TAA flights on Friday and Sunday nights. Ansett and TAA have rescheduled these flights to arrive earlier in Brisbane and thus maintain services. No scheduled jet flights from Brisbane to north Queensland are affected. Additionally, the closure has disrupted the night freighter operations which normally fly in and out of Brisbane between 11.00 pm and 1.00 am on week nights. The north-bound leg of the weekly Qantas Airways Ltd flight to Tokyo is also affected by the three hour closure, but the Brisbane passengers are being ferried to Sydney for the flight to Tokyo. The south-bound Tokyo-Brisbane flight is not affected. At locations other than Brisbane, air traffic control services are being maintained at the level of the published hours of coverage, though the general shortage is causing significant amounts of overtime to be worked by some controllers to cover short term absences for sickness and special leave. The situation varies between locations, but Sydney particularly was seriously affected by sick leave during the month of August when over 160 shifts were worked on overtime to cover sick leave in order to maintain services. </PARA>
<PARA>Actions Being Taken to Overcome the Problem</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The following long and short term actions have been taken, or are being taken, to overcome the shortage of air traffic controllers in Australia. Action was taken by my Department to transfer controllers to Queensland. However, as the recent wastage in Queensland has involved senior terminal area controllers, it will take some months before transferees provide sufficient trained controllers to overcome the shortage. With the action now taken, there will be sufficient controllers in Queensland by the end of the year to meet requirements. When daylight saving commences in the southern States on 25 October, the effect of the closure on the domestic passenger flights will be alleviated. Coverage is planned for the scheduled and special airline flights in the period leading up to Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA> My Department has been supplementing its Australian recruiting campaign with a recruitment program in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and New Zealand. Thirty-three suitable recruits have been offered employment as a result of the overseas recruitment efforts. We are investigating the possibility of recruiting air traffic controllers in Canada and the United States. Sufficient trainees are already available for the three courses scheduled to commence before the end of the year. There will be 20 trainees per course. In order to enable as many as possible of the industry requirements for additional services to be met with the available controllers, my Department and the Public Service Board have been negotiating with the air traffic controllers industrial association, the Civil Air Operations Officers Association of Australia-CAOOAA-for variations to the industrial agreement related to rostering principles. The variations would be of particular value at Brisbane in that the extent of the closure could be reduced and coverage provided for all scheduled passenger services. Regrettably, CAOOAA rejected the financially attractive proposals offered by the Public Service Board which were combined with proposals by my Department for a system of familiarisation flights by air traffic controllers. This has been an objective that the Association has sought for many years. Despite this set-back, my Department again requested CAOOAA, as a goodwill measure, to agree to varying the rostering principles to alleviate the effect of the current shortage in Brisbane, by maximising the coverage provided by the available controllers. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the Association's central council meeting last week, my Department has received advice that the Association will agree to the requested variations for a one to two year period in return for agreement to fundamental variations in salary and conditions of employment of air traffic controllers. The Association's response has been referred to the Public Service Board for consideration. My Department has completed negotiations to permit the temporary re-engagement of eight ex-air traffic controllers who can be temporarily released from their employment as Qantas pilots. It is expected that these ex-controllers will be deployed in Sydney and Brisbane after refresher training. My Department is working with the Public Service Board in developing proposals for engaging suitable controllers from the United States on a contract basis for a period of three years. The widespread shortage of air traffic controllers in many overseas countries has led to regular recruiting campaigns for air traffic controllers for service in the Middle East and far eastern countries. Hopefully this demand will be met in future from the pool of currently unemployed controllers in the United States, many of whom have expressed interest in employment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As can be seen from my statement, the efforts already in hand will ensure that the air traffic control resources will be able to meet fully the demand for services by the end of 1983. In the meantime, the situation will be progressively improving and hopefully with the co-operation of air traffic controllers, there will be negligible impact on the travelling public from the beginning of next year. It is regrettable that due to unusually high retirements, resignations and sickness amongst air traffic controllers, and the unforeseen growth in the aviation industry, the shortage should show up at this time. There is no doubt that we are now experiencing the low level of trainees who com- menced their training during 1974, 1975 and 1976. I regret that some inconvenience is being occasioned to some travellers to and from Brisbane. I appreciate the efforts being made by the great majority of air traffic controllers to help overcome the immediate problem. I give the assurance of the Government that everything that can be reasonably done is being done to obtain sufficient air traffic controllers to meet the needs of aviation and travellers in the 1980s. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes the opportunity which the statement of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) provides for parliamentary discussion on this critical issue of air safety and, more particularly, the serious shortage of air traffic controllers which has resulted in the early daily closure of Brisbane Airport and which is most likely to lead to the early closure and reduced availability of other airports within Australia. I understand it has also led to concern at Sydney Airport where a heavy work load is being placed upon air traffic controllers and excessive overtime is being worked. Some two out of three shifts at Sydney Airport are worked by people on overtime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In essence, the statement constitutes a confession of failure and misjudgment of air safety services by the hapless Minister for Transport. To an extent, he inherited some of the problems from his equally hapless and embattled colleague, the present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). Whilst the Minister has sought to detail the position with respect of air traffic controllers, the information his predecessor provided to this Parliament on an earlier occasion refutes much of what the Minister has said. I will come to that later. Both Ministers, the present Minister for Transport and the present Minister for Primary Industry-the former Minister for Transport-have employed, on numerous occasions, the standard National Country Party tactics of denigrating critics of their shortcomings rather than responsibly and carefully investigating and acting upon claims of deficiency in air services. Those claims have come from across the full spectrum of the industry, executives, operators, unionists, members of the parliament and ordinary members of the community. The Department, the Minister and his predecessor have been aware of those claims but have chosen instead-as the Minister did last night in his statement about the crash at Mascot on 21 February last year-to ridicule and besmirch those making criticism of their failings and shortcomings. I refer to the attitude to air safety of the Minister's predecessor. On 23 July 1979 a Press statement released by Mr Nixon stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Nixon said he was vitally concerned to ensure that Australia's aviation safety standards were fully and adequately maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I have said before, and I repeat now, that I am not prepared to put up with any condition that leads to the view that air safety in Australia is being jeopardised,' Mr Nixon said. </PARA>
<PARA>The present Minister has made similar high sounding statements. His predecessor, in the Parliament on 16 August 1978, said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it is the Government's policy to maintain aviation safety at the highest possible level. However, aviation safety is for experts to maintain; it is not for politicians, journalists or laymen to determine. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that they are the potential victims of failures in air safety procedures. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I will continue as always to rely on those experts in my Department and in the industry itself who can and do advise me. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to the Minister and his predecessor that I have seen the results of that attitude in the damning report of the Air Safety Investigation Branch into the Advance Airlines of Australia disaster of 21 February last year. The Minister also sought in his statement to play down the costs of his failure to keep Brisbane Airport open. We know that a major tourist development to the value of $30m in the Whitsunday area has been deferred as a direct result of the insecurity of the availability of Brisbane Airport. The decision was not taken because of problems associated with the commercial side of the development. It was the direct result of the failures of the Minister and his Department. The major disruption to domestic airline scheduling has led to a lower utilisation of its expensive aircraft. The Minister has played down that aspect. He said that the airlines have re-arranged schedules and that everything is okay. He pointed out that only a minor number of flights are affected. Costs are now being incurred through a lower utilisation rate of aircraft by the airlines and through the unavailability of services. There are problems for the tourist industry in the preparation and planning of tourist packages because of the uncertainty associated with airport availability. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental problems involved are the Government's failure to plan ahead and its refusal to bring the conditions and entitlements of air traffic controllers into line with those available in countries that are poaching our very highly regarded and well trained air traffic controllers. In an incredible fashion in the Minister's statement and at the Estimates Committee last week he foolishly sought to blame the present shortage of air traffic controllers on the Whitlam Administration. Honourable members should bear in mind that the training period for air traffic controllers was two years. It later became three years. There has been time since the Whitlam Administration was in office for two classes of air traffic controllers to graduate. The Minister has advanced differing reasons from time to time for the shortage of air traffic controllers that his Department has. Mr Thompson of his Department appeared at the Senate Estimates Committee on 30 April this year. In answer to a question by Senator Georges he said:</PARA>
<PARA> You were referring to Brisbane airport. It is true that in certain areas the Department is short of air traffic controllers but that is a problem caused by the lead time required in training and problems in recruitment. </PARA>
<PARA>There was no mention of the Whitlam Administration or a low intake of air traffic controllers in earlier years. On 25 August the Minister in answer to a question by the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) in this chamber referred to the shortage of air traffic controllers at Brisbane Airport. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the great difficulties we have with the controllers there is that many of them have in fact been working for two years without recreation leave, and in the terms of the conditions under which they have to operate they must take their leave at the end of the second year. This has contributed to a shortfall of air traffic controllers in Brisbane as from 10 September. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no mention of the Whitlam Administration or the low intake. They are the latest stories that the Minister has dreamed up. We should look also at the disparity in entitlements and conditions of air traffic controllers in this country and those available elsewhere, to which I referred a few moments ago. We should also look at the onerous and most responsible tasks that air traffic controllers have to fulfil in the course of their duties. Add to that the excessive overtime and work load and we have some understanding of why there is a limited life for air traffic controllers and why grave risks are associated in the operation of our air services if too much overtime is being worked, if not enough air traffic controllers are available and if the Government is not acting in a positive way to remedy the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned some of the problems associated with the matter which the Minister has advanced on earlier occasions but which contrast with his statement today. The invalidity rates for air traffic controllers between 1976 and 1980 reflect the nature of their occupation. Forty-one per cent of retirements due to invalidity were due to psychiatric conditions. There is a grave responsibility upon air traffic controllers. Likewise, there should be a grave responsibility upon this Government to act honestly, forthrightly and positively on this issue. It should not try to politicise it, as it has in the latest exercise, and blame the air traffic controllers for not accepting an offer that the Minister and the Public Service Board knew they would not accept. The Minister gave the impression that they were likely to accept it. He has not revealed the details of that offer. It would help public discussion if he did. It would certainly interest the other members of the Public Service. Everything this Minister has said about the number of air traffic controllers, the reasons for their problems and the numbers required in the early 1970s and the late 1970s is refuted by the parliamentary record of his predecessor. In a general discussion about the problems of air safety Mr Nixon on 16 August 1978-this is recorded at page 360 of Hansard-said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the area of air traffic control staff numbers are down less than 3 per cent of the presently required strength of 955 in the regions, or down 27 officers. </PARA>
<PARA>The required strength was 955, not more than 1,000. Mr Nixon said that three years ago. There is no mention of the Whitlam era or low intakes in the middle 1970s. Those are the facts from the Minister's predecessor and the Department which has now produced different information for the present Minister. Mr Nixon continued:</PARA>
<PARA> This requirement takes into account all operational needs plus relief for leave and sickness. I point out that this is not an abnormal situation for any organisation of this type; but in addition the Department took action some time ago to accelerate the trainee intake to alleviate even this small shortage as quickly as possible. More particularly, the Department and the Public Service Board are currently giving urgent consideration to a restructuring of air traffic control training. This will give even earlier relief, whilst at the same time giving better training and improved prospects of career satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the House that there is the absolute rebuttal of the tomfoolery the Minister has presented to us today. His predecessor three years ago said that strength was down by 27 officers, that the Department had increased the intake and was changing the training regime, that there was only a minor shortage and there would be no problem. He said that the Department had had discussions with the Public Service Board on restructuring air traffic control training. Three years and one month, less six days, later, Brisbane airport has been closed down by this Minister and this Government because not enough air traffic controllers are available. Which Minister was telling lies? They both cannot be correct. Was it the Minister at the table or his predecessor? Which officers in the Department were telling lies? Was it the present ones or the ones in 1978? Whilst we accept and welcome what we hope is a faithful undertaking to try to alleviate the situation and ensure that action is taken to recruit sufficient air traffic controllers to keep the airport open during normal operational hours, the Minister's statement is not acceptable. It is a false statement. It is a paltry attempt to blame, of all people, former Prime Minister Whitlam as being responsible for the present shortage of air traffic controllers. </PARA>
<PARA> We should note also from the Minister's statement that it is not expected that the full strength of air traffic controllers will be reached for another two years. The Minister gave the impression in the earlier part of his statement that by early 1982 everything would be back to normal. Later in his statement he said that we will not get up to full strength until 1983-another two years away. This is five years after his predecessor said: 'Everything is okay. We are on strength. We are recruiting quickly and we are changing the training program'. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst these belated attempts to remedy the situation are welcome, we have no confidence in this Minister. This Minister changes on the hour, by the hour. This Government's policy on aviation is made on the hour, by the hour. Let us revert to a statement the Minister made at 8 o'clock last night. He said of the report of the aircraft accident at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport-the air safety investigation report on the Advance Airlines disaster:</PARA>
<PARA> I have considered the need for the appointment of a Board--</PARA>
<PARA>Being a board of inquiry-</PARA>
<PARA>I have concluded that such action is not warranted in the circumstances of this accident. </PARA>
<PARA> In reaching this conclusion, I was aware of the actions which had been taken by my Department in relation to some issues which had advanced during the investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>Less than 14 hours later he said:</PARA>
<PARA>In giving further consideration to the conclusion of the report, particularly recommendation 14--</PARA>
<PARA>Which I will not bother to read-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I feel that there is a public interest matter that should be resolved by a board of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>How can anybody have any confidence in the competence of this Minister or the advice that he is receiving? We cannot. The tourist industry and the aviation industry cannot have any faith or carry out any firm planning on the basis of what this Government says are its aviation policies on the hour, by the hour and sometimes 12-hourly. We must always be prepared for the unexpected as far as this Minister is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals put forward for rapid recruitment of air traffic controllers in effect amount to band aid solutions to a very serious problem. The basic problem is to bring the conditions entitlements of air traffic controllers into line so that the air traffic controllers on whom we spend $100,000 each training are retained for our services on our airline system. The reason the world wants them, apart from the fact that the money is better elsewhere, is because they have such a high reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make the following point which the Minister neglected to mention. The overseas recruitment training program that the Minister put forward early in the year was to have solved things. The Senate Estimates committee dealing with this matter was told that there was a rapid recruitment of air traffic controllers abroad. It was expected that a certain number of air traffic controllers would be recruited and that that would get things right. Taxpayers paid, in addition to the $135,000 that year, another $440,000. In total, some $575,000 has been spent on travel associated with the recruitment of air traffic controllers and key personnel abroad. What have we to show for that expenditure? We see closed airports, airports not available for service, services disrupted, and unnecessary costs being incurred. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we welcome the statement. We hope that these belated attempts by the Government to remedy the situation will be carried through. We hope, for the sake of the industry and the travelling public, that they will be fruitful. We cannot accept the Minister's statement as being factual. In the light of his past performance, we have little confidence that he will carry through the initiatives that he has indicated. </PARA>

He quoted a figure continuously today which indicated that the strength of the Department in that area is 1,156. But when one compares the two figures the answer is only 996. A note on the bottom of this table states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 2. Figures after June 1980 include Flight Data. </PARA>
<PARA>The only conclusion that I can come to is that the figures prior to 1980 did not include flight data. Therefore, the true figure-this is where it is an untruthful statement-of the strength of the Department in 1980 was 1,021 and not 1,144, as against a figure of 1,020 in 1974 and 1,039 in 1975. The estimated figure for 1981 is 996, plus 160 flight data staff which obviously were not included in the figure prior to 1980. This is what the table shows. This is one of the instances where the facts have been distorted. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Minister prepares statements such as the one that he has just delivered to the Parliament he should not just pick a year and say: 'This is the fault of inadequate training from early 1974 onwards'. He should go back to his Department and ask his Department what is the position. The Department would tell him. I went back to his Department to check out his figures. In the years 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973 and 1974 the number of people trained was in accordance with the recommendations of the Department of Transport. An adequate number of staff was trained to meet the requirements of air traffic control. The Minister should not come into this place and appear before an Estimates committee and make misleading statements. That is what he has done. He has made misleading statements. Those are the facts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) quoted from a table which I gave him. He is suggesting that I have misrepresented the facts. I believe that I have been misrepresented because in regard to air traffic control strength from 1974 to 1981 the figures are thus: 1974, 1,020; 1975, 1,039; 1976, 1,023; 1977, 1,018; 1978, 1,009; 1979, 1,093; and 1980, 1,144. Those figures are consistent in their compilation because the data control people are included in each one of those figures.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are. I have checked with my Department and that table is completely accurate. There was no attempt to deceive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In order to clarify the situation, I table these graphs which are self-explanatory and which refute some of the statements made against the current Minister. They show the national air traffic control graduates, trainees and wastage figures between 1974 and 1981. They clearly show the way in which there has been a movement with respect to air trainees, graduates from air traffic schools and the wastage that has occurred. The other table shows the Queensland air traffic control staff availability, requirement and wastage between 1976 and 1981. The other table refers to air traffic control staff, including flight data staff, available and required between 1974 and 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the number of air traffic controllers who are turned out in any one year and the number of graduates who are entered into the system in any one year certainly have an influence on the availability of air traffic controllers in the years that lie beyond that date. So the current events do not owe their origin to 1980 or 1981. They owe their origin to a shortage of graduates entered and trainees turned out some years ago. One does not need to have much intelligence to appreciate that point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In six days' time the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) will preside over the opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne. This meeting, as we have been reminded, will be the largest meeting of foreign leaders ever to assemble in Australia. It will bring together leaders representing 25 per cent of the world's population, from both developed and developing countries. It will be the Prime Minister's crowning glory, his political climax. It will be the result of his relentless pursuit of fame-international fame. The Right Honourable John Malcolm Fraser will have arrived.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time as the Prime Minister achieves his ultimate triumph in one Commonwealth, the Commonwealth of Nations, we observe in stark contrast his failure in another Commonwealth, the Australian Commonwealth. In the Commonwealth where he can only grandstand, posture and interfere, he is immensely active. In the Commonwealth where he can actually right the wrongs, where he has the responsibility for action, he does nothing. When abroad he is a crusading statesman. At home he is a feeble political weakling. In international affairs, the Prime Minister was rightly concerned about bringing democracy to Zimbabwe. He continues, quite rightly, to campaign on the North-South question, which seeks a better deal for the underdeveloped countries from the developed countries. He is right to be concerned about Namibia. It is certainly not my intention to belittle his role on these important issues. I simply ask the question: In the face of this frenzied activity overseas in relation to other countries, why is there so little activity at home in relation to the position of Aborigines and their lack of control over their lives, their poverty, their persecution, their denial of basic human rights? In July of this year the Prime Minister said in his address to the Royal Commonwealth Society in London:</PARA>
<PARA> The scope for Commonwealth action is not pre-determined and fixed by some objective law. To a very considerable extent it depends on our own attitudes and commitments. Of course, there are objective limits to the role we can play, but we should not allow timidity or exaggerated modesty to circumscribe that role unnecessarily. Indeed, we should be alert to any opportunity to expand it. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what he says about the opportunities and responsibilities of the Commonwealth of which he is but one among 40. Compare that with what he says about his role in the Commonwealth of which he is head, the Commonwealth of which he is the Prime Minister. In answer to a question from the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) on 26 August last year, the Prime Minister said in relation to his dealings with the Western Australian Government:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it is true that the Conference-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the National Aboriginal Conference-</PARA>
<PARA>put to us that it would prefer this Government to use the totality of its Commonwealth power. The Government, in response, said that if these matters are to be resolved through negotiation and consultation, it will be not only a question of negotiation and consultation among Aboriginal groups, the State Government, miners or the Federal Government but also a question of negotiation and consultation between governments. It is not a question of one government arbitrarily using powers in relation to another. </PARA>
<PARA>Before that he had said:</PARA>
<PARA> It will not advance the cause of Aborigines if one government is virtually to go to war with another over the question of what ought to be done. </PARA>
<PARA>Is this not evidence of the sort of timidity which he was exhorting the other Commonwealth to avoid? The worst conditions confronted in Australia by Aboriginal and islander people are no better than those experienced by blacks in Zimbabwe during minority rule, no better than those experienced by the poor and the sick in underdeveloped countries. In the face of this double standard-the piety abroad and the neglect at home-the Prime Minister's efforts overseas only serve to mock him. But more than that, his activities abroad attract international attention to his efforts at home and that is really beginning to hurt. The National Aboriginal Conference has already taken its grievances to an agency of the United Nations in Geneva. The Australian Council of Churches invited a team from the World Council of Churches to visit Australia to examine the predicament of Australian Aborigines. Its report is a damning indictment. Under the heading 'Mining', the report says:</PARA>
<PARA> In the top end of the Northern Territory and in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, Aboriginal communities are living in fear of the impact the massive mining developments will have on their life style, their freedom, their culture, and their land and sacred sites. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The West Australian Government in its actions in support of or on behalf of the mining companies is showing a callous disregard for the people. Community development programmes for Aborigines are apparently being stopped in order to prevent any hindrance to mining development. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading 'Legal System', the report says:</PARA>
<PARA> The relationship between Aborigines and the legal system is one of conflict at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on. </PARA>
<PARA>In Queensland, Aborigines represent 2 per cent of the general population but 35 per cent of the prison population. In Western Australia, the general population is 2.4 percent Aboriginal but the prison population is 41 percent Aboriginal. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading 'Health', the report says:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing shows more clearly the total neglect of Aboriginal people and the racial discrimination against them by white Australian society than the alarming health conditions of Aboriginal people. Their standard of health is far lower than that of the majority of Australians and would not be tolerated if it existed in the Australian community as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was also said by the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs of which the honourable member for Dundas was Chairman and of which I was a member. Under the heading 'Housing', the report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Aboriginal communities in all the States we visited are inadequately housed. In some rural areas, Aboriginal people live without such basic needs as a water supply and minimum shelter. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading 'Education', the report says:</PARA>
<PARA> Our attention was drawn to the insensitivity and inflexibility of the education system which has resulted in statistics that indicate:</PARA>
<PARA> from a total of about 60,000 Aboriginal children, approximately 15 per cent are currently studying at secondary school but only 2 percent proceed beyond Grade 9, compared with 24 percent of white children;</PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading 'Employment', the report says:</PARA>
<PARA> Aborigines are the poorest people in Australia primarily because for the majority of them, their only income is inadequate social security benefits. Put simply, because they are unemployed. Yet time and again Aboriginal people told us they wanted to work and scorned 'sit down money'-their term for unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>The report is a picture of unrelieved horror, something of which we should all be ashamed. I do not believe for one moment that the Prime Minister condones the conditions of Aboriginal people in Australia. Indeed, his abhorrence of racism is one of the very few issues on which he has been consistent and passionate. But this only makes it worse. If he thought Bjelke-Petersen and Court were right, it would be understandable for him to do nothing to contest their actions. But that is clearly not the case. He knows they are wrong; he disapproves, and yet he still does nothing. What greater failing can there be in a Prime Minister than to recognise an evil, to have the power to correct it and to do nothing? The Prime Minister has expressed himself eloquently on Aboriginal issues in the past. I quote from a speech he made:</PARA>
<PARA>The denial of fundamental human rights to any group in a society diminishes that society. We must all be resolved that such discrimination and bigotry will never happen again. All Australians are entitled to be treated equally under the law whatever their colour, whatever their race. All are entitled to equal respect and equal protection. The Government is resolved to put an end to the hurt, indifference and intolerance which almost destroyed the Australian Aboriginals and their culture. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout all our work together we must never forget that any policy based on the superiority of one race over another is a policy doomed to failure. Just as the Government's policies towards Southern Africa are founded on this fundamental principle so in Australia we must achieve nothing less than real equality of all Australians-equality of rights, equality of opportunities, equality of protection under the law. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet the rhetoric of the Prime Minister, however well intentioned, has been particularly cruel. He has expressed his sympathy for the cause of Aboriginal people. He has expressed his horror at their current circumstances. He has expressed his concern for the preservation of their culture and their sacred sites. He has, in short, raised the expectation of the Aboriginal people only to disappoint them with his lack of action. This approach has been mirrored by his Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs-first Viner, then Chaney and now Baume. They have dragged their silver tongues from one end of Australia to another mouthing sweet platitudes, making the right responses, but when it comes to delivering on their promises or their implied promises they have all been found to be sadly wanting. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Government has been in office it has clipped $213m off the budget for aboriginal affairs, despite its initial promise to maintain funding for Aboriginal programs. Time and time again this Government has refused to take on the governments in Queensland and Western Australia. There was one feeble attempt to take over the reserves at Aurukun and Mornington Island, a move which was calculated to be subverted, and was, by the Queensland Government. The Queensland Government got its way and the Aborigines at Aurukun and Mornington Island lost out. Now, as the Queensland Government moves to provide leases instead of reserves, this Government will again do nothing. These leases are practically worthless to the Aboriginal people. They provide no tenure. They bestow no rights in terms of what can be done with the land and who can occupy it. The terms of the leases could at any time be overridden by the Queensland Government. In Western Australia the situation is just as bad. That Government has set its face against providing land for Aboriginal people. Yet this is the single most important demand of Aboriginal people throughout Australia. As the World Council of Churches team reported:</PARA>
<PARA> The cry for land rights is universal among all Aboriginal communities, rural and urban, particularly in the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia. It is part of their struggle for social and human justice for human dignity and identity. It is not a matter of political and economic convenience or of acquiring a piece of real estate. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told over and over again by Aborigines that land is their spiritual heritage. It is part of their being a people. Land was the basis of all relationships with Aboriginal human and physical environment. Land defined the clan, its culture, its way or life, its fundamental rights, its religious and cultural ceremonies, its patterns of survival and above all, its identity. Land was synonomous with Aboriginal existence. It could not be defiled, desecrated or cheapened. The expropriation, erosion, plundering, misuse or spoil amounts to the destruction of the Aboriginies' cultural and spiritual heritage: In contemporary understanding, it amounts to cultural genocide. Therefore, recovery of land has a deep spiritual meaning for the Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA>What the World Council of Churches has drawn attention to is that very little can be done about the appalling health, housing, education and poverty of Aboriginal people unless people have secure access to their land. So, the efficacy of all the programs of support for Aboriginal and islander people is greatly diminished without the Commonwealth first securing land rights throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that the Commonwealth has power. The referendum passed in 1967 quite specifically gave the Commonwealth the power to make laws in respect of the people of any race, including the Aboriginal people. The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in its report on the situation at Aurukun and Mornington Island has quite clearly confirmed the power of the Commonwealth to acquire land for Aboriginal people and determine the way in which it will be handed over to the Aboriginal people. Not to use this power by this Government is evidence of unbelievable political cowardice. It is to be compared with the Prime Minister's actions in browbeating young sportsmen and women over the question of the Olympic Games just last year. He had no compunction about taking on those people, about telling them what their responsibilities were not only to Australia but also to the rest of the world. He had no compunction in telling the Prime Minister of New Zealand what he ought to do about the tour of the visiting South African rugby team this year. But when he is confronted with the real intransigence of two Premiers elected by outrageous gerrymander the Prime Minister goes to water. </PARA>
<PARA> Without the sort of action in Australia that is necessary on these important issues how can we possibly be taken seriously by the rest of the world in relation to those questions on which the Prime Minister wants us to be involved? We cannot be taken seriously on the North-South question. We cannot be taken seriously on the question of providing democracy in other countries if the Commonwealth of Australia is not prepared to take the same sort of action on the same sort of issues in Australia where it has the power to act and where it has just shown itself too spineless to take action. If we do not take the necessary action in Australia our international reputation is likely to be comprised to the extent that the Comonwealth Games in Brisbane are likely to be imperilled all for the want of action by this Prime Minister, all for the want of action on the part of this Commonwealth Government. Negotiations have already been set in train on a proposed makarrata following preparations which the NAC has made. Those negotiations must proceed. Without that, without some resolution of the conflict which exists between the original Australian and the rest of the community, the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister will stand condemned before the whole world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One must read the words of this matter of public importance to understand its implications. The words are very important, I think, for all honourable members to note because this is a personal attack upon the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) at a time when he is embarking upon the organisation of one of the most important international conferences in which this nation is participating. The matter of public importance is written in this form:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The threat to Australia's international, reputation arising from the Prime Minister's-</PARA>
<PARA>Mark this, the Prime Minister's-</PARA>
<PARA>failure to protect and extend the rights of Aboriginal and Islander people in Queensland and Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>This reads as if this is some personal responsibility of the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) had the audacity to say that the matter of public importance was not intended to belittle the role of the Prime Minister. But that is exactly what it does. That is exactly what the honourable member thought to do. That is exactly what the matter of public importance is designed to do. It was designed by the Australian Labor Party, knowing that Australia was to participate in this important conference, to embarrass the Prime Minister in some covert way, to undermine his efforts to assist the world scene- a denigration of Australia by Her Majesty's Opposition, a denigration of Australia in the eyes of the world offered by some of its own citizens. I see it very much that way. I very much regret it. I do not think that the Aboriginal cause ought to be misused, as I believe it is in that way, by linking it with such an important national event. When the eyes of the world are to be focused upon Australia it is not for Her Majesty's Opposition, in my view, to be using the opportunities that it has in this House to advance arguments that have absolutely no validity at all. To the extent that one recognises that there have been a large number of problems in the field of Aboriginal affairs over a long time with various governments in office, with various elements of success in their programs, I think to put the matter in the way in which it has been put and to subscribe the blame, as has been endeavoured, to the Prime Minister personally is a reflection upon those who advanced the argument. </PARA>
<PARA> I am always disappointed when people who ought to know better advance arguments about what can or cannot be done in the field of Aboriginal affairs on the basis of the 1967 referendum proposals. I think it is timely to take this House once more through the circumstances that occurred at that time because some people believe-the honourable member personifies this-that the passing of that referendum gave the Commonwealth all sorts of powers to interfere in all sort of government activity, State and Federal, simply because it has some incidental relationship to Aborigines. To imply that is wrong. To promote that argument in the community is wrong. It is wrong, in my view, in law as much as it is in anything else. It is certainly wrong to mislead Aboriginal people into thinking that the Commonwealth has some power that it has not. The fact of the matter is that placitum (xxvi) which was incorporated in section 51 of the Constitution has never been tested in the courts. Honourable members should look at the words that were involved. The honourable member did, at least, mention that it did not refer specifically to Aboriginals when it was incorporated in the Constitution. It did in fact refer to making laws for people of a particular race. The reference excluded the previous exclusion in the section; that is, Aboriginals were not in that section before. The section simply dropped it. In debates at that time the Honourable Harold Holt, I am told, explained the matter in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> An effect of omitting these words will be the removal of the existing restriction of Commonwealth power to make special laws for people of the Aboriginal race in any State if the Parliament considers it necessary. As the Constitution stands at present, the Commonwealth has no power, except in the Territories, to legislate with respect to people of Aboriginal race as such. </PARA>
<PARA>He identified the words in this way. He said that if the words were deleted the result would be that the Commonwealth would have vested in it:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a concurrent power with respect to Aboriginals as such, they being people of a race, provided the Parliament deemed it necessary to make special laws for them. It is the view of the Government that the national Parliament should have that power. </PARA>
<PARA>It was seen as being a concurrent power, a power that would be exercised in co-operation with the States-not an overriding power, not a power that was to give it responsibility in all areas. That is the case with that particular section. In any event, we do not know the extent of that power. It has never been tested before any court. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member says: 'Why don't you test it?' That really gets to the crux of this matter as far as I am concerned. It is the very basis on which the Labor Party seeks to use Aboriginal people in a system where we confront Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals on issues which can be negotiated and discussed. The honourable member for Fremantle suggested that was cowardice. What is the reality? The reality is that if there is confrontation, Aboriginals suffer a great deal of anguish and difficulty, not that they are not suffering that now. They suffer it to a greater extent when they are put in conflict with other non-Aborigines in the community and when under the system there is grave uncertainty, worry and concern. What would be the concern? The concern would be in relation to the very programs that are in place at the moment. The concern would be if the Commonwealth were to take up the options of honourable members opposite, moved in to acquire the land and handed it over to the Aboriginals. Nobody knows on what basis the Commonwealth can do that, except we know that whenever it does, it has to do it on just terms; and just terms mean that there is a cost. Let us say that the cost is $1,000m. Some people have suggested that it might go higher. What would that do to Aboriginal programs in Australia? It would mean that we could not fund Aboriginal programs for five to 10 years at the existing rate of funding. What would it do to a Budget? What would be the cost?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is brought home to people very clearly if they look at the Bill proposed by the Labor Party to try to give effect to Aboriginal land rights in Queensland. In, I think, clause 14 of the Bill there is a proposal to deal with the range of other activities that are provided by Queensland. Some of them relate to law enforcement proposals. That clause seeks to remove from Aboriginal settlements elements of Queensland law-its criminal code, its consumer legislation and so on. One could go on and on about the legislation, of beneficial programs for Aboriginals that would be excluded simply by that provision being in the Bill. I am not arguing about its constitutional validity at this time. But assuming that it was valid it would create a situation in which the Commonwealth would have to put into place in Aboriginal reserves, or whatever else they became, its own laws to replace all those laws of Queensland which would otherwise apply. Nobody can justify a situation in which schools, health services and police would not be available. Nobody can justify a situation in which Aboriginal people are totally separated from mainstream Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Fremantle in his speech today suggested we should rely in some way upon this magnificent World Council of Churches report. I interjected during his speech because he was quoting at length words in that report which were in fact words I had drafted for the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs report on Aboriginal health. I do not demur from what was said because I believe it to be correct; there was nothing new or novel in the Council's report. Much of what was said in that report had been said by parliamentarians on both sides of this chamber, by parliamentarians in the States of Australia and by people who are concerned about Aboriginal issues. There was nothing new in that document. In fact, the document was deficient in the sense that I have heard other people describe documents as deficient; that was in respect of the shortness of time in which the people who deigned to comment prepared themselves to look at the question.</PARA>
<PARA> I was recently in India and I had the opportunity, as leader of a parliamentary delegation, to talk to Mrs Indira Gandhi. She asked the group how long we intended to be there, and I answered nine days. She said: 'That is good. Most people come for two days and then think they can write a book'. I think that is very much the case in relation to this World Council of Churches report. I suggest that a gentleman here in Australia, holding office for the Australian Council of Churches, went through all the reports, picked out the most difficult parts that he surmised others might have to answer and put them down as the views of the people who came to Australia. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) was with me recently in the Northern Territory. He did not visit the particular place mentioned in this report-Papunya-but if he had, he would know what was said on that occasion by the school principal at that place and some of his teachers about what happened on the day when the representatives of the World Council of Churches were there. Honourable gentlemen may have seen the photograph of children jumping from car body to car body in what was depicted as a playground but what was in fact the tip. Those who wanted to get good pictures for their books took the children out there from the school and had them jumping around for the photographers. It was a place where they would rarely go under other circumstances. To put such emotionalism into a topic like this does no justice to those who wrote the report and does no justice to Australia. It certainly does not provide a basis for reasoned discussion in this House of these important issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take honourable members through the important achievements that have occurred not only over the period of the Liberal-National Country Party Government but also over the period of the previous Labor Government. Some of these matters have been happening for quite a considerable period. Honourable members have given their attention to Aboriginal questions in Australia and they do not show any deficiency of concern or any lack of willingness to work for improvement on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since 1968 we have seen an estimated 11,659 houses provided for Aboriginal people. Aboriginal hostels now provide a bed capacity in Australia of some 2,500 beds. We have over 244 independent Aboriginal housing associations operating. We have over 15,000 Aboriginal children now in secondary schools. We have 138 Aboriginals utilising Aboriginal study grants in universities; 184 are undertaking teacher training, 681 are in other tertiary studies and 229 are doing technical studies. We have more Aboriginals graduating from tertiary institutions. This year over $10,948,000 has been spent by way of State grants and grants-in-aid for education. The Government supports over 19 independent Aboriginal medical services. We fund over 40 Aboriginal alcohol rehabilitation programs. The Government is committed to providing over $50m in the next five years for Aboriginal public health improvements. That was a direct result of the health report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. There are over 11 independent legal services operating from some 46 offices throughout the Commonwealth and handling over 750,000 cases. We have seen over $6.5m provided for legal aid in this year alone. We have seen over $11.67m directly spent for employment purposes in 1980-81. The national Aboriginal employment campaign, launched in association with the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, has resulted in over 2,000 jobs being provided for Aboriginals. We have seen 2,638 Aboriginals receiving training under the National Employment and Training System in this year. We have had the Community Development Employment Projects which are very important in providing support for Aboriginals in remote areas. Some 1,300 people in the past year have participated in that program at a cost of over $7m. </PARA>
<PARA> This financial year the Commonwealth has provided about $228m specifically for the advancement of Aboriginal people in Australia. Direct spending in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs this year will be over $147m, an increase of $19.5m on spending in 1980-81. That has been done in the areas retained by that Department. It does not include the additional expenditure in the areas of education and the like. This is a magnificent record. It is a record of achievement by the Government. It is a tangible expression of our concern. But those who want to suggest that the problems that have been with us over a long time have resulted from generations of differences between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people ought to recognise that those problems will not be overcome overnight. They will certainly not be overcome by confrontation. The problems will be overcome by co-operation. I entreat the Opposition to join with us positively in this program, and the program for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members will recall that, on 13 November 1979, the then Minister for Home Affairs informed the House that the Government, in considering the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Public Libraries, had decided to establish an interdepartmental working group to review the current level of library resources and facilities to identify the developments that had taken place since 1976. That working group included the departments of Home Affairs, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Education, Social Security, Science and Technology, and the National Library of Australia, the Schools Commission and the Tertiary Education Commission. The two latter bodies attended later meetings of the working group. The Minister indicated that the review would have regard to the library services currently available at educational institutions and the scope for public access to these and the special library resources and facilities which are available for handicapped persons and proposals for handling any improvements necessary in this field. The Government's decisions have been taken having regard to the recommendations of the working group and the recommendations of the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Public Libraries. The Government has also kept in view its policy of co-operative federalism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Public Libraries-the Horton report-contained 53 recommendations, mostly of State concern. Two of those recommendations called for Commonwealth implementation. Those were:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Commonwealth financial assistance to the States amounting to $20m per annum over 10 years; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the establishment of a Public Libraries and Information Council to co-ordinate the development of library services and to formulate advice on national policies for development. </PARA>
<PARA>The interdepartmental working group put forward several proposals based on those recommendations. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the recommendations of the working group. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Commonwealth support an evaluation of school-community libraries in Australia through the appropriate body, the Schools Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Commonwealth agree to the provision in 1980-81 of additional finance to the extent of $19,000 to the Schools Commission to undertake the evaluation study, over and above its 1980-81 appropriation. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Commonwealth agree in principle to the further development of library services for the handicapped at the national level, the precise requirements for additional staff and finance for the National Library remaining a matter to be determined in the annual budgetary context. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. In view of the Government's federalism policies, no special funds should be allocated to the States for the provision of public library services. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The Commonwealth should play a role in nationwide co-operation and co-ordination of library services. This should be achieved through:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the establishment of an Australian Libraries and Information Council, as proposed by the State Librarians' Council and the National Library of Australia, to be responsible for providing advice to Governments at all levels on the development of library and related information services in Australia, with particular regard to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the formulation and progressive development of a national plan for the development of library and related information services at the national, state and local government levels; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the establishment and operation of mechanisms to facilitate resource sharing in the field of libraries and related information services. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the strengthening of the Advisory Committees of the National Library of Australia and the Network Committees of the National Library to ensure effective co-operation with the Australian Libraries and Information Council; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the support at an appropriate level by the National Library of the activities of AACOBS (Australian Advisory Council on Bibliographic Services). </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has endorsed all these recommendations. I now turn to specific aspects of the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>Library Resources Currently Available at Tertiary Educational Institutions and Secondary Schools and the Scope for Public Access to These</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The working group's report examined in detail the library resources held in educational institutions in Australia. Holdings of bookstock held by universities in 1978 totalled 12.5 million volumes while 66 of the 73 colleges of advanced education had a total bookstock holding of 5,436,000 volumes in 1978. In this regard, as the working group points out, total holdings are substantially less than for the university sector but some of the large multi-purpose institutions have collections which match the size of some of the more recently established universities. The working group report provides details of recurrent expenditure in 1978 on library resources in tertiary education institutions. Honourable members will be aware that while universities and colleges and their libraries are fully funded by the Commonwealth Government, the costs of the State technical and further education systems are shared between the Commonwealth and the States. In 1978 total recurrent expenditure on university and CAE libraries was $49,915,000 and $28,442,000 respectively. Estimated recurrent expenditure on TAFE libraries in 1978 was $8,871,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Primary and secondary school libraries are funded from a number of sources-the Commonwealth Government, State-Territory governments and the schools themselves, through school councils and parents' associations. Commonwealth Government grants for school libraries are provided through the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act as a notional element of the capital program. The working group report indicates the capital grants to be so provided in 1980 and the amounts which it is expected will be directed to libraries will be for Government schools, $92,722,000 and $9,179,500 respectively and for non-Government schools, $27,858,500 and $3,296,500 respectively. The working group report examined the scope for public access to libraries in educational institutions and concluded that the additional burden which would be placed on both the staff and financial resources of these libraries through increased public access would be too onerous and that the development of this option would not be realistic at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> The working group report notes that the provision of library services for joint public-secondary school use does occur in a limited number of cases and in a variety of forms. The report indicates that South Australia, at the time the interdepartmental working group report was submitted to me, was the only State to have published officially accepted guidelines for a program of school-community library development. The working group sees advantages associated with the development of joint school-community library services, but considers that there is a need for a detailed study of this area and hence its recommendation for an evaluation study to be undertaken by the Schools Commission. In this regard, I am advised that the Schools Commission has made an approach to the States with a view to the formation of a management committee, representative of those States which will participate in the evaluation study. The task of the management committee will be to develop the guidelines for the evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Special Library Services and Facilities Which Are Available for Handicapped Persons and Proposals for Handling any Improvements Necessary</PARA>
<PARA> The working group report notes and endorses the significant initiatives taken by the National Library of Australia in the development of a national policy for the provision of library resources for the handicapped. In this, the International Year of Disabled Persons, it is appropriate that I refer briefly to the initiatives being undertaken by the National Library in the development of library services for print handicapped persons. In 1978, the Library conducted, on behalf of the Working Party on Library Services for the Handicapped, a nation-wide survey into the whole question of meeting the informational, recreational and cultural needs of the print handicapped. In particular, the survey sought views on the structure of library services for handicapped people and an indication of the role that might be played by the National Library, if any, as well as State and local libraries, educational agencies and institutions. The results of the survey formed the basis of a national seminar held at the Library in August 1978. The Library's current program, which was discussed at a second national seminar in May, includes: The development and maintenance of the national union catalogue of library materials for the handicapped; the development and maintenance of a production register of library materials for the handicapped; the provision of other services facilitating co-ordination and co-operation of library programs for the handicapped on a national scale; and the publication of a newsletter. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue of the National Urban Catalogue of Library Materials for the Handicapped, which has been published by the Library, lists 4,000 items in 10 major institutional collections. By December this year, one-third of the total resources of these materials in Australian insitutions-estimated at 35,000 different items-will have been made available for use by service agencies. I might add that the National Library's catalogue is the second such computer-produced listing in the world. Other initiatives include compiling a register of materials being produced for handicapped readers and establishing a national advisory committee on library services for people with disabilities. The aims of the advisory committee are to consider the special needs of handicapped people for library services and to advise the National Library Council on the organisation, development, co-ordination and co-operation of these services. </PARA>
<PARA> State governments are sympathetically inclined towards the establishment of advisory committees concerned with library services for the handicapped to ensure co-operation and co-ordination among State, local and voluntary organisations providing library services to handicapped persons and to liaise with the National Library's advisory committee. The governments of Western Australia and Tasmania have already set up such committees. Honourable members will also be aware that the Copyright Amendment Act, which came into effect on 1 August, contains particular provisions which will remove the copyright impediments that have hindered the production of versions of published work for handicapped readers. </PARA>
<PARA>As a Result of the Government's Federalism Policies, States and Local Government Have Increased Revenue To Meet Objectives within Their Own Priorities</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The report of the inter-departmental working group takes into account the Government's federalism policies and notes the increased funding made available in recent years to States and local government through the income tax sharing Acts and the flexibility available to local government to deteremine its own expenditure priorities. In endorsing the recommendations of the working group, the Government was mindful of the significant increases in tax sharing payments to the States and local authorities. Both the States and local government can look forward to substantial increases in funds provided by the Commonwealth. On the basis of estimated revenue and income tax collections this year, local government's 2 per cent share of personal income tax collections is expected to rise next year by about 19 per cent. In the same way, the States' share of general revenue, based on revenue collection estimates for the current financial year, is expected to rise substantially by some 16 per cent. In other words, States will have substantially increased general revenue funds from which they can meet these important objectives within their own priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Co-operation between Library Services</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> One of the major recommendations of the Horton report was the establishment of a body to co-ordinate the development of library services in Australia. In its report, the interdepartmental working group referred to the desirability of such a co-ordinating body and also noted that several government inquiries in the 1970s recognised the need for national guidelines in relation to the co-operative co-ordination of library and information policies. The interdepartmental working group supports the view that the Commonwealth Government has a role in the development of co-operation and co-ordination in library services. To this end, the working group supported the proposal by the State Librarians Council and the National Library of Australia for the establishment of an Australian Libraries and Information Council. The Government has agreed to this proposal and it received the unanimous support of Ministers at the February 1981 conference of Ministers having responsibility for cultural affairs and the arts. </PARA>
<PARA> The function of the Council is to advise Ministers on means of securing co-operation and co-ordination between the Commonwealth and the States and among the States themselves in the development of library and related information services. The Council would not have a funding role. The membership of the Council will include the Director-General, National Library of Australia, the State librarians and the Director of the Northern Territory Library Service, three nominees of the Commonwealth Minister for Education and one nominee of the Commonwealth Minister for Science and Technology. I will be discussing with my colleague the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) the actual arrangements for the nominations of the three representatives of the education sector. The Government has now approached the State Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory seeking their respective agreement to the appointment of the State librarians and the Director of the Northern Territory Library Service to the Australian Libraries and Information Council-ALIC, as it is coming to be known. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The provision and co-ordination of information services is one of the great challenges of our time. We live in a complex society in which we are coming to grips with the information revolution. The revolution, opening up all sorts of exciting possibilities with regard to the provision of and access to information from businesses through to our own homes, has coincided with, and has been encouraged by, the rapid expansion and development of new technology. We are acquiring almost daily better and more efficient ways to store, locate and provide information, whether it be for our large companies and businesses, or the latest information about the weather on a teletext link on our own television screens at home. Libraries, traditionally society's store of information, are of course crucially involved in the information revolution, adapting to meet the challenges and demands being placed upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the interdepartmental working group canvasses some of these issues. The interdepartmental working group's examination of public library services in the States in the post-Horton era, shows that there has been a growth in public library services although this varies from State to State. Furthermore, it is evident that the role of the public library is being extended in acknowledgment of community attitudes and needs. Developments in the planning of public library services on a State-wide basis also reflect greater commitment on the part of State library authorities to the improvement, equalisation and extension of public library services. There has been continuing attention to the provision of special library services for clients with special needs, such as ethnic readers, the partially sighted and the blind. State and local libraries have especially supported the development of general information services for local communities which have regard to the needs of ethnic and other groups for information on government welfare and health agencies and activities of clubs and organisations. There has been a move towards greater co-operative action, aided by the development of new technology, which may be seen as a response to the growing need for resource sharing to cope with greater pressures on library budgets due to the rising cost of resources and the increasing and diversified demands on library services. </PARA>
<PARA> On the national level, the Government recognises the continuing leadership role of the National Library in the development of library and information services in Australia. The Government acknowledges its responsibility to contribute to this development through its support of the National Library's activities, as well as those of such other agencies as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, not to mention the libraries at each level of education. In this regard, provision of $17.392m has been made available for the operating expenses of the National Library in 1981-82. Some of the services currently being provided by the National Library to Australian libraries include its central bibliographical service which in 1980-81 filled 800,000 orders for cataloguing information in card and machine-readable form, and made available on micro-film more than one and a half million records from its massive union catalogues. The Library's inter-library loan services also provided approximately 200,000 items from the Library's collections to other institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, the Government recognises that today's society is information orientated and that information services are very much bound up with technological change. In line with this, the Government has endorsed the National Library's proposal to develop an Australian bibliographic network. When developed, the network will enable Australian libraries to consult through the Library's computer the substantial data base of cataloguing information compiled from Australian and overseas sources. Libraries will be able to use this information for their own cataloguing or, when no entry is found, to contribute their own so that it can then be used by others. In addition to enabling libraries throughout Australia to reduce cataloguing costs, and in some instances to reduce them quite significantly, and to avoid unnecessary duplication in the acquisition of library materials, the network could also be developed to take the place of the present national union cataloguing program and to provide libraries with sophisticated reference and acquisition systems. It will also enable State and regional libraries to better support the services of local public libraries and allow smaller libraries better access to the nation's library resources. The potential of such a system is immense and, in terms of library and information services of the nation, it will improve co-ordination and enhance resource sharing to make more effective use of resources in libraries generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Director-General of the National Library has described the proposal to establish the Australian National Bibliographic Network as the most important development that the Library could undertake at present. This proposal, along with the decision to establish the Australian Libraries and Information Council, is indicative of the progress that is being made towards achieving greater co-ordination in the nation's library resources. The Government remains determined to ensure that the information revolution is harnessed to the benefit of the whole community through the gradual development of a more efficient and effective network of libraries in Australia. I commend the report to honourable members. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Fraser Government's response to the report of the Horton Committee of Inquiry into Public Libraries is miserable and constitutes a further betrayal of Australia's intellectual resources. This is part of a deliberate policy by the Fraser Government of winding down Australia's intellectual resources as witnessed by the declining numbers of students who complete secondary education, the falling numbers in tertiary institutions, the re-introduction of fees for second degrees, the declining investment in research and development, the ending of the Australian Government Publishing Service bookshops, and the imposition for the first time in Australia's history of a sales tax on books, magazines, periodicals and newspapers. Despite the enthusiastic words of the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) Australia is not well placed to cope with the information revolution. It is cynical to suggest that these makeshift, cheapskate arrangements referred to in the Minister's statement constitute an effective response to the challenge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee of Inquiry into Public Libraries was appointed in March 1975 and it reported to the Fraser Government in February 1976 on the shortcomings of Australia's public libraries. The Chairman of the Committee was Mr Allan Horton, the university librarian of the University of New South Wales. He had six other distinguished people on the Committee with him. It is striking that it took them only 11 months to produce the report. It has taken this Government five and a half years to announce its response to the report. This illustrates the enthusiasm it feels for the information revolution. The Horton report recommended total expenditure of $700m over a 10 year period to upgrade book stocks and the means of access so that Australia could come to grips with the information explosion sweeping the Western world. The money provided in the Minister's policy document is not $700m but only $19,000. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA>Guidelines</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>(Recommendation 1) The following broad guidelines should be accepted as a basis for a program of assistance to public libraries in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the provision of public library and information services should be the collective responsibility of the Commonwealth, State and local levels of government, funded in part by each of these levels of government;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the provision of equality of service on the basis of reasonable need should be ensured by the Commonwealth and State Governments;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the provision of public library and information services should be free of charge to all members of the community;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the provision of total library service cannot be achieved by any one type or unit of library or information service, but only by the co-operative efforts of all types of information agencies working towards a commonly accepted and planned system;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the expansion and extension of individual library and information services should be achieved through co-operation, and/or contract and the formation of library systems and networks, with each service retaining its autonomy within the overall State plan for the development of these services;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) the integration of these State systems and networks into a national network should be ensured by the Commonwealth Government in consultation with State Governments, with the Commonwealth Government giving highest priority in assistance to State Governments who demonstrate effective plans to develop a State system and networks;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) the further development of the informational role of the public library should be given priority by funding authorities and the library profession, while at the same time the recreational and educational role should not be diminished;</PARA>
<PARA> (h) the participation of users in marketing, developing or extending public library service should actively be encouraged by State and local authorities;</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the improvements of public library service is dependent on the clarification of the role of the public library, the assessment of user needs, the education programs for staff, the provision of increased resource materials, the introduction of new methods and management techniques and the provision of support services. </PARA>
<PARA>(4.12) Role of Public Libraries</PARA>
<PARA>(Recommendation 2) Public libraries should consider the relevance of each of the following functions of libraries when planning library and information service for the people of their specific communities:</PARA>
<PARA> as a source of recreational material for reading, listening and viewing, related to the people's interests whatever they are;</PARA>
<PARA> as a source for information useful to people in their day to day living;</PARA>
<PARA> as a source of advice to people about community, local, regional, State and Commonwealth government activities;</PARA>
<PARA> as a point of referral when people are in doubt as to which group or organisation to approach in connection with a probem;</PARA>
<PARA> as a source of material for people's vocational continuing education either directly or by arrangement with specialised services provided by regions, State or Commonealth government libraries;</PARA>
<PARA> as a source of material for people's life-long education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The major point is this: The report stresses that there must be the provision of a quality of service on the basis of reasonable needs which should be ensured by Commonwealth and State governments. The provision of public library and information services should be the collective responsibility of the Commonwealth, State and local levels of government funded in part by each of these levels of government. The report speaks about the integration of State systems and networks into a national network. It is true the word 'network' appears once in the very last words of the Minister's statement. He says: 'Let the network be funded by the already existing resources available to the State and local government'.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is so thin that the nation may fall through it. Let us look at the response in the document tabled today entitled 'Policy on Assistance to Public Libraries', submitted by the interdepartmental working group to the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. It gives the game away. Page 1 points out that the Horton report had two major recommendations. They are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) Commonwealth financial assistance to the States amounting to $20 million per annum over 10 years;</PARA>
<PARA>That is in 1976 money; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) establishment of a Public Libraries Information Council to co-ordinate the development of library services and to formulate advice on national policies for this development. </PARA>
<PARA>The first part, which is the most important part, is rejected. The second part is adopted, but we are told that the PLIC will have no funding powers. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Horton report estimated that in order to implement the programs proposed by the States to bring public libraries in Australia to a reasonable standard a total amount would be needed at State and local levels of approximately $500 million or $50 million per annum over a ten year period.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 3 the report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> At the outset, the Working Group noted that the provision of public library services is constitutionally and historically the responsibility of State and local government. In giving consideration to this basic issue the Working Group was required to bring forward any proposed action against a background of the Commonwealth's federalism policies. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the working group said: 'Look, let us face it, the game is up. Under the new federalism you are not going to get anything. If you are going to raise the standard of State and municipal libraries, the States will have to fund it themselves. That is really the end of it'. Again, we note the extraordinary situation of how the provision of public library services and the book stocks have fallen very dramatically behind the universities. We do not want to downgrade the importance of university libraries, but if we really want to bring the benefits of the information revolution to everybody, as the Minister has stated, we have to maximise the access to information by ordinary citizens. The public library traditionally and historically has been the great place of access for the ordinary citizen who wants to increase his own knowledge, to improve his own competence, to familiarise himself with things that are unfamiliar to him. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the Government does not. It still sees access in absolutely elitist terms. That is the tragedy of it all. That is why this is such a hollow and cynical document. It is very striking that the total number of books that are provided in State libraries throughout Australia is only of the order of 5,896,000; in municipal libraries the figure is 18,720,000. Those libraries will include an infinite number of sets of the complete works of Enid Blyton and so on. Quite correctly, there will be an enormous number of children's books, but there will be a great deal of duplication which will not add a great deal to the intellectual resources of the Commonwealth. University libraries have over 11 million books and colleges of advanced education over 5 million books. It is difficult to see whether there is any provision for reading at all in the technical and further education institutions. The working group's report says that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 340 of the 487 TAFE institutions in Australia in 1978 had no library at all. Even those libraries that do exist range from an acceptable level of provision down to very small holdings. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister says: 'That is all right. We will solve the problem. This year we will kick in $19,000, not $700m'. I say that it is a sham and the Opposition is appalled by the poverty of the response we are getting. On page 63 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's federalism policies have had an all pervasive influence on the Working Group's approach to the financial recommendations of the Horton report. </PARA>
<PARA>You can say that again. The working group took account of the political climate in which the Horton recommendations were brought down and the changes in government policy and the approach of the States since that time. It is thumbs down all the way. What the Minister said is correct: We face an information revolution. That is something I have talked about, it seems almost interminably, from this side of the House. James Martin and Adrian Norman, in their book the Computerised Society wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the sum total of human knowledge changed very slowly prior to the relatively recent beginnings of scientific thought. It has been estimated that by 1800 it was doubling every 50 years; by 1950, doubling every 10 years; and that presently it is doubling every five years. One wonders how long this acceleration can continue. Computer technology may make a frighteningly high rate of increase possible for centuries. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's response is to say: 'Do not worry. We are almost, but not quite, keeping up with inflation'. What about the book stocks? The Government says: 'Well no, we are not able to provide adequate money to put up for replacement level on the basis that you have to get rid of 12.5 per cent of your book stock every year'. In no way is this government response adequate to deal with the information explosion. The US National Academy of Sciences estimated that in the early 1970s about two million scientific writings were published every year, that is 8,000 for each of 250 working days. It said that this figure would quadruple by 1985. George Anderla wrote a very important study called Information in 1985. A Forecasting Study of Information Needs and Resources which was published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Professor Anderla noted:</PARA>
<PARA> The figure of 8 million scientific documents yearly put into circulation in 1985 as against two million in 1970 must be considered as a conservative forecast. </PARA>
<PARA> A mere continuation of the present tendency-</PARA>
<PARA>He wrote this of the years 1967 to 1971-</PARA>
<PARA>would produce a total of some 13 to 14 million per year, i.e. equivalent to the stock accumulated since the origins of science until the present day. A projection midway between these figures would seem fairly reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA>The mathematician, Stanislaw Ulam, found that in the 1970s about 200,000 new theorems were published each year in mathematical journals and decided that this was something to worry about. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> If the number of theorems is larger than one can possibly survey, who can be trusted to judge what is 'important'?</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is standing still on a descending escalator. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every member, not just the Minister, could benefit by the use of libraries. I think it is tragic that the response of the Government is so pathetically inadequate. It must change. If the Minister is earnest in trying to adopt some of the best elements of the Horton report-I would like to think he was sympathetic-much more has to be done. Of course, we welcome some things in the Minister's statement, for example that special library services and facilities will be made available for handicapped persons. That is long overdue; it ought to be done. But there are not very many good things in the report. We are glad that the Australian Libraries and Information Council has been set up but essentially it is toothless. It is a mere aggregation of public servants. It will have no money. There will be no responsibility on it to report to the public and there is no reason to assume that it will. ALIC will be completely dominated by public servants. It is difficult to see that it will in its own way make much of a contribution to Australia's information revolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister's definition of the information revolution and the examples he gave in his speech were extraordinarily narrow. He referred to the information revolution in a purely economic and commercial context. There was no hint of raising levels of consciousness or widening personal horizons. Access to information was seen in a very limited way. The Government said that people would have access to information from businesses to find out what is happening in large companies and the latest information about the weather. In other words, presumably people will find out whether to go out and buy an umbrella and a raincoat or whether to buy a sunhat and shorts. That is the view the Government has of the information revolution. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> On the national level, the Government recognises the continuing leadership role of the National Library in the development of library and information services in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>What is the situation? The National Library has had a 2 1/2 per cent reduction in staff this year. It has had an 8 per cent increase in its annual vote but in real terms, when we take inflation into account and the enormous increase in the cost of books, that is a very severe cut. Books have increased in price on average by 24 per cent over the last year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is also the sales tax of 2 1/2 per cent. Presumably libraries will be able to receive exemption but it is a tragic situation. In the nineteenth century some of Australia's public libraries were regarded as among the best in the world. The Melbourne Public Library, or the State Library of Victoria as it is now known, had one of the best collections of books in the world in the nineteenth century. It kept very much up to date with current publishing. Now our libraries, relative to the enormous flow of information and the exponential increase in publications, are falling far behind. They have a token access to the books available that are published overseas. That is tragic. It puts Australia right down the chute. I urge the Government to look again at the Horton report. Instead of producing this pious collection of cliches, it should make sure that the information revolution really does work. It should recognise that the new federalism is intensely destructive to Australia's intellectual base. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the proposal the Labor Party will advance for a national information policy. That is something we need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>National Information Policy</PARA>
<PARA> A National Information Policy shall provide that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. All Australians are entitled to free access to information and library services of acceptable standard relative to the affluence of the State, regardless of where they live, of their social and economic position, of their language, their age, their mobility, or physical disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The effective working of democracy depends on the availability of adequate information and the capacity for its independent evaluation. The right to know, to be informed, is basic to every person. Access to information and the right to its availability should be vigorously pursued. In our society, access to information is a vital resource of government and of the public, and like other resources it should not be concentrated in the hands of the rich. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Australian community is divided between the 'information rich', and the 'information poor'. Women, migrants, the aged, the young, the poor and the handicapped are victims of inadequacies in the information delivery system. Information facilities are remote from those who need them most. They do not know what is available and do not know how to remedy their lack of information. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The enormous inequity in 'information transfer' means that the position of the individual compared to governments and corporations may deteriorate rapidly. The increasing volume of available information may lead to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) increasing tendency towards specialisation and the fragmentation of knowledge</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) a growing sense of 'alienation' or 'anomie' from many people who feel unable to understand what is going on around them, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) a risk that power will move towards the technocrats and away from elected institutions such as Parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Information problems should not continue to be treated in the narrow perspective of science and technology, and left to scientists and experts alone, but should be envisaged in the broader context of knowledge and social welfare in which information is regarded as a fundamental resource. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Governments must not allow automated systems and networks to develop in a chaotic fashion for strictly commercial motives. They must understand and plan for the new technologies which will come into general use everywhere in the next ten years. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. As recommended in the Coombs Report on Government Administration, a Commonwealth Information Advisory Council should be set up to define and codify:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the right of access of individuals or public or private bodies to this information resource and the inherent limits to this right:</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the political and social guarantees which individuals and institutions can legitimately expect, including protection of privacy and professional secrecy;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the basic rules of reciprocity which should govern relationships between public and private systems and networks;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) a code of ethics for professions and industries concerned in this field.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. The provision of public library and information services should remain the collective responsibility of the Commonwealth, State and local levels of Government, funded in part by each of these. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. Public libraries must become information resource centres including local data banks, information about access to government services, with greater emphasis on non-book material such a gramophone records, tapes, cassettes, microforms and audio-visual material generally. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. The expansion and extension of all library and information services should be achieved through co-operation and/or contract and the formation of library systems and networks with each service retaining its autonomy within the overall State plan for the development of these services. Already existing information services should be co-ordinated and integrated to avoid duplication and waste of resources. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a Commonwealth office building, Townsville, Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposal is for an office building which will replace existing widely dispersed accommodation and consolidate most Commonwealth activities in a central location in Townsville. The building will accommodate 600 people and the works will comprise three floors of office accommodation, a basement providing storage areas and secure parking for official vehicles, site landscaping and an open car parking area. </PARA>
<PARA> In reporting favourably on the proposal, the Committee also made certain recommendations and comments. Firstly, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority will be a tenant in the building as recommended by the Committee. The Committee sought a report on the future of the old Customs House. An interim report has been made to the Committee. For the present the Customs Bureau will continue to operate from the old Customs House. However, the appropriateness of this arrangement will be kept under review. </PARA>
<PARA> A further recommendation was that there be liaison with local authorities to determine whether the building should, in whole or in part, be designated and constructed as a cyclone shelter. Discussions have taken place with State counter-disaster authorities and it has been agreed that the Commonwealth will make the basement of the building available for use as a cyclone refuge area. Detailed arrangements on access and security have yet to be finalised. The Committee called on the Government to clarify its policy on car parking to ensure, where possible, that the Commonwealth complies with local by-law provisions. Government policy is that each project should be considered on its merits, taking into account various constraints including car parking and other requirements of local planning authorities. Wherever practicable there is compliance with the local authority requirements in a spirit of co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the Commonwealth office building at Townsville a compromise was reached in discussions with the Council which facilitated the design of a building in harmony with the civic precinct of Townsville. The Committee in paragraph 37 of its report suggests that in future departments consider more fully the economies of accelerating completion of construction of projects and that such considerations be reflected in the departmental evidence. Note has been taken of this suggestion for adoption where appropriate in future references. At the same time I point out that overall budgetary considerations largely determine priorities and timing of commencement of individual proposals. In the case of the Townsville offices the date for commencement of the project will be considered in the context of the 1982-83 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally the Committee expresses an option that further consideration should be given to the provision of food services in the building. This has been done but no such provision is proposed. The estimated cost of the proposal examined by the Committee was $8.7m at August 1980 prices. The Committee recommended construction of the work in the reference. If the House agrees to support this motion, detailed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly in support of the motion. The question of a new Commonwealth office building in Townsville is one which I raised with the Government soon after I was first elected to this Parliament early in 1978. It is a project that I have pursued fairly vigorously since then. The problem is that in Townsville accommodation for various sections of the Commonwealth Public Service is diverse in nature, scattered, and often sub-standard. All of those matters were dealt with, of course, by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and have been reported on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government made a commitment to go ahead with this building some 18 months to 2 years ago. After that, the matter was referred to the Public Works Committee. An inquiry was held and the Public Works Committee, of course, recommended in favour of the building. Then came the announcement that no funds would be provided for the building in the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> That announcement was greeted by me and by the Townsville community with a good deal of alarm and disappointment. We felt that a commitment had been made to construct the building and we could demonstrate that the building was needed. Then, of course, a decision was made to defer it as far as the 1981-82 financial year was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, therefore, heartening that the Government now sees fit to move this motion that it is indeed expedient to carry out the works. This means that all the detailed planning and design work can proceed unhindered. If funds are provided in the 1982-83 financial year and all the detailed design and document work has been completed there ought to be no great delay in starting on the building. It is that course of action that I urge upon the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other comment I would like to make relates to the future of the old Customs House in Townsville. It is a very fine historical and very good looking building. It is a building that, to some extent, is inefficient in terms of its use by the Bureau of Customs. Yet, of course, it has the advantage of providing that Bureau with a single base of operations. My preference would be to see the Customs Bureau take advantage of facilities in the new building. There might then be a question of what to do with the old building which, as far as an office building is concerned, is expensive to maintain and, as I have said, somewhat inefficient in terms of its size. I have said also that it is a very fine looking building, well situated on the Strand in Townsville. It is my view that the building would be eminently suited to being put aside to some public use, perhaps as a North Queensland museum or a branch of the Queensland museum. </PARA>

Because of the cost of continually maintaining the building, and because the Customs Bureau could otherwise be well accommodated in the new building it seems to me that it would be preferable for Customs to go to the new building and, therefore, for the Government to consider making available this grand old historic building for public and community use.

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Garden Island, New South Wales, Modernisation stage 2. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposal is for the second stage of an overall modernisation program which is aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Dockyard and the fleet base. The Committee has recommended the construction of the various facilities included in the reference except for the surface preparation and preservation facility and oily bilge waste treatment plant. The facilities which are the subject of this motion comprise: Woolloomooloo fleet berth wharves; West Dock workshop modules 'B' and 'C'; guided missile launching system overhaul facility; conversion of building 30 to a ready-use store; conversion of buildings 89 and 90 to an office complex; production administrative centre and dock refit berth support facility; groundworks; and reticulated engineering services. In respect of the surface preparation and preservation facility and oily bilge waste treatment plant, the Committee has recommended that they be deferred and referred back to the Committee for separate consideration. The Government accepts this recommendation and I foreshadow that in due course I will propose a further motion to refer these facilities to the Committee for separate consideration and report. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to bring to the attention of honourable members the fact that the liquid trade waste plant was considered and endorsed by the Committee as part of the stage one modernisation works, but was to be housed together with the facilities which are now to be referred back to the Committee. In view of this there will be no action taken on the liquid waste treatment plant until the Committee has reported on the surface preparation and preservation facility and oily bilge waste treatment plant. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended that there be a design development provision of $1m and that the justification of a further $1.5m design development provision proposed by the Department of Housing and Construction be examined when the surface preparation and preservation facility and oily bilge waste treatment plant are referred back to the Committee. The Government notes the Committee's recommendation and further justification will be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> In the body of the report the Committee has drawn attention to the fact that there is as yet no agreement between the Commonwealth, the State and the Council of the City of Sydney on financial arrangements for providing and maintaining the public park on the roof of the carpark. The Committee reaffirmed its view that the State and the City Council should be financially involved. The Commonwealth is pursuing this matter with both the State and the Council and has received a proposal from the Council to contribute to maintenance subject to the State Government also becoming involved. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Committee's hearing, a number of undertakings were given on the treatment to be accorded historic buildings and machinery at Garden Island. The Government will ensure that appropriate action is taken. The Committee requested that further discussions be held with the Council of the City of Sydney regarding an alternative site for Harry's Cafe de Wheels. This will be done and I understand that a new site will be suggested to the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> In paragraph 74, the Committee has noted that no further works are planned for construction until 1988 at the earliest. There could, however, be a need to undertake further work before 1988 to meet operational requirements. In paragraph 69, the Committee has noted that careful management of the project will be required to minimise disruption to both dockyard and construction activity while the work proceeds. Appropriate management controls will be exercised. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I note that the Committee has commended the attention being paid to environmental aspects and to the preservation of historic buildings at Garden Island. With the deletion of the surface preparation and preservation facility and oily bilge waste treatment plant the estimated cost of the proposal recommended by the Committee is $75.4m at April 1981 prices, inclusive of a design development provision of $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> Except for the surface preparation and preservation facility and oily bilge waste treatment plant, the Committee recommended construction of the work in the reference and if the house agrees to support this motion detailed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Armoured centre redevelopment, Puckapunyal, Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposal is for the consolidation of new and refurbished facilities into an integrated complex for training, administration and accommodation. The works will comprise: A headquarters and instructional building; driving and servicing training facilities; a technical support building; a Q-store and guard complex; sleeping accommodation; new and refurbished mess facilities; refurbishing of tank hangars; a parade ground, roads, carparks; and engineering services. </PARA>
<PARA> In reporting favourably on the proposal the Committee has made certain other recommendations and comments. Firstly, the Committee has recommended that the Department of Defence in conjunction with the Department of Home Affairs and Environment review the methods of disposal for all pollutant substances throughout Australia to ensure its practices are in accordance with the requirements of existing legislation and relevant local authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Defence already makes efforts to ensure that its methods of disposing of pollutant substances accord with the requirements of existing legislation, relevant local authorities or community standards. In regard to any new works, statutory or other requirements are taken into account by the Department of Defence and the Department of Housing and Construction. This includes the reference of works to the Department of Home Affairs and Environment for advice on their possible impact on the environment. The Department of Defence will take note of the Committee's recommendation and take action where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> In the body of the report, the Committee has indicated that it believes a pollution problem has been allowed to develop through the use of waste oils for laying dust in range areas. Only a small amount of the waste oil produced at Puckapunyal is used to suppress dust. Where it is used it is confined to a small area. There is no evidence that the small quantities of waste oil sprayed in such situations have significantly harmed the environment. Pasture grasses in the general area discourage run off, and assist bacterial decomposition of the oil; river monitoring stations have not indicated any oil flowing out of the Puckapunyal catchment area; oil from the centre is not contaminated by lead; the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, which is Defence's consultant on environmental aspects of managing this and other training areas, has not specifically commented on the spraying of oil at Puckapunyal to suppress dust. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee expressed concern that the environmental approval for this project was issued at a time when the Department of Defence was not ready to put a proposal for the full work. The Department of Home Affairs and Environment concluded in 1977 that the proposed works at Puckapunyal would have no significant impact on the environment. Further design development of the works since then has not significantly affected their general nature or intended use. At paragraph 33 of its report the Committee indicates concern that waste water from the tank hangars might pollute the stormwater system. Interceptor traps have in fact been included in the project to ensure that this does not occur. Also in the body of the report the Committee notes its conern at the delay in upgrading kitchen and mess facilities. To this I can say only that overall budgetary considerations largely determine priorities and thus the timing of commencement of individual proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally the Committee has commended the efforts of those who have developed and maintained the Armoured Corps Museum. It has also recommended that the Department of Defence should, in conjunction with the Australian War Memorial, begin planning for the eventual reconstruction of the museum on a new site at Puckapunyal. Defence is developing its policy towards military museums in the context of the Government's general policy on museums. Buildings suitable for the armoured corps' museum are expected to become available at Puckapunyal after the works proposed there are completed. The estimated cost of the proposal when examined by the Committee was $12m at May 1981 prices. The Committee recommended construction of the work in the reference. If the House agrees to support this motion, detailed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The report I have just tabled deals with the subject of energy in the Australian Capital Territory. Availability and distribution of energy supplies are important and complex issues for governments everywhere and the last decade has seen major shifts in the patterns of usage and availability of certain primary sources of fuel. This has resulted in the growth of conservation movements and the realisation that present energy resources are exhaustible and costly unless attempts are made to examine alternative solutions to present problems and to develop long term strategies for more efficient energy use and distribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Within the Australian Capital Territory there have been numerous disruptions to petrol supplies as a result of industrial disputes. While these short term disruptions have caused inconvenience to local residents, they have also served to indicate long term consequences of such disruptions. It is generally acknowledged that Australia is richly endowed with a range of energy sources. However, the question of access to supplies of petroleum is one which looms large in the future for all Australians, particularly given the dependence on oil of the society of which Canberra is a part. It was against this background of short term disruptions to petrol supplies as well as the long term outlook for the availability of energy that this inquiry was undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> This report is the result of a concentrated period of work by the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. The terms of reference for the inquiry were referred to the Committee in the previous Parliament. The Committee was unable to complete the inquiry in the life of the thirty-first Parliament and requested that the inquiry be referred to the Committee again in the thirty-second Parliament. During the life of the inquiry the Committee received over 60 submissions and held several public hearings in Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. In addition, the Committee held informal discussions with State authorities and conducted several days of inspections and examined several energy research facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> In this report the Committee has paid particular attention to energy conservation since it considers this issue to be of particular importance. A special chapter has also been devoted to the issue of energy research, particularly the suitability of Canberra as a centre for such research. The remaining chapters deal with the terms of reference of the inquiry and recommendations have been made on each of these. One chapter deals with petrol prices as the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) has indicated that he expects the Committee to comment on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the introduction of natural gas in the Australian Capital Territory will lead to a diversion of demand from petroleum to natural gas and that there will also be increases of consumption of energy from alternate sources. However, petroluem will continue to be the main source of energy in the immediate future. In regard to the adequacy of petroleum delivery, distribution and storage in the Australian Capital Territory, the Committee concludes that there is around fifteen days' supply of petrol for private requirements and three weeks for Government requirements. In addition, the storage capacity for bus networks is around two months' supply. </PARA>
<PARA> To cover disruptions to supplies, the Committee has recommended that steps be taken to redraft the Fuels Control Ordinance and that the fuels use advisory committee be formally established. Supply of petrol to the private motorist should be available at the service station and the Committee has recommended that, rather than freeze all fuel stocks during an emergency, only a certain percentage of stock be retained for emergency service. This petrol should be purchased by the authorities or at least compensation should be provided to the service station owner for the costs involved in storing the fuel. Such a procedure would encourage service station operators to obtain and sell petrol rather than placing a complete ban on such sales. During times of emergency the Committee would support a system of rationing fuel to private motorists on the basis of odd and even number plates and the setting of a maximum amount of petrol able to be purchased at any one time. The Committee has also examined the question of petrol prices and the apparent disparity in prices charged for petrol in the Australian Capital Territory and surrounding areas of New South Wales and has recommended that the Minister for the Capital Territory take immediate measures to eliminate the petrol pricing differential between the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes Canberra is ideally placed as an energy research centre and supports reseach currently being carried out by the Australian National University and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation into areas of alternative sources of energy and fuel. The question of energy conservation by means of electric vehicles has been considered in some detail and the Committee has recommended an electric vehicle trial for the Australian Capital Territory. Such a trial was proposed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and endorsed by other organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of energy conservation, the Committee has been informed of the establishment of energy information centres in Sydney and Melbourne as well as a proposed centre in Adelaide. Both the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority and the Australian Gaslight Company have indicated their support for such a centre and the Committee considers its establishment of crucial importance to energy conservation in the Territory. The Committee has considered the question of energy conservation under several headings. It would appear that the main avenue for conservation is in the area of transport. At present, the principal method of transport is the private car and the Committee has suggested that the registration system by revised to encourage cars with smaller engine capacity. The role of the public transport system has been noted, particularly that the level of subsidy to the bus service compares favourably with other capital cities. The encouragement of cycling has also been suggested. The Committee has noted recent improvements to the rail service between Canberra and Sydney and has indicated that priority be given to a feasibility study currently being undertaken on a proposed railway link between Canberra and Gunning. As a greater incentive to encourage rail travel as air fares continue to increase, the Committee recommends that the Government expedite the provision of XPT trains on the Canberra to Sydney link. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the heading of 'Conservation and Housing' the Committee has suggested that residents need to be more aware of steps that can be taken to reduce energy consumption. This could be achieved by the publication of a pamphlet outlining steps that may be taken. As a further measure to increase general awareness about energy conservation in housing the Committee has recommended that annual prizes be awarded for designs which take account of energy conservation criteria. The divided responsiblity for energy conservation in Commonwealth buildings is also commented on in some detail. The Committee recommends the establishment of a special task force to carry out energy audits in government buildings and further recommends that high priority be given to energy efficiency and conservation in the design of Australian Capital Territory school buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> In summing up the conclusions to this report I am conscious of the importance of energy consumption and conservation. Of particular significance is the Committee's proposal to establish an energy information centre which would act as an advisory and promotional body and could play a major role in determining future energy use and availability in the Australian Capital Territory. I believe that it is possible to overcome some of the present shortcomings and adopt a co-ordinated approach to the conservation issues highlighted in the report and that some of the measures proposed in the report can be of direct personal benefit as well as benefiting the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I express my thanks to the staff of the Committee for the dedicated work they put into the report. I also advise the House that the Minister has apologised for not being here when the report was tabled. He has commitments in the Cabinet but he has assured me that he will be giving attention to the report and will be discussing it with the Committee at an early stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I welcome this report by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory into energy and I congratulate the Committee for the excellent report it has produced. Before I make any specific comments on that report, I would like to pay tribute to the work done on this report by the former Chairman of this Committee, the late Senator John Knight. Senator Knight was, in fact, the Chairman of this Committee for the great majority of the time it was deliberating on this subject. I think that special tribute should be paid to him for the contribution he made to this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inquiry reviewed existing sources of energy, the outlook for the future, conservation measures and initiatives which might be taken by the Government in its territorial and municipal role to encourage and facilitate energy conservation measures. The inquiry also provided an assessment of the adequacy of delivery, distribution and storage facilities for petroleum and related products in the Australian Capital Territory. I particularly welcome recommendation No. 6, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the Minister for the Capital Territory take immediate measures to eliminate the petrol pricing differential between the ACT and NSW. </PARA>
<PARA>Last December I presented the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) with a detailed submission recommending that the maximum wholesale and retail price of petrol in the Australian Capital Territory be declared items under the Prices Regulation Ordinance 1949. It has been apparent for some time that Canberra motorists have been paying higher prices for their petrol than their counterparts in Queanbeyan, even though the bulk of the petrol comes from the same Sydney wholesale source and on the same train. </PARA>
<PARA> Both government departments and the oil companies treat the Australian Capital Territory as an integral part of the New South Wales geographical and economic sphere. This was emphasised by the submission of the Department of Transport to the Committee on 12 May 1980 in relation of policy development and future energy supplies. This was also stressed by the oil companies in their submission to the Committee on 30 July 1980 in relation to the marketing and distribution of petroleum products. Yet we still find that Canberra motorists have to pay more for their petrol. It is clearly inconsistent that, for the purpose of Government policy development and commercial marketing and distribution practices, the situation in the Australian Capital Territory is regarded as consistent with that in New South Wales, but that for the purposes of pricing a superficial boundary is drawn which disadvantages Australian Capital Territory consumers. I am glad that the Committee saw the sense of trying to keep the price of petrol in New South Wales in line with that in the Australian Capital Territory. Australian Capital Territory consumers are clearly paying more for petrol than those in other capitals. The submission of the Australian Bureau of Statistics to the Committee on 30 July 1980 indicates a marked price differential which disadvantages Canberra residents. The Department of the Capital Territory, in its submission to the Prices Justification Tribunal inquiry last year into petrol prices, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of competition demanding significant discounting by oil companies, both oil companies and retailers are earning greater margins from Canberra than other cities. </PARA>
<PARA>In my submission to the Minister last December, I estimated that the cost of higher Canberra petrol prices to the person completing an average mileage per year could be as high as $147.50 per year. There has been little change to the pricing differential in Canberra and Queanbeyan petrol sales during this year and Australian Capital Territory consumers continue to subsidise cheaper petrol in the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence was given to the Committee that 73 per cent of the energy consumed in the Australian Capital Territory is derived from petroleum products. Higher petrol prices combined with high usage of petroleum fuels-above the national average-indicate that the Australian Capital Territory consumer is paying dearly for this essential commodity. The cost of transporting petrol to the Australian Capital Territory is frequently given as the reason for the higher prices. But that is not supported by the evidence available, as the petroleum products subsidy scheme ensures that consumers in all rural areas of New South Wales do not pay more than 0.4c per litre of the freight cost. The Committee concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> No evidence was given to the Committee to substantiate a difference in wholesale price between NSW and the ACT. This situation is affecting the viability of some service stations and disadvantaging consumers in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, Canberra motorists should not have to pay higher prices for petrol than motorists in New South Wales. Last December I asked the Minister for the Capital Territory to remedy this inequitable situation as a matter of urgency. The Minister replied to that submission that he could not give a categorical reply until this Committee had brought down its report. We have that report before the parliament today, and we have a clear recommendation from that Committee that the price of petrol in the Australian Capital Territory should be related to that in New South Wales. I hope the Minister will take note of this Committee's recommendation and act on it immediately to rectify this disadvantage to Australian Capital Territory consumers. I have urged for more than 18 months that this action be taken and the parliamentary Committee has now made exactly the same recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the issue of public transport. It is apparent to all of us that in view of the need to conserve energy the long term goal will be to move people from using private vehicles to using public transport. At present, there are few incentives to attract people to use public transport, particularly in the Australian Capital Territory. Intracity transport in Canberra is comprised of an extensive bus network. The Department of the Capital Territory, along with other organisations, has stated that buses are a much more energy efficient mode of transport than private cars. I hope that the Minister for the Capital Territory will take note of the recommendation of the Action for Public Transport group that a special off-peak fare be provided to ensure greater usage of buses in the Australian Capital Territory during that off-peak period, particularly by pensioners and unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to intercity travel, it is apparent that Government policies have driven up air fares beyond the reach of ordinary travellers. Since April, Canberra air fares on the most travelled Canberra-Sydney route have risen by 46 per cent. Needless to say, passenger numbers have dropped dramatically. It is apparent that a fast, efficient rail service is the most effective, energy saving alternative. At present the train journey to Sydney takes up to six hours and is not a viable alternative for most families, business or tourist travellers. I was very pleased to see a recommendation of this Committee that the Government give priority to the feasibility study being undertaken on a possible railway link from Canberra to Gunning and a further recommendation that the Government expedite the provision of an XPT rail service between Canberra and Sydney. I hope the Minister takes immediate action on that recommendation. I commend the report to the Government. Before I conclude I, too, give my thanks to the members and also to the staff of the Committee for this very comprehensive report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to make a number of changes to the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 to bring the Act more up to date. The Bill makes three basic changes. First, pensions now based on Australian Industrial Court and Federal Court of Bankruptcy salaries are to be based on Federal Court of Australia salaries. Secondly, pensions in respect of children of deceased judges, currently based wholly or in part on fixed annual amounts determined in 1968, are to become a percentage of the pension that would have been payable to the deceased judge. Thirdly, judges who are required to retire before serving the 10 year qualifying period will be entitled to pro rata pensions after seven years' service. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of former judges and dependants of former judges are now in receipt of pensions based on the salaries payable to judges of the Australian Industrial Court. The transfer of the jurisdiction of that Court to the Federal Court of Australia has, for all practical purposes, been completed and the plain fact is that the Australian Industrial Court no longer has any real business. Parliament has already provided for the Court to be abolished when there are no judges of the Court holding office. It is not appropriate that pensions should continue to be based on salaries payable to judges of a court that is now virtually obsolete. The Bill provides for pensions based on the salaries payable to judges of the Australian Industrial Court to be based on the salaries payable to judges of the Federal Court of Australia which has taken over the jurisdiction that Court previously exercised. This will also have the effect of restoring, for pension purposes, the relativity that existed until 1977 between judges of the Australian Industrial Court and presidential members of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Provision is similarly made for pensions based on salaries payable to judges of the Federal Court of Bankruptcy to be based on the salaries payable to judges of the Federal Court of Australia which has taken over all new bankruptcy jurisdiction previously exercised by the Federal Court of Bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA> The pensions payable under the Act in respect of the children of deceased judges are based wholly or in part on fixed annual amounts. The amounts were set in 1968 and have not been increased. They are now clearly inadequate. By way of example, the pension payable in respect of a child who is not an orphan is only $208 per annum. Moreover, fixed annual amounts are no longer an appropriate basis for pension entitlements. Accordingly, the Bill provides for increased pensions in respect of the children of a deceased judge based on a percentage of the pension that would have been payable to the judge. </PARA>
<PARA> The Judges' Pension Act provides for a 10 year qualifying period for entitlement to pension. That requirement was introduced at a time when federal judges enjoyed life tenure. As a result of the 1977 Constitution alteration relating to the retirement of judges, a compulsory retiring age now applies to new federal judicial appointments. In the case of the Family Court of Australia, Parliament has fixed 65 years as the retiring age. For the other federal courts the retiring age is 70 years. As the Act now stands, a judge appointed at an age at which he is not able to complete 10 years service is not entitled to any pension at all when he retires on reaching retiring age. It is the Government's view that 10 years should continue to be the normal qualifying period for retirement on full pension but that judges who have served at least seven years and are forced to retire because of the compulsory retiring age requirements should receive a pension entitlement on a pro rata basis. The Bill also updates references to certain former Papua New Guinea judges for whose pensions the Commonwealth is responsible and makes provision for application to be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of certain decisions of the Attorney-General under the Act. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is the first of a package of four Bills that I am introducing today for the purpose of authorising the imposition and collection of a tax on various kinds of fishing activities by foreigners. The others are the Fisheries Agreements (Payments) Bill 1981, the Fisheries Amendment Bill 1981 and the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill imposes a levy on the grant of licences authorising foreign boats to fish in the 200 nautical mile Australian fishing zone or to take sedentary organisms from the Australian continental shelf. since the establishment of the fishing zone on 1 November 1979, the Government has collected amounts in addition to licence fees in accordance with agreements between the Commonwealth and the foreign interests concerned. This Bill does not affect that practice. I shall refer to this in more detail later. The Government's policy is to encourage joint fishing operations between Australian and foreign interests as the preferred method of allowing foreign fishermen to have access to the portion of fish stocks in the AFZ that Australian fishermen do not harvest. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal purpose of this Bill is to enable implementation of an aspect of the new guidelines for joint Australian/foreign fishing arrangements, developed by the Australian Fishing Zone Committee comprising representatives of the fishing industry and State, Northern Territory and Commonwealth governments. Following endorsement by the Australian Fisheries Council in September 1980, I announced the Government's acceptance of the new guidelines. The guidelines provide that, in addition to administrative fees prescribed by regulation under the Fisheries Act, joint venture partners during the period when foreign vessels and crews are utilised might be required to pay access fees which may be reviewed during the course of the project. This provision in the guidelines is designed to cover the initial situation where there is little Australian involvement in the joint venture. As the Australian content is increased the levy could be phased out. Alternatively where considerable benefits are offered the levy would be payable if the benefits do not materialise. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for the assessment of a levy payable in respect of the grant of licences for foreign boats operating under the control of joint fishing arrangements and for the liability of licence holders, who may be Australian residents or companies, for payment of the levy. Other Bills in this package provide for the collection of the levy, and how it may be reduced or waived if other suitable benefits are provided to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill applies not only to licences granted as the result of a joint fishing arrangement. It subjects all licensees of foreign fishing boats to an obligation to pay a tax to be called levy except in two cases. The first case is where the licence is granted under an agreement with a foreign government which specifies that an amount is payable over and above the licence fee. The second case in which levy is not payable under this Bill is where the boats are temporarily imported, and the regulations prescribe them to be exempt. The Government's intention is that the regulations will exempt only those temporarily imported boats that are under the exclusive control of Australians for use in developmental fishing. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of levy that is payable under the Bill will be set out in the regulations. Clause 7 provides that the regulations may set out the amount of levy payable for any boat or class of boats by reference to a wide range of matters relating to the boat or its operations. As I have just mentioned, the amount required to be paid in respect of boats in joint fishing arrangements may be less than the applicable levy as the result of provisions in the Fisheries Amendment Bill or the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Amendment Bill to which I will refer later. Finally, neither this Bill nor any other Bill in the package, applies to fishing operations with Australian boats. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is the second of the four Bills dealing with payments in respect of foreign boats licensed to fish in waters or areas of the continental shelf under Australian jurisdiction. The purpose of the Bill is to provide the Commonwealth with legislative powers to give effect to fisheries agreements entered into with a foreign government, providing for the payment by nationals of the other country of amounts additional to administrative fees payable for the issue of licences. Boats licensed pursuant to a government-to-government agreement are exempt from levy under the Foreign Fishing Boats Levy Bill and any amount required to be paid under the agreement is payable in lieu of levy.</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill has the constitutional character of a taxing Bill and has no other application than in that sense. There are mirror provisions in other Bills to which I will later refer, which have effect if the provisions are held not to deal with the imposition of taxation. This course of legislative action has been taken on legal advice to put the matter beyond doubt. What is not caught by this Bill will be caught by one of the others. The Bill does not of itself provide statutory authority for the Commonwealth to enter into agreements. The Commonwealth does this in the exercise of its executive authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1979 when the Australian fishing zone was established, the Commonwealth has collected an access fee in respect of Japanese tuna longline vessels in accordance with the subsidiary agreements with the Japanese Government. The Bill does not replace provisions of that kind in any past or future agreement. It leaves the two governments free to agree that all or some of the amount becomes payable after the licences are granted. This additional flexibility is of benefit to both parties in negotiating the agreement. The Bill supports this flexibility by providing a power to suspend the licences granted under the agreement while amounts agreed to be paid remain outstanding. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the third of the four Bills dealing with taxation in relation to foreign fishing boats. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the collection of levy payable on the grant of licences under the Fisheries Act 1952, which the Bill amends for the purpose. The Bill also contains provisions to facilitate giving effect to fisheries agreements entered into with foreign governments, to the extent that those provisions do not deal with the imposition of taxation. When moving the second reading of the Foreign Fishing Boats Levy Bill, I referred to the Government's policy of licensing foreign fishing boats to fish in the Australian fishing zone only after entering into formal agreements with the foreign fishing interests seeking the licences. These agreements fall into three general categories, each of which this Bill deals with separately. </PARA>
<PARA> The first category is agreements for the conduct of joint fishing operations. Where a joint fishing company offers benefits to Australia, in consideration of which the Commonwealth has agreed to release the company from additional impost by way of levy, the Bill empowers the Minister to give effect to that agreement. The Government expects that the use of this power will encourage joint fishing companies to create employment for Australians, to invest in facilities on shore in Australia, or to provide other tangible benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The second category of agreements is where Australia agrees with the government of a foreign country to license fishing vessels flying its flag to fish in the AFZ. The Foreign Fishing Boats Levy Bill exempts boats licensed pursuant to such an arrangement from liability to pay the levy. The Fisheries Agreements (Payments) Bill provides legislative authority to give effect to the agreement insofar as it may be held to deal with the imposition of taxation in relation to the agreed amount. The Fisheries Amendment Bill provides for giving effect to the agreement in cases that do not have taxation implications. </PARA>
<PARA> The final category of agreements comprises those which do not fall into either of the previous categories, such as the agreement with the Kaohsiung Commercial Fishing Boat Guild of Taiwan. Foreign boats licensed under agreements in this category will continue to be liable to pay the full amount. The Bill requires the Minister to table agreements of any of these kinds in both Houses of the Parliament within 15 sitting days after entering into them.</PARA>
<PARA> The Fisheries Act which this Bill amends, sets out objectives in section 5B, to which the Minister is to have regard when administering the Act. The Minister exercises his discretionary power to grant or refuse a licence under section 9 of that Act in accordance with those statutory objectives. The Bill will require the Minister to disregard those objectives when granting licences pursuant to agreements. The stage at which the Minister considers the conservation and fisheries management objectives of the Act is when the agreement is being negotiated. It is proposed to insert a new section 9C in the principal Act to provide for collection of levy payable in respect of all foreign fishing boats that have not been exempted under the Foreign Fishing Boats Levy Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed sub-section 9C(2) enables the Minister to make arrangements with people or companies liable to pay the levy, concerning the time and manner of payment of the levy. In such a case, proposed sub-section 9C(10) requires payment in accordance with the arrangement or, where there is no such arrangement, within 30 days of the grant of the licence. By proposed sub-section 9C(6), when the Minister has made an agreement approving a joint fishing arrangement and the company has defaulted on the provision of a promised benefit, the amount of levy that had previously been waived becomes payable. The Minister may then suspend some or all of the licences held by the company in respect of foreign fishing boats. Agreements for joint fishing arrangements will normally refer to the benefits to be provided on a year-by-year basis, in conjunction with the issue of licences. If the company subsequently either pays the levy together with any penalty that has accrued or provides the promised benefit, the Minister is then required, by proposed sub-section 9C(7), to reinstate the suspended licences. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of an agreement in the third category, when levy is not paid by the due date, proposed sub-section 9C(8) empowers the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industry to suspend the licences for the foreign fishing boats concerned. Under the next proposed sub-section he must revoke the suspension when the levy and any penalty is received. Proposed sub-section 9C(11) provides a rate of penalty of 10 per cent for each month the levy remains unpaid after the due date. Penalty ceases to accumulate on the date that the licence would have expired. </PARA>
<PARA> The combined effect of these provisions is that the licensee would commit an offence against the Fisheries Act 1952 if he used the boat for fishing in the AFZ during the suspension and even if the levy were paid during the period of the licence, it and the penalty would remain as money owing to the Commonwealth, recoverable in a court of competent jurisdiction. The intention of these sanctions is that they should serve as much as an incentive to the provision of promised benefits or prompt payment of levy as a punishment for default. Nevertheless, the sanctions will be applied whenever a default occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not appropriate, in the case of an agreement with the government of another country, to make any unpaid amount a debt to the Commonwealth recoverable in a court or to impose any penalty for non-payment. However, the Bill contains provisions for suspension of licences in such a case. To assist in verification of the amount due when levy is assessed in accordance with the size of the boat, clauses 5 and 6 provide a power for an officer to go on board and measure the boat or to obtain the assistance of another person, who would have the powers and rights of an officer while so engaged. It is envisaged that the other person would be a qualified marine surveyor employed by the Commonwealth or a State. Finally, clauses 7 and 8 make a number of formal amendments to the principal Act. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill is the final Bill in the package concerned with taxing foreign boats. In substance, it is identical with the Fisheries Amendment Bill. For that reason, I will not take the time of the House with a recital of its detailed provisions. However, there are several points about which it is appropriate to inform the House in relation to the Bill. Australia's sovereign rights in relation to living sedentary organisms on the Australian continental shelf differ significantly from Australia's sovereign rights and responsibilities for managing the swimming fishery resources of the Australian fishing zone. In particular, Australia is not obliged to allocate to foreigners, any surplus of the allowable catch of sedentary organisms that Australians do not take. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Act 1968 came into force, the Commonwealth policy has consistently been not to license foreign ships. This does not mean that, if Australian fishermen did not harvest the allowable catch of presently known or newly discovered stocks of a sedentary organism, we would not at some future time review the policy to see if there was benefit to be gained for Australia by allowing foreigners to harvest those stocks on terms and conditions determined by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers it appropriate to provide now for collection of the levy in relation to licences that may at some future time be granted for foreign ships to take sedentary organisms. Without the Bill, the Government would be limited in the options available to it in relation to any future proposals it might receive from foreign fishermen seeking permission to harvest sedentary organisms from the continental shelf of Australia or the external Territories on a commercial basis. At present there are no such proposals under consideration. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I spoke last night, I gave a report on a meeting in Adelaide concerning motor vehicle workers and their concern about the report of the Industries Assistance Commission. I said that the House should have information regarding the Adelaide city protest. The report in the Adelaide Advertiser on 23 September dealt with the peaceful march of some 10,000 workers from the vehicle industry. The article stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The march was peaceful and orderly . . . </PARA>
<PARA> But the mood changed when the Minister for Industrial Affairs, Mr Brown, was invited to the microphone on the steps of Parliament House to address them . . . </PARA>

<PARA> They booed, hissed and chanted while Mr Brown doggedly stayed at the microphone trying to make himself heard above the din. </PARA>
<PARA> But after several minutes and a number of tries he gave up. </PARA>
<PARA> However, he insisted later that no-one had done more than the State Government and himself to maintain protection for the car industry and to reject the IAC recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> He said the IAC report would cost at least 10,000 jobs and possibly up to 15,000 in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Milne (Australian Democrats) said the IAC was 'out of touch with what everybody wants in Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA> He said the Democrats would do their best to 'get rid' of the IAC report and he would pass on to his colleagues in the Senate the resolution adopted by the rally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bannon, said: 'We must not let this industry go to the wall. Our first job is to get rid of the IAC and this report and secondly to get rid of Fraser.'. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The resolution carried by the rally said the livelihood of up to 178,000 Australians involved in the motor vehicle industry was at stake. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry was the largest manufacturing employer in South Australia, providing jobs for 17,500 workers directly and thousands more indirectly. </PARA>
<PARA> The adoption of the IAC report, it said, would mean the loss of more than one quarter of the jobs in South Australia manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is relevant to point out that that was an agreement between the Liberal Party, the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party in South Australia on the question of the IAC report and where it should be sent. In my electorate of Hindmarsh I have a large number of relatively small factories. These factories supply the vehicle manufacturing and vehicle spare parts industries. I have signed petitions from 990 employees who work in 14 of those factories in my electorate. These 990 employees have collectively spent 3,806 years in the industry. Along with their employers they were unanimous in calling for the rejection of the IAC report and the Government's decision that will ensure the continuation of the vehicle manufacture and spare parts industry in Australia. I pass these protests to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson), who is sitting at the table, to convey to the appropriate Minister so that the message from my constituents will be received. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget introduced by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) contained an allocation of $22m for the operation of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, not one cent of which is publicly accountable.

<PARA>MR JOHN L. SCOTT, FEDERAL MEMBER FOR HINDMARSH</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Member for Hindmarsh has asked the Prime Minister to reveal whether leading South Australian anti-uranium activists are being bugged by ASIO. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Scott said a leaked copy of ASIO's annual report revealed that there were 58 authorised phone taps by ASIO in October last year. </PARA>
<PARA> He said, 'that report also revealed that ASIO had expanded their activities to surveillance of people involved in anti-uranium activities and unemployment groups. The report says that ''increased attention is being given to these groups''. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Somehow these people are considered by ASIO to be ''subversive'', even though they are exercising their democratic rights to protest about two legitimate community concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> 'In fact, people opposed to uranium mining are in the majority in South Australia, according to several recent opinion polls. Nationally, people are divided on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I have asked the Prime Minister whether ASIO is spying on South Australian anti-uranium activists. I have asked him whether or not ASIO has bugged the ''phones of leading anti-uranium activists, the office of the Campaign Against Nuclear Energy (CANE), and members of the Australian Labor Party's Nuclear Hazards Committee, including the Chairman, Mike Rann.'</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Scott said he was aware that a self-proclaimed ASIO agent based in Adelaide was currently investigating the legal activities of trade unions in South Australia.

This harassment is occurring both in the factory and at home. The agent has pestered a particular unionist demanding that he supply information on minutes, leaflets, notes, and those who move and second various resolutions. I give a warning, as I have publicly, that if this does not stop I will name the agent and any other agent who comes to my notice. This $22m that I have referred to is twice the amount needed to continue the Community Youth Support Scheme. Yet, this Government, in a most callous way, is determined to eliminate the CYSS projects. There is much I can say in support of the CYSS projects, especially those in Hindmarsh. I believe that they do fulfil a need.

<PARA>21 August 1981 The Hon. N. Brown,</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Brown,</PARA>
<PARA>An Open Letter on Youth Unemployment</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter advising that the Government will not accept the Brotherhood's JOBS Scheme proposal for an experimental community work experience program for unemployed young people. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot accept that the reason given for rejection is an adequate response to the high rate of unemployment among young people. Although there has been some improvement in youth unemployment, according to the ABS sample estimates, there are still close to 100 000 unemployed teenagers of whom more than 30 000 are last year's school leavers. </PARA>
<PARA> You said that the Government's objection to the proposal is that it would result in 'reduced private sector initiatives because of the inflationary consequences of financing the budget deficit'. There are ways in which such a project can be funded without an inflationary impact. These include reducing losses incurred through tax avoidance, economising in other areas of expenditure and, if necessary, by a small increase in taxation. We believe the public would accept the latter if there was no alternative, in the interests of reducing unemployment among teenagers. There is also another economic view that the problems of unemployment and inflation preceded large budget deficits and that the deficits are a consequence not a cause of economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Other relevant considerations are-</PARA>
<PARA> United States experience with targetted job creation shows that 'the price tag is much lower that what would be needed to create equivalent employment indirectly by means of tax cuts or general spending increases'. </PARA>
<PARA> That 'short, well designed programs that directly create jobs serve to off-set adverse side-effects of labour market constraints and in doing so increase employment of low wage workers, raise economic output and add to total employment, all with little of no inflationary impact. (Professor Rober Haveman, Creating Jobs: more than a Dead End Street. The Wharton Magazine, Spring 1980. Professor Haveman is Professor of Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.)</PARA>
<PARA> Some 40 per cent of people enter tertiary educational institutions from the workforce after work experience has led them to appreciate the importance of training. Without work experience they are less likely to make this transition. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation of unemployed teenagers is worsened by the Government's failure to increase the junior rate of unemployment benefits from the present level of $36. </PARA>
<PARA> The lengthening duration of unemployment and the observations of people working with unemployed teenagers suggest that there is now a hard core of young people who are in danger of becoming unemployable. There can only be serious social consequences as a result of this trend which is occuring despite EPUY, SYETP, school-to-work transition schemes and allowances. New special programs, especially ones that provide jobs, are needed to check this trend. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Government has rejected this moderate proposal we are obliged to ask what alternative measures you intend to introduce to mitigate the effects of long-term unemployment on some 100,000 Australian teenagers, at a time when most of the community enjoys reasonable living standards and opportunities. We are disappointed at the Government's response and will continue to press vigorously for the introduction of a job creation scheme, or an adequate alternative, for as long as youth unemployment remains at such a high level. </PARA>
<PARA>Junior Unemployment Benefits Rate We deplore the Government's failure to increase the junior rate of unemployment benefit which has remained at $36 for the past seven years. Although the Government has not bothered to find out how many young people are living away from home, it seems that some 20,000 of the 50,000 receiving the junior rate are living independently. It is quite impossible for anyone to live decently on an amount of money which is an incitement to anti-social behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA>CYSS The Brotherhood sees the decision to abruptly terminate the CYSS scheme as indicative of a serious lack of concern and understanding on the part of the Government and your Ministry of the feelings and interests of young unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the limitations imposed by its restrictive guidelines and lack of resources, CYSS provides interests, support, opportunities for service and, in many instances, training for its 60,000 participants. It has helped to keep large numbers of young people within the community and still employable. Australia will be the worse for denying some 600 CYSS Project Officers jobs and the chance to work constructively with young people in the 280 CYSS projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the Australian Bureau of Statistics sample figures of unemployment, which exclude people who have worked for more than one hour a week, show that there are almost 100,000 teenagers unemployed and 30,000 of them are last year's school leavers. The new training places to be provided will not help many of the young people who use CYSS. </PARA>
<PARA> We urge the Government to postpone the decision to terminate CYSS for one year to provide time for a thorough review to improve CYSS or develop alternative programs. </PARA>
<PARA> We trust that as Minister for Youth Affairs as well as Employment you will give earnest consideration to these concerns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. I point out that this letter is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) and is dated 21 August 1981. Of CYSS, it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Brotherhood sees the decision to abruptly terminate the CYSS Scheme as indicative of a serious lack of concern and understanding on the part of the Government and your Ministry of the feelings and interests of young unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Government has received protests from all quarters of Australia, even from its own front benches. Petitions have been lodged by its own Ministers. I hope that the Government will take heed of this concern in the community. It is particularly important that CYSS not only survive but also be given the kind of support that is needed. The support for CYSS in Hindmarsh goes beyond the project officers and those people who attend it. A large public meeting was held in Adelaide recently where the room was filled to overflowing. The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) was on the platform. He indicated his support for CYSS also. A number of resolutions were, in fact, adopted by those public meetings. I took the opportunity to convey those messages directly to the Ministers. That was the desire of the meeting. I sincerely hope that those others who were in attendance did likewise. Support has come also from the Corporation of the town of Hindmarsh and a letter in support of CYSS has been sent to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the revenue figures in this Budget and looking at matters that have been raised in this House over time, the Government could have been in a better position in relation to revenue. This would have allowed it more money for such things as CYSS and various other projects that desperately need finance such as education, health and so on. Budget revenue would have improved if the Government had managed to collect in excess of $1 billion from the major tax avoiders in this country. I compare this Government's failure to implement that kind of action to collect that tax with the studious effort it made to collect $14.6m in 1979-80 from pensioners because of so-called over-payments. A pensioner in my electorate allegedly has been overpaid $5,000. She is repaying it at $1 a week. That dear lady would have to live another 100 years to pay off that debt. People have been thrown into that kind of pauperism. This poor dear will go to her grave with that debt hanging over her head. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1981-82 Budget, which we are debating, reinforces the consistent approach to economic management that the Fraser Government has pursued over the last 5 1/2 years. Year after year that approach has proven successful through the improvement which is evident in a wide range of economic indicators. In turning to comment about specific aspects of the Budget I say this Budget will ensure the retention and further strengthening of the progress that has been made in the light of a less than favourable international economic environment over the next 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Prior to the presentation of this Budget, there were rumours concerning the proposed imposition of a tax on wine. I was very pleased that the strong representations which I was able to make to the Government on this issue were successful and that no wine tax was implemented in the Budget. The continuing exemption of the wine industry from such a tax is fully justified. The wine industry is essentially a primary industry. It is difficult for the industry to make short term adjustment to changes in demand which would be caused by the impact of a tax because of the long lead times required in grape production. I was appalled to hear the Australian Labor Party, through the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), criticise the exemption of wine from sales tax and advocate the implementation of such a tax during the debate on sales tax legislation. At least it is good for the grape growers and wine makers in the Kingston electorate-the Southern Vales area-to know where the Labor Party stands on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to terminate the Community Youth Support Scheme at the end of October has aroused a measure of controversy in the community. This was referred to by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) a few moments ago. The decision to terminate CYSS was based on changed circumstances which have transpired since it was initiated by this Government in 1976. These changed circumstances include the significant improvement in the youth employment situation and the large range of more effective training programs that the Government has implemented since that time. That emphasis on alternative training programs is reflected in this Budget by a 67 per cent increase in funding for those programs. However, I was glad of the assurance of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) that an alternative scheme will be considered if a need is demonstrated following the counselling procedures that have been instituted to attempt to slot CYSS participants into alternative training programs. From my follow-up of those counselling procedures, I believe that thus far, to the limited extent that counselling has taken place, that need has been demonstrated. I believe the Government must have an alternative program in place by the end of October. If that is not possible, I believe the Community Youth Support Scheme should continue until an alternative program can be implemented. In the campaign that has been launched in the community since the Budget to fight for the retention of CYSS there has been the involvement of a large number of people who have not had any previous active involvement in this scheme. I believe the extension of the Community Youth Support Scheme for a further period, if an alternative cannot be placed in operation by the end of October, would give those people the opportunity to place their involvement where their mouths have been over the last few weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe South Australia is worthy of special consideration in this matter. In that State there are several regional employment problems which are a result of the combined effect of structural problems in its regional economy and the fact that for nearly 10 years it had an anti-development, anti-private sector Labor Government in office. The Tonkin Government has valiantly strived to reverse that trend since it came to office two years ago. It is achieving success. But I believe the continuing problems that South Australia faces do warrant special consideration by this Government. As I have said, if there is a clear demonstration by the end of the counselling procedures that the participants in CYSS cannot be slotted into alternative training programs, I believe it is essential that an alternative be provided by that date. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the proud achievement of this Government that home ownership has gone up from 66 per cent of the population in 1976 to 71.6 per cent in 1980. That means that Australia has the highest level of home ownership in the world. Home ownership is an important aspect of the Australian way of life and I believe that it assists social stability. In this Budget the Federal Government has increased its total expenditure on housing by 17 per cent-from $341.1m in 1980-81 to $399m for the current financial year. Within that, the amount allocated for the Home Savings Grants Scheme has increased from $44.6m to $74m, an increase of 66 per cent. Thus in that way the Government has demonstrated its commitment to support housing. </PARA>
<PARA> However, high interest rates remain a major concern for home buyers. The Government has given that problem major priority in this Budget. By budgeting for a large domestic surplus it is reducing the need of the Government to borrow, thereby reducing competition for funds and so reducing pressure on interest rates. This is in marked contrast to what happened when the Labor Party was in office some years ago. On the basis of that past practice and the present economic strategy it advocates, it must be recognised as a party of high spending, high deficits and therefore necessarily high interest rates. In the three years that the Labor Party was in government-from 1972 to 1975-interest rates on bank housing loans increased from 7 3/4 to 11 1/2 per cent. That is in fact a 48 per cent increase in interest rates. In the period of nearly six years that the coalition Government has been in office since then it has effectively restrained the increase in interest rates-so much so that they have increased from 11 1/2 per cent when the Government took office to 12 1/2 per cent currently; that is, an 8.7 per cent increase in the rate of interest compared with a 48 per cent increase when the Labor Party was in government. That is a far superior performance. It ought to be emphasised, of course, that the massive increase in interest rates that occurred when Labor was in office occurred when there was little demand for funds from the business sector because there was no any expansion in business activity due to the way Labor destroyed the economy. The increase in interest rates was due entirely to its profligate spending and the massive deficit that it generated.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly will go down well in Kingston. By contrast, the revival in business activity that has taken place under the coalition Government over the last 6 years has significantly increased the demand for loan funds. I take the corporate sector as one example. The demand there has gone from $973m in 1976-77 to $4,000m in the last financial year-1980-81. Despite that, interest rates have gone up only from 11 1/2 per cent to 12 1/2 per cent. Of course, the reason for that is the much better financial management of the coalition government. The Government has reduced its need for borrowings by eliminating the deficit that it inherited from the Labor Party. The domestic surplus that has been provided for in this Budget aims to reduce further the pressure on interest rate increases. Of course the best thing that the Federal Government can do for home buyers is reduce its demand for loan funds and so reduce the pressure on interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government cannot wave a magic wand and instantaneously reduce interest rates because interest rates simply reflect the balance between the supply of and the demand for money. If the Government seeks artificially to depress interest rates, potential lenders will invest their funds elsewhere and so loans for housing will dry up. If it provides some form of interest rate subsidy, either directly or through a tax concession, the subsidy will have to be paid for by the taxpayers through an increase in some other form of taxation. Also, the intended benefit of a subsidy or tax rebate would flow through and be reflected in higher home prices. So in real terms it would not benefit the home buyer. The strategy which this Government has pursued and which is evident in this Budget does provide the best chance of keeping interest rates down. I was very glad that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) was able to indicate only last week that favourable signs are already evident with regard to the future trends for the interest rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just contrasted what has happened in six years of Liberal Government with the three years when your mob were in charge. The Budget, of course, highlights the dangers to the economy and also to the much improved employment situation of renewed wages pressure. This is, in part, a product of the expansion of the economy and the shortage of certain skills in the labour market. But in large measure it is due to the institutionalised rigidities in our wage fixation system. It is totally incongruous to have large wage increases at a time of unsatisfactorily high unemployment. Militant unionism, combined with entrenched rigidities, ensure that wages always rise and never fall despite unemployment. If demand slackens for goods and services provided by businessmen, they either have to reduce prices to increase sales or accept reduced profits directly or through those reduced sales. Either way their income falls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When there is a slackness in demand for labour it is reasonable for wages to fall to a level which allows many more to be employed. There is no doubt that high wages are a major factor causing unemployment. Of course, the trade unions would not have a bar of such a proposition. This demonstrates that they are concerned only with benefits for their employed members and do not give a damn about those who are unemployed. Far from allowing such an opportunity for job growth to occur, the trade unions continue to seek higher and higher wages. But the improved productivity from more employment at lower wages would soon allow higher wages to eventuate anyway. A much freer operation of market forces with regard to wage levels is desperately required in Australia. It would make a great contribution towards overcoming unemployment. I believe the barriers to its achievement ought to be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget initiates a welcome broadening of the tax base with the application of an increase of 2 1/2 per cent sales tax. This move to a greater reliance on indirect taxation is exactly in accord with the recommendations of the Asprey Taxation Review Committee. Australia has a heavy reliance on income tax as a source of revenue. I am disappointed that the sales tax increases have not been immediately accompanied by income tax reductions. I look forward to them in future budgets. While referring to taxation, let me lay to rest the dishonest claims by the Australian Labor Party that the present Government is the highest taxing, biggest spending government in history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the Labor Party is dishonest. While it may be true in an absolute sense that total spending and total revenue are at the highest levels, it is superficial in the extreme to use that as justification for a charge of big government to be laid against the coalition. The most important factor in considering such a charge is the rate of growth in spending. In six years the Fraser Government has increased spending by a total of 8.2 per cent in real terms. The Labor Party in half that time, in just the three years when it was in office, increased spending in real terms-that is, after allowing for inflation-by a massive 33 per cent. So the figures of comparison are 33 per cent over a three-year period against about 4 per cent over an equivalent three-year period for the coalition government. Such figures demonstrate the utter hypocrisy of charges of big spending that have been levelled at this Government by the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In three years the Labor Party increased revenue from taxation by 24 per cent in real terms. In six years, the Liberals have increased it by 29 per cent. Over twice the time, the figure has increased only a little more than in Labor's shorter era. If one works that on a three-year basis, it is about 15 per cent compared with 24 per cent-a much smaller figure. This is despite the fact that the present Government has needed that extra revenue to make up the gap between spending and revenue that was left in the form of a massive deficit by the previous Labor Government. Despite the massive increases in taxation revenue under Labor, which I referred to a moment ago, its even more massive increases in spending left a massive deficit as a result. That deficit was heading towards--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Mr CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1975 the people showed very clearly that the Government did not meet their needs. It left a deficit approaching $4 billion when it went out of office. With modest increases in revenue, compared with that which transpired during the Labor era, the coalition Government has managed to overcome this massive deficit. It has accompanied that by significant reforms to income tax, such that all are now paying less tax than they would have if the scales of taxation that were in operation under the Labor period had continued. Let there be no doubt that the present Liberal-National Country Party Government is the only one with a legitimate claim to practise small government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the main factors contributing to increased spending despite the restraint of this Government has been the area of welfare and especially its age pension component. In the last decade the population of Australia has increased by 14.8 per cent, but the aged population-that is men over the age of 65 and women over 60-has increased by 30.2 per cent. This aging population is further evidenced by the expected acceleration which will increase the figure by another two-thirds over the next 20 years. Of course, this means an ever higher proportion of our population is becoming dependent on a smaller proportion of the population which is the active income earners and wealth producers. Even more dramatically, as at 30 June this year, there were 1,376,671 age pension recipients; that is 68.9 per cent more than 10 years ago. So, the percentage increase in age pension recipients is more than twice the increase in the aged population over the last 10 years which, in turn, is twice the increase in the population at large. That is why, in real terms, spending on welfare has doubled in the last 10 years. In money terms it has increased by more than seven times over that period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not mind supporting the elderly. We have a very effective policy towards them. Over that period the proportion of the Budget allocated to welfare has increased from 17 1/2 per cent to 27.8 per cent of total Budget expenditure. So there is increasing pressure on government revenue and on the economy to provide these benefits. That raises a serious question as to the nature of pension eligibility. On the one hand people put the argument that the means test should be abolished or significantly eased. This, of course, would result in a large increase in the number of pension recipients and an equally massive increase in spending and, therefore, the need for taxation to pay for it. This argument finds favour with many aged people. The argument against it is the massive tax burden which it would require. On the other hand is the argument in favour of a means test to ensure that pensions are directed to those in real need. The argument raised against this is that it penalises thriftiness and provides a disincentive for people to provide for their future and aged years. There are valid arguments on both sides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given those statistics which I cited a few moments ago with regard to the increase in the proportion of the population of aged people, I believe a continuation of the means test is the only practical option. It is the only way in which we can ensure that the funds that are available are directed in sufficient quantity to those who are in real need. However, I believe that the income test for full pension and fringe benefit eligibility should be eased to take account of inflation over the last decade or so. It is nine years since the $20 limit for a single pensioner and $34 limit for a married pensioner have been increased. I believe the Government should consider one option concerning fringe benefits. Those who are just over the eligibility criteria should be allowed to purchase a fringe benefit card for a fixed amount of money. The arbitrary cut-off point creates certain anomalies in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, this Budget reinforces the consistent approach the Government has adopted over the last five years. It is a clear demonstration of the Government's concern to ensure that Australia's domestic economic environment will remain well placed to cope with the strains which will be placed on it by international economic circumstances. It maximises the opportunity for prosperity in the continuing difficult economic climate. Nothing which has been proposed by the Labor Opposition in this lengthy Budget debate which is now drawing to a close detracts from the Government's achievement or the prospects which this Budget offers. I am certainly not convinced that I should either oppose the Budget or support the amendment. On that basis I support the Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer (Mr Howard) has brought before this House two Appropriation Bills which contain provision for the levying of $40,716m in taxes and charges. I have studied some of the Government's revenue raising proposals. Aspects of these proposals disturb me greatly. The shift of emphasis from direct to indirect taxes is a matter of some concern. I believe that the taxpayer could legitimately be afforded some relief this financial year, not only in the field of income tax but also in the field of sales tax. My views are obviously at odds with those of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that the crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas excise, which was imposed to bring about export parity for domestic products, is expected to bring in $3,440m. That is an increase of 10.7 per cent. This levy grows relentlessly year by year. It is as iniquitous as all other indirect taxes. It hits my constituents much harder because they use more oil products. They do not have the public transport or short distance travel of people in the metropolitan area. The electors of Kalgoorlie are more proportionately disadvantaged than city dwellers. This tax also hits the lowest income earners hardest, notably poor country people who statistically spend almost 10 per cent of their incomes on petrol compared with 2 per cent for those on higher incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has indicated to the House that he intends to increase sales tax substantially. If the Government's policy is implemented total tax receipts will leap by 38.6 per cent from $2,102m last financial year to $2,913m this financial year. I am opposed to these levies. Sales tax is a regressive form of taxation. It is indiscriminate and it imposes an added burden on those who can least afford it. It is a tax that nobody can escape, not the poor, nor the pensioners nor the unemployed. Sales tax particularly discriminates against country people as it is levied as a percentage of the price of goods that pass from the wholesaler to the retailer and a freight component, as well as the production cost, is involved. Residents throughout my electorate have an added penalty imposed on them. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to specifics. The Government intends to increase the sales tax levy by 2 1/2 per cent across the board. Items classed as luxury goods, for example, televisions, radios, stereos, records, cameras, jewellery and cosmetics, will now be taxed at a rate of 30 per cent instead of 27 1/2 per cent. Most other articles are classed in the general category. This, of course, includes motor vehicles and caravans. Tax will now be levied on these items at 17 1/2 per cent rather than the previous rate of 15 per cent. All domestic items such as washing machines, stoves, refrigerators, fans and heaters, blinds and mattresses and kitchen utensils will now be taxed at a rate of 5 per cent rather than 2 1/2 per cent. In addition, the Government proposes a whole new tax levy of 2 1/2 per cent on items that were previously exempt. Books, magazines and newspapers now become taxable. There is a tax on knowledge. That does not surprise me. It is obvious that this Government is interested in keeping the public of this country ignorant and ill-informed. The Government also proposes to tax clothes and footwear as well as drapery, blinds, building materials and soft furnishings for the first time. It is, Mr Deputy Speaker, an incongruous government that raises the price of these items by its tariff protection and quota policies and then increases their price by placing an additional tax on them. </PARA>
<PARA> Once these items become taxable, the amount of tax that is levied on them will start to creep up. When a person tries to build a house and furnish it in the north-west of Western Australia he finds that prices are astronomical. Yet the only thing the Government can think to do is add an additional tax surcharge in the form of sales tax. The Government proposes to clear up certain anomalies. All of a sudden a 17 1/2 per cent tax surcharge is lumped on pet food. Motor oil which was exempt will have a 17 1/2 per cent tax imposed on it. It is not only the private individual who is affected. Many manufacturers and wholesalers will become tax collectors for the Government. This will appreciably add to their costs. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the items that are now taxed it becomes apparent that certain industries in my electorate will be very adversely affected. An example is the mining companies. The Treasurer has now decided that all items used in the construction and operation of railways that do not carry public traffic, that is mining company railways, will be taxed at 17 1/2 per cent. This will inhibit the construction of railway lines and the development of mining in the Pilbara. Many items used in railway construction cost almost as much for transport as they do for the item itself. If a 17 1/2 per cent sales tax levy is imposed it will apply not only to the unit cost but also to the freight cost. On many items the cost escalation will be 35 per cent as a result of the Government's new policy. For example, Mount Newman Mining Company Pty Ltd transports its sleepers from Whyalla in South Australia to the Pilbara. It is now faced with a 35 per cent price hike on those items. I certainly believe that the people of Australia in general and Kalgoorlie in particular should not have to bear the new sales taxes outlined in the Budget. I shall oppose them and all added duties. I was hoping that the Government would lighten the existing sales tax burden. We should have before us legislation aimed at removing the freight component from sales tax or a reclassification to exempt more items from sales tax and reclassify some of the so called luxury items as essential items. Instead, I find myself fighting to prevent a massive new sales tax slug. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to income tax. I see from the Budget Papers that the Treasurer anticipates a rise in income tax of about 19 per cent from $17,543m to $20,860m. The Government has put an end to income tax relief through a scheme of tax indexation. Be that as it may, I believe that some income tax relief should be provided. I have two specific areas in mind. The first is income tax on workers compensation payments. Currently weekly compensation payments made to the victims of industrial caused disease are classed as income and as such are taxable. Lump sum payments are not taxable. Many miners in Kalgoorlie who suffer from pneumoconiosis are penalised by this anomaly. I call on the Government to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to provide that such payments be exempt from income tax. I ask honourable members how they can justify that if a man breaks an arm and gets a tax free payment it is a tax free recognition of a capital loss; however, if a man breaks his lungs by working in dusty and dangerous conditions and breathing silicon dust he gets a weekly compensation payment, not because he wants it that way but because the Act is written that way and he has no alternative. He must pay tax because he receives a weekly payment. The Treasurer knows the details because I have brought them to his attention. His neglect in this area is testimony to his general indifference to the plight of the needy in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Great hopes were held out for a significant improvement in the level of zone allowances, particularly by the Western Australian Liberal Government and assorted Liberal politicians. Federal and State inquiries were set up with much fanfare. Committees travelled throughout the length and breadth of the country receiving submissions. The electors have, however, once again been betrayed. The adjustments to the zone allowance contained in the Budget before us are paltry and totally inadequate. The Treasurer has mightily laboured and brought forth a lemon. The current benefits paid to offset the extra costs incurred and disabilities suffered in living in the remote areas could hardly be described as generous. People on low incomes, that is pensioners or those who earn below the taxable limit, receive nothing. Taxpayers in zone A receive a rebate of $216 plus a sum equal to 25 per cent of the dependent rebate. In zone B the taxpayer receives a rebate of $36 plus 4 per cent of the rebate in respect of that area. Thus, a single person living in zone A gets a flat rebate of $216 while a single person in zone B gets $36. </PARA>
<PARA> What is needed, therefore, is a significant increase in the basic allowance, an increase in the dependant component, and an easing of the conditions of eligibility. Without this the whole benefit might as well be abolished. At the moment, it is not fulfilling the function for which it was designed. The function of the allowance is to act as an inducement to encourage people to live in isolated areas. It should also provide compensation for the disadvantages of living in remote areas caused by climate, harsh environment and isolation. To some extent, the zone allowance could also be seen as a compensation for taxation paid on district allowances. In many cases it is necessary to encourage people to live in isolated areas in order to develop our resources. Development projects within my electorate may indeed be hampered if more realistic zone allowances are not devised. </PARA>
<PARA> For all who favour decentralisation of population and industry away from the State capitals, recent trends are disturbing. Some 5.9 per cent of the nation's population was living in the remote areas of the continent when the zone concession was first provided in 1945-46. This represented 1.6 per cent in zone A and 4.3 per cent in zone B. A substantially smaller percentage is living in those areas today. Common justice requires that we maintain realistic zone allowances. The amount of tax levied on disadvantaged groups should be less than the norm. Clearly, people who live in remote areas are disadvantaged. Their cost of living is significantly higher. Food costs for people who live in my electorate are between 10 per cent and 40 per cent higher than Perth food prices. Housing and insurance is a lot more expensive in remote areas, particularly in the cyclone affected areas of north-west Western Australia. It costs parents who live in remote areas thousands of dollars each year to board their children in Perth or major regional centres for both secondary and post-secondary education. The high cost of freight and petrol imposes an added burden on isolated residents. </PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable members have pointed to the fact that significantly higher wages and district allowances are already paid to offset the disabilities suffered by such residents. I concede that the mining industry, in general, offers its employees good conditions. But by far the greatest percentage of workers-72 per cent in zone A and 86 per cent in zone B-are employed in other industries. In most instances the latter are employed under the same award and conditions as workers elsewhere in the State and are paid a district allowance which is taxed and, as such, does not compensate for the increased costs. A number of employees, particularly in the rural industries, are not paid district allowances. There are also a considerable number of self-employed people in these areas. In my electorate 6 per cent of workers in zone A and 22 per cent in zone B are self-employed. They do not have the advantage of receiving district allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> How has the Government responded to the challenge to change a token effect into a policy that will have some real impact? It has not. We still have a policy of tokenism. People on low incomes-that is, pensioners and those who earn below the taxable limit-continue to receive no benefit. The single taxpayer receives the same as before. There is some slight improvement in the lot of the person with a family. A taxpayer who lives in zone A now gets a base amount of $216, plus 50 per cent of the rebate in respect of dependants. A taxpayer who lives in zone B now gets a base amount of $36, plus 20 per cent of the rebate in respect of dependants. A special zone allowance will now be paid to taxpayers who reside more than 250 kilometres from a population centre of 2,500 people or more. This new rate of $750, plus the zone A or zone B dependant rebate according to locality, is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, over 70 per cent of my electors who live in zone A or B will not benefit from the provision at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, unfortunately, not only has failed to increase zone allowances but also has introduced some new regressive features. I refer to the proposal that urban areas, with a population in excess of 25,000 in Zone A will drop into zone B, and those in Zone B will be excluded from any benefit. Although this provision will not immediately affect any centre in my electorate, it could well affect Kalgoorlie-Boulder in a few years time. The sword now hangs over our heads. I will not remain silent while the Government just slips this new measure through. </PARA>
<PARA> I call on the Government to reconsider its zone allowance policy as outlined in this Budget. I will now outline some recommendations. Firstly, the Government should increase the basic zone rebate to $560 for single taxpayers in zone A and $448 for single taxpayers in zone B. Secondly, it should increase allowances for taxpayers with dependants to a level of $560, plus 75 per cent of the rebate in respect of dependants for zone A residents, and $448, plus 75 per cent of the rebate in respect of dependants, for residents in zone B. Thirdly, it should ensure that those who receive no benefit from the current rebate system because they have an income below the taxable limit are paid a cash benefit after lodging a taxation return. Fourthly, the Government should remove the new clauses that reduce or remove the zone allowance benefits for large rural centres. If this Government adheres to its stated policy it does so in the face of public opinion. It ignores the opinions conveyed to the Government inquiry by 19 shires in my electorate. It ignores the opinion of progress associations, party branches, unions, chambers of commerce and numerous other community groups, not to mention individual citizens. It ignores also rural Australia. Total outlays in 1981-82 are estimated to be in the order of $40,862m. </PARA>
<PARA> One small item fails to appear in this year's Budget allocation. Out of a record expenditure of $40,862m there is no allocation for the Community Youth Support Scheme. This Scheme cost us a mere $13.8m last year. The Community Youth Support Scheme has established a line of support between the young unemployed and the rest of the community. Many citizens have taken an active and supportive role in local CYSS communities. Young people who are unemployed have been given basic skills that will at least put them in the race for available jobs. More importantly, they receive moral support and encouragement. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the much touted Government alternatives, there is no alternative for many young people in my electorate. Their geographic isolation will put them beyond the reach of new forms of assistance. Some of the so-called training schemes offered as alternatives to CYSS are next to useless. Many young people who have taken part in a 17 or 34 week subsidised employment scheme have been given menial labouring tasks for the subsidised period and then have been retrenched. I fully support the project officers national campaign to save CYSS. I deplore the cheap sensationalism of the Western Australia Government in trying to make political capital out of the current situation. It announced, in a blaze of publicity, that it would save CYSS in Perth. With its offer to find one small project it misled many people into thinking that it was taking some more substantial action to save the scheme in the metropolitan area. As I understand it, in Perth CYSS will be funded by the Young Men's Christian Association. This is a great effort for this organisation but it offers little in terms of real need. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now return to some of the aspects of the sales tax legislation. I must refer to one defect in the current Act. Section 135A of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> Motor vehicles (and parts therefor) for use in the transportation to and from gainful employment of a person in respect of whom the Director-General of Social Services, or an officer appointed by him for the purpose, has certified that he has lost the use of one or both legs to such an extent that he is permanently unable to use public transport, not being goods for sale. </PARA>
<PARA>This section is overly restrictive. Only people who have lost the use of one or both legs to the extent that they are unable to use public transport are eligible for benefits. This excludes many handicapped people who justly deserve some concession. The current section also limits sales tax exemptions to vehicles used to transport handicapped people to or from gainful employment. Thus people who have had an accident or are incapacitated in some other way and are attending a hospital for therapy sessions receive no consideration. Many people who are incapacited and on sickness benefit remain isolated in the suburbs with meagre public transport. Making it easier for these people to purchase a car could make all the difference to their lives. Handicapped people need new cars, not worn out second hand cars that will break down. </PARA>
<PARA> Many disabled people who are now out of a job could gain employment if they had their own transport. They are in a catch-22 situation. Often they cannot apply for jobs because of a lack of suitable transport. As they are unemployed they cannot afford to purchase a car. Therefore they cannot apply for many jobs. On the other side of the coin, we have the situation of the gent from Dalkeith who regularly purchases a new Mercedes Benz car sales tax free so that he can drive, or be driven, to his bank. He is classified as a self-employed investor. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should make some effort to aid the disabled in this the International Year of Disabled Persons. It has done precious little so far. I suggest that the exemption provided under item 135A should read:</PARA>
<PARA> For motor vehicles (and parts therefor) for use as personal transportation and not for sale by persons in respect of whom the Director-General of Social Services, or an officer appointed by him for that purpose, has certified those persons so permanently physically or mentally handicapped as to require the use of private transport. </PARA>
<PARA>In the 30 seconds I have left, I point out to the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman) that, in line with current Liberal Party practice, it was my belief that there should be a tax on wine. I am outraged at the very high tax on beer. I think it is only equitable that wine should bear some of that tax. It obviously was not the view of the Labor Party and, in this instance, I feel that the Government and the Labor Party was wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without spending a lot of time on any one aspect, I make brief mention of the speech by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and, in particular, their references to the Community Youth Support Scheme. The worst thing that the Government has done in recent times was to take advice from Labor politicians. I shall quote Mr Mick Young, the previous Labor spokesman on Employment and Youth Affairs. In his book, I want to Work, in relation to the CYSS he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Day after day since the Budget Speech was delivered, members of the Australian Labor Party have led marches and banged the drums on the CYSS program saying: 'It must be saved'. Yet prior to the Budget debate it was the Labor politicians who were actively undermining CYSS. I speak as the founding president of the program in my former electorate of Griffith and the patron of the CYSS program called Woodridge Ways in my electorate of Fadden. I know what CYSS is all about. I say this to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) at the table, the former Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs-and I hope the Minister can believe and understand exactly what I am saying: my view is that whilst many CYSS programs throughout Australia were a flop-I know of one in Sydney that consisted of a dark room, a coffee machine and two pin ball machines-across the country there have been many worthwhile CYSS programs. I realise that the Government is a very responsive government, but on the other hand--</PARA>

But it is my plea-I do not care what it is called or what name it is given-that once we remove the warts and wrinkles some program should be continued or developed to allow the type of young people who do not fit into the existing programs to be given an opportunity for training and assistance. I already know that the Government by this Budget-the previous speaker did not mention this; perhaps he did not read the figures-is allocating $203m simply for manpower training in this country. Of that $203m, 70 per cent is going to youth training. That is approximately $154m out of a total of $203m.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> We have heard a lot about the subject of sales tax. I suppose no one would have received any more letters than I on the subject. John Citizen is exercising his democratic right to complain and to express an opposite view. Since the Budget was introduced on 18 August, one has had at least a month to consider seriously the ramifications of what is being done. It is very easy to stand up in this Parliament, kick the Budget and say: 'No, it is not on. We would be better without it'. I would rather have no tax at all. I receive $30,000-odd in salary, but by the time I get it home it is less than $20,000. I wonder where the other $10,000 has gone. I am representative of every member of Parliament and every working man and woman in this country. I could be the most popular man in the world by saying: 'Abolish all tax'. Now let us see what we have achieved as a nation. We have almost reached a stage at which we have killed or are killing incentive in the work force by the growing plundering raids that we make on the working man's pay packet.

If ever there was a party that kicked up government involvement and government expenditure it was the Whitlam Government, and it went out in a screaming heap for that. This Government will not follow the path which the previous Government followed. Our reliance on the pay packet as a source of income for government expenditure is growing and growing. The Labor Party even appointed the Asprey Taxation Review Committee, which later stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . the weight of taxation should be shifted towards the taxation of goods and services, and away from the taxation of income. </PARA>
<PARA>When we look at Australia's position compared with the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development we see that in 1978, the last year for which all necessary information is available for comparative purposes, total tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product averaged 35.8 per cent for the 22 countries. The Australian figure at that time was 29 per cent. The averages in 16 of the 22 countries were higher than in Australia. Although Australian personal income taxes are lower than in other OECD countries, Australia collects more of its total revenue from personal income taxes than other OECD countries.

Balancing this, Australia ranked ninth out of 22 in terms of reliance on all types of consumption tax but, in the area of sales tax and excise, 20 of the 22 member countries derived more expenditure from those sources than did Australia. Besides that, the number of items to which sales tax is applied has been limited. Over the last quarter century the nation's reliance upon the worker's pay packet has grown appreciably. I referred before to what the Whitlam Government-appointed Asprey Committee later suggested. I used that prized quote. I believe that expenditure in this country never really will go down and, whilst there remains a continuing upward trend, the Government still has to raise revenue.

I respectfully suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), who is at the table, that consideration be given to compensating these people who simply cannot avoid the extra costs which will be incurred under the sales tax legislation. Perhaps it could be done through an increase in the family allowance for all children as a compensatory measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I single out another area-that of home building. We all know that, depending on the style of the home young people plan to build or buy, the increase in cost brought about by the sales tax legislation will be anything from $300 to $400 upwards. There is a limitation, in the Homes Savings Grant Scheme, on the value of the home that attracts the full grant. I respectfully suggest that, to offset the cost increases in the building industry which this tax will bring about, those first home owners become entitled to a larger payment. On the other hand, I have no regret for those people who are gathering homes like chestnuts; the very wealthy who through tax avoidance schemes-I am not saying that this applies to all people who own a number of homes-are avoiding their obligations. I am talking about the smart-Alicks who are advocating tax avoidance and avoiding their obligations. I cannot see why we should have a system in this country whereby those people can go right through from A to Z scot-free and even at the end, if they use their heads properly, pick up a tidy sum because a capital gains tax is not applied if a property is owned for X years and it can be shown somehow that it was not bought simply for quick profit purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, it is true that a lot of people are getting away with not meeting their obligations in terms of tax. However, I think any Labor politician in this House who is fair-minded would acknowledge that our worthy Treasurer (Mr Howard) almost has the nickname of 'the ferret' because of his actions in this regard. There has been no man in this nation's history who has been more determined to crack down on those smarmy, slimey people who make a living simply out of trying to teach people how to get out of their tax obligations than our John Howard. In my time in this Parliament-it goes back 15 years-there has never been a Treasurer who has been more dedicated to this cause. There has never been a Treasurer who has brought in more legislation on this matter. There has never been a Treasurer who has been more determined to shut the door on these smart-Alicks. Let us leave the matter at that. One of the problems with this chamber is that every time someone makes a constructive comment or observation, Opposition members say: 'If you were to collect the tax avoidance money we would not need to take these measures'. That is a very hollow and unfair observation because in their own hearts they know that John Howard, the ferret, is doing a full job in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that I have a maximum of only six minutes left to me in which to speak so I turn now to another aspect of the plundering of the public purse. Out of this Budget of $40,000m, I notice an amount in excess of $11,000m allocated to social security. I personally subscribe to supporting those in this lucky nation of ours who are in need of care, supporting the aged and supporting those who are not as fortunate as the majority of the population. But I am rather deeply concerned about a trend that is sweeping this nation, a trend which I believe was started by the Labor Party, a trend which has not been stopped by my party, which has been in government for the last six years. I do not wish to moralise because what a person does with his or her body is not my business. However, it becomes my business when the working men and working women of my electorate, of my State and of this nation have to pick up the bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I will relate a story to the House of an experience I was confronted with during the recent recess. It perhaps exemplifies the paralysis of the nation in a particular area and explains and accounts for some of the growth of expenditure in the area of social security. Last week a young lady-for the sake of the story I will call her Marjorie-came to me and complained about the level of social security paid to a mother with two children. She explained, and properly so, that her pension payment represented about $199 per fortnight. Nobody in this House would find it easy to live on that amount of money. I said to Marjorie: 'Do you mind if I am personal?' She said: 'No, not at all'. I said: 'I only want to ask questions'. I said: 'You have two children. One is five and the other is one. Are you married?' She said: 'No, I have not married'. I said: 'Have you had any support from the fathers of the children or is it the father?' She said: 'One father'. I said: 'No support?' She said: 'Never a cent'. I said: 'You told me that one of your children is five and the other is one. Please tell me, having gone through that experience, how you could have fallen for the two-card trick?' She said: 'I thought of that, but I always wanted two children, so I thought it was best to go out and have them by the same man rather than different men'. That is fair enough. That is her decision. But the point is that she was in my office complaining about the level of support for her. She was in a Housing Commission home which would be worth $54.50 a week in rent if it were put on the market and utilised by a normal income earning family and she is paying only $19.50 a week. So there we have a $35 subsidy from the Government. On top of that, she has her benefits of about $99.50 a week, say. So we are up to about $135. On top of that, she has her entitlements to health care, which are worth about another $10 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> So Marjorie and her two children are receiving support from the Government to the extent of $145 a week. Some people may say: 'That is not much. You should give her more'. The point I am making is that, whilst I acknowledge Marjorie's right to do with her body what she wants, I also believe she has an obligation not only to those children but also to the working men and women of this country. I checked with the Taxation Office and found that to support Marjorie we would need the total income tax from one single man earning $225 a week gross, one married man earning about $260 a week gross and a sole parent with one child earning about $250 a week gross. The entire income tax contribution that those three people will pay will go to supporting Marjorie and her two children. I am not knocking motherhood. I am knocking an attitude in this country that we can do anything, we can do what we like, and then knock on a door and say: 'I want to be supported'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the remaining moments available to me I express my personal view that if anything is likely to destroy Australia it is the continued, unfettered growth of this attitude. I really believe that there is just so much that this country can carry. The country is already carrying a fair share. We have an aging population. We have to face up to the fact that there will be fewer people to work to provide for a greater pecentage of older people. If we simply keep going like this, oh how the lucky country will crumble. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Budget richly deserves to be condemned on any number of grounds but principally for its inhumanity and its dishonesty. The Australian people should never forget that this is the Government and this is the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who came in six years ago on a promise of honesty. This is what the present Prime Minister had to say on the subject of honesty on 15 November 1975:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can promise you honesty and integrity in government. I'd like to have a government which people can trust. </PARA>
<PARA>Less than a year after its return to office this Government has demonstrated its dishonesty and its lack of integrity with brutal clarity. It is a government that cannot be trusted. Its deceit and inhumanity are there for all to see, not just in this Budget, not just in the decisions of the razor gang, not just in the latest-the fifth-health scheme, but also in a whole range of sins of omission and commission and, as events this week have shown, in day to day administration. This is a government that trades on deceit. Where, in the Government's policy speech last year, did it tell the people of Australia that interest rates would go up yet again, that the Community Youth Support Scheme would go, that public health would be butchered and that the sales tax slug was on the way? When did the Government tell the people? Where is its mandate for these measures? The answer is that the Government did not tell the people at all and consequently it has no mandate for those measures. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a government that skates from one election to the next. It skates on the short term currency of rubbery promises that bounce well and truly once the election is out of the way. This is a Budget which is particularly silent on the important matter of assistance to home seekers and to home buyers. The silence of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Prime Minister on this matter is deafening. Of course, it was not always so. In fact, the Prime Minister and others in this Government are always most vocal on the question of interest rates before an election. This is what the Prime Minister had to say about interest rates on 21 November 1977:</PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates have begun to fall and they will keep on falling. </PARA>
<PARA>On 6 December 1977 the Prime Minister, again on interest rates, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Once the election is over, we will start to move to the consummation of a two per cent reduction in interest rates-and that means about $500 a year for someone on an average home loan. </PARA>
<PARA>The present Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) went one better in that election campaign. Speaking in Orange in the electorate of Calare just before the election in December 1977 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> If interest rates don't fall by two per cent I'll eat my hat. </PARA>
<PARA>At that time those were the promises on interest rates. What was the post-election reality? The reality is that since that time we have had six rises in interest rates. The impact on families buying or seeking to buy homes has been catastrophic. We all know of instances of people battling on with less and less, trying to pay off homes that they cannot afford to furnish, depending more and more on overtime, looking for a second family income, chasing part time work to make ends meet and to pay off a home. Many people are giving up and selling out in their struggle to pursue the great Australian dream of owning the family home. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder that under these circumstances, these rises in interest rates under this Government, foreclosures on home loans have increased so much? In 1973 one in 950 mortgages was foreclosed. In 1979 the rate was up to one in 70, an increase of over 13 times in foreclosures. Is it any wonder that under this Government it is becoming harder and harder for home seekers to get a loan? In fact, it has become so hard that sterilisation has actually become an advantage for home seekers. I refer to the National Times of 9 August to an article on page 3 headed 'The Unkindest Cut of All'. The first paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian housing market has now reached the stage where sterilisation is an advantage in getting a loan. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr FREE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true. The article continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A National Times survey has found that finance companies are favouring married couples where the woman is prepared to be sterilised. </PARA>
<PARA>What a situation we have reached when finance companies insist on a guarantee of that second income through means such as this in order to enhance people's chances of getting a loan. The Treasurer's line now on interest rates is two-pronged. The first defence of the Treasurer has been to deny responsibility in this matter and to point to market forces determining interest rates. In fact, he has adopted the defence that perhaps there is some virtue in higher interest rates because they mean more money invested and, therefore, more money for lending. Well, there are two obvious replies to the Treasurer's line on interest rates. The first one, which is utterly obvious, of course, is that really, if the Government has no intention of controlling interest rates even up to the point of denying that it can control them, then why, before an election, does it pretend that it can? Why does the Government raise expectations in this way? I respond to the Treasurer's second line of defence that higher interest rates mean more money for lending. If we have moved from a position where there is only enough money for one in four applicants to a new position where money is so expensive that only one in four applicants can afford it anyway, then where is the advantage in that situation?</PARA>
<PARA> Many people are still waiting for the Deputy Prime Minister to eat his hat. What a gastronomic spectacular that would be. I guess that under the present circumstances a hat might be less suspect fare than some of the dead horses that have been flogged around this country recently. Perhaps a hamburger might in these circumstances be preferable to a horseburger. As entertaining as that spectacle might be, the people of Australia would prefer, rather than see the Deputy Prime Minister eat his hat, to see action on the housing front. They would rather see cheaper money for housing. They would rather see tax assistance on interest repayments. Under this Government they will be waiting forever. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that average families are far worse off after this Budget and those measures which preceded it, in relation to not only housing costs but also health charges. We have certainly come a long way since 27 November 1975 when the Prime Minister told the people of this country: 'We will maintain Medibank'. There was no fine print in that statement, just four words: 'We will maintain Medibank'. This year, instead, we have seen the final destruction of Medibank, another Liberal promise dishonoured, another pre-election cheque that bounced. The Government's latest medi-muddle has spread confusion throughout the community. It has spread insecurity. It has meant that people are paying more and more for less and less. This downhill trend in family living standards will be accelerated by the taxation measures contained in this Budget. Income from pay-as-you-earn taxation will go up over 22 per cent this year. Tax indexation has gone. Of course, a host of new sales taxes have been introduced without the promised offsetting cuts in income tax.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what some of the spokesmen for this Government have said in the past on questions of taxation. We find that this Government on taxation, as in so many other areas, is a government that cannot be trusted. The Prime Minister on 27 November 1975 on the subject of taxation said:</PARA>
<PARA> We will fully index personal income tax for inflation over three years. We will reduce the tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA>In his 1977 policy speech two years later, again on the taxation question, the present Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have ended the big tax rip-off. </PARA>
<PARA>Again in that election campaign, on 1 November 1977, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> From 1 February 1978 further tax cuts will come in for every Australian wage and salary earner . . . the Government will bring taxes down further-not increase them. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the fistful of dollars election. On that promise the Government ran full page newspaper advertisements in the metropolitan Press featuring that fistful of dollars. The message was quite brutal and quite clear: 'You give us votes, we will give you money'. How long did the promise last? That was the pre-election rhetoric. What was the reality? Full indexation was never introduced. For a time we had part indexation, but then even that was whipped away. Instead of a lower tax rate we have had a massive increase in the tax take. As I mentioned earlier, pay-as-you-earn tax collections are up by over 22 per cent this year, more than double the expected inflation rate. Finally-surprise, surprise-after the earlier promise of this Government, we have had a host of new sales tax measures, a further blow to family incomes and family living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> I have listened with interest to the Treasurer twisting and turning under questioning about the extent of the impact of the new sales tax measures on families. Really it seems to me to be quite a simple matter to calculate the effect of the new sales tax measures on family living standards. If we look at the Budget Papers we will find that the income from the new sales tax measures contained in this Budget is quite easy to add up. First of all, by increasing the existing rates the Government will raise an extra $420m a year. From the new 2 1/2 per cent rate it will raise an additional $330m a year. From the correction of anomalies provision it will raise an additional $142m a year. The total take from the new measures will add up to $892m a year. The estimated working population in 1981 is 4.72 million people. When one divides the first figure by the second figure, using an electronic calculator, which, of course, is more expensive under these sales tax provisions now, we find that the additional sales tax to be paid by each person each year amounts to $60.60, or $1.17 a week. The average family of three people will be paying an additional $3.50 a week because of the new sales tax measures. However, a young family of, say, two children and their parents will pay an additional $4.68 a week. That is without taking into account the fact that young families will be spending more on major household goods and in looking after the needs of the children. As the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) said a short time ago, in attending to the needs of children going to school by buying expensive school shoes and so on, it is obvious that the young growing families will be bearing the brunt of the sales tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA> The most objectionable feature of these sales tax measures is that they hit not luxury items but necessities. There is a doubling of sales tax on furniture, white goods and floor coverings. Shoes and clothing have been hit. Books and newspapers have been taxed-a tax on knowledge and a tax on the free exchange of information. As the executive director of the Library Association of Australia said earlier this month, a tax on books is not the act of a civilised, developed country. It is a tax also on safety. We note from the Budget Papers that sales tax on seat belts will go up from nothing to 17 1/2 per cent. There are few items untouched. They include food, medicine and wine, but not packaging. I note with some amusement down towards the bottom of one of the Schedules that also untouched are certain parts of toilet pans. I have some sympathy with the newspaper correspondent who wondered whether this last item reflected the Government's own assessment of its Budget or an anticipation of public reaction to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also mention, as has almost every speaker in this debate, the destruction of the Community Youth Support Scheme in this Budget. This is a scheme which has assisted some 200,000 young people. It has operated some 276 projects and has harnessed the skills and dedication of some 2,000 instructors, tutors and project officers. It is a low cost scheme and a very successful scheme. The success of the scheme was admitted in the annual report of the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs for the year 1979-80. In that report the Department said:</PARA>
<PARA> CYSS has expanded rapidly since its inception and a review and rationalisation of the scheme during the 1979-80 financial year consolidated its progress and provided a sound base on which future community based projects can be developed. </PARA>
<PARA>The report said that the progress had been consolidated and that the scheme provided a sound base. Yet this is the scheme that is to end on 31 October. The 117,000 teenagers currently unemployed, the school leavers, the staff of the scheme and the local communities are all entitled to ask why the scheme has been axed and where the Government expects them to go from here. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a Budget which is also largely silent on the needs of the underprivileged. There is no doubt that under this Government the ranks of the poor have continued to swell. In fact in the last six years there has been a massive redistribution of income away from families, away from the needy and away from the desperately poor. As Graham Williams pointed out in a series of excellent articles in the Sydney Morning Herald last month, the Government was saved some $800m by failing to index a whole range of welfare benefits. About $180m has been saved by not indexing the $36 unemployment benefit for those aged under 18. Some $210m has been saved by not indexing the unemployment benefit for single adults. The new increased rate this year will be $11.60 a week behind the base rate for all pensioners. About $145m has been saved by not indexing the weekly allowance for each dependent child of a pensioner. If these allowances had been indexed, they would be worth $14.40 a week instead of $10. The family allowance was increased for third and subsequent children in this Budget, but if it had been indexed for the children of the 25 per cent of poorest families, the Government would have paid out $170m more than it has. The result of these cuts in real income to large groups of the poor, as well as rising rentals, has led to a phenomenal demand for emergency aid. Graham Williams quotes in his article one welfare worker. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> No one is able to cope with the huge growth in poverty. The poor are at their wits end trying to get clothes and a little cash to tide them over. It's really frightening to see how bad things are. </PARA>
<PARA>Welfare agencies, including State agencies, now give an estimated $60m a year in emergency aid to the poor, but the Federal Government in six years has given the private agencies only $500,000 to assist. There is a whole range of other indicators showing that poverty in this country under this Government is intensifying. Rents for the poor are rising. There is a huge increase in the number of people seeking public housing and, of course, there have been major cut-backs in Federal programs. These cuts all show, as Graham Williams said in his article and as Professor Ronald Henderson told the Sydney Morning Herald, that those in need are suffering the most under the Fraser Government. That is the situation with the poor and needy in this country this year. But what was the promise? This is what the Prime Minister had to say on 12 December 1975:</PARA>
<PARA> We will protect those in need of help. Medibank, pensions, education and social welfare will all be strengthened by honest responsible government. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget is part of the deceitful cycle of action of this Liberal Government. Stage one in the cycle is before the election when the people are promised anything-honesty, lower taxes, prosperity, a fistful of dollars-lead them on. That was the last slogan-'Lead on, Liberal'. I point out to honourable members opposite that the dictionary definition of 'lead on' is to entice into going further than was intended, as in 'lead up the garden path'. That is exactly what stage one of the Liberal action cycle is-to lead people on, to promise anything before an election. </PARA>
<PARA> Stage two after the elections is the bitter reality. This is when the promises are dishonoured. This is when the pre-election promises bounce. The result is a confused and a disillusioned community, a community that does not know where it stands on a whole range of matters. It does not know where it stands on social welfare. It does not know where it stands on interest rates, health care or taxation. But the one thing that people do know is where they stand in respect of promises and performances of this Government. They reject this Budget because they can see it for what it is. It is a recipe for higher inflation, for higher unemployment, for falling living standards and for more misery. Equally they will reject the Government responsible for it at the first opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Central to every Budget brought down by this Government, to every action with significant economic implications, has been our recognition of the critical role of economic policy in creating a favourable environment, for individual initiative and a growing private sector, for effective humanitarian concern and greater assistance for the needy, for balanced economic development throughout Australia and sustained confidence in Australia's future. This Budget highlights the gulf between the Australian economy as it was in 1975 and the Australian economy as it is today, with our international reputation restored, with well-founded projections for growth, higher employment and better wages, and with the enhanced potential for personal income tax reductions which even the Opposition has not failed to perceive within this Budget. When this Government came to office in 1975 inflation was high; it was above world levels; and it was uncontrolled: Unemployment was growing and private sector employment actually shrinking; and confidence was shot to pieces. How different is the picture today, with inflation below world levels, with nearly 300,000 new private sector jobs created in the two years to May, and with very great confidence indeed in this country, as evidenced particularly by the widespread investment in the manufacturing and mining industries that is now taking place. All of this comes from the steady application of responsible economic policies by this Government. It comes particularly, as it will continue to come, from the successive Budgets of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want, first, to say something about this particular Budget's strategy in the context of the Government's overall economic objectives. I shall put it to the House that the virtual elimination of the deficit in this Budget will be seen in years ahead as a landmark in Australia's development, that any claim that this Government is a high spending or a high taxing Government does not stand up, and that expenditure restraint must continue to be a matter of fundamental priority. Secondly, I want to explain to the House the success of the Government's commitment to combining expenditure restraint and economic responsibility, with effective care and concern for the legitimate expectations, the real needs, and the authentic aspirations of the Australian community. I will put it to the House that our programs are effective and progressive, that they identify priorities and balance the total range of human concerns, and that any suggestion that the Government does not care and does not understand, simply flies in the face of the record. </PARA>
<PARA> The strategy of this year's Budget is unmistakable in the virtual elimination of the deficit which has been achieved. The $3.5 billion Budget deficit which the Government inherited from the Labour Government, which would have been even higher without the expenditure reductions immediately made by this Government when it came to office, would now be almost $7.5 billion if we had persisted with deficit financing at the Labor rate of almost five per cent of gross domestic product. The Government has consistently rejected deficit financing as totally inappropriate for Australia's circumstances through the 1970s and into the 19801s, for these circumstances are quite different from those which existed in the 1930's when deficit financing became respectable and, as Keynes himself would unquestionably have recognised. Australia is still paying the price for Labor's irresponsible deficits, for those deficits are still distorting Australia's capital market, and still contributing to excessive interest rates as the loans that had to be raised at the time to fund the deficit are still having to be rolled over and renewed. The Labor deficit was nothing more than a way of making the future pay for the spending schemes of the past, either through inflation, or through higher taxes, or both. Deficit financing encourages expectations that are unreal and it means dishonesty about the real level of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> With the virtual elimination of the deficit in this Budget, we can plan next year's Budget no longer hostage to this element of the Labor Government's mismanagement and with the enhanced potential for tax cuts which I have already referred to. The Government has got rid of the massive Labor deficit partly by an honest approach to taxation and partly by rigorous restraint on its spending. We have worked at the problem from both ends. Our more honest approach to taxation, which has involved lifting Commonwealth revenue by 2.4 percentage points as a proportion of gross domestic product has gone into getting rid of the deficit. The Government's view has been that our children should not have to pay the costs of the Government programs of today. The Opposition calls this a high tax approach which only shows again that the Opposition simply does not care about the long term development or future of this country. The claim that this Government is a high tax Government simply does not stand up. And if we look at the sales tax increases and the Government's objectives in connection with them, objectives of deficit elimination, of reduced pressure on interest rates, of a better balance in the tax mix, and of enhanced potential for personal income tax reductions, the Government's overriding concern with reducing the burden on the community of taxation and of the high costs of Government is again apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure restraint has been the major ingredient of this Government's approach to getting rid of the deficit and to making room for the private sector growth on which the future prosperity of Australia so fundamentally depends. In the Labor years the average annual real growth of Budget outlays was just over 10 per cent. Between 1975-76 and 1980-81, under the present Government, that figure is just over 1 per cent. The restraint of this Government is highlighted further if we look at what has happened in some major overseas countries, countries which are themselves concerned to achieve expenditure restraint. While Britain has matched Australia's achievement, the Australian figure of 1.2 per cent stands in stark contrast to the comparable figures of nearly 3 per cent for West Germany, about 5 per cent for the United States of America, and over 10 per cent for Japan. The most important index of Government spending is the number of cents which it takes out of every dollar of gross domestic product. The proportion of gross domestic product which the Government spends is not only vital to the number of dollars in actual pay packets; it determines whether there is enough room for expansion and growth in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975-76, the Commonwealth Government spent 30.1 cents of every dollar that Australia produced. In 1981-82, the Commonwealth Government will be spending 2 1/2 cents less than in 1975-76 of every dollar produced in Australia. This reduction, which would be nearly 3 cents but for the extra payday which comes at twelve year intervals, means that the Government will be spending $3.7 billion less than if the 1975-76 proportion had, in fact, continued. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's reduction in Budget outlays as a proportion of gross domestic product stands in stark contrast to the increase under labor from less than 24 per cent to more than 30 per cent. Everybody knows how much easier it is to spend more, rather than less. The steady progress which this Government has sustained in reducing its expenditure requirements has come about only as a result of the Government's resolute commitment to the cause of expenditure restraint and more limited Government. This Government will continue to maintain expenditure restraint and will continue the task of bringing down its outlays as a proportion of GDP towards the more moderate levels which prevailed before the Whitlam years. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn from the Government's expenditure restraint to its borrowing restraint because, in the end, borrowing is a form of expenditure. This year's Budget makes a substantial contribution over and above the reductions already achieved in the Loan Council towards reducing Government borrowing requirements and a central objective of this is to ease the pressure on interest rates. The interest rates which currently prevail are produced by three main factors; inflation, the pressure of demand within Australia, and the impact of overseas factors. A prospering Australia, where business investment and business borrowing are surging ahead, cannot hope to cut itself off entirely from overseas trends in interest rates, and overseas trends have been upwards in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> This overseas pressure, together with the demand that is arising out of growth in the Australian economy, explains why it is imperative that all governments should pull back their borrowing demands. Between 1975-76 and 1980-81, the Commonwealth Government has achieved a reduction of over $2 billion in its own and its authorities' borrowing requirements, and there will be a further reduction of about $1 billion this year. While substantial public sector borrowing is needed to provide infrastructure for the private sector economic developments now taking place, that borrowing must not be so high that it squeezes out these developments, for all loans are ultimately drawn from the same pool of funds, and larger borrowing by governments reduce the availability of funds, not only for large investment projects, but also for home owners, farmers and small businesses and tend to push up interest rates at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> All governments need to be aware that the dollars which they borrow could be used for other purposes, that the money which goes into a $10m government loan might have been used to provide 300 or 400 housing loans. While interest rates are obviously too high at their present levels, it must also be recognised that the people who provide the funds for borrowing will need an adequate return if they are to continue to invest their capital in this way, and the fact that the present housing interest rates are little different from the average rates through the 1960s when infiation is taken into account serves again to demonstrate the insidious nature of inflation and the continuing need to get it down in the cause of lower interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Bringing down inflation has of course been a vital target in the Government's expenditure restraint and the continued containment of inflation obviously remains a primary economic objective of the Government. The restraint of this Government, both in terms of spending and borrowing, has been remarkable by any standards, as other countries recognise. It is even more remarkable in view of the fact that the priority areas of social security, welfare and defence, which have required real increases over the period in question, encompass such a high proportion of Budget outlays-more than 37 per cent this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been speaking of what this Government has achieved over almost six years through its consistently applied Budget strategy. But while the Budget is the major economic vehicle through which the Government's philosophy and priorities are given concrete expression, many other activities of Government have a significant impact indeed in their own right on the well-being of Australians and the prospects for increasing prosperity. The Review of Commonwealth Functions provides a particular example. The results of the Review contributed significantly to restraining expenditure this year but to assess the RCF exercise only in this perspective is to miss its main point, for out of that Review have come decisions which will strengthen the role of the private sector, reduce government interference in private sector decision-making and restore the State governments responsibility and ultimate control over areas of activity which are rightly theirs. The impact of these outcomes is not to be measured merely in dollars and cents. Indeed, in some cases their monetary value would be virtually impossible to estimate, but they will offer huge long-term benefits in increasing the strength of Australian federalism and the vitality of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of Commonwealth Government decision-making which has significant implications for long term prosperity is that of tariffs and protection. This is an area of decision-making fraught with difficulties, for we are well aware that the long term benefits of a more competitive and efficient Australian economy need to be balanced against the costs to those whose employment prospects may be put at risk and the consequences for those who have made substantial investments under existing protection policies. On many occasions the Government has stated its view that Australia should move progressively towards lower levels of protection in order to promote the development of a manufacturing industry which will be more internationally competitive. In the last three years in particular, as the Industries Assistance Commission has moved through its progressive series of reviews of assistance to all sectors, we have taken many decisions which over a period will phase down protection in a wide range of industries including iron and steel, rubber products, chemicals, sporting equipment and, starting in 1982, textiles, clothing and footwear. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also recently acted to eliminate, except in the case of certain defence-strategic high technology industries, an additional element of protection to Australian industry afforded through a margin of preference in Commonwealth Government purchasing. Now that the IAC has almost completed its series of tariff reviews, we have asked the Commission to report by early 1982 on what options are available to achieve further reductions in protection. I want to emphasise that gradualism and the avoidance of disruption are indispensable elements in the Government's approach and policies in this area. In these and other ways, the Government has sought to promote the necessary conditions for a dynamic economy and a prosperous society. In doing so, however, we have not forgotten that change and progress, even prosperity itself, inevitably confront people with pressures and problems, that sound and responsible economic management must be integrated with care and concern for the needs of people. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to this wider issue, bearing in mind that a Budget does not demonstrate genuine concern about people or their well-being unless it faces up to economic reality with firmness, with conviction, with balance, and with that proper caution which does not place hard won gains at risk. It also needs to be understood that Budgetary policy is not just a matter of cutting up this year's national cake, which is what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) boils it down to in the end, and that while Budget allocations have an immediate and critical bearing on the well-being of a significant proportion indeed of Australians, Australians overall should obviously be looking to a healthy economy rather than a few dollars and cents in the Budget for their economic well-being. What better illustration of this could there be than the increase of $2.7 billion, after tax, in real household disposable income that was achieved last year as a result of the economic growth and activity which this Government's policies have generated. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering this Government's policies on the great issues of human concern and the real needs of people the starting point must be our concern and the real needs of people, the starting point must be our programs for young people because it is this Government which has concentrated on equipping those who are not academically inclined with useful work skills, and this Government which has based its policies on the premise that young people who are not at work ought where possible to be in education or training. The Government has sustained its original commitment to the development of a skilled work force, with particular emphasis on youth, and prominent among our major initiatives are the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training scheme, the Special Youth Employment Training Program and the School to Work Transition Program. Under these initiatives, a record 95,000 apprentices will receive assistance this year compared with only 21,000 assisted in 1975-76 by the old apprenticeship scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should wait. Some 90,000 young people will be able to obtain work experience including longer term experience for 12,000 of those who have had the greatest difficulty in finding jobs, and 23,000 young people will receive training under the transition programs in technical and further education institutions alone. The Government has also introduced a variety of smaller scale schemes because the Government's initiatives cater for the real problems in this area. The programs implemented by the Government are appreciated throughout the community and nobody in the community would want to deny the importance of the Government's concern in relation to this matter. The total allocation in the 1981-82 Budget, directed towards training schemes and transitional programs is more than $24m, almost 40 per cent up on last year's allocation, and upwards of 225,000 young people will be receiving assistance. The fact that unemployment has come down by over 20,000 in the year to August for young people seeking full time work and by over 25,000 for those seeking part time work shows the effectiveness of our policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the Government's initiatives and support for disabled and handicapped persons where assistance is being provided this year involving an overall expenditure of $1.1 billion. This figure might be doubled or trebled without the real needs that exist being fully met, by the real increase of 39 per cent on the Labor figure of 1975-76 shows the very considerable and sympathetic commitment of this Government to the well-being of handicapped and disabled persons. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is in real terms. The Government's view is that a wide range of programs and forms of assistance are required to meet the needs that exist. About 280 projects have been approved to date for the 1980-83 triennium in the handicapped persons welfare program. A new progam of aids for disabled people who were not covered by existing programs was established last June and the national employment strategy for the handicapped is improving services and increasing assistance under the training programs at a cost of $4m this year. Three new initiatives in the Budget, which will have a significant impact on the lifestyles of handicapped and disabled people, are: A new permanent scheme for assistance in the production of audio books in addition to Braille books; a new scheme of support for the establishment of radio services to supply spoken word services; and the new Australian caption centre, which will provide access to television programs for people with impaired hearing. The Government is acutely aware of the difficulty of allocating priorities in relation to the needs of disabled persons. A fundamental principle of government policy is to assist disabled persons to live normal lives wherever and so far as this is possible. Our commitment to making real gains in meeting the needs of disabled persons in our community will be maintained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to Aboriginal affairs where health care, employment opportunities and self-management initiatives are among the most central concerns and objectives of government policy. In this Budget health grants to Aboriginal medical services, at almost $5 1/2m, have more than doubled in real terms since 1975-76, and are up 22 per cent on last year's allocation; $50m is to be provided over 5 years for the Aboriginal public health improvement program, $8m of it this year; $47m will be provided this year for Aboriginal education and training; and a further $25m has been allocated specifically for employment and related programs for Aboriginals. Some $78m will be provided through various programs for Aboriginal housing. Grants to Aboriginal legal services will increase by almost 20 per cent over last year; to Aboriginal cultural and recreational organisations by 18 per cent; and funds for social support schemes will increase by 24 per cent. The well-being of the Aboriginal people concerns the Government as it concerns the vast majority of Australians and while a great many of the initiatives which need to be developed require a financial commitment, initiatives of a different order are equally required. In relation to the profoundly important objective of self-management, the Aboriginal Development Commission is an exciting initiative which is attracting overseas interest. It was established only after detailed consultations with Aboriginal organisations and communities, including the National Aboriginal Conference. It already has over 60 per cent of its positions occupied by Aboriginals. In this year it has available over $50m for spending on Aboriginal advancement programs. This Government also promoted the establishment of the National Aboriginal Conference-a body elected by Aboriginals to give independent advice to the government on matters affecting the Aboriginal people and with which successive Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs have developed strong ties. The Government continues to seek co-operative progress in meeting the special claims and particular needs of Aboriginals. While there is much that may be said about the treatment of Aboriginal people in earlier times, I believe that the record of achievement over the last decade or two-a record to which both sides of this House have made significant and impressive contributions-provides a basis for confidence that progress will continue as a matter of urgency and of the highest priority. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Budget allocation for assistance to aged persons. This is an area which raises issues and dilemmas of profound significance for the community, especially in the situation in which there is not only an increase in the aged population but also in which the legitimacy of established expectations and the policy of directing government assistance to the needy cannot be reconciled completely in practice. Assistance for the aged is directed to three major areas of need: Pensions and other income support; services which enable aged persons to remain in their own homes; and assistance for people who require either sheltered accomodation or nursing care. This year's allocations illustrate the degree of this Government's commitment to its policy of protecting basic pensions against inflation-a policy which we regard as crucial in ensuring social justice especially for those whose only source of income support is their pension. The Government has, through indexation, maintained the real value of pensions with the cost of the 1981-82 increases amounting to about $430m in a full year for aged pensions alone. The upper income limit at which an aged couple can receive some pension payment will be $266 per week after November this year, compared with $163 per week when this Government came to office. The Government continued to provide assistance for home care, meals-on-wheels, and senior citizens centres at a cost of over $23m this year. Support is also being provided towards the capital costs of nursing homes, hostels and self-contained accommodation and personal care subsidy. In all, at $4.6 billion for this year, assistance for the aged has more than doubled since this Government came to office-a real increase of 20 per cent since 1975-76. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to multicultural affairs and services to migrants where this Government's achievements are again meeting the needs, the concerns and the aspirations of so many members of the Australian community. The Galbally report, which was designed as a review of services to migrants, has become a symbol of a transforming vision of Australian society. It recommended that $50m will be spent on new or expanded programs over three years. We have more than met our commitment to this expenditure through expanded settlement and migrant education programs, establishment of migrant resource courses, the development of multicultural television and ethnic radio, establishment of the Institute of Multicultural Affairs, the funding of ethnic schools, and the ongoing teaching of ethnic languages and culture. The Galbally vision is increasingly becoming a reality. There has obviously been major expenditure on a very large number of programs and services for immigrants and for ethnic communities. But the truly significant aspect of all this is not so much the financial commitment involved, but rather that multicultural Australia has been made a reality under the auspices of this Government, and to a significant extent as a result of its initiatives and encouragement. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1981-82 Budget combines responsible economic management with effective care for people and their concerns. The list of initiatives and achievements which I have presented is by no means exhaustive. The same picture of effective achievement of progressive Liberal objectives would emerge in an examination of grants for local government, of grants for overseas aid, of increases in family allowances and in attention to veterans' affairs. Any suggestion that this Government has concentrated on economic management to the exclusion of broader concerns and issues is wholly groundless. Any suggestion that the Government has lost sight of its own Liberal objectives, or its commitment to the way of life which Australians want, is wholly groundless. Of course, the Government recognises the importance of a strong economy as a pre-condition for the realisation of wider social and cultural objectives. That recognition has been written large in the balance which has been maintained in our pursuit of social and humanitarian objectives and in the rigorous way that we have always given first place to the highest priorities. It is this concentration on priorities which has allowed the Government to make significant increases in allocations to areas of need while maintaining expenditure restraint and building up the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all, the Government's policies reflect its fundamental philosophy that individual Australians and Australian families have the right and must have the freedom to decide for themselves their own needs, their own way of life. Our policies-unlike the Opposition's-are designed to give a constructive, positive and properly limited role to government to make room for private enterprise: to make Australia strong by moving in a responsible and balanced way to a more competitive economy; to give people greater control over their own incomes by firmly setting this country on the only course leading to lower taxation; to develop opportunity, choice and power over their own lives for all Australians by appropriate government programs for Aborigines, migrants, the elderly and the young; to make government strong to protect the weak and open doors for the disadvantaged; and to make individuals strong to defend their rights and build the kind of life they want for themselves. In six years, Australia has been brought from the chaos of the Labor disaster to a condition of strength and prosperity with unrivalled prospects and a magnificent future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved by my colleague, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). The amendment moved to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1981-82 substantially spells out the direct opposition that I have to this Budget in clear and unmistakable detail. The Budget strategy of the Government is yet another onslaught on that section of the Australian community least able to defend itself. During the years of the Whitlam Government a series of initiatives were taken. Whilst they did not solve the difficulties of the community or the capitalist society in general, at least they set in train a basis for a concensus in regard to decent living standards, social welfare, education, housing for the underprivileged, the socially and economically deprived including pensioners, Aborigines and other groups at risk. Yet even this meagre attack on the evils of our society was regarded as a development that had to be reversed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to the warped minds of the landed gentry and the blue bloods who control the Liberal National Country Party-the coalition-we were heading into a form of socialism that had to be destroyed at all costs. That is not just fundamental to Australian society. In general it is found in a world wide pattern. We have the Reagan Administration and the Thatcher Administration and we now have our Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) who does not have enough guts to reverse one decision that was spelt out in the Budget Speech. That is the matter of the Community Youth Support Scheme. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) had to go on television this evening to announce the reversal of the position in regard to the funding of CYSS and a new campaign. The Prime Minister of this country did not have the courage to say that in a half hour speech to the House this evening. What sort of courage is that? This reversal in the face of at least a consensus that I referred to in the initial stages was indicative of the thuggery led by the Prime Minister of this country and his cohorts on the front bench. He had the audacity last night to try to defend an indefensible position. The Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair), caught yet again in another scandal, was defended by the Prime Minister in such a way that he would not have to worry about his enemies if he has friends such as the Prime Minister. He did not defend the matter at all; he just toughed it out. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) again was challenged by the Opposition. What happened again? The Prime Minister could muster exactly seven minutes to defend him. He did not utter one word to defend him but went on with a lot of garble that we on this side of the House have learnt to expect. It means absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of posturing will go on in the next couple of weeks. The three people I mentioned-Reagan, Thatcher, and Fraser, the Prime Minister of this country-have something in common. He will go off to America and will speak to Reagan after he has done his posturing at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the next two weeks. What a paragon of virtue! What a wolf in sheep's clothing! What a great defender of democracy and of the underprivileged of this country! What a great defender of the Aborigines of this country! Honourable members should go and have a look in the back blocks of the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia. He should bring the people he will talk to in America over here and show them exactly how Aborigines are treated in this country and then see how he stands up to the test.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Budget strategy is indicative of that arrogance which knows no bounds. After six years of Budgets and obnoxious attacks on the livelihood of the people to whom I have referred, what do we have under the banner of fighting inflation, increasing employment availability and increasing socio-economic opportunities for the poor; people who find themselves on the lowest spokes of fortune's wheel? We have a Budget strategy that is indicative of the areas I pointed out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Education spending has fallen by 2 per cent; health spending is down by 22 per cent; transport and communications spending is down by 53 per cent; water supply, electricity and gas spending is down by 50 per cent; and the general housing construction is down by 59 per cent. If, for instance, we look at the alternatives, where is the redistribution of wealth? The wealth has gone to the people who run the Liberal and National Country Parties. Those who invested their fortunes in Australia will reap the results. The redistribution of wealth in this country is in that direction. Once again the needy and those who depend on social welfare will pay the price. Will there be a relief in taxation? Will there be relief in unemployment, the rate of inflation, interest rates and, as I mentioned before, taxes? Certainly not!</PARA>
<PARA> In the time available to me, I will refer to three or four specific matters that are relevant to the strategy I pointed out. One other aspect of the strategy of the Government is to hand over the whole running of this community-not only running it behind the scene but also directly by supplying the wherewithal-to private enterprise which results in million of dollars being poured into the pockets of private enterprise. In regard to housing, the people who have been relegated to the status of second class citizens are those who are unfortunate enough-and young people predominantly are-to need to try to find themselves a home. Once they are married they have to place themselves in hock for the rest of their lives. It was indeed bad enough 12 months to two years ago, but where do they find themselves at present? They are in a worse situation because of the availability of housing loans not purely on the basis of the money that is available but in regard to the wherewithal to service their loans. </PARA>
<PARA> During the last session of the Parliament, I raised a number of questions about the operation of permanent building societies. I expressed concern at the numbers of homes being repossessed by those societies. Since then, the monetary policies of the Government have ensured that even more Australian families will find themselves on the street. The interest rate increases, encouraged by the Treasurer (Mr Howard), have placed an unbearable burden on many families who will find their monthly repayments beyond their means. The Government claims it has increased emergency housing funding in this Budget by 22 per cent. Many people at both State and local government levels must wonder what happens to this increased funding. The Government claims it has increased its emergency funding all right, but I suggest that every cent of the welfare housing finance will be required to meet the needs of hundreds of families who will be left homeless because of the Government's policies. At the same time as these families are faced with crippling increases in home repayment costs, they also have to face increased medical and hospital costs, new or increased sales taxes on many essential items and, in my State, increases in energy prices. The impact of these added costs will be devastating for many families. The effect will compound when the unscrupulous among the building societies get their tentacles in. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I will suggest several steps which the Government could and ought to take to assist these families in their dealings with building societies. Further, I argue that any people over many years who have been charged penalties by building societies under certain contracts ought to have their money refunded, depending on the time the societies--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My friend the honourable member for Phillip, who has just woken up, talks about this being a State government problem. That is what the Minister said. Of course the organisation which repossesses the houses is the direct responsibility of the Federal Minister. I do not know how much the honourable member knows about it. He is a barrister. For God's sake, how would honourable members like him defend them? He does not even know that the responsibility for repossessing houses rests with the Federal Minister for Housing and Construction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In making these comments, I do not want to include societies which may fully inform borrowers of their rights. There was a case in England which proved conclusively, beyond doubt, that if these societies do not advise those who borrow from them the amounts that they are required to repay there is no obligation on the individuals concerned. I put it to the Federal Minister that, unless his obligation in that regard is so superficial, he ought to do something about the people in Australia who are robbed of their possessions by societies such as the Statewide Building Society in Victoria and the shonky lawyers who represent that society. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area we ought to look at is the situation in education institutions. The educational needs of the multicultural and socially disadvantaged communities in Melbourne require attention. It is not good enough simply to say that this is another State matter. In 1976, the Victorian Department of Education imposed staff ceilings on all State schools. These ceilings were set at below the actual number of teachers already employed. The ceilings were clearly not related to any educationally based decision but rather to an economic and political one. Decisions about staffing are ultimately made by the Federal and State Treasuries through the respective Ministers for education. The decline in staffing has been coupled with a decline in teaching conditions as well as a decline in the students' learning conditions. For instance, the ad hoc cutbacks in recent years have had a devastating effect on curriculums. </PARA>
<PARA> Cutbacks have not affected the private school sector to the same degree. In fact, money is being diverted from the state sector to the private school sector. Non-government schools receive 56 per cent of Federal Government recurrent funds while catering for only 20 per cent of the students. This squeeze on the state education system has led to centralised decision-making which leaves little, if any, room for input from teachers, students and parents. Because the special needs component can be ascertained only by the school community involved, the centralised decision-making system has had a disastrous effect on schools with acute needs resulting from economic and/or ethnic disadvantage. Rigid staffing formulas have led to the dismantling of previously existing school programs. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to bring to the attention of the House the effect that the funding priorities of the Fraser Government has had on the education available to young people in my electorate. I do not have the time to go through all the examples that could be put forward in that regard. However, I point out that I was a member of a committee on specific learning difficulties during my period in this Parliament. One has only to read that committee's report to find out precisely how students in both areas-public and secular-have suffered at the hands of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take the matter further and go into the area of unemployment and the Community Youth Support Scheme. In Melbourne, for example, young boys and girls are prostituting themselves on the streets to keep a roof over their heads. If anyone wants to deny or question that, I suggest that he asks the Salvation Army and other religious agencies in my electorate about it. These young boys and girls are prey to perverts and other individuals who oppress them and place them in all sorts of mitigating situations. Some of these young people are too ashamed to go back to their families because they cannot get a job. What is the result? We have the pressures applied by this Government and, adding insult to injury, the Government then takes away the funding of at least some of the counselling agencies where these young people could go day after day for the purpose of getting some relief and to talk to people who are in the same situation. </PARA>
<PARA> But what has happened insofar as this Government's policy is concerned? This Government has shown the same disregard for the position of these young people as it has for the pensioners, the homeless and others. The Government purely applies an economic formula to what these young people are all about. The Government says, out of hand: 'We will stop that system without even making a close examination of it'. When asked by church people and people involved in counselling agencies to reconsider, the Government refused point blank. The Minister came into this chamber and said that the Government would not change its Budget strategy. </PARA>

The government has taken interest rates out of the loans which were afforded to Telecom during the time of its commission, thereby increasing the rates to people in the communications area. What I am saying is this: The capital program applied by the Government is forcing Telecom into a series of situations which is forcing up the rates of communication. The Australian Postal Commission is in a similar situation. The common letter traffic has been making a profit over the last four or five years. What is happening now?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my friend and colleague the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) said, the presentation of the Federal Budget is an event of national significance. Over the past weeks, political commentators, members of parliament and the community have had time to analyse this Budget. It is understandable that we have had many complaints from sectional interests. The mining industry has seen its tax deductions halved and all exports of black coal not presently subject to duty will now become dutiable at the rate of $1 per tonne. Surely these small charges are acceptable to an industry which has been given substantial government and taxpayer encouragement in the developmental stage, and which knows it will continue to receive this encouragement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> None of us like the impact of a more general sales tax. However, the reasons for its introduction are valid. Australians pay higher personal income taxes to government revenue than most other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. This has been a major disincentive to the average worker to work, to save and to invest in his own future and in the future of Australia. It is estimated that income tax receipts on individuals and companies in 1981-82 will be $26,000m or 64 per cent of total government receipts. On the other hand, excise, customs duties and sales taxes will account for only 27.7 per cent of Government receipts. It is, therefore, of significance that the opportunity has been taken to broaden the tax mix by raising extra revenue through a 2 1/2 per cent increase in sales tax and the rectification of taxation anomalies. The credibility of the Government is dependent on these changes being reflected in substantial-I repeat, substantial-personal income tax cuts in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> I make some criticisms of these changes. One is where some measures by their effect are, in my view, retrospective. I believe the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has to ensure by clear direction to the Australian Taxation Office that new sales taxes must not apply in any area where documented evidence can be produced or where contracts or orders were entered into before the Budget night. In some individual cases I am aware of, and of which I have provided full documentation to the Treasurer, major purchasing decisions made months ago under existing tax rates could well threaten the viability of business if forced now to pay sales tax increases. I express also my opposition to the sales tax on books, magazines and newspapers. Whilst most countries have taxes-some as high as 22 per cent on these items-Australia does not need to follow suit. I see this as a disincentive to the free flow of information. The Government should reconsider this unnecessary impost. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not, however, lose sight of the real purpose of a Federal Budget and the economic responsibility of a national government. That purpose is to manage effectively the economy in a way that will ensure growth, ensure that we are competitive on world markets and improve the living standards of our people. If this can be achieved all other government responsibilities in welfare, health and education and our commitment to foreign aid can be both met and increased. As a result of the prudent management during the past six years our economic position is now one of growth and productivity-what a different position from 1975-76 when this nation was showing negative growth and had a deficit of $4,000m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with my colleague. We are indeed in a fortunate position compared with other industrialised countries that are troubled with slow or no growth, higher inflation and higher unemployment. Production, employment, investment and consumer demand are not only stronger than a year ago but also greater than thought likely at the time of the last Budget. It is important to note that business investment grew by more than 20 per cent in real terms during the year, which is the largest growth in this country for 30 years. It is essential that the Government, therefore, keep a tight reign on its own expenditure if this position is to be maintained, if inflation is to be contained and if we are to reduce the pressure on interest rates. What a contrast we have with the Opposition's policies. The outlook for next year under our policies indicates prices will rise by 10.75 per cent, employment by 2 per cent, gross domestic product by 3.5 per cent and wages by 13.5 per cent. Labor calls again for increased Government expenditure. These are the same policies followed by the last Labor Government when we saw inflation rise from 5 per cent to 17 1/2 per cent. The spending of taxpayers' money in that time was at a record rate. Personal income tax increased by 125 per cent in three years and investment in development collapsed completely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to discussing some of the specific measures in the Budget and areas of change that must be undertaken in the year ahead if we are to continue our enviable position. It has been said that the primary welfare of the Australian people does not rely on our social welfare system but on the strength of our economy. The Government's concern for the care of the elderly and needy will be further expanded this year. Indexation of pensions based on consumer price index increases in November and May will add an additional $7.6m to the Budget. In November the single rate of social service pension will be $69.70 a week and the combined married rate will increase to $116.20 a week. The Government has decided also to increase and redirect a program of rental assistance to pensioners and long term sickness beneficiaries in order to provide more support to those paying higher rents. Other major initiatives in the social welfare area include increases in family allowances by some 50 per cent for third and subsequent children and new assistance measures for the handicapped. It should be emphasised that it was this Government that introduced the family allowance scheme and it was this Government that has increased assistance to the disabled by 140 per cent since 1975-76. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian social security system is in place to protect people from economic hardship caused by loss of earnings through age, sickness, invalidity, unemployment or the loss of a supporting spouse following death or desertion. It is also intended to assist parents with the cost of raising children. When we look at the total outlays on social welfare at Commonwealth level, always remembering that State governments also supplement these outlays, we find that in 1981-82, 27.8 per cent of the Commonwealth Budget or $11,357m has been appropriated. As this is a 14.5 per cent increase over the previous year and well in excess of the inflation rate we should expect our programs to meet all those factors mentioned earlier. But do they?</PARA>
<PARA> We are, of course, aware of significant areas of poverty and a wide disparity of living conditions in our community. Whilst no Government programs can be expected or should be expected to assume responsibility for every individual's well-being it is becoming increasingly obvious that our social security system is far from satisfactory. I believe that two questions have to be asked. The first question is: Can our economy continue to support the massive annual increases in welfare spending? In 1968, for every 1,000 workers in our community 178 persons were being supported on welfare benefits. Today, this has increased to 287 persons being supported by every 1,000 workers. The burden of this upon each taxpayer is exces- sive and the inflexibility it imposes upon a government in establishing priorities for increased growth is immense. If such a trend is allowed to continue the social security system will collapse either through economic or political pressures. </PARA>
<PARA> The second question to be asked is: Are the people in real need in our community being supported adequately or is our assistance being spread too thinly across a broad spectrum of programs? We are all aware that many payments in the social security area are being paid to people who are not in need of income maintenance. It is time to bite the bullet on this issue. The two advantages to be gained are that, on the one hand, those in real need could be supported at benefit levels above the poverty line and, on the other hand, government programs for economic and employment growth could receive higher priority stabilising the ever increasing welfare budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The emphasis in the Budget of devoting increased resources and introducing new manpower and training programs is indicative of a positive commitment and totally against those remarks made by the honourable member for Melbourne tonight. Of course, we are all aware of the many reasons for the high levels of unemployment. We are aware of the social effects of unemployment in our community. Most of us have reasons for why this occurs. I guess that we can all cite many of them. Perhaps the economic recession that has gone through most of the industrial world in the last few years can be blamed. Perhaps the inappropriateness of our education curriculum can be blamed. Perhaps a higher junior wage and penalty rates which have been accompanied by a loss of traditional youth jobs can be blamed. Of course, we all know that the replacement of labour by technology is another one of those reasons. All these factors combine to contribute to some of the high unemployment rates that we have at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> But Australia is not in the position that the honourable member for Melbourne likes to paint us. Australia is in the fortunate position in that in the last two years 300,000 new jobs have been created. We know, by Budget estimates, that we can look forward to a further 2 per cent growth in employment this year. Our positive programs are practical ways of helping young people improve their education, training and work experience opportunities. An amount of $72m will be expended on training and an increased number of 95,000 apprentices will be assisted. The Special Youth Employment Training Program will assist 90,000 young people. An assessment has shown that up to 60 per cent of young unemployed people commencing this Scheme have obtained long term employment or have obtained satisfactory work shortly after their training is complete. I was disappointed, after a considerable effort had been made by me in my electorate and, I know, by most other members of this House, that the decision was taken to terminate the Community Youth Support Scheme. The Scheme was particularly appropriate and successful in country regions. I pay tribute to the project officers and their supporting community committees for adapting the scheme to bring positive benefits to many young people with acute social and employment difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased that the Government has been able to reassess its decision. I am pleased that it has been able to announce that, as its assessment has proceeded far enough to show that not every CYSS participant would be able to benefit from the new range of programs we have established, it has been prepared to change its mind. It has been prepared to accept that some young unemployed people would not have access to the programs we have designed and that these programs would not meet their needs. Therefore, it has been decided that in the interests of the young people concerned, current CYSS projects will receive their present level of funds until February 1982. New and improved guidelines for the operation of the scheme will be prepared. Those guidelines will have particular regard to the best means of providing assistance and support for young people who live in areas where training and educational opportunities are limited or who may not qualify for or be able to benefit from existing employment programs. As I said, CYSS is to continue, and it will continue after 28 February 1982 under new guidelines. Special attention will be needed in many rural and remote communities as many disadvantaged young people will not have access to transition programs, training positions and, in turn, apprenticeship opportunities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did have a hand in it. I am very pleased to say that I did. In the context of the Budget debate, it is appropriate to pay some regard to the effect of our exchange rate and the impact of protection upon our economy. Our rate of exchange is important because it determines the international competitiveness of our exporting and importing industry. The Government has quite correctly been successful in restoring and maintaining this country's exporting advantage. While I recognise that the real effective exchange rate has no meaning unless it is taken over a period, I must express concern at the trend that is occurring. We all know that most rural industry prices are determined in the countries and currencies of major consumers. The conversion of these into revenue for primary producers depends solely on the existing exchange with the Australian dollar. The real effective exchange rate appreciation during 1980-81 was about 7 per cent. The dollar appreciated by some 18 per cent, however, for wool against the Australian Wool Corporation's wool trade weight basket. This is a major disadvantage to wool producers and is of more significance to the wool industry compared with other rural industries because of the impact of European countries on the world wool trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other hand, beef suffered only a 6 per cent appreciation in the dollar because of the importance of the United States trade to that industry. Adverse exchange rate movements reduced the price of wheat over the last 12 months by $13 a tonne. The combined effects of these movements have reduced rural income by $400m in 1980-81, which is approximately 10 per cent of net rural income. If we add other exporting competing industries to this, the net loss is close to $700m. As I said earlier, exchange rate movement must be looked at over a period and not just at any given point in time. But it is important to note that the farm rate of inflation over the last 12 months rose by 15 per cent, whereas the consumer price index rose by less than 10 per cent. We must expect further revaluations in 1981-82 due to the estimated capital inflow of up to $8 billion. There are several solutions to this problem, foremost being a restriction of capital inflow and an enccouragement of capital outflow. We can endeavour to restrict government borrowings further and to repay earlier borrowings. We could abolish the 2 per cent revenue duty and relax by-law entry. </PARA>
<PARA> The other solution to the exchange rate difficulty is, of course, to reduce tariffs. It is on this matter that I wish to conclude my remarks. There is probably no area of greater misunderstanding or misconception than in the 'free trade' versus 'protectionism' debate. Firstly, it should be pointed out that there are valid arguments for granting protection. There are the arguments that tariffs are necessary to support infant industries or that tariffs on manufactures are justified in a labour scarce economy. Levels of protection, however, cannot be justified on these arguments today. The main arguments we hear today in favour of high levels of protection have been that they are necessary to expand the size of the manufacturing sector in order to provide employment for a growing labour force, as Australian manufacturers have also argued, that industries in which there are economies of scale should be protected from import competition, so allowing the domestic producers to increase their output and to lower unit costs. Most people would not necessarily agree with this, as often such protective industries operate at less than the minimum efficient scale. Primarily this happens because firms are aware of their interdependence and avoid price cutting, which may jeopardise all their profits. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, governments must also consider the levels of tariff, subsidy or other forms of protection that are necessary to preserve the viability of industries established by government decisions. An example of this is that many of our horticultural industries have been developed following closer settlement schemes. It may be necessary, therefore, to afford some protection against low cost imports if these industries have to operate in a high cost structure. The social and decentralised importance of these industries adds another dimension to the protection debate. But even this assistance must not be such that it becomes a burden on society. We have seen in the primary industry sector many examples of restructuring over the years, the dairy industry offering a most recent example. Such restructuring has resulted in more efficient and profitable industry, but not, I emphasise, without personal trauma and hardship. The difficulty with tariff protection is that society usually does not know the cost of the protection it is bearing and some industries become fat and lacking in initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads me to the current discussion on protection for the motor vehicle industry. Any assessment of the Australian motor vehicle industry, despite the unfair and emotional outcry from the industry in recent weeks, will show that it is out of step with the Government's objectives and that it is a massive burden on the Australian community. We know that protection for the indsutry amounts to over $1,000m annually, the equivalent of $3,000 for each car produced in Australia, or a massive $15,000 for each employee in the industry. Australia also has five manufacturers making 19 basic models for an insulated domestic market. As a result, the industry is fragmented and costly in its total manufacturing process. We also know that, despite protection, employment in the industry continues to fall. Presently 65,000 workers are involved. This is a drop of over 20,000 during the past five years. Therefore, the Government has to make decisions in the overall national interest. However, its intentions in the short and long term must be clearly stated. The industry must be restructured gradually, in my view, with the intention of retaining a strong and efficient industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) speaking in this debate before the dinner suspension, one could have been excused for thinking that he was talking about another country. But then I suppose the perspectives are somewhat different from Nareen compared with Coburg. The 1981-82 Budget presents us with a clear statement of the bankrupt economic thinking and regressive social attitudes which have characterised the Fraser Government's handling of the Australian economy and society since 1975. It provides yet another stark reminder of this Government's blinkered commitment to a misguided conservative ideology, the practical application of which has imposed immense economic and social costs on all but the most wealthy and powerful sections of the Australian community. The average wage earner, the unemployed job seeker and the young person have all been treated with contempt under the social and economic policy regime administered by the Fraser Government since 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1981-82 Budget confronts us with the latest regurgitation of an economic strategy which aims at suppressing inflation, reducing real wages and pruning the size of the public sector as the necessary prerequisites for generating economic growth in the private sector. Such a strategy has been pursued consistently since 1975 and its main policy ingredients have been, and continue to be cutbacks in government spending, reductions in the Budget deficit, and tight control over the growth in the money supply-in other words, a monetarist strategy aimed at squeezing the economic life out of the economy for the sake of some vague assurance of longer term recovery. This strategy has had five years to produce the much-heralded regeneration of output and jobs. It has proved to be an abysmal and unequivocal failure. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been minimal gain on the inflation front. The inflation rate of 13 per cent in 1975-76 was reduced to under 9 per cent by 1978-79, but the trend has subsequently worsened and the consumer price index is anticipated by the Government to rise by almost 11 per cent during 1981-82. In other words, little headway has been made after half a decade of tight policies. Economic growth has stagnated. Average annual growth of less than 2 1/2 per cent in non-farm output since 1975-76 compares dismally with the experience of the first half of the 1970s and with the growth experience of other major Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Growth in the first half of 1981 collapsed to the lowest level for four years. Job opportunities have increased at a snail's pace as a consequence of this poor growth performance. Employment has grown by a mere 384,000 over the 5 years to 1980-81, or at an average annual rate of little over 1 per cent. Over one-third of this increase has consisted of part time jobs. Amongst teenagers, an extra 55,000 jobs have been made available since 1975-76, and only 12,000 in that period-or less than a quarter-have been in full time employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The unemployment situation has deteriorated significantly and generated a social problem of massive proportions. An average of almost 390,000 people, or 5.8 per cent of the Australian labour force, were recorded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as being out of work during 1980-81-that is, an increase of almost 90,000 over the level in 1975-76, when the unemployment rate was less than 4 1/2 per cent. Unemployment over the six years to August amongst teenagers has risen by almost 20,000 to stand now at 106,000 or 14 per cent of the teenage labour force. Unemployed people are now out of work for much longer periods-35 weeks on average compared with about 13 weeks in 1975-76, with over 80,000 unemployed people now out of work for over a year. The inadequate growth in job opportunities over the past 5 years has also contributed to the emergence of substantial 'hidden' unemployment currently totalling at least 300,000 people-that is, people who want jobs but have decided not to participate actively in the labour force because of limited job prospects or who have taken part time jobs even though preferring to work full time. The true unemployment figure is thus probably closer to three-quarters of a million Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government must bear the prime responsibility for this economic mess. The eminent Australian economist, Professor John Nevile, in the Economic Record of December 1980, reached the unqualified conclusion that tight fiscal policy was a major reason why unemployment had risen in the last three to four years, and would rise again in the near future. Professor J. O. N. Perkins from Melbourne University, in a recent discussion paper circulated by the Parliamentary Library, has provided an even more comprehensive indictment. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> Policy in the recent past has held activity well below potential in the hope of thereby restraining inflation. If such a policy was intended to make possible a restoration of full employment without serious inflation, it has clearly failed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Fraser Government's record in the specific area of labour market policy is particularly susceptible to criticism. Total Government expenditure on manpower, training and support schemes has been reduced by almost 50 per cent in real terms between 1975-76 and 1980-81. In terms of real spending per unemployed person, the fall has been more like 80 per cent. The real value of unemployment benefits has fallen dramatically over this period, especially for unemployed young people under the age of 18 who have been required to exist on a paltry $36 a week since 1975. The Government has not developed a coherent manpower policy. Rather, it has been content to rely almost entirely on inadequate programs of subsidisation of a range of training and work experience schemes administered by employers in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable members to consider the major examples: Firstly subsidisation of apprenticeships under the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training scheme introduced early in 1977 has failed to generate an adequate increase in apprenticeship training. Government assistance under this scheme has more than doubled in real terms over the three years to 1980-81. Despite this, the number of new indentures only regained the 1973-74 level during 1979-80. The number of apprentices in training and the rate of apprenticship completions have hardly risen at all since 1976. Hardly what one would call an effective trade training performance!</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly the Special Youth Employment Training Program, aimed at temporary subsidisation of the employment and training of young unemployed people, has been dogged by a history of ineffectiveness and abuse by some employers. Many trainees have received little, if any training, and according to the Government's own evaluations in 1979, 20 per cent of SYETP positions at most were created specificaly for trainees, half the trainees not being kept on after subsidisation was terminated, with almost 30 per cent becoming unemployed again. Our unemployed youth deserve better employment schemes than this. The Government has resolutely refused to implement any programs aimed specifically at creating jobs, continually referring to the Australian Labor Party's Regional Employment Development scheme of 1974-75 as the definitive example of the inherent costliness and ineffectiveness of a public sector job creation program. The Government has apparently chosen to ignore the 1977 evaluation of the RED scheme by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations which concluded that the scheme's benefits outweighed its costs. It has also conveniently overlooked-or is probably unaware of-the 1978 report of the United States National Commission for Manpower Policy which pointed to the widespread use of job creation schemes by most European countries as a major means of reducing unemployment, and concluded that, if well designed, such programs were worth their cost. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, what a dismal record after 5 years of supposed economic responsibility! It is a catalogue of unmitigated failure in the area of economic and labour market strategy. What a price the Australian community has had to pay for the implementation of such a bankrupt strategy: The costs inherent in the potential goods and services which have been foregone as a result of production levels being consistently depressed below capacity; the economic, social and psychological costs of persistent and massive unemployment; the emergence of shortages of skilled labour and the need to rely increasingly on immigrant skills; and the erosion of the living standards of the average wage earner. In relation to this last point, it is worth highlighting the fact that, as a result of an increased tax burden, higher health costs, rising interest rates, and continued high inflation, the typical family on average earnings is at present $8 a week worse off in terms of spending power compared with the situation in 1975-76. It is only the top 30 per cent of wage earners who have experienced gains in real incomes over the past 5 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the clearest practical indictment of this Government's economic strategy is the fact that the only experience of accelerated economic growth in recent years occurred as a direct result of the Government's failure to implement its repressive policy regime of fiscal and monetary restraint. This brief revival took place during 1980, which, predictably enough, was an election year. During the latter half of 1980, output increased at an extraordinary annual rate of 6.1 per cent, and annual employment growth was close to 3.5 per cent. What were the underlying causes of this burst of growth? First, accelerated growth in Government expenditure during 1980 which created expansion in the public sector; secondly, growth in the money supply at rates well above the 11 per cent policy ceiling, and accelerated growth in real wages and disposable incomes, both of which underpinned an upsurge in business investment and consumer spending-in other words, the very economic magnitudes which the Fraser Government has sought to repress as part of its basic long-term strategy!</PARA>
<PARA> What does the 1981-82 Budget offer us specifically on the economic front? After six years of waiting for less inflation and sustained recovery, the Government now presents us with a set of policies which deliberately add to inflation, diminish economic growth, increase unemployment, and worsen the economic situation of the average working family. An overriding obsession with reducing the size of the Budget deficit is to be the basis for policies which will intensify the economic and social problems of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Increased sales taxes, together with increases in health costs arising out of recent Government decisions, will add at least 1 1/2 percentage points to the rate of inflation during 1981-82. Reductions in the real level of funding to the State governments will force State charges to rise and put further upward pressure on the cost of living. What an incredible scenario from a Government committed to fighting inflation! Of course, it is the average wage earner who will continue to bear the brunt of such regressive fiscal measures. On top of recent interest rate increases, the typical family unit receiving average weekly earnings which I referred to earlier will find itself a further $4 out of pocket each week during 1981-82 as a result of the Government's fiscal decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the economy is to be subject to the deflationary impacts of further cutbacks in overall government expenditure and a continued commitment to curbing growth in the money supply. Growth in government outlays is to be reduced to 12.6 per cent, compared with a 14.6 per cent increase in 1981-82. Direct government expenditure on goods and services is expected to rise in real terms by less than 1 per cent, considerably less than the 2.6 per cent growth recorded in 1980-81. The domestic surplus is budgeted to rise by $1.1 billion, which will constitute a 12 per cent increase in the rate of withdrawal of spending power from the domestic economy over what was achieved by the previous Budget. The 1981-82 Budget will thus have a strong contractionary effect on the economy. Indeed, the Budget documents contain the Government's own prediction that output will increase at a slower rate-3 to 3 1/2 per cent compared with 4 per cent in 1980-that employment growth will fall from 2.6 per cent to 2 per cent and that the level of unemployment will rise during 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the economic outcome for 1981-82 is likely to be far more draconian than even the Government's own miserable predictions would have us believe, for what we have is a set of contractionary policies being imposed on a private sector economy which is already on the downturn. Consider the recent behaviour of some key economic indicators:</PARA>
<PARA> Growth in non-farm gross domestic product fell dramatically from 6.1 per cent in the first half of 1980-81 to a mere 1 1/2 per cent in the latter half of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> Annual employment growth has plummeted from a high point of 212,000 in July 1980 to a rate of 109,000 by July 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of unemployment has deteriorated noticeably over the past two months, after some improvement earlier in the year. </PARA>
<PARA> Consumer confidence, as measured by ABS surveys, has been declining continuously during 1981 and growth in consumption expenditure during the latter half of 1980-81 fell noticeably. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of building and construction commencements slumped sharply during the recent June quarter. </PARA>
<PARA> An unexpected slowdown in manufacturing growth in recent months has been associated with a decline in business confidence in this area, according to the latest joint survey by the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Bank of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the Budget strategy will be to intensify this economic downswing. In particular, a severe reduction in the growth of consumer purchasing power will be the inevitable outcome of the slower growth in real wages and the increased burden of pay-as-you-earn taxation associated with the 1981-82 Budget. This in turn will ensure that a further brake is applied to consumer spending during 1981-82, and there can be little basis for the Budget assumption that consumers will maintain the rate of expansion in their spending levels during the coming year. Moreover, further increases in interest rates are inevitable if the Government is successful in reining in the growth of the money supply from around 13 per cent to the targeted range of 10 to 11 per cent for 1981-82 or if the anticipated boom in capital inflow is not forthcoming. As a result, additional adverse effects on business investment decisions and consumer spending can be expected during 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are facing, then, is the prospect, if not the certainty, of a substantial deterioration in the growth of job opportunities, the level of unemployment and the standard of living of most Australians during 1981-82. As has been the case over the past 5 years, it is the application of a misguided and inappropriate budgetary strategy which will be largely to blame. The increase of 10 1/2 per cent in the rural level of funding for manpower, training and support programs appears to be a notable departure from the general restraint in government spending. It is, on the contrary, a grossly inadequate gesture when viewed in the context of labour market realities. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, this increased funding will only provide support for an additional 23,000 people in training and work experience positions over the number subsidised during 1980-81. Unemployment is likely to rise by at least this much during 1981-82. Secondly, these positions are essentially subsidised on a temporary basis, with permanent employment still depending on an expansion of job oppportunities in the private sector, which, as we have seen, will be decidedly sluggish during 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that the Fraser Government has discarded the policy goal of full employment and is content to pursue instead the goals of smaller government and reduced inflation, no matter what the impact on wage earners and the unemployed and no matter what the damage to the social fabric of this nation. The Australian Labor Party, on the other hand, believes that the achievement of full employment is still of paramount importance. Availability of satisfactory jobs for all those who want to work and sustained and equitable improvements in general living standards must be rekindled and restored as the dominant guiding philosophies for economic and social policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Fiscal strategy, for a start, must be more expansionary, involving a more direct role for the public sector in job creation and more appropriate mix of taxation and expenditure policies which will tackle the problems of inflation and unemployment simultaneously. But traditional fiscal and monetary policies are, by themselves, insufficient to cope with our contemporary economic problems. An incomes policy which seeks to achieve consensus between government, labour and employers concerning maintenance of the real incomes of all sections of the community is an essential ingredient of a policy strategy aimed at fighting stagflation and protecting living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Elimination of large scale unemployment and the achievement of sustained improvements in living standards require progressive and imaginative policies and, most importantly, a government with the humanity, vision and strength to devise and implement such policies. The Fraser Government has shown itself singularly incapable of meeting such a challenge. </PARA>

<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, there are two basic points that I want to make in respect of the announcement this evening by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I start my speech by apologising for not having made this statement in the House before it was released to the news media. The reason for that-I hope it will be accepted in the spirit in which it is given-is that the Government and the Opposition, I freely concede, have been concerned about the problems of youth unemployment. The Government has also been concerned with many young people and adults in the community who have, themselves, been concerned about the Community Youth Support Scheme and its future. Accordingly, when a decision was made by the Government about this matter it was decided that it was appropriate to make the statement publicly and as quickly and as widely as possible. I emphasise that there was certainly no intention to cast any aspersions on the standing, significance and importance of this House or of the importance of making significant statements in this House. If any such disrespect to the House was interpreted by my actions, I certainly apologise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the Community Youth Support Scheme. Since the Budget decision to terminate CYSS on 31 October, the Government has been looking closely at its skills, training, work experience and education programs for young people. It has also been looking closely at the availability of those programs for young unemployed people under the Community Youth Support Scheme. The Budget provided a total of $197m for manpower and training programs, an increase of almost $50m on the previous financial year. Within that expenditure there is greatly increased provision for practical and positive assistance to young unemployed people through work experience and educational opportunities. Indeed, expenditure on youth training programs in 1981-82 is to be increased from $47.5m to $79.4m, a 67 per cent increase over the last financial year. Opportunities through the School to Work Transition Program have also been substantially increased. The Government has consistently stated that skills, training, work experience and education opportunities are the best means of helping young people to find a job and keep it. The School to Work Transition Program and a greater range of training programs are designed to achieve that objective. The reduction in the number of young Australians who are unemployed indicates that those policies are working. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced, the Government has taken special steps to ensure that as many CYSS participants as possible are helped into our programs with the enhanced employment, training and education opportunities that are needed so much by the young unemployed. That assessment has not been completed, but it has proceeded far enough to show that not all CYSS participants will be able to benefit from other programs. The Government is not prepared to have a situation where some young unemployed people do not have access to a program suited to their needs. The Government has considered the alternatives of maintaining CYSS or establishing another scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It has decided, in the interests of the young people concerned, that: Firstly, the current CYSS projects will receive their current level of funds until 28 February 1982; secondly, new and improved guidelines for the operation of the scheme will be prepared; and, thirdly, those guidelines will have particular regard to the best means of providing assistance and support for young people who live in areas where training and education opportunities are limited or who may not be qualified or able to benefit from existing programs. It has also been decided that CYSS will continue after 28 February 1982 under the new guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to encourage young unemployed people to take full advantage of skills, training, work experience and education programs. The Government firmly believes that it is in the best interests of the young unemployed to take part in those programs. They have been carefully designed to help young people prepare themselves in every way for employment. For those young unemployed who may not be able to take part in these programs, the new and, we believe, better Community Youth Support Scheme will provide a practical way of improving their position to a level where they can take advantage of existing employment, education and training opportunities. In drawing the new guidelines, my Department will consult with community interests, including the National Youth Advisory Group, the Youth Affairs Council of Australia, church bodies, State governments, local government associations, State CYSS committees, and associations of CYSS committees and project officers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has always said that youth unemployment is a major concern. It is not only an economic problem but also a matter of great personal and social concern. It believes that by the procedure now announced it can draw on wide community resources to help solve a difficult human problem. The funds to enable the Scheme to function until 28 February 1982 will come from resources within the present Budget of the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I will repeat one part of the statement. The final point I made with respect to the specific decisions of the Government is that the Community Youth Support Scheme will continue after 28 February 1982 under the new guidelines. We are confident that the new guidelines will produce a new and better scheme. It remains only for me to thank those people both outside this House and within the House who have made constructive suggestions to the Government. I would like to place on record that the Government has considered very carefully all of those suggestions from honourable members and senators and community representatives and organisations outside the House. Those representations, particularly from houourable members, have been of considerable assistance to the Government in reaching these decisions. I present the following paper:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-What the Opposition has to say on this matter falls into two parts. I will briefly dispose of the first part. We believe that the Government has laid itself open to criticism in respect of the timing and making of the announcement. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was speaking to the House in the Budget debate in the half hour leading up to 6 p.m. this evening. Clearly, the decision had been made by that time. We believe it obviously appropriate that, the decision having been made by then, the Prime Minister should not have treated this House with contempt by not making the statement to the House. Clearly, if he wanted some extension of time to his prepared speech to make such an announcement that extension of time would readily have been granted.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reminded that he stopped five minutes early. I make the point that, at a time when this Parliament is saying that it is taking the question of the standard of the Parliament seriously and that someone is being dealt with in respect of prima facie contempt, it would have been much better if the Prime Minister had done the House the courtesy of making the announcement to the House. I could understand the desire of the Government then to make the broader announcement as the Minister did on PM. I think the House would have been better served if it had been done in the other way. In that respect the Acting Leader of the Opposition, Mr Lionel Bowen, has made a statement which has the support of the Opposition in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having made that statement in a responsibile manner, I come with much more happiness to the second part of what I wish to say. I have said publicly and, as the Minister knows, I have said privately, that in regard to this matter we do not seek to make political capital. It is quite clear that if the decision had stood we would probably have been able to do better out of it in political terms. But we do not approach the matter in that way. On behalf of the opposition and with its full support I congratulate the Government on having changed this decision. As one who this week has been very much concerned in attacking the Government, it gives me very much pleasure on behalf of the Opposition to say to the Government that we congratulate it on its change of heart and decision. It is a change of heart and decision which will be applauded by every member of this House and, I believe, the other place as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not completed all that I have to say at this stage by extending congratulations to the Government for this change of decision. We should extend congratulations to members on both sides of the House, the young people themselves who have been involved in CYSS projects, the CYSS officers, the churches and the other community organisations in this country who have properly used the processes of democracy in this matter. They have been faced with a political decision of which they did not approve and they have used the processes of democracy peaceably to make their opposition known. To the Government's credit it has responded to the use of the democratic processes and it is to be congratulated. </PARA>
<PARA> The final thing that has to be said-I appreciate the sense in which the Minister to some extent picked up this point-is that we should all conclude on the note of acknowledging that we are talking about a problem which transcends partisan considerations. It is not just an economic problem we are dealing with. It has tragic dimensions for this community. The Government has recognised that and it will keep the CYSS projects going. I congratulate it. I hope that the organisations to which the Minister has referred will be able to take part in the review and will throw their full resources positively and constructively into assisting the Government so that at the end of that process a better Community Youth Support Scheme will emerge. It will provide to young people some hope and feeling that the community has not abandoned them and the great resource involved in those young people will, at the earliest possible time, be made available to play a constructive part in the community. I conclude by unequivocally congratulating the Government, in the terms I have mentioned, for the decision it has made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to delay the House for any great length of time. I congratulate the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) and the Government for having recognised this problem. I am glad that the decision has been taken to provide a continuing basis of support particularly for those people who were able to receive the benefit of the Community Youth Support Scheme but who would not have been able to receive the benefit of the training programs which have received an enormous increase in funding from the Federal Government. We have to recognise that an enormous proportion of the people who should have been receiving the benefits of CYSS were not in fact getting that benefit. A very large number of unemployed youth did not get the benefit of CYSS programs because they were not appropriate to them. That is why I welcome not only the decision to continue CYSS in its present form for a while, while examining appropriate changes but, in particular, I welcome the Minister's decision to re-examine the guidelines so that there will be a much more meaningful involvement of unemployed young people in CYSS programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would be wrong for us to assume, as the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Blewett) said this afternoon that CYSS has been a total success. It has not provided as much of the benefit as I would have hoped in many areas. I hope that the introduction of professional assistance in the CYSS area, particularly from some of the very highly skilled agencies which have examined this kind of program overseas, will be possible as the result of the re-examination of the guidelines. Many of the amateurs-if I may use that word-who were heavily involved in CYSS were learning as they went rather than bringing real skills into a very detailed, difficult and complicated area of assistance to young people. I simply want to thank the Government for having reconsidered its decision. I express the hope that the reconsideration of the guidelines will make CYSS much more relevant and appropriate in the future than it has been in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the past few weeks, as the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) indicated, we have seen democracy at work in a real sense. In Melbourne about three weeks ago a meeting was called at very short notice of representatives of Community Youth Support Scheme projects throughout Victoria. That meeting was attended by a very large number of project officers representing schemes throughout Victoria. Mr Deputy Speaker, I assure you that the people who spoke on this issue did so with a feeling that was very genuine. They were genuinely concerned about a step which the Government had taken without thinking the matter through. The proposal to terminate CYSS projects and then evaluate the program was ridiculous. Because of the groundswell against this decision the Government has now reconsidered. I reiterate what the honourable member for Wills said. The Government and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) deserve to be congratulated. We have said that no political capital would be gained on this side of the House from that decision being taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the past four and a half years the number of young people receiving unemployment benefit in this country has increased by 80 per cent. The training programs which were proposed will not cater for many of those young people. The dedication, particularly of project officers and in many areas the community support which was given to the CYSS projects have been vindicated by the fact that all sorts of people have come together on this matter. As was indicated earlier tonight, not only the project officers but also the participants in the projects have worked very hard over the past few weeks. The efforts of the churches and various welfare groups all came together. It was a very interesting exercise in that it shows that if the people of Australia feel sufficiently strongly about something they will come together. At that meeting in Melbourne, which was held about three weeks ago, there were people of all political persuasions and from every area of society. There were presidents, members of CYSS committees, project officers, social workers and all sorts of other people. But they all had one thing in mind-to bring as much pressure as possible on this Government to reverse a very cruel decision which was taken without any consideration at all. </PARA>
<PARA> These young people face many problems. They receive $36 a week and many of them are homeless. At the moment young people are camping in a tent outside the municipal offices in Dandenong, something which is causing grave concern to the council and the people of Dandenong. That happened today. When I was advised that that position had arisen this afternoon, I was very disturbed. I think the repercussions of the Government's decision would have continued and, in fact, we would have had a very nasty situation developing when CYSS was terminated. Over the past few weeks some very harsh things have been said-I think they were said with absolute justification-about the steps taken by this Government. Some very harsh things were said about the Minister for Employment and Youth affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) which I think were also justified. I conclude by repeating what I said when I commenced my speech. I congratulate the Minister and the Government on the decision taken tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the spirit of the night, I will be brief. I merely say that as chairman of the Community Youth Support Scheme committee in my electorate since the Scheme was started, the decision taken tonight by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) is very much appreciated, not on policital grounds, not for reasons of recrimination or who was responsible for what. The unemployed youth in my area will be greatly benefited by the decision taken tonight. Honourable members might recall that I commented yesterday in another area that I admired the Government's decision to switch its emphasis towards the training aspect for unemployed youth. I commend the Government for its decision tonight. Its decision with respect to unemployed youth is still to move to training but to keep a community, non-governmental department involvement in the problem of those people who, in most cases, are incapable of finding work for themselves. Under the same circumstances, those people will be incapable of finding training programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the decision taken tonight is a very good one. In February 1982 the new guidelines are created. In my area we have called the Scheme SPEC-the special pre-employment centres scheme. We have never called it the CYSS. Perhaps the name of the Scheme could be changed to something like that. But the title is irrelevant. The functions are the most important thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the Minister for his decision. I am sorry to hear groans from honourable members opposite in this regard. I congratulate the Minister for the sensitivity he has shown towards the problems affecting unemployed people. One of the great things that have been achieved through CYSS--</PARA>

The decision is to be welcomed and the Minister is to be congratulated for his sensitivity. I hope that after February 1982 we will see a revamped progressive scheme that combines both the work search aspect of CYSS and the training program that was brought in by the Budget. I am confident that with the Minister's administration of his portfolio we will see a happy marriage of both those things and community backed committees which will help the officials around the country. I am sure that this will have the total support not only of the churches, the volunatry organisations or the people who have worked on these schemes so far but also of organisations such as employers and the trade union movement which has been most forthcoming where CYSS has been successful. I am sure that will continue. I congratulate the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with my colleagues on this side of the House in saying that we are pleased that the Government has reversed its decision. Frankly, we are grateful for any crumbs that fall from the table of this Government. The young unemployed of this country have been served a very harsh blow by this Government. The ruthlessness of the Budget in cutting back in this area was inhuman in the first place, so much so that there was a great deal of protest across the nation. The young people joined together and created public demonstrations to make sure that the Community Youth Support Scheme was not done away with. In a sense, it really brought something to those young people. Even though we in the Opposition were critical of the Scheme in the first place, it is remarkable how it brought some compassion and unity to people. It was a kind of a bringing together of many unemployed people who needed some compassion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sad thing about young unemployed people is the hopelessness of their positions. CYSS was successful in its own way in bringing those young people together. Many honourable members on this side of the House have said: 'That Scheme is good in itself, but what we really need to do is to build on to it'. All honourable members in this Parliament need to search for broad programs to do away with unemployment in this country. That is the major problem which we have to solve in the long term. At present young people under the age of 18 years are getting $36 a week. That figure has not changed since 1975. They are now $37 a week under the poverty line. As a result of pegging the unemployment benefit at $36 a week for people under the age of 18 years the cumulative savings of this Fraser Government in all of its Budgets since November 1975 have amounted to $53m. This Government has stolen $53m out of the pockets of the young unemployed of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We are pleased that this Government has given a few crumbs to those people. But it is about time. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) and back bench members started to put pressure on the Government to raise living standards. What is the equivalent value now of that 1975 $36 payment? That amount would have more than doubled and would be in the vicinity of $72 to $73 a week if allowances were made for the normal cost of living increases in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> What I was most pleased about was the self-help and, as the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) said, the agitation. The young people organised themselves throughout this country and held protest meetings. I actually spoke to a meeting of between 500 and 1,000 people in the Town Hall Square in Sydney recently. It was a public rally held according to democratic principles to express concern at the Government's drastic action in abolishing the CYSS scheme. Also I must commend the role of the churches of all denominations across this country. Their representatives conferred and spoke out against the actions of the Government. Delegations came here and expressed their criticism and their protest to the Government and to Government Ministers. For instance, tonight I actually spoke with young people who really were pleased with the success of their campaign to save this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that what we have to do if democracy is to function in this country, if we cannot convince the Government by debate in the Parliament, is to see that action is taken in a democratic and peaceful way throughout our society. This is one example of how the people have said that the Government decision was wrong and inhumane and that they wanted that decision reversed. If we are to congratulate anybody for changing that decision we should congratulate the people because this is a victory for the people over the Government. The Government has said that it was wrong, that this was an inhumane decision, that public opinion was against it, and it submitted to that view. The Government certainly has been under pressure, particularly the Cabinet, in this last week. It has been under the pressure of criticism from the Government side. We have seen Ministers misleading the House. We have seen charges of collusion on the part of Ministers and the Prime Minister. We on this side of the House have seen charges of collusion on the part of senior Cabinet Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> We are pleased that the Government has seen the light. It has seen the light because it knows that public criticism is running against it. If it cannot lift its sights, if it cannot show a bit more compassion for those people affected, if it cannot build economic policies that will overcome the unemployment problem in this country, it at least can raise the level of the unemployment benefit paid to people under the age of 18 years. Honourable members know that $36 a week is now $37 a week under the poverty line. So far as I am concerned, it is about time some of those smug complacent people on the Government back benches started to criticise and put pressure on the Government to give a more compassionate living to those people whom it has forced into unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the CYSS scheme will develop into a scheme which will give greater confidence and greater comradeship to young unemployed people. That is an important aspect because these young unemployed people are lonely; they need compassion, comradeship and support. At least the Minister is starting to recognise that this Scheme in fact gives them that. The Scheme will exist until February, and I hope the scheme that comes forward after February will be even much more progressive. I hope it will be a much more generous scheme. I hope in the long term, and in the not too far distant future, that the Minister will advocate and, ultimately, will get from Cabinet an increased payment for the unemployed until such time as he can convince the Government to reverse its policies and start to bring in more compassionate policies so that more young people can be fully employed in this society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1981-82 as a Government supporter. I congratulate the Government on re-implementing the Community Youth Support Scheme, although I must say that indecision in regard to change is probably better than a change of the type under consideration. All the training in the world is no good to anybody unless jobs are available. That is what our Government is about. I rebuff the comments made by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). He said that the Government is not progressive and imaginative. I believe that it is. He said that we were not seeking to create job opportunities. But I point out that business confidence has actually increased to a greater extent in the last 12 months than it has at any time in the previous 20 years. I also remind the honourable member that the inflation rate, although it is still too high, has been kept at a reasonable level and is nothing like the 17 per cent that we experienced under the Whitlam Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BF4">Mr IAN CAMERON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was enough; I can assure the honourable member. One quarter was one quarter too much. I assure the honourable member for Wills that, if he had been in government under Whitlam, he probably would not be here today. I guess we are all treasurers at heart, as most honourable members on this side of the House own and run businesses of some kind or another. It is a basic fact that we handle the Australian financial system better than the Opposition. I would like to do better than John Howard, and that is good for the challenge keeps him and his department working at their task. No one can deny that the honourable member for Bennelong is a hard working Treasurer and manages the economy well with what he has to work with. Total receipts are up to $40 billion, which is an increase of $5.5 billion or a rise of 15.8 per cent. Total tax revenue is up $5.3 billion to $37.7 billion, an increase of 16.3 per cent. Expenditure is $40.8 billion. In real terms, with an adjustment for the extra pay day, there is a real increase in expenditure of one per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It disappoints me that government spending continues to grow, even marginally. Although a cut of $500m was made by the revenue review committee and a staff ceiling reduction of 9,000 was imposed on the Public Service, we still see that overall tax collection and expenditure are growing. Somehow or other we have to find the means to stop that because we cannot continue to pay higher and higher taxes forever. I believe more emphasis should be placed on the processing of our resources. I applaud the Government for encouraging the iron and steel industry by allowing it a greater write-off in depreciation. I believe this should be extended to other resource industries in order to help ease unemployment. I think we have reached the stage in our development at which we should be looking at processing much more of our raw resources here in Australia. Surely there is no better way to increase employment than to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I oppose the shifting of the tax base to indirect taxation. I have expressed my opinion on this matter before. I believe that it militates against employment in that it does not encourage small businesses to employ people because they are paying tax before they show a profit. I do not believe that that is good for employment. No one can employ unless he has a profit and the balance that is over enables him to employ more people. The Government is using the Asprey Taxation Review Committee to project this theory. I put it to the Government that it was set up under the Whitlam Government. Surely it must have been in the interests--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BF4">Mr IAN CAMERON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am, because the Asprey Committee was set up under the Whitlam Government and we are still using it as a reason for shifting the base of taxation. If we are to argue that, we should have an inquiry of our own. We should not be obliged to have anything whatever to do with the Whitlam Government. It really depends on the line we push as to how we encourage people to think about what sort of taxation they should be paying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I only hope that Cabinet is as generous in looking at the anomalies in sales tax as it has been with the Community Youth Support Scheme. I believe it has been generous in continuing the scheme. Let us hope that Cabinet will give them due consideration when the sales tax Bills came back to this House. Surely some of the anomalies must be looked at, particularly the severe rate of 17 1/2 per cent that has been applied to some goods. In some cases, it has gone from nothing to 17 1/2 per cent-an enormous increase in tax. This is particularly so in the case of people in my electorate purchasing grain trucks. The tourist industry is another industry which has been very hard hit. I believe we have to look again at this tax. I think that there should be only a 2 1/2 per cent increase for these anomalies and it should apply as from 1 January when the other 2 1/2 per cent sales tax increases come into operation. I believe that is the only fair and just way to apply the new increase. Those people who are being asked to pay the 2 1/2 per cent increase from 1 January are being given a breathing space to adjust their businesses to the new tax. I believe that should also apply to those expected to pay the enormous increase of 17 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Air navigation charges have been increased to 20 per cent. This is slightly higher than we expected. We were hoping that it would only be in line with the consumer price index increase. The Government and the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) need to be congratulated for rejecting the general aviation report whereby we were going to see enormous increases in charges. Trans Australia Airlines has announced that it intends to withdraw from the F27 routes in Queensland. These basically are the routes up the coast and inland. We will have to look at maintaining those essential services and at seeking a subsidy from the Government to do so. I think that is fair and equitable. The report of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares recommended that this happen. Tasmania has received $5m to do exactly that. I do not particularly like playing one State off against another but perhaps Tasmania is a good example to use. I hope that Cabinet will be feeling generous when we put the proposition to it that an extra $3m will be needed to continue operations in that part of the world. That money will have to go either to Bush Pilots Airways Ltd or to TAA. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates are far too high, and this is an enormous burden on rural Australia. Those of us who have businesses or farms have to borrow large sums of money to continue operating throughout the year. Usually all our income comes in at once, whether one is shearing sheep, selling cattle or growing wheat. Normally, after a period, one has to borrow large amounts of money to carry on until one's next income arrives. I believe this has a disproportionate effect on people in rural Australia as against people in business who have a continuing income. Let us hope that interest rates will come down. The fact that we have budgeted for a surplus suggests that we are pointing in the right direction. In the past few weeks we have seen a decrease of about one per cent in the United States interest rate. I am hopeful that overall we will see a steady decline in interest rates. The overall tax collection is now 28.8 per cent of the gross domestic product. This is a rise of 2.8 per cent on that of last year. Unfortunately, it is continuing to go up. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is not good economics to rely on capital inflow to balance our Budget. I believe we should be encouraging business to produce and to export more and to look for more overseas markets as this is the only safe and sound way to run our business. We cannot rely on the income of overseas speculators and on other income coming into the country. It is projected that in the next 12 months we will have an increase in the capital inflow of $2 billion-roughly from 6.8 per cent to 8.8 per cent. I thing we would have to have pure luck on our side to maintain that sort of inflow. I do not think it is a good idea to put ourselves in the position of having to rely on so much money to balance the trade portion of our Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government must be congratulated for reviewing zone allowances. These allowances affect a great area of my electorate. I only hope that when the final decision is made-as yet, it has not been made-we will see substantial increases in those allowances. Surely anybody living and working in that part of the world deserves some consideration for putting up with the environment. Today, we see unionists getting site allowances and things such as that when they live within a stone's throw of Brisbane, for instance. If it is good enough for them to get something, those people who live permanently in the western part of Queensland and other parts of rural Australia ought to be compensated to some extent. The Industries Assistance Commission has been asked to look at protection to all of industry. Let us hope that its report is taken up by Cabinet and that we will see a gradual reduction in tariffs because surely that is long overdue. We can no longer afford the luxury of heavily protecting inefficient industries to the detriment of efficient industries. Most of the industries in rural Australia are highly efficient because they are operating on a world market without any protection whatsoever. Defence spending is up by 16.3 per cent or 5.3 per cent in real terms. I think that is important. </PARA>

We can thank the National Country Party for that piece of pork-barrelling, if you like. As I said, defence spending is up by 16.3 per cent or 5.3 per cent in real terms. That is one of the main reasons why the Budget income has had to be increased. Surely defence spending is worthwhile because we must have good defence in Australia if we are to survive in the long term. Education expenditure is up by 11.1 per cent to $3.255 billion. The freight equalisation subsidy on petroleum products is now worth $129m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The levy on raw oil is worth $3.44 billion or an increase of 10.7 per cent. I have always opposed the crude oil pricing policy and I will continue to do so because I believe it militates against those who have to live away from the points of refining. The further away one gets the more of the product one uses and the greater the tax one pays. I believe that is unjust. At present, over 50 per cent of all we spend on petroleum products goes to the Government by way of indirect taxation. So when someone accuses me of not paying enough tax I politely tell that person that when I start up my tractor I use an awful lot of fuel and half of it goes up the chimney stack as taxation to the Government. I believe it is important that in the long term we look at alleviating this problem. We have to find some way in which to subsidise the people who live further out, in inland Australia. At present the equalisation scheme applies to the wholesale price only. We find with price cutting obviously that the more people in capital cities there are, the more price cutting goes on and the cheaper the fuel becomes. The further out one moves the dearer the retail price becomes. In actual fact, the whole system is militating against those people who live inland from the coast. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bring to the attention of the Parliament and the Government the poor logic involved in plans by Australia Post to close the Koongamia post office in my electorate. I am aware that Australia Post must operate as efficiently as possible and that at times this will mean that some post offices will have to be discontinued because the expense of providing them cannot be justified by the marginally greater convenience they offer when compared with other offices. However, it appears to me that this argument is currently being applied in a very simplistic manner. Australia Post is closing the Koongamia post office on the grounds that usage, measured in the numbers of telegrams, articles posted, money orders and so on, has dropped to a level where the cost can no longer be justified. It also claims that other services, in this case at the post office in Midland, are quite accessible. If this arguement were used in relation to a post office of the usual type in its own building, occupying land, having a permanent staff, this might make sense, though the access to alternatives would be debatable. I will return to that question presently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main point, however, is that the Koongamia post office is an agency. It is located in a general store occupying about one square metre of floor space behind a wooden frame built by the shop owner. There is no permanent staff. The shop owner gets paid according to the numbers of each type of post office transaction he conducts. In this situation it is hard to see how Australia Post could save money by closing it down. Australia Post has no capital invested there and it pays no rent. No matter how low the volume of business gets it is still paying the same proportion of income for labour. An Australia Post van will still have to visit the location because the post box outside the shop is to be retained. On the other hand, Midland is already a busy post office. Constituents have complained of waiting lengthy periods in queues, particularly at peak times such as lunch hours. If Koongamia and two similar post offices outside my electorate, but in the same general area, close down then Australia Post will need to put on more full time staff in Midland to handle the extra work. The cost benefit of closing the small agency type offices becomes even harder to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the question of convenience of access to the alternative Midland post office. The buses run approximately at the rate of one an hour during the week between Midland and Koongamia. It has been argued by Australia Post that most people in the area go to Midland to shop and can use the post office at the same time. Apart from the fact that this limits access to once a week it should be pointed out that this is a solid, working class suburb and many of the people would shop on Saturday morning or on Thursday late night shopping when the post office is not open. I hope the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) will review the process by which decisions to close post offices are made. I would particularly like to know how the agency type of post office would be losing money. The Koongamia post office should not be closed and a full review of this sitaution should be made. </PARA>
<PARA> I go on tonight to congratulate the project officers of the Swan, Belmont and Victoria Park Community Youth Support Scheme projects for the very successful campaign that they and their committees under the chairmenship of Lyla Elliot, Fred McKenzie and John Hudson waged to retain the very vital service that they perform for many young people in the Swan area. That service is irreplaceable. I am pleased to say that that service will now not have to be replaced because of the reversal of the Government decision that the pressure of these individual committees has successfully brought about. I want to thank, too, the many service organisations which have supported them over the years and which will now have an opportunity to go on supporting them. I am glad that they will now see that their money has not been wasted, that the projects that they have pursued over some years now will be properly accorded the financial assistance that their success deserves. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased too, particularly in the Midland area because there we have had, at least until the Swan CYSS project opened, a very considerable problem with the activity of youth gangs. These substantially diminished during the time of the operation of the CYSS project and many people in Midland feared that there would be a resurrection of that type of antisocial behavior. There will not be. Many young people will continue to be given hope by the operations of these projects. I hope that none of the reviews of the guidelines close down any of the very important activities that those organisations have undertaken. We will, along with those committees, be watching that very closely. I assure those committees that I shall be watching the changes to guidelines very closely in this House to make absolutely certain that for some very considerable time into the future, until the problem of youth unemployment is solved, their very real contribution to the solution of that problem will be maintained. </PARA>

Brown) and the Government for their decision to continue the funding of the Community Youth Support Scheme. I will not speak tonight on the decision as announced by the Minister. Since the Budget decision was made to terminate the scheme on 31 October this year I had constantly expressed my concern to the Minister that a number of CYSS participants would not be adequately catered for in the newly expanded and funded job training, work experience and education programs which the Government announced in the Budget. I expressed this concern to the Minister personally. I spoke in this Parliament on the same subject on 27 August. I spoke within my Party on this subject and in the Estimates Committee which dealt with the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs on 15 September. The point was made that because of the particular problems of CYSS participants-many of them have been unemployed for a long while-they lacked confidence. They do not necessarily fit into institutionally based and broadly based bureaucratically administered programs. Because of these characteristics pertaining to CYSS participants I was most concerned that they might not be taken up in the new programs of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the Estimates Committee debate I think the most interesting thing to come out was that, in answer to one of my questons, it was stated by one of the officers of the Department:</PARA>
<PARA> No statistics are kept on the characteristics of the participants in CYSS . . . </PARA>
<PARA>To me this obviously indicated that there was no guarantee that the CYSS participants with their particular problems would be embraced by the new schemes announced by the Government in the Budget. So, for that reason I am very pleased that the Government has decided to continue funding the CYSS program. I think that there has to be a reassessment of the guidelines under which CYSS programs operate. I believe that the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs needs to monitor the CYSS projects more closely than it has done in the past because if it does not there is a real danger that the particular projects which do not work will, in fact, prejudice the good schemes which exist throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think CYSS needs more secure funding arrangements than it has had in the past where it really lived on a six-monthly basis not knowing what its future was. I believe also that there needs to be less of an administrative burden placed on the project officers of these schemes who, instead of being able to get on with their job of looking after unemployed youths, have to spend so much time carrying out a very heavy administrative load. I do not think that is satisfactory. I believe also that the CYSS projects have to be given official sanction to carry out a greater orientation towards job placements. In the past and certainly initially job placement was not considered to be a role of the CYSS program. I think this was utterly ridiculous. Certainly, in my electorate I know of projects which had a great deal more success than, say, the Commonwealth Employment Service in putting young unemployed youths into appropriate jobs in a very short time. I believe that is something which the Government must consider when these guidelines are being reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I just make the point that I think that the democratic process has been well served by the decision of the Government. There was a great deal of agitation for the retention of CYSS. I believe that the Government was quite right in its decision. I support that decision and wish again to congratulate the Minister and the Government for deciding to continue the funding of the CYSS program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw attention tonight to the appalling inadequacies in the Government's highly publicised program of aids for disabled people. This program has finally been implemented, after a 10 month delay. The State of Victoria is to receive the sum of $600,000 this financial year, to be divided between 28 hospitals in the State. The program has been advertised as assistance for disabled people to receive aids such as wheelchairs, walking aids and home modifications, and has been given considerable publicity by the Government Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar), in this International Year of Disabled Persons. However, I suggest that the experience of several of my constituents with this scheme has shown that it is little more than a publicity stunt at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to describe the case of a young disabled girl in my electorate. This girl was born on 26 January 1963. It was discovered that she had a partial cleft palate and a defect in her nasal passage. She subsequently had three operations on her mouth and throat before she was three years old at a cost ot approximately $3,000. Her health gradually deteriorated and at the age of 6 1/2 she contracted rheumatoid arthritis. Her parents spent the next four years taking her to one of Melbourne's best arthritic specialists. By the time she was 11 she was confined to a wheelchair and had reacted adversely to the drugs prescribed for her condition. She was unable to attend a normal school, so her parent moved to a suburb close to Balwyn so that they could have their daughter attended Yooralla special school. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1980 this girl spent nine months in the Austin Hospital and underwent five operations. In the last operation, her hip joints were removed as the surgeons were hoping to replace these joints with plastic hips. However, due to the severe deterioration of her bones they were unable to replace these joints. She is now without hips and her legs project at right angles from her body. Her knee joints calcified while in plaster and they cannot be bent. Before he hips were removed, she was able to roll onto her side when lying down, but this is now impossible for her. She is in constant pain from her physical condition, which make transportation by car a nightmare, as well as an extremely awkward operation due to the angle of her legs. This is only a brief outline of this young girl's condition. She is bright and intelligent, interested in art and craft activities and particularly interest in the possibility of showing Chinchilla cats at cat shows, if she could be suitably transported to venues. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately such transportation at present is impossible. Even attendance at day centre is impossible as the staff are unable to cope with her physical condition. She is virtually stranded in her home, an has in fact only left this home twice this year, to attend the Austin Hospital. I point out that the parents of this girl have, over the past 18 years, been involved in considerable personal expense in order to alleviate the severe physical disabilities and pain which their daughter has suffered. They have built a new home with suitable modifications to allow her some mobility within this environment. This cost them $50,000. Other expenses incurred have included two wheelchairs for $800, a bath chair for $450, a lifting machine for $1,200, a special heating light for $130, a special bed for $900, and a slide table for $20, as well as the continual expenses of sheepskins, medication and other on-going requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The girl's father brings home $214.05 per week. Her mother works at night and on Saturday afternoon to supplement this income, as their daughter cannot be left alone. There are three other children in the family. Inevitably this couple has found the expense of providing for their daughter a considerable drain on their finances and their need for support has now become desperate. They were advised to apply for help under the program of aids for disabled people and prepared a submission for such help. They wish to be able to purchase a van to enable their daughter to leave her home without pain, and require financial help with a battery operated wheelchair and a hoist for the chair. I supported this submission from her parents and assumed that such a deserving case would have little trouble in gaining help. </PARA>
<PARA> However, when the parents approached the hospital they were virtually laughed at, and told that their daughter's requirements would take up the whole of the hospital's allocation. They have received no help at all from this program. It seems extraordinary to me that such a case of extreme hardship and tragedy, where a family has worked so hard and for so long to help their daughter, and devoted enormous sums of money to this, can get no relief from a program supposedly designed to help such cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary objective of the International Year of Disabled Persons, as proclaimed by the United Nations, is to promote 'full participation and equality' for disabled people in everyday community life. I therefore call on the Minister to extend this scheme until it becomes a genuine vehicle for enabling disabled people to have some real access to the community. Realistic funding must be provided for the numbers of people desperately in need of this help. </PARA>

But I would like to issue a note of warning, not only to Government members. I think members of the Opposition should heed the warning too. They have done a fair bit of talking about CYSS since it has been in a state of flux, but they did not say very much about it when we originated it. They did not say so much about it during the difficult times, and there have been difficult times with CYSS. I think we are now all charged with the responsibility of making absolutely certain that the right project officers handle CYSS. We were critical of a few who were not the right types to be looking after young people. That is a fact of life.</PARA></TALK.START>

Therefore, we have that responbility to make absolutely certain that we have the right people looking after CYSS. Then if we extend CYSS we will have good programs throughout Australia and we can do something positive for the young people. This will need the co-operation of the Opposition and, of course, the co-operation of the Government. If in the future we have a bad scheme then we, as parliamentary representatives, should curtail it. We should have that responsibility and we should not leave it to the Commonwealth Employment Service or to some public servants who would not have a clue about what makes a good CYSS program tick.

Surely that is what has created most of the problems in Tasmania at the moment-our poor Premier cannot make a decision. He has made another disastrous decision. He has left out of the referendum the critical question about whether there should be no dams at all. A lot of people seem to be very interested in Tasmania now. They were not interested before. They are not interested when we have a strike, but they all seem to want to come to Tasmania with their haversacks on their backs looking at the stars and saying they are going to make it survive for the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter not in any sense in an attempt to score off anyone but just to put a point of view, in an endeavour to get some assurances from the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) who I hope either will be listening or will be on his way to the chamber, on the recent aircraft accident in Sydney, the findings that the Minister tabled in this place on Tuesday and some of the information that is now starting to float out with regard to air operations. Whilst I realise that a commission of inquiry has been appointed to investigate the aircraft accident investigation report, I still believe we should get some assurances from the Minister that the Department is moving to ensure that the things that possibly brought about this tragic accident are not going to happen again. I draw the attention of the House to conclusion 5 on page 42 which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The aircraft operating weight used by the company did not make allowance for all the equipment carried on the aicraft. </PARA>
<PARA>The last sentence in conclusion 6 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Weight Sheet incorrectly indicated that the aircraft was loaded within the maximum permitted limit. </PARA>
<PARA>In actual fact it was not. On page 43, conclusion 7 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The fuel load figure used by the pilot was in error by some 40 kg. The reason for this error could not be established. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion 13 states:</PARA>
<PARA> A take-off at the company limit of 700 degree centigrade reduced the power available by approximately 23 per cent and, under the ambient conditions, reduced the single-engine performance to a critical level. </PARA>
<PARA>This was done, obviously, with the approval, knowledge and direction of the company. On page 44, conclusion 14 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Officers of the Department of Transport were aware of the unapproved practices in respect of standard passenger weights and reduced power take-offs but action had not been taken to regularise the company's operations. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion 15 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Although the aircraft was equipped with an auto-feather system, it was company policy, in the interests of fleet standardisation, not to use the system. </PARA>
<PARA>Was it for the safety of the passengers who were flying in that aeroplane that that was done or was it a case of the company stretching to the limit the operations of the aircraft to give maximum profit? I am trying to get the Minister for Transport's assurance that the Department is acting to ensure that all of these matters will be rectified. Conclusions 16 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The take-off was probably made with power set at the company limit of 700 degree centigrade ITT. </PARA>
<PARA>All the way through the report there are issues that indicate a laxity that has crept into the industry. The commuter industry is now a very substantial means of transport for thousands of people. Over a hundred thousand people fly from Newcastle to Sydney every year on commuters. It was clearly established in this report that the aircraft was 128 kilograms overweight. That is an unacceptable weight in the size of that aeroplane. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see the honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield) here. A Press report in today's Sydney Morning Herald which has obviously been checking on these matters states that the big jets are cutting back on power so as to reduce the level of noise to the people living under flight paths. That noise is just too bad for the people living there. The Department should ensure those aircraft are taking off and landing in conformity with the rules laid down in the manuals for take-off, weight, speed and all aspects that are necessary to ensure safety of operation. It is also claimed that aircraft are now using the full length of runways so they can take off with reduced power and so save wear and tear on the engine. I hope that the Minister will come into the House and give us an answer to some of these questions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's national water resources program was recently announced. It provides for expenditure this year on capital items of $34.9m. This is an increase of approximately 20 per cent over last year's allocation. It provides limited scope for some new initiatives. We feel that the allocation for water resources in this country should be far in excess of $34.9m. This is the driest continent in the world. Unless we make provision for the storage of water we will face some very serious problems. Indeed these problems are with us today. These schemes have been put forward and are now under consideration. An announcement about them will be made at a later date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is pleasing to see that an allocation of $1.5m has been made for the Split Rock Dam project on the Manilla River, approximately 10 kilometres upstream from the town of Manilla. This dam is designed to store 370,000 megalitres. It will increase the flow in the Namoi River by about 30 per cent. This then flows into the great Keepit Dam, of course, which provides water for 200 or 300 miles down the Namoi River and particularly to the great cotton industry at Wee Waa. It is very important that the building of this dam be continued. It is to be hoped that the New South Wales Government, which has not given the Commonwealth its priorities to date, provides more funds this year for the building of the Split Rock Dam. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is very serious in the Hunter River area. The capacity of the great Glenbawn Dam is down to 20 per cent. It was at 8 per cent but rain filled it up to 20 per cent. Very dry conditions exist in the Hunter Valley and in the north- west of New South Wales at present. Indeed, a very serious drought condition exists. It is very important that more water storages be built on the Hunter River. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bayswater Power Station, which is a very big power station, is being built. It and the Liddell Power Station, which is the biggest in the southern hemisphere, will draw their water from the Glenbawn Dam; so it can be seen that great problems exist. The dairy farmers down the Hunter River depend on this dam for irrigation water. The towns of Muswellbrook, Singleton and Scone depend on water as well from the Hunter River for the town supply. I note the State Government has commenced building a dam at Glennies Creek which is between Singleton and Muswellbrook and runs into the Hunter River. When this dam is completed, it will assist in providing further water supplies. But the Federal Government should be co-operating with the New South Wales Government in this area to see that more storages and dams are built. If more are not built, a calamitous situation will develop in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The coal industry is developing at a great pace at Singleton, Muswellbrook and, indeed, up to Scone. These mines will require great quantities of water; we all know that. It is hoped that the Commonwealth water resources authority has close liaison with the New South Wales Water Resources Commission and takes note of the serious situation that exists in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Major industrial development expected in the Hunter Valley over the next 25 years could mean that water needs will increase by at least three times the present need. If these needs are to be fully met, it is necessary that investigations be carried out immediately and water storage facilities implemented. Glennies Creek dam is now being constructed near Singleton. Proposals are in hand to enlarge the Glenbawn Dam. The Kerrabee Dam on the Goulburn River is also mentioned for the New South Wales program. The Goulburn River eventually flows into the Hunter at Denman. It is very important that every effort be made to increase our water storage, to provide more funds and to co-operate with the State Government to see that they are provided so that a calamitous situation will be avoided. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) (a) and (b) My Department has established noise abatement committees at the major capital city airports to facilitate, inter alia, public participation in finding the best possible answers to the aircraft noise problem.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr Malcolm Fraser</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 September 1981 the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) asked me a question, without notice, concerning the French nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The following is in answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware that on 12 August 1981 the French authorities in French Polynesia issued a communique declaring the temporary closure of the beach in the eastern part of Mururoa Atoll against the possibility that ''residues of the atmospheric tests conducted prior to 1975'' might have been deposited there following a period of bad weather. The French communique stated that ''the temporary situation that has been created is a result of atmospheric testing and had no link with the underground testing that has been carried out since 1975''.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has no information concerning any serious leaks of radioactivity in the waters of Mururoa Atoll. Nor does it have information which supports the suggestion that, due to venting, a large gap has been opened in the atoll below sea level. However, in in the light of the information provided by the Honourable Member, the Government is making urgent enquiries into this matter. In the absence of any further information it would of course be premature to canvass courses of action which might be open to it to take.</PARA>
<PARA> As will be known, Australia's continued opposition to the French nuclear testing program is firmly on record with the Government of France. Our position has been frequently conveyed to France, most recently during discussions in Paris in June between Mr Street and the French Foreign Minister, M. Cheysson.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia also supported the resolution adopted by the recent Twelfth Meeting of the South Pacific Forum in Vanuatu which, among other things, reaffirmed the Forum's strong condemnation of nuclear weapons testing and urged France immediately to cease its nuclear weapons testing program and provide full details of the effects of its past testing activities on Pacific people and the environment.</PARA>
