<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Transport, relates to the Holcroft report on air fares, which shows that last year economy class passengers subsidised first class passenger and other air fares to a total of some $12m. I ask: Is the Minister aware that the Government's new air fare policy will mean that economy class passengers will still be subsidising first class and other passengers by at least $7m a year? Will the Minister, as a matter of urgency and equity, redress this outrageous injustice whereby people, generally of modest means and paying their own fares, subsidise the air fares of first class passengers especially, most of whom are on business accounts?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr HUNT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition has identified an area of concern to the Government. It was certainly identified in the Holcroft report. In dealing with the application for the fare increase, which overall averages 8.9 per cent, the Government took into account the recommendations of the Holcroft report. It varied the ratio between first class fares and economy fares from 1.375:1 to 1.45:1. Instead of there being an 8.9 per cent increase across the board, the actual increase in economy fares was 7.4 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In further refining the recommendations of the Holcroft report prior to the consideration of the next application for a fare increase following fuel price rises, wage rises, et cetera, we will certainly take into account the point which was raised by Holcroft and which the Leader of the Opposition has identified. He can be sure that we will do all in our power to move as quickly as possible to achieve the equity that is necessary between first class passengers and economy class passengers. We are well and truly on the way. I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has suddenly woken up to something that happened while he was in government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Administrative Services: Is it a fact that seizures of cocaine bound for the Australian drug market have almost doubled in the past year? Is it a fact that a substantial part of these drug shipments have come from Central and South America? Is the Minister concerned that Australia may be a new target for hard drugs produced in Central and South America? What action is being taken to counter the threat of a large scale drug connection with these countries?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WM7">Mr NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police that the force is aware of an increased use of cocaine in Asia and the South Pacific Islands. I am also advised that the police are worried that there may be an attempt to extend the use of cocaine in that area by trafficking into Australia. I made an announcement on 14 January that the AFP, foreseeing an increase in heroin available in the Golden Triangle, would be taking measures to meet what was then seen as a threat. Likewise, the AFP is taking steps now to prepare itself for any increase in cocaine trafficking in Australia. The measures that have been taken are: Firstly, an AFP drug liaison officer will be making regular visits to the Pacific Islands area, particularly following major seizures of cocaine in Tahiti and Fiji. Secondly, an AFP drug liaison officer will be making a trip to South America to confer with officials there who are involved in limiting drug trafficking. An additional AFP officer has also been posted to Bangkok as a temporary measure to liaise with drug officials there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an area of grave concern for Australia. These measures will help. In addition, I emphasise two other areas in which the AFP is co-operating very strongly with State police forces. One is the establishment of joint task forces with State police officers and Australian Federal Police officers working together in specific areas against drug traffickers. Secondly, a very important step was taken at the last Federal Police Council to establish an Australian crime intelligence bureau which will allow the police forces to target specific drug offenders. I assure the House that not only the AFP but also the State police forces are working together to try to beat this threat.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Transport to his statement yesterday in which he indicated that the new air fares would increase the revenue of Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia by $1.2m a week, or over $62m a year. I ask: To what extent will that increase in revenue increase the profits of the two airlines?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr HUNT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I said that it was costing the airlines $1.2m in lost revenue is that because of increases in fuel prices and wages as from 1 January, since the last adjustment to fares, an overall increase of 8.9 per cent in air fares was justifiable. The fact that the fares were not adjusted resulted in the airlines losing about $600,000 in revenue per week. The Department of Transport, in examining the applications for fare increases, was absolutely satisfied in advising me that the fare increases were justified. It did not make any alteration to past criteria in respect of profit levels or profit margins.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</PARA>

<PARA>Press Guidance-US-Australian Agreement on B-52's</PARA>
<PARA> QUESTION: Can you confirm that the United States and the Government of Australia have reached agreement on the staging of United States B-52 flights from Australian air bases?</PARA>
<PARA> ANSWER: Under the terms of notes exchanged in Canberra on March 11, United States B-52's which are presently flying non-stop surveillance missions over the Indian Ocean from Guam will now land en route at Darwin Air Force Base in Northern Australia. The planes will conduct routine navigational training exercises en route to Darwin. After refueling and crew rest there, they will engage in surveillance missions over the Indian Ocean.</PARA>
<PARA> QUESTION: Will these aircraft be armed?</PARA>
<PARA> ANSWER: As the Prime Minister announced in Canberra March 11, these aircraft will be unarmed and carry no bombs. However, the B-52H aircraft that will be operated through Darwin is equipped with an integral tail gun for defensive purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> QUESTION: The Prime Minister of Australia has stated that before his Government could agree to any change in the nature of these missions, it would need to be informed concerning whether nuclear weapons were being carried. Can you comment on this?</PARA>
<PARA> ANSWER: No comment other than to point out that the Agreement specifies Australian Government approval be obtained before the facilities are used for any other category of operations. Furthermore, it remains the policy of this Government neither to confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons on particular missions.</PARA>
<PARA> QUESTION: Members of the Australian Labor Party have criticized the agreement between the United States and Australia concerning B-52 transits on the ground that there is no assurance that the United States will seek Australia's agreement on any change in operations under the Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> ANSWER: Article I of the Agreement states ''The B-52 staging operations shall be for sea surveillance in the Indian Ocean area and for navigation training purposes. The agreement of the Government of Australia shall be obtained before the facilities are used in support of any other category of operations.'' It is hard to imagine a more unequivocal requirement for prior consent by the Government of Australia in the event that different operations are contemplated by the United States.</PARA>
<PARA> QUESTION: Australian Labor Party spokesmen have argued that Articles VII and VIII override Article I and, therefore, eliminate the requirement of prior consent. What is your response?</PARA>
<PARA> ANSWER: Paragraph VII, which was proposed by the Government of Australia, contemplates consultations between the two governments to ensure that the Government of Australia has full and timely information concerning the B-52 operations. Paragraph VIII, also proposed by the Government of Australia, sets forth factors which the Government of Australia will weigh in considering whether to grant its agreement to any request by the United States for an alteration of the terms of the Agreement. The requirement for prior consent contained in Article I is unequivocal and absolute. It is not in any sense diluted by the consultations contemplated by Article VII. It is, in fact, strengthened by Article VIII which elaborates on the right of the Government of Australia to grant or withhold its consent to an alteration of the Agreement. There is absolutely no support in the text of the Agreement or in its negotiating history for the construction advanced by Labor Party spokesmen.</PARA>
<PARA> QUESTION: Labor Party spokesmen have argued that the Agreement is flawed because a formulation presented to Foreign Minister Street by Secretary Haig was not included in the formal Agreement. Can you comment?</PARA>
<PARA> ANSWER: The written Agreement is complete and embodies the entire understanding of the parties. The formulation presented to Minister Street was intended to be a suggestion of how the Agreement could be described and explained publicly. It does not in any sense contradict the Agreement; it is merely explanatory and in fact is similar to public statements which the United States Government has made concerning the Agreement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, in its consideration of the Holcroft inquiry's recommendations, took into account a very significant recommendation which indicated that in considering air fare adjustments it needed to be understood that discounts should not be applied in a way that would increase the economy fares of the ordinary travelling passenger. When the two airlines made their applications for fare increases they proposed a reduction in the APEX fare from 40 per cent to 35 per cent and a reduction in the standby percentage discount and in a number of other discount areas. It was a commercial decision taken by them. Since it accorded with the general thrust of the recommendations of the Holcroft report, the Government resolved to approve the application by the airlines.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am informed that yesterday a military group calling itself the Revolutionary Party announced that Prime Minister Prem had resigned and that it had assumed Government powers in Thailand. The group is led by the Army Deputy Commander-in-Chief, General Sant Chitpatima. I have to say, though, that there is considerable uncertainty about the situation. According to reports both General Prem and the King have gone to the north-east of Thailand and Prem has denied that he has resigned and he has called on the coup leaders to surrender. General Prem claims to have the support of all the army commands in the provinces, as well as the navy and the air force, but this has not yet been confirmed. Naturally the Australian Government hopes that the situation within Thailand can be resolved quickly and peacefully. According to information available to me, day-to-day life in Bangkok appears to be functioning normally and there have been no reports of any harm to Australian citizens in Bangkok. I understand that the airport is still operating normally. But in view of the uncertainty of the situation and the speed with which it could change, intending travellers to Thailand would be well advised to check with the airline concerned or with my Department before travelling. I need hardly add that the Australian Embassy in Bangkok is watching the situation closely.</PARA></TALK.START>

There are negotiations in relation to increased rail accessibility. I repeat for those who are genuinely interested in the problem, that it is something we believe can be accepted. We believe the Government's decisions are fair. We go further and say that those in the tourist industry will not react with the same knee-jerk, off-the-cuff reaction of the honourable member.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first question is yes. The adjustment that was made to air fares, as announced yesterday, was an interim response to the Holcroft recommendations. Further study will be done on the recommendations of the Holcroft report. The people associated with that report indicated that it would take some considerable time to adjust the basis of their recommendations to the 1980-81 financial year because they did their calculations on the 1979-80 year. Since then the costs to the airlines have risen by 30 per cent, so that could cause some distortion of the 1979-80 calculations. We will be seeking outside expert advice as is required to enable us to establish the Holcroft recommendations in the new air fare formula when the next adjustments are made to air fares in Australia. Our objective is to remove unfair cross-subsidisation that has worked against the best interests of people flying over long distances in this country. Although people may have to pay higher fares when commuting between Sydney and Canberra, they have been subsidised for a jolly long time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Seamen's Union of Australia and the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia have said that they will not handle uranium produced by Queensland Mines Ltd, and that they would prevent the export of it. This is, of course, frustrating the operations of that company. I point out that the contracts which are being honoured are contracts which were entered into before 1972. It was the undertaking of the Australian Council of Trade Unions-indeed I believe it is Australian Labor Party policy-that these contracts would be honoured. The Seamen's Union and, therefore, the Waterside Workers Federation are flying in the face of decisions previously taken. They are not honouring those decisions and, as a result, exports are being inhibited. I think it is a very poor state of affairs when people enter into long term contracts that these contracts are likely to be disrupted. The Government is certainly looking at the options to see what can be done. But, as far as Australia's reputation is concerned, the Government has no intention of seeing our name marred by the irresponsible actions of unions, particularly unions which will not even accept their own decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware, from what I have been told by the Commissioner of Taxation, and consistent with his obligations under the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, that a number of taxpayers are seeking to take advantage of the device that the honourable gentleman has very accurately described. It arises from the fact that a limited number of self-employed people, who are regarded as performing personal services, continue to be allowed by the Commissioner of Taxation to be taxed on a cash receipts basis, notwithstanding the effect of the High Court's decision in 1970 in the Henderson case, which effectively, as I understand it, gave the Commissioner of Taxation authority to require that all income be returned on an accruals basis. As a consequence of that decision people such as solicitors and accountants, but not doctors or barristers, were required to return their income on an accruals basis. As I am advised, the Commissioner of Taxation does not accept the efficacy and therefore the tax avoiding consequences of what this group of people is purporting to do. He has advised me that he will be contesting very vigorously what is being done. I might further inform the honourable gentleman and the House that, if those efforts are not successful, the Commissioner might consider taking further action, including requiring that an accruals form of taxation returning be adopted by people who presently enjoy the privilege of returning their income on a cash receipts basis, thus applying in full the authority given to him by the Henderson decision.</PARA></TALK.START>

We appreciate the difficulties but, notwithstanding the points that he made, it is pertinent to point out to the House that at present applications for home savings grants are running at an all-time record. We have been staggered by the number of people making application under and obviously good use of that important incentive scheme. The present legislation does not allow for the certificate commented on by the honourable member to be issued. However, as the Minister for Housing and Construction, I am fully aware of the problem.

He then sought to obtain a further loan by changing his name by deed poll to Asmith. I give that as an example of a difficulty which could be experienced if a certificate of this sort were issued.

It should be noted that whilst the parties to the Altona agreement submitted that the cost would be minimal-I think they alleged it would be $34,000 net, or 0.18 per cent of total wages of current award employees-in a number of cases the cost offsets amounted to nothing more than an undertaking to work normally in accordance with existing awards. In effect, the employees are being rewarded for past inefficiencies. They will receive the 35-hour week for such 'concessions' as those applying at one of the companies there. My recollection is that the company will implement correct timekeeping. The saving is alleged to be $16,250. It will use work and job cards more efficiently resulting in a saving of $40,000. It will restrict tea breaks to the existing allocated time-a saving of $30,700. So much for the concessions and the offsets.

It was not until the decision, I think, of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Forsyth's case and then the decision of the Federal Court of Australia which put that practice in doubt.

The Holcroft report indicated that if there were to be subsidies to compensate Tasmanians for the fact that they have no land bridge, it should be done off-Budget and not through the fare setting system.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is widespread concern across Australia at the Government's intention to dismantle Trans-Australia Airlines as a publicly owned transport enterprise. The carefully guarded statements of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) on the future ownership of Trans-Australia Airlines are but the latest episode in the shabby, sordid story of mismanagement of aviation policy and the continued preferential treatment of the proprietors of Ansett Airlines of Australia. The Minister's deliberately vague statements about Trans-Australia Airlines were designed to conceal his true intent which is the sale of TAA to private enterprise, a course which was strongly urged upon the Government by Mr Rupert Murdoch and Sir Peter Abeles at their original negotiations for the new two-airline agreement and by a group of Government back benchers led by Senator Rae. Irrespective of the denials of those opposite, the sale of Trans-Australia Airlines will have one inevitable result and that is the creation of a private monopoly in the provision of major domestic airline services in this country with, consequently, higher air fares and greater profits for Ansett. This will all happen at the expense of air travellers of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Trans-Australia Airlines was set up to provide a system of airline services across Australia when the aviation industry was in its infancy. The sole investment of the Australian people in Trans-Australia Airlines has been $15m, and that was by the Chifley Government in the 1940s. It has not cost the taxpayers one cent since. Despite the many obstacles, disabilities and impediments placed in its path by successive conservative governments the people's airline has become the major domestic airline and the leader in the introduction of innovative services. It enjoys the support of a majority of the Australian air travellers. Due to the dedication and service of its employees over the last 35 years it has succeeded in establishing itself as a symbol of national endeavour, national identity, national pride and achievement and as a symbol of Australian national spirit. All Australians share its ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's plan to sell up Trans-Australia Airlines would rob Australians of their share of ownership of the airline and place ownership in the hands of wealthy investors and stock exchange speculators. This move is the forerunner of other Government moves to sell off only the profitable public enterprises or those sections that return a profit, and sell them off to the private sector and so deprive Australians of their share of ownership of valuable national assets. It is a despicable plan that amounts to a pilfering of public property and it deserves the strongest condemnation by this Parliament and by all Australians. Trans-Australia Airlines is one of the few profitable areas of our public transport system and it is essential that it remains in full public ownership with its continuing objective being the provision of safe, convenient airline services at minimum cost to travellers. It should not be sold off to line the pockets of the Government's wealthy friends whose sole objective is personal profit and who are responsible for those who sit opposite being in government today. </PARA>
<PARA> Two spurious arguments have been advanced for the sale of TAA: Firstly, that it arises from the recommendations of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. That argument is totally false. Nowhere in any of the 36 recommendations of the inquiry is there any suggestion, not even one word, that recommends or mentions the sale of Trans-Australia Airlines or a change to its financial structure. Secondly, the proponents of the sale of TAA claim that it suffers financial disabilities in comparison with Ansett, which problem can be remedied only by selling the airline. Those disabilities-higher interest charges, inability to borrow locally, loss-incurring country services, superannuation contributions-are matters that can be overcome by relatively minor amendments to existing legislation. They are matters for decision by government, not by the airline, because the airline is forced to operate within the environment created for it by government policy. Those disabilities in no way justify the selling of TAA to private enterprise. The Minister, his predecessor and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) have repeatedly denied that the Government intended to sell Trans-Australia Airlines. But the fact is that it is Australian Liberal Party policy that TAA should be sold within four years. Just as the Government deceived the public on the provisions of the new two-airline agreement, so it has deceived electors as to its intentions in respect of Trans-Australia Airlines. Four weeks ago I showed in this Parliament the manner in which the Minister for Transport had misled the Parliament and the public as to the conduct and activities of the Holcroft inquiry. Government members have asserted that TAA is responsible for a restriction of competition in airline services. That assertion also is false. </PARA>
<PARA> TAA was the target of the two-airline agreement when it was devised. The real obstacle to greater competition in air services has been the policy of successive conservative governments of protecting Ansett, whatever the cost. The new two-airline agreement shows that fact indisputably. The true intent of this Government to sell off TAA can be seen from the advice that has been given to the Minister for Transport. In recent months he has spoken repeatedly of the need to 'commercialise' TAA as have other proponents of the sale of TAA. It is obvious that the Australian National Airlines Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1980 presented to this chamber on 18 September last is to be discarded. Its purpose, we were told by the Minister at that time, was to make TAA more commercial. What the Minister did not tell us, and what has now been revealed, is that he was given expert advice almost a year ago that the only way by which TAA could be made fully commercial would be for a majority shareholding in the airline to be sold off to private enterprise, and therein lies the nub of what the Government's action is all about, therein lies the reason that the Minister has not been able to tell the Parliament what the Government proposes to do in respect of the ownership of TAA. He knows very well what it is-it is to pilfer this property of the people; it is to sell off the airline which will lead eventually to the creation of a private monopoly in air services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister knows what I am saying is correct. He knows that the advice to which I have referred is correct. But why has not the Minister in a forthright manner brought that advice to the notice of the Parliament? Why has he not included that advice in the many statements he and his colleagues have made in respect of the future of airline services in this country? Why has he not spelt out what he really means by commercialising TAA? The reason he has not spelt it out is that it would have exposed the Government to massive public reaction prior to and during the election campaign and it would have exposed the Government's intent now. As I have said, the advice exposes the Government's intent and it explains the deliberate vagueness of the Minister about the financial structure and the future of TAA. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's scant five-line statement yesterday-it was almost a throwaway line-was designed to conceal the Government's true objective. All Australians who value the services provided by TAA and their ownership of TAA as Australians must now express their opposition to this robbery by legislation that the Government proposes in respect of TAA. They must speak up now and express to this Government in the strongest possible form that they will not tolerate this thievery, that they will not tolerate this pilfering of public assets to line the pockets of supporters of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make this point clear: TAA is a creature of government; it is subject to government control; its disabilities are of the Government's creation. Yet honourable members opposite profess to be competent economic managers. It is clear from the evidence available that they cannot even superintend responsibly the affairs of the airline. It has been starved of capital and forced to operate with a higher borrowing ratio than its competitor. The only capital injection it received was the $15m in the 1940s to which I referred earlier. It was forced last year by this Government, by this Minister and by this Prime Minister to pay a higher dividend to the Government than was commercially sound. It has been required to operate heavy loss incurring country air services by government demand. It has incurred greater superannuation liabilities than Ansett by government edict. To assert now that those financial disabilities are the fault of the airline is to be utterly dishonest and irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA> Government members who have participated in the orchestrated campaign which has been waged against TAA and which has been supported by the Ansett Press have never questioned the financial performance of Ansett Airlines of Australia, its efficiency or the meagre airline information which has been provided by that company to this Parliament and which consists of a sparse one page of sectional headings. Yet those opposite in this chamber or in the other chamber who are the proponents of the sale of TAA have never once put forward a case as to why Ansett Transport Industries should provide full and detailed information to this Parliament on its financial performance and on its airline activities. In 1979, Senator Rae, the leader of the push, valued TAA at $30m, which he said was a reasonable figure. Last year Mr Rupert Murdoch put a value on TAA of $150m, which is five times the previous figure. Yet Senator Rae and his supporters participate in the Government's transport and finance committees, and they obviously have a major input into Government policy in respect of aviation and finance. There we see the competence of the economic managers. They are attributing one-fifth of the real value of TAA because it is a public asset. As it is a profit making enterprise, they want to get it out of the hands of the public and into the hands of the private sector. I have been advised this morning that already Mr Robert Holmes a'Court is in Canberra to put a proposition to purchase TAA to the Minister and to the Government. So let there be an end to the cant opposite that the Government does not propose to sell TAA. Let those opposite be honest and forthright for once and try to tell the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> The public record shows that this Government cannot be trusted to carry out any of its undertakings. It cannot be believed. Its Minister for Transport cannot be believed. His performance and the Government's record of broken promises show that fact. Nor can the assurances of the Minister for Transport in respect of TAA's future be given any credence. The simple facts are that the changes proposed to TAA and its sale constitute the pirating of a valuable national asset, the pilfering of public property for the benefit of this Government's wealthy supporters, and the destruction of a national symbol of achievement. The Australian Labor Party-and let me make this quite clear to any intending purchasers-will use every resource at its disposal to block the sale of Trans Australia Airlines, to block this pilfering of public property and, if by some mischance the Government manages to sell TAA in part or in full, the next Labor government will restore it to rightful public ownership, that is, to the ownership of all Australians, not just to the privileged few whom this Government represents. </PARA>
<PARA> I said at the opening of my speech that the prime demand of Mr Rupert Murdoch and Sir Peter Abeles in the negotiations with the Government in respect of the new two-airline agreement was that TAA should be sold to commercial interests. The letter has been made public within recent days. Correspondence between the Minister for Transport and Sir Peter Abeles dated 3 March last year, which my colleague the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Les McMahon) revealed last week, shows that to be true. It shows that Ansett requested the introduction of automatic air fare increases, and it shows that Ansett requested that TAA should have a net profit target of 10 per cent on revenue before tax. Government advice shows that a set profit figure for TAA, related either to a share of revenue or to a set target, irrespective of the decisions made by the airline or the Government, would in effect guarantee profits for Ansett, irrespective of efficiency, or performance. </PARA>
<PARA> In his letter to Sir Peter Abeles, the Minister said that the Government rejected Ansett's proposition. But, in the new two-airline agreement which was signed some months later, the Minister caved in completely, and yielded to the request of Ansett. Provision was made in the agreement for Ansett to have automatic fare increases and, in September last, provision was made in the legislation for TAA to change the structure of TAA's profit objective, so providing exactly what government expert advice recommended against. This Government is in effect thieving a valuable public asset for the benefit of its friends, and the Minister for Transport is a principal tool in this shameful exercise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition's matter of public importance reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The widespread public concern over the Government's intention to dismantle TAA as a publicly owned enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>It signals the great difficulty that the Labor socialist party has in accepting the principles of private enterprise. The very fact that the Australian Labor Party associates the Government's intention to make Trans-Australia Airlines a public company with dismantling reveals beyond any doubt that the Labor Party still firmly adheres to its socialist intentions. In the minds of members of the Labor Party anything associated with private enterprise apparently is associated with dismantling. The Labor Party is a socialist party with socialist objectives. The Liberal and National Country parties happen to be private enterprise parties and this Government is a private enterprise government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Labor Party sees as its clear objective a completely state-owned economy. Any move to make a statutory corporation a public company is claimed to be an act of dismantling, pulling down, tearing to pieces or stripping of protection. There is no doubt that the Australian Labor Party is still driven by its basic philosophy of socialisation of industry, distribution and exchange. The Labor Party quite deliberately has not spelt out its policy in respect of aviation. It covers its aviation policy in no more than three or four sentences. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to quote from the Labor Party's aviation policy as arrived at during the 1979 Adelaide conference. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Examine the effects of the existing airlines policy on passenger and freight carriage. </PARA>
<PARA> Ensure that air travel as a principal mode of long-distance public passenger transport is accessible to as wide a range of the community as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Throughout the period that the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) has been shadow Minister for Transport he has never advanced a constructive policy in the aviation or transport areas generally. In fact, his whole performance in these areas has been characterised by a continual barrage of destructive criticism. However, every so often he falls back on the proclamation of the 1975 Inter-State Commission Act as Labor's panacea for the ills of the entire transport system. I can think of no more ill-defined remedy to meet the dynamic needs of aviation or transport generally. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to understand the motivations that lie behind the matter before the House, one needs to recall the history of the Labor Party's involvement with aviation. Towards the end of the last war the then Labor Government decided that the interests of the Australian industry would be best served by implementing its socialist policy by nationalising the airline industry. Fortunately, this was found to be unconstitutional but, as a last resort, the then Government looked to its Australian National Airlines Commission, which began operations as Trans-Australia Airlines in 1946 to establish itself as a monopoly airline. The Australian Labor Party did everything in its power either to delay or to refuse Australian National Airways dollars or sterling funds to purchase competitive aircraft while making such funds available to the government-owned operation. It directed all government business to the government-owned airlines. There is not the slightest doubt that the Labor Party discriminated against the private sector in characteristic socialist fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government of the day did everything in its power to overcome the constitutional problem to achieve socialisation of the airlines by attempting to squeeze the private sector out of existence. It allowed TAA to operate without a commercial structure in direct competition with private enterprise in an attempt to destroy the survival of the private sector. We were so close to having a socialised airlines monopoly in this nation that it does not matter. I can think of nothing more drab or more unresponsive to public demand than such a socialised monopolistic setup. It is fortunate that for all but three years since 1949 we have had a Liberal-National Country Party government which has attempted to allow both TAA and Ansett to conduct their operations within the concept of a two-airlines policy on as commercial grounds as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1949 the Menzies Government decided that the nation's interests would be best served by a competitive airline policy. The Liberal-National Country Party Government is opposed to a monopoly situation, government or private, in the transport area. We are opposed to that concept of a monopoly, whether the Government or private enterprise owns it. In the years that the Liberal-National Country parties have been in government they have ensured that TAA has been able to operate in competition with Ansett. It did not allow TAA to operate in a privileged position which would untimately result in a government monopoly, or allow TAA to be disposed of in such a fashion as to allow a private enterprise monopoly to take over airline operations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In making TAA a public company, the Government will ensure that it remains as a separate airline, whether the Government owns all the shares or whether some shares are made available to the public. Decisions have yet to be made about the nature of the structure of TAA operating as a public company. Let it be clearly understood that no action will be taken that will allow Ansett to buy into TAA. That possibility is just not on under any circumstances. Our objective in making TAA a public company is to give it a commercial flexibility which is necessary to compete with Ansett in the market place and to remove the cost burdens that are not shared by Ansett. I would like to remind the honourable member for Shortland that the problem of superannuation was created in 1973 when the Labor Government was in office and it indexed pensions. </PARA>

The Government's adherence to the two-airline policy has always been based on its desire to ensure that the major trunk routes throughout Australia have available to them a regular scheduled service serving all the major ports of call, with the most safe and sophisticated aircraft available and with the highest possible utilisation of capacity, thereby keeping air fares down to a minimum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is no part of the policy of this Government to foster either a government monopoly or a private monopoly on our major air routes. It is our belief that TAA, having successfully established itself as a statutory corporation, is now sufficiently mature to operate in the market place as a public company. We consider it to be absolutely necessary that competition between these two major airlines should be as free as possible in the interests of the travelling public. I have no doubt that, with all the expertise and experience available to TAA, it will operate as a highly competitive airline when the claws of the bureaucracy are removed from it as a statutory corporation. Qantas Airways Ltd, as a public company with the Commonwealth owning all the shares, has proved beyond any doubt that it can compete against the biggest and the best airlines in the world. The fact that it has operated as a public company so succesfully for so long vindicates the Government's decision to make TAA a public company. Qantas is undoubtedly one of the best airlines in the world. Certainly it is one of the safest and one of the most competitive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Bill 1981 which was debated last evening. I am in the concluding stage of my speech. I reiterate the point that we should consider the Antarctic from the point of view of foreign policy. It is very important that, whilst we are a party to the Antartic Treaty and whilst we welcome this legislation which relates to conservation, we bear in mind that we have done very little to establish our sovereign rights effectively by displaying a practical interest in the area. I recognise that we spend a small amount of money but we even have to rent an icebreaker. Our financial resources are a mere $15m. I made the point last evening that the Government of West Germany, for example, is planning to spend several hundred million dollars in the next three years. We claim three-sevenths, or six million square kilometres, of the total area. Unless we do something tangible about that claim by providing more financial resources, establishing our own fishing rights and recognising the competing interests under the law of the sea convention, other nations will regard themselves as being entitled to the high seas below the 60-degree parallel. These things have to be faced up to by Australians from the point of view of foreign policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When considering that matter we must also look at the claims of the underdeveloped countries. To assist such claims would give us some guarantee of recognition in the future of our interest in the area, not the least of which is the fact that we should be sharing some of those resources with the underdeveloped countries. I refer to scientific aid, such as bringing the scientists of those countries to the Antarctic, and also, in accordance with the law of the sea convention, giving them a share of the resources. If the law of the sea convention is ever established it is proposed that the underdeveloped countries should get, say, 5 per cent, of the resources in the area. The same criterion ought to apply now. For all these reasons we would like the Government to become interested in what we can do. It should be not merely the office boy in Hobart but also one of the managing directors of the resources of the Antartic. We could then establish in the future our legitimate claims to the area and guarantee that we are not excluded because we are too weak and subservient and unable to finance those claims. In that case we would lose our chance to protect those resources. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments about the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Bill because of its importance to Australia's involvement in the Antarctic territory and also because of my recent experience when I was fortunate enough to undertake a round trip from Melbourne to the Antarctic territory aboard the Thala Dan. This Bill legislates for Australia to become an official member of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. More importantly it provides for the headquarters of the new international Commission to be established in Hobart. Previous speakers, including the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) last night, have pointed out that this is the first time that an international commission of such a nature has been based in Australia. That is significant in its own right. Perhaps the commission to be established to look over the continental base resources will also be based in Australia. I understand that we are the first nation to ratify the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. Indeed, it is a further development of Australia's involvement and international reputation in the Antarctic. This involvement originated many years ago and we have made significant contributions not only to the exploration of that continent but also to its subsequent development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment we are involved in a major rebuilding program of our three continental bases at Mawson, Davis and Casey, a program that will extend over 10 years and involve about $55m. We are presently looking very carefully at proposals to build our own ship to transport both cargo and passengers from Australia to the continental bases. We have looked at and I believe we should continue to look more seriously at the prospects for providing effective air transportation through New Zealand, by means of ski-equipped transport aircraft, to all three or at least two of our continental bases. As a signatory to the Treaty we are looking to what may eventuate when the Treaty comes up for renewal in 1989. We have a very historic presence in that continent with the explorations and the very fine record of Sir Douglas Mawson. I advocated in this House some weeks ago that this Government should look seriously at the prospect of building a memorial to Mawson in Australia and at the same time restoring his hut in Australia's Antarctic territory to provide a perpetual memorial to him and his efforts in that continent. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested in one of the speeches last night which referred to the enormous biological resources that are now being realised in the seas around the Antarctic continent. Figures given on the estimated amount of krill were between 800 million tonnes and 5,000 million tons. I presume the figures related to production per year. I understand that this means that krill is the largest protein source yet to be exploited in the world. We know that there have been discoveries of economically important and significant minerals in the continent. We know that hydrocarbons have been found off-shore on the continental shelf. We know that the Antarctic is being viewed by some nations as being of strategic and tactical significance. The Antarctic has moved from being regarded as a continent of major scientific interest, particularly for its contribution to meteorology, to an area of vast interest for its resources, both biological and non-biological. I therefore believe the Australian Government should be congratulated for being the first to ratify this important Convention on the Conservation of Marine Living Resources in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's record on environmental concerns in Antarctica is very good. We are leaders in many ways of dealing with waste, both biological and non-biological, as a result of our presence in the Australian Antarctic territory. I have a very comprehensive report which refers to the Antarctic environment, particularly the proposed rebuilding program of Australia's Antarctic stations. Most stations in the Antarctic pollute the environment, which is very fragile. Most stations are discharging untreated sewage effluent into the sea. Solid and non-combustible refuse is being collected at tips and in many cases, particularly during the summer melt season, it is also pushed directly into the sea. Much of the biodegradable refuse is thrown to the scavengers, the skuas. Some of the chemical waste is of considerable concern, particularly chemicals that relate to colour photo processing. They are also being discharged into the sea or into pits without any real attempts at environmental control. I am pleased to say that Australia's efforts in environmental control in the Antarctic are very sound. Our new rebuilding program will provide some of the most up to date and effective means of waste disposal and toxic chemical neutralisation and disposal in the entire continent. The marine resources of the continent, to which I have referred, are vast indeed. They include not only the whales, seals and birds of Antarctica which, of course, are of lesser economic interest but also krill, fish and perhaps squid. The area is one of the major sources of protein for human consumption, perhaps not so much directly but indirectly, in that it provides a major component of rations for livestock and other feeding purposes. I hope that conventions such as this one will ensure that the Antarctic marine resources are not overexploited but can be preserved and used in balance, not by upsetting the very delicate ecosystem that we know exists in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I call for a greater impetus and emphasis by Australia in respect of research, particularly marine research. That is one of the areas in which we have been lagging for some time, although in recent years there has been some attempt to promote further marine research facilities in Antarctica. One of the ships has been partly re-equipped to provide marine research facilities. Many other nations are far ahead of Australia in terms of marine research and marine biological research in the Antarctic territorial waters. We know also that many nations are fishing those waters. We do not know how much krill and fish is being taken by, for example, some of the East European countries. I am very pleased to note that some of those countries have seen fit to be signatories to this new Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that many other members wish to speak in this debate. In closing, I compliment the Government in moving as quickly as it has. I applaud Australia's record in the Antarctic. I believe that we have a commitment in many ways to lead the world in our approach to the Antarctic environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Bill ratifies the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources signed in Canberra last May. Fifteen nations signed the Convention. Australia has been designated the depository country for the Convention and also will be the first country to ratify the Convention. There will be a permit system established to allow the harvesting and researching of marine organisms in the Convention area-those waters between the Antarctic continent and the Antarctic convergence. The Bill also recognises permits or authorities issued by another country which is a party to the Convention. Illegal harvesting or research that is done without a permit or in contravention of a permit will carry a maximum penalty of $50,000 for individuals and $100,000 for a body corporate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst the Bill basically is designed to cover Australians in their actions in the Southern Ocean, it will have jurisdiction over all people and vessels within Australian waters and the Australian fishing zone. Since the Antarctic convergence is north of Heard Island and Macdonald Island-two Australian territories in the Southern Ocean-the Australian fishing zone around each island falls within the Convention area. I suppose we shall, therefore, have to regulate fishing by foreign vessels in these zones under the Fisheries Act because they will need Australian permission to harvest marine living resources in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports this legislation and is happy that Hobart was named as the site of the headquarters of the Commission set up under this convention. I hope that this will boost the Government's flagging interest in research in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, however, has some glaring inadequacies, as are found in all international agreements reached by consensus, but it also has major breakthroughs. It recognises the need to prevent irreversible changes to the ecosystem and uses the ecosystem approach harvesting. It defines the northern boundary of Antarctic waters using ecological criteria instead of an arbitrarily decided latitude. The ecosystem approach to harvesting is embodied in Article XI of the Convention. As a result, harvesting of prey species-that is, krill-in the Antarctic waters will be limited if the reduction in that species is affecting predator species, that is, seals or whales. Previous fishing agreements have usually considered species in isolation ignoring the effects of harvesting on non-target species.</PARA>
<PARA> The northern boundary of the Convention area is defined as the Antarctic convergence. This convergence is where temperate waters meet cold Antarctic water and form a natural boundary which effectively isolates the cold water species of the Antarctic. For example, krill are not found north of this convergence. The 1959 Antarctic Treaty set a northern boundary of the Antarctic region as 60 degrees south which, whilst precise geographically, does not mirror the natural physical boundary of the Antarctic marine ecosystem of the Antarctic convergence. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst agreements on these two matters are major advances for an international agreement, the Convention has a number of weaknesses, as pointed out in Dr Suter's book Antarctica: World Law and the Last Wilderness. The Convention specifically avoids provisions for setting national catch quotas and limitations on fishing effort. Without national catch quotas, we may see a massive build-up of fishing fleets which will make it unlikely that those countries will reduce operations in the future to comply with future scientifically agreed on quotas. Membership of the Commission is restricted to those States that are engaged in fishing or research activities in Antarctica. Even then, admission depends upon a unanimous vote of acceptance by the Commission countries. That is a closed shop arrangement with Antarctica being claimed as the exclusive domain of the treaty nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment of the Convention depends on consensus being reached so that each country has a veto. If this is not enough, any country party to the Convention need not accept conservation measures developed by the Commission by consensus. The United States of America, I understand, proposed a two-thirds majority voting system but this was not accepted by the other parties including Australia. Enforcement of decisions will be virtually impossible, I am afraid. Britain, New Zealand, the United States of America and Norway all argued for a strong system of observance and inspection with adequate enforcement. But other countries stopped this. The Convention does have an observer system but it requires only flag state endorsement. The section of the first Canberra draft of the Convention affording observers freedom of access to vessels, including reasonable facilities and accommodation, was dropped in the final document. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that these points arise from a difficulty in getting 15 nations to agree on a common document such as this. However, we must question the prime purpose of the Convention. Is it to regulate the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources or is it to regulate their exploitation? Several other conventions also deal with living resources in the Southern Ocean. They include the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species, the Convention covering the International Whaling Commission and the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals. There could be problems developing from such a fragmented approach to management of Antarctic marine living resources.</PARA>
<PARA> The waters south of the convergence are ecologically distinct from the waters to the north. Most species remain entirely within the area although some, notably whales and seabirds, migrate through it. As with all marine systems, there is continuous interaction between the living organisms and the non-living environment. The Antarctic marine ecosystem is relatively simple, containing few species. A single species of krill holds a central position in the food web. It feeds on phytoplankton and zooplankton and is in turn the major food of the baleen whales, crabeater and other seals, fish and squid and many other organisms. Krill and the organisms that feed on it form the major economic living resources of the Southern Ocean. The harvesting of any of these organisms or groups of organisms in the Antarctic marine food web will have repercussions on other species in the ecosystem. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977, the reported catch of krill was 122,500 tonnes. The 1978 catch by Japan, Poland and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was more than 200,000 tonnes. There have been estimates of krill production as high as 1,000 million tonnes a year. Prior to whaling, the baleen whales consumed probably 190 million tonnes a year and, although decimated in number, may now consume 50 million tonnes. People have argued that this leaves a surplus of 140 million tonnes a year which could be safely harvested. However, since the krill is central to the food web, a massive harvest could throw the entire ecosystem out of balance. In 1978, some United States scientists suggested that, in order to encourage the recovery of whales, the interim catch of krill should not exceed one million tonnes to 2.5 million tonnes. Soviet scientists have also reduced their estimates and some are now talking of a sustainable catch of 15 million tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA> Antarctic fin fish will be another major target for exploitation under the Convention. In 1977, a fin fish catch of 279,000 tonnes was reported by the USSR, Poland and East Germany. Glowing projections of sustainable fisheries of millions of tonnes a year are frequently made by fishing countries but it should be noted that areas in the Antarctic have already been overfished-such as the waters off South Georgia during the early 1970s. With the tragic tale of the decimation of the whaling stock freshly in mind, the world should tread cautiously before plunging into the exploitation of the marine resources of the Antarctic. In the short to medium term, Australia will not be fishing these waters, but we must exert our influence on the Commission to ensure that past mistakes are not repeated. Although the ecosystem approach which has been adopted by the Convention is a step in the right direction for the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources, we cannot assume that the fishing nations signatory to the Convention will be more interested in conservation than in achieving large catches to justify their large investment in research and fishing fleets. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude I make the point that so far there does not appear to have been much attempt by the Commission to take into account anti-oil pollution devices and to set up an appropriate program. I draw attention to the fact that most of the super-tankers of the world, carrying oil between the Persian or Arabian Gulf and Europe, still travel via the Cape of Good Hope. Many of these tankers range from 250,000 tonnes upwards. The biggest seas in the world develop off the Cape of Good Hope around Cape Agulhas. Waves sometimes reach 100 or 150 feet in height. The so-called holes in the sea can develop. It is not generally known that such a hole almost broke the back of the Queen Elizabeth during World War II. Many scientists and oil industry and shipping experts have pointed to the fact that it is quite conceivable that a super-tanker could break its back off the Cape of Good Hope and spill anything up to half a million tonnes of oil into the Southern Ocean. I make the point that that ocean is the only ocean that encircles the globe unobstructed by a land mass. Currents can circle the globe and it is quite possible that the Commission will have to do more to set up an oil spillage control mechanism. It is certainly not outside the realms of possibility that we could witness a huge oil-spillage disaster similar to that in which the Amoco Cadiz and Torrey Canyon were involved off the Cape of Good Hope, which is not so far from the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA> Antarctica is the last great wilderness of the planet. International co-operation is essential if we are to ensure the continued survival of marine and terrestrial ecosystems which will come under increasing pressure by competing interests for the living and non-living resources of the Antarctic. The Antarctic Treaty nations must not become a club to utilise the resources of Antarctica for their own exclusive benefit and take little note of the interests of the rest of the world. The protection of Antarctica's fragile ecosystem must be given top priority and resource exploitation must take second place to ensuring that this aim is preserved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Bill is to enable Australia to implement the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, as drawn up in May of last year. The 13 Antarctic Treaty consultative parties, with the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, last year took part in what I believe was the most important conference dealing with the Antarctic since 1959, when the Antarctic Treaty was first signed. That Treaty contained no provisions relating to resources exploitation. At the Seventh Consultative Meeting in Wellington in 1972, the New Zealand delegation suggested that, in view of this omission, the question of the exploitation of living and non-living resources, and the consequent environmental implications, should be placed on the agenda for the Eighth Consultative Meeting. That is the real history of this Convention. A few months later, in February 1973, the sea bed research vessel Glomar Challenger, which was then engaged in deep sea drilling projects, found traces of methane and ethane in the Ross Sea area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The subsequent Eighth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, which was held in Oslo in 1975 was, I believe, the turning point in attitudes towards the Antarctic. This meeting was the beginning of a serious examination of problems which could arise if the living and non-living resources of Antarctica were to become commercially exploitable. The intensive scientific research which had taken place during and since the International Geophysical Year had revealed the fragility, if honourable members like, of the Antarctic environment and the value of Antarctica generally. It was at the Oslo meeting that it became clear that the Antarctic Treaty, which for 16 years had preserved Antarctica from the adverse effects of commercial and ideological rivalry while promoting a unique co-operative international effort in scientific research, was coming under increasing strain. Since 1975, the Treaty parties have been working intensively to maintain Antarctica's unique status as a continent of peace. </PARA>
<PARA> The Conference, which I was privileged to attend, culminated some three years of negotiations and discussions on the conservation of the entire ecosystem of the Antarctic. In essence, the Convention envisages the establishment of a Commission and a scientific committee with the task of putting into effect and overseeing the effective conservation of marine living resources in the Antarctic. All nations which become party to the new Convention, whether or not they are parties to the Antarctic Treaty, assume an obligation not to engage in any activities in the Antarctic Treaty area that are contrary to the purposes of that Treaty. They also undertake to be bound by specific articles of the Treaty and measures taken by consultative parties under it, specifically those relating to the demilitarisation of the Antarctic, its use for peaceful purposes, the protection of its environment and its preservation as a zone free from international tensions and discord. I believe that it has accomplished that since it was first structured. </PARA>
<PARA> Embodied in the Convention is the concept that the whole Antarctic area, with its separate regional ecosystem, is to be treated as a single ecosystem because of its interrelationship with the living species that exist in the area. It covers all the marine living resources of the area and complements the provisions of the International Whaling Commission and the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals. For this reason, the Convention visualises the establishment of a scientific committee for the study and exchange of information with respect to Antarctic marine living resources. My assessment was that the Conference was a success. Not all parties were in agreement with the final convention. The fishing nations pressed for a weakening of the fishing restrictions in the area, whilst the conservationists demanded stricter controls. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of the utmost importance that the concepts of responsible stewardship should prevail and that immediate economic consideration should not be the only criterion for deciding man's role in the Antarctic. The Antarctic and the Southern Ocean influence the whole world. Not only do these regions play a crucial role in the formation of the earth's climatic and weather conditions, thereby affecting food production, but the far south also contains a significant reservoir of natural resources that could affect our welfare. We ought to take cognisance of the fact that for 50 years scientists have been at work in the Southern Ocean-frankly, 50 years is not long enough-and are now joining in an international research program, to which no one has referred until now. One hopes that that program-the Biological Investigation of Marine Antarctic Systems and Stocks or BIOMASS-will ensure that the Southern Ocean can be used with wisdom. Using information gathered from ships, shore stations and satellites, scientists hope to have results available by the mid-1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> The damage to the Antarctic ecosystem began with uncontrolled whaling. With the use of whales in the production of manure, stock food, pet food and oil, whaling became a large scale industry in the early part of this century. In 1925 the new pelagic floating factories began to operate, free to hunt whales anywhere in the Southern Ocean. With the increase in whaling, the whale society changed. Female blue and fin whales not only began to grow faster but also died earlier and did not grow as large as normal. I believe 1931 marked the beginning of the end of the blue whale, the biggest animal that had lived on earth. In that year there was a record catch of 30,000 whales, which was predominantly used for oil. Sadly, it is ironic that the catch was a massive waste as the demand for oil dropped dramatically. Thereafter, the giant whale became a rare sight in the Antarctic. In 1965, when so few blue whales were left that it was no longer profitable to hunt them, hunting was banned. It was a tragedy. Other species of whales-fins, humpbacks, sperms and seis-have suffered similar fates to that of the blue whale. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had the same problem with seal hunting, which also was extensively pursued in the early part of the century. We often forget that in 1961 it was the Antarctic Treaty nations, showing concern for uncontrolled sealing, that moved towards an international agreement to control sealing in the Antarctic. After 11 years, in 1972 the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals was signed and six years later-17 years after the initial moves-the Convention came into force when it was ratified by seven countries. However, that convention is only an attempt to manage properly the harvesting of Antarctic seals because there is no law or police force to enforce the Convention. Many honourable members on both sides of the House do not realise what a convention is and what it entails. The ratification of this convention was much overdue and by the time it was ratified the Ross seals, fur seals and southern elephant seals had to be totally or partially protected. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the greatest interest in the Antarctic marine ecosystem presently lies in the supplies of krill. The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research lists an intensive study of the life history of krill as a priority. Nobody is certain how frequently krill eggs are spawned, how deep they fall, how fast the young krill grow or how long they live. In fact, nobody knows much about krill except that it might provide the world with some 100 million tonnes of high protein food a year. That is more than man's entire fish catch in any given year. Krill is currently the main food source for whales, seals, squid and many birds and fish in the Antarctic. An intelligent guess based on crude data puts the annual consumption of krill at about 300 million tonnes. Estimates change all the time as new information is acquired. Even supposing that these figures are accurate, vital information is still missing. The estimated total annual production of krill does not correspond with the estimated total annual consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to be mindful of the tragedies that have befallen the Californian sardines, the Peruvian anchovy and the Antarctic baleen whale. We do not have adequate information concerning the stocks of Southern Ocean resources. At the two Convention conferences I attended biologists admitted that. We have virtually no estimates of the abundance and biomass of fish populations in the Antarctic, and we know next to nothing of Antarctic squid. The problem is further complicated by the structure of the Antarctic ecosystem and its complex interaction between seals, whales, sea birds, penguins and fish, all competing for food which consists almost entirely of krill. Since krill is the key species of the Antarctic ecosystem, it is not difficult to visualise that its unwise exploitation could trigger disastrous changes throughout that ecosystem. </PARA>
<PARA> In a world facing critical energy and protein shortages, the natural resources of the Antarctic have become a major focus on international interest, and the existing framework of co-operation in the Antarctic has come under increasing challenge. Close attention is being directed towards the need to recognise and accommodate some of the pressures for exploitation of the Antarctic resources while ensuring that the region's delicate ecosystem is preserved. However, as yet no headway has been made by the parties to the Antarctic Treaty on the issues of national sovereignty. The fact that mineral resources are non-renewable, as well as the intrinsic nature of mineral exploration and extraction activity, poses a far greater problem than did the issues at the Convention on the Conservation of Marine Living Resources. I do not think there was one delegate who did not recognise that. Australia and other claimants will be looking for a role in a regime commensurate with their sovereign status. Such a regime must also be consistent with the aims of protecting the Antarctic environment and its living resources. Australia's approach to the negotiations on an Antarctic minerals regime thus includes as an objective the maintenance of an effective moratorium on the exploration and exploitation of the resources, pending a study of the environmental implications. I believe the Government and its officers have applied their minds to that pressing problem. Antarctic mineral exploitation could leave a tragic environmental legacy. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects of land based installations on the fragile Antarctic ecological balance mean that any mineral exploitation which may ensue can be undertaken only with a complete knowledge of its effects on the marine living resources if the intentions of the Convention are to be achieved. It struck me while attending the conference on the convention that, whatever the roles of diplomats and politicians may be, the real answer to the appropriate development of the Antarctic lies with the Scientific Committee-that is, with the biologists and the physicists. The Antarctic Treaty has so far ensured the protection of the Antarctic environment while guaranteeing freedom of scientific research in the Antarctic. If the parties cannot come to an agreement on mineral resources, the Treaty itself will face its most serious challenge. Beyond any doubt, that would be the most serious challenge to the continuity of the Treaty. Any attempt to find solutions outside the Treaty could undermine its viability. My attendance at two conferences confirmed that beyond any doubt. On the other hand, development by the Antarctic Treaty parties of a resources regime which did not take into account the growing international interest in Antarctic resources might also threaten the continued viability of the Treaty. It cannot operate any longer on a club basis; it has to have some sense of international responsibility. So far there is no evidence to suggest that resource regimes cannot be built on the structure of the Treaty. I believe, and hope, they can. However, the real test of the Treaty will come when a minerals regime is to be concluded, and the difficulties which may arise should not be underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA> The bringing together of countries with such divergent political philosophies and such divergent attitudes on a number of contentious aspects of the Convention is a tribute to the skill of the leaders of the Australian delegation who chaired and hosted the concluding conferences leading up to the signing of this Convention. I want to place on record my sincere gratitude to them. I fully appreciate the fact that the responsibility on the Australian delegation was enormous. This Convention is testimony to the excellence and skill of Ambassador Roland, Ambassador Brennan and in particular the staff who gave them such worthwhile support. It is with great pleasure that I support the Bill. </PARA>

The 1980 report indicates that it was not responded to in 1980.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill, ratifying last January's oil price rise is the centrepiece of this Government's non-energy policy. It remains a revenue raising exercise which achieves neither oil exploration nor conservation. Any reduction in the usage of oil by consumers in Australia can largely be explained as being due to the economic downturn which has only recently bottomed out and by a shift to smaller cars and energy conservation which would have occurred with any price rise, including one far less steep than the crude oil levy has managed to impose over the last few years. The Government claims an increased rate of exploration for its parity pricing policy. It has constantly sought to associate the crude oil levy with it. The association is, of course, quite spurious. Nothing of the parity price on old oil goes to the companies. Parity pricing on new oil, which the Opposition not only supports but also introduced, is of course a condition for the extension of exploration and development of new fields, but of itself it does not amount to a sufficient policy to achieve those ends. Despite increased drilling just one per cent of locally produced crude oil is classified as new oil. The amount of exploration is manifoldly pathetic when our 100-odd wells per annum are compared with several thousand in Canada.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a taxing policy the new oil-old oil formulas also produce some difficulties. As technology improves, more and more oil may be taken from fields already classified old oil. However, there is no incentive on Esso-BHP to extend the life of existing fields beyond that which is permitted under the current old oil formula. Full parity pricing to the producer would not be necessary to achieve this but probably more than is currently permitted under the old oil formula is required. While the situation maintains, there is more incentive to expand elsewhere. From talking to some friends who have been involved in the oil industry I understand that this is increasingly becoming a factor in the operations of Esso-BHP in the Bass Strait fields. The companies are being discouraged, under the current formula, from expanding or introducing new technology into their operations in the area because they see no substantial advantage in doing so and they would prefer to conduct exploration activities elsewhere, where the new oil parity pricing policy is likely to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> What arises when a field is discovered in an old oil area, which is simply too good for the company to pass up, is the ridiculous situation which we now have in the Fortescue Field. What is there is patently old oil, but is declared new oil with a few geological rationalisations thrown in. The producer gains a massive windfall at the expense of the Australian taxpayer and consumer. Something far less than full parity was required to get crude oil from Fortescue out of the ground, but it was something more than what is permitted the producers of old oil. If we had a competent authority publicly monitoring these developments we might come up with some very interesting data on disincentives to upgrade old oil activities and further potential sleights of hand similar to that which occurred in the case of Fortescue. The Government should be prepared to think beyond the old oil-new oil formula which was a temporary expedient introduced by the Whitlam Government preparatory to a more thorough-going development of national energy policy, and which with the crude oil levy and continued parity pricing introduced by this Government has become a blight on Australian economic development. It might introduce some interesting changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party for several years has presented two constructive proposals which would obviate many of the difficulties which now arise and which would encourage development. A resources rental tax would take care of excess profits in situations such as those produced in Fortescue. As oil prices increase geometrically in the 1980s it would also pick off excess profits which may well be made in the development of new fields. Price rises are likely to move well beyond the levels that are required to make some new fields, which are currently under exploration, economic. I believe that we are likely to see examples of this process in fields off the north-west of Western Australia. The potentiality for such development can be seen in the changing value of a related fuel about to be extracted from that area-liquid natural gas. </PARA>
<PARA> More important than any of these, however, for a rapid extension of oil exploration and extraction in Australia would be a decision by this Government to go in the direction of public involvement in the process, in the manner of every other country, apart from the United States of America, where oil currently is extracted. In discussing this I would like to draw the attention of the House to an interesting report of the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources in Canada, entitled: 'The National Energy Program 1980'. As that report points out, governments have responded to the dramatic changes in the oil industry by developing a large public sector. The British National Oil Corporation has been extensively engaged in exploration and development. Rather foolishly the ideologically inspired tinkering of the Thatcher Government has deprived the British public of all the benefits that it might expect by restricting the corporations activities in the North Sea. However, it continues to remain an important part of the British process of oil production and extraction and will, I understand, at least be permitted by the Government to enter into joint arrangements in the development of some of those off-shore leases; the type of joint arrangement in fact that we on this side of the House would envisage for our idea of a hydrocarbon corporation. That type of arrangement appears to be proving so successful around the globe. As I have mentioned, Canada is a nation which, whilst in many ways it has an economy and a resources base equivalent to ours, nevertheless is much more successful in the exploitation of its mineral resources, including oil, and much more successful in ensuring that that is done on behalf of the public and to the public benefit through public involvement and intervention. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely. Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan have established corporations partly or wholly owned by the provincial government. I should point out here that some of the governments involved are tory governments and some were governments which, like ourselves, were affiliated with the Socialist International. But the corporations which were established by those governments have been maintained by subsequently elected conservative governments and, of course, the Canadian federal government, which has been exclusively of one a variety of conservative party-that is liberal or officially conservative-has created Petro-Canada. Here is how the Canadian Department of Energy, Mines and Resources assessed the value of Petro-Canada:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Events since Petro-Canada was created have reinforced the general appreciation of the positive role that can be played and has been played by such an instrument, as a 'window' on the industry, a stimulus to activity, and a supporter of domestic industries providing goods and services to the energy sector. Nevertheless, direct public sector participation in this sector remains too low. By world standards, the degree of private sector involvement in the Canadian oil industry is high. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable members to think how much higher it is when we compare the Australian situation with the world standard. The Department continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The industry owes much of its prosperity to cash flow and incentives by Canadian consumers and taxpayers, few of whom are in a position to share in the benefits of industry growth. For most Canadians, the only way to ensure that they do share in the wealth generated by oil, and to have a say in companies exploiting that resource, is to have more companies that are owned by all Canadians-more companies like Petro-Canada. </PARA>
<PARA>Many of the arguments that have been advanced by the Labor Party in debates on this matter in the Parliament over the last several years revolve around the sorts of propositions that have been put forward in this report. I will just take one of them. I refer to the value that the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources in Canada sees in organisations like Petro-Canada providing Canada with a window, as it puts it, on the nature of the oil industry and its development. </PARA>
<PARA> We in this country are babes in the wood when dealing with international corporations not only in oil areas but also in pretty well all areas of minerals and energy exploitation. The value of a hydrocarbons corporation, even though under our proposals this corporation would not be the sole developer of any fields, is that it would provide Australian civil servants and Australian Ministers with an expertise that they lack. It would permit them an understanding across a wide range of minerals and energy development that they do not possess at the moment, of international markets, the prospects for attracting investment and the prospects of effectively utilising that investment. They will find this denied to them at the moment because of their unwillingness-their ideologically based unwillingness, not a rationally based unwillingness-to see development of the sort we have proposed take place. </PARA>
<PARA> All the developments in Canada that I have been talking about have come from free enterprise governments, governments that say they are committed to free enterprise principles. We could not have presented a more ringing, if indirect, endorsement of the reasons we propose for a hydrocarbons corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> As an aside the Canadian report says one or two other interesting things. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Some have argued that Canada ought to tie its prices to the world price. This would be a mistake. Under such a policy Canadian prices would reflect uncertain and erratic movements in world oil prices. Canadian economic performance would be made even more vulnerable to the economic repercussions of the world oil situation. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, linking Canadian and world energy prices is not necessary for energy reasons. To be sure energy prices must rise, and higher prices are one mechanism to bring about increased energy conservation. But it is equally important that consumers and producers have a clear view of steady predictable future price rises. There is no need to punish consumers with large, unexpected price changes. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, this Canadian energy report, produced by a responsible authority in Canada and endorsed by Conservative and Liberal Canadian governments, makes precisely the points about the effect on the Canadian economy of the type of policy on oil parity pricing pursued by this Government that we have been making in this House for years now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The report points out the very considerable damage it would envisage being done to the Canadian economy by precisely the steps taken by this Government. The steps taken by this Government do not even have the rationale put forward by advocates of similar policies in Canada in that they are being taken as a means of raising revenue; they are not being taken as a means of pursuing an energy policy related to conservation. So the Australian Government, in order to get itself out of some of the problems that essentially it has created by its reluctance to crack down on the Australian tax avoidance industry, has produced an economic policy which the legislation we are discussing today celebrates and which, in the terms of a responsible Canadian authority, is likely to produce economic disasters and difficulties. The point is that effective energy conservation and oil exploration and production require extensive planning and a considerable sense of national direction. Only an authority capable of involving itself thoroughly in the whole process and only a government determined to involve itself thoroughly in the whole process will produce the systematic development that we need in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have put forward constructive proposals. But the Government shows no signs of learning either from our proposals or from the experience of countries in a similar position to Australia. It is not learning not because it does not see the essential rationality of our propositions. It is not learning because it operates in this area with ideological blinkers that are very much to the detriment of the long term interests of the Australian population. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was most enlightened to hear the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) make reference to the proposal by the Australian Labor Party to introduce a national hydrocarbons corporation. I had thought from my reading of some Press reports of moves from within the Australian Labor Party that perhaps it was moving away from its socialist objectives. But on the basis of what the honourable member for Swan said today it is blatantly clear that the Australian Labor Party still has a very firm objective to nationalise the oil industry in Australia. I think that point needs to be remembered by the House. I think we need to remind the public of what are the objectives of the Australian Labor Party if it ever had the opportunity to govern in the future. From my point of view, and I think from the Government's point of view, we would see the nationalisation of the oil industry by whatever mechanism as a disaster that could lead only to higher oil and petrol prices in this country. Such a move would certainly chop off the possibility of further development and exploration in the oil industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill validates the policies that this Government has followed for quite some time in that it has tied the price of Australian produced crude to the base rate that is charged for Saudi Arabian light crude oil. That policy has been disputed by some honourable members on the opposite side of this chamber as being not in the best interests of Australia. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Since the Government moved to world parity pricing for light crude oil, there has been a very substantial increase in the rate of development and exploration for new oil in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all too well aware of the fact that production from our main oil producing wells in Bass Strait will start to taper off by 1985. If we do not develop more oil resources in this country, we place ourselves in the position of being totally in the hands of the Middle East oil producers; and we place in jeopardy all our industries and transport systems. The Government has encouraged exploration companies to find new oil in this country so that we can retain our self sufficiency. I find it difficult to understand why any honourable member in this place could argue against that policy. Also implicit in this legislation is that, as a means of conserving our scarce petroleum products, the Government is continuing with its policy to encourage motorists and others to convert their vehicles to liquid petroleum gas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the comments of my friend from Franklin (Mr Goodluck). He has been a staunch advocate of such oil policies and he has highlighted some of the inequities which have occurred in the oil industry. Since he has been in this place he has pursued those matters vigorously. The Government is legislating to decrease the excise on liquid petroleum gas from $43.48 per kilolitre to $36.67 per kilolitre. That effectively reduces the price of liquid petroleum gas as against other petroleum products and acts as an incentive and an encouragement to motorists to convert their vehicles to liquid petroleum gas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things in the Bill that is before us now that I find extremely encouraging is that the Government has decided that it will be Government policy that the ethanol components in petroleum products or in petroleum mixtures will not be subject to excise duty. I see that as a very positive and encouraging move. In Tasmania, there has been and still is a very strong move to develop a sugar beet industry for the purpose of producing ethanol as a blend mixture for petroleum products. I see this move by the Government to allow the ethanol component to be sold duty free, as one of the most positive contributions that it can make to help in the development of the sugar beet and ethanol industry in Tasmania. </PARA>

I think we should adopt any contribution that can be made on the basis of producing petroleum products from sources other than crude oil which is extracted from the ground. We have tremendous potential in this country, from all of our agricultural crops, to produce fuel resources from other than our crude oil reserves; but we need to develop the ethanol component industry, if I can use that terminology, far more than we are doing at the moment. I think that this move by the Government is a very positive contribution. It will certainly help those interests in Tasmania which are trying to develop an ethanol industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill is to enact the changes in excise payable on oil and liquefied petroleum gas which came into operation in line with new import parity prices for oil on 1 January this year. As we all know, the Fraser Government's policy is to increase the price of Australian oil every six months in line with increases in the world oil price-import parity pricing, as it has come to be known. The Opposition's view on this policy also is well known. We are opposed to import parity pricing. We do not believe Australians should be forced to pay through the nose for their own oil. The Opposition is opposed also to the use of the crude oil levy as a mechanism for taxing oil producers. It is inefficient and inequitable and should be removed and replaced by a properly designed resources rent tax which is neutral in its effect, efficient, and a better mechanism to divide this wealth between the companies and the community. The Opposition is opposed also to the Government's policies on LPG, particularly its policy of increasing the Australian LPG price in line with the oil price. For those reasons, the Opposition opposes this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under Government policy, Australian oil prices keep rising in line with the world price. Australians now pay $30.23 a barrel for local oil. When the Fraser Governent was elected in 1975 the price was only $4.33 a barrel, so it has risen from $4.33 to $30.23. There is no reason why we should pay for our own oil the high prices that are being charged by other countries. We are 70 per cent self-sufficient. This should protect Australians from high overseas prices. Why should Australians pay a high price for petrol when they do not pay high prices for gas, coal or electricity? The price of gas in Melbourne is around $3 a barrel oil equivalent. The price of gas in Sydney is slightly higher. The price of electricity does not reflect ruling steaming coal prices in the world market. </PARA>
<PARA> As a nation we have decided to give consumers the benefit of having our own resources, yet the same policy does not apply to oil. The doubling of petrol prices under the Fraser Government has been unnecessary. It has been a major contributor to inflation at a time when the Government claims to be fighting inflation. On the other hand, the Australian Labor Party has a policy on oil which will protect Australian consumers from the full inflationary effects of continued price increases by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, a policy which will return to the public a fair share of revenues gained by producers and encourage the fullest possible development of Australia's petroleum resources. The cost of producing local oil is about $1 a barrel, yet we are now paying over $30 a barrel for the privilege of using it. Of course, the bulk of the difference goes to the Government by way of the crude oil levy or the petrol tax as it has come to be known. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) continues with the charade of ruling over an alleged low tax government, yet under the Prime Minister oil taxes have increased more than tenfold. We have a sleight-of-hand policy, a tax by stealth levied at the bowsers instead of being levied directly through the tax system or through incomes, as is done with the pay-as-you-earn system. This financial year tax receipts from the crude oil levy, the excise of LPG and the excise on petroleum products-that is, the old pump tax-will amount to an equivalent of 30 per cent of total pay-as-you-earn income tax receipts. Australians are being slugged, not just through the normal tax system, but by the growing impost which is levied by way of this indirect tax through taxes on petrol. During the last election campaign the Prime Minister said that any increase in the revenue from oil would be used to reduce personal income tax or to raise family allowances. What has happened to this promise? Admittedly, the revenue increase was not as large as expected, but it was $50m. When will the Government stand by its commitment and return this money to the Australian public?</PARA>
<PARA> The high petrol prices are being packaged under the guise of an energy conservation program; that is, that Australian oil is to be saved. On examination we find that this is another sleight-of-hand. Any fall in energy consumption does not save one drop of Australian oil. Australia is 70 per cent self-sufficient. It keeps producing the same amount irrespective of consumption. If consumption rises or falls, all that changes is our level of imports. We keep using Australian oil at the same rate. Bass Strait and the other oil producing centres produce at maximum capacity. They will continue to produce at maximum capacity. Nothing which the Government does by way of price or the conservation effect of price will alter in any way the rate of production from Bass Strait, Moonie or Barrow Island. All we have is the possibility of a reduction in imports arising through the conservation effect of high prices. Given the fact that Australia has a burgeoning primary export sector, the problem of paying for imports does not seem to be a particularly onerous problem at this stage. Yet the whole pattern of our energy pricing policies has been distorted simply by the Government's quest for revenue which comes from the crude oil levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The other justification that the Government uses is that a high price is needed to encourage exploration. This is also a furphy and it is used against the Australian Labor Party. In fact, the Labor Government of Prime Minister Whitlam introduced the policy of paying the world price for new discoveries of oil; that is, the promise to pay the ruling world price for oil yet to be discovered. That policy was adopted by the coalition parties in 1976 and has ruled since its introduction in September 1975. This is the policy under which oil discoveries, if any, are to be made. This is the policy under which exploration in Australia continues. It is a policy common to both parties. The trite argument advanced by the Government that one needs to have a high price-the world price-for oil discovered 10 years ago in order to keep exploration going is nonsense. What keeps exploration running is the promise to pay the world price for new oil. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the companies exploring in Australia at the moment are not oil producers. As they are not oil producers, they get no revenue from the present policy. So, regardless of what price we have for old oil, if one is simply an explorer-not an oil producer-one does not get any revenue from the present policy anyway. Exploration would continue under the promise to pay the world price. The argument used by the Government that one needs to have this high price is nonsense. No additional encouragement is given for exploration in the old oil pricing policy, except for the Esso and BHP companies. Those companies certainly have been substantially bankrolled by the increases in the price of oil from Bass Strait. None of the other exploration companies operating in Australia receives a dollar from the old oil policy-the policy which makes Australians pay $30 a barrel. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy of offering the world price is very generous indeed. Not many countries offer to oil exploration companies the import parity price as the cost of production. Honourable members may know that the cost of producing oil in the Middle East is about 15c to 25c a barrel. In Australia it is about $1. In some cases-Wapet at Barrow Island and Moonie-the prices are higher because of the small pools of oil. It is about $1 a barrel for oil from Bass Strait. It is about 65c for Halibut and Kingfish and something in excess of $1 for the rest. It averages out at about $1. In the Middle East it is about 25c a barrel. </PARA>
<PARA> The only difference between the Government's policy and that the the Opposition on this matter is that the Government offers this return; that is, the payment of import parity as a cost of production, free of any tax other than company tax. In other words, it says that it will offer this price free of levy so that the only tax which would apply would be simply company tax. Let us take the situation of a producer who is producing oil at around $30-odd a barrel; that is, we are paying that producer $30-odd a barrel for the oil in Australia. Let us imagine that that producer happens to find a modest size pool of oil, say, in 350 or 400 feet of water, which is the most likely scenario in Australia. Let us be generous and say that it costs the producer $4 to $5 a barrel to produce it, compared with the $1 which it costs to produce Bass Strait oil. That still leaves an excess of profit over costs of about $25 a barrel. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Government's policy for new oil, the only tax which would be paid on that $25 is company tax, which is 47c on the dollar. In other words, the companies would pay about $10 a barrel of the $25 and $15 over and above costs would remain with the company. That is simply too much. There is no way any government could stand by that policy. Frankly, I do not think there is anyone in the Australian exploration industry who believes that the promise of import parity without levy has any validity to it at all. I am quite certain that everyone in the industry believes that if a new oilfield were found today and production from it started within five or six years time a levy would be imposed upon it, as well there should be. The only dfference between the Government and the Opposition is that we are saying there should be now. The Government has declined to say that there should be. We are saying that a resources rent tax should be applied to all oil production in Australia so that a fair and equitable distribution of wealth is achieved on a profits related basis. That is how it ought to be, particularly when there is a Government decision changing the nature of the returns to companies. In that way we could have the best of both worlds-the benefit of lower prices from Bass Strait and yet maintain the high price for new oil, take the tax-take away from it, and put back some of that money into alternative energy or further exploration. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the Government's crude oil policy which needs a mention is the nature of the crude oil levy. All levies are arbitrary, inefficient and inequitable. They create distortions in investment decisions, in particular, in the bringing into production of smaller pools of oil and in the extraction of maximum possible levels of oil from producing fields. The levies also have to be changed frequently and arbitrarily to take into account changing prices. We have seven levies operating on Bass Strait which have to be changed every six months. This system should be replaced by a properly designed resources rent tax, which may be called a super-profits tax. A resource rent tax would only operate after a project has earned a threshold rate of return on investment sufficient to begin and maintain production. It would represent a sharing of profits rather than an addition to costs and would enable the economic recovery in full of Australia's oil reserves. In other words, no small pool of oil would be left wasting. It would not be too expensive. The tax system would not mitigate against secondary recovery techniques or other things which may be expensive and may cost more than the present levy system would allow. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Government's policy on liquefied petroleum gas. Part of this legislation seeks to change the excise on naturally occurring LPG from $43.48 to $36.67 a kilolitre. This excise change is a further indication of the mess the Government's policy is in. On 1 January we saw the price of domestically consumed LPG go up from $227.63 to $250.23 a tonne but the excise went down by almost $7 a tonne. This is because the rate of excise is a function of the Australian price and the world price. We now have the world price falling but the Australian price increasing. The Government no longer has a credible policy in relation to LPG. The whole approach is ad hoc. Every attempt to rectify the situation only compounds the problem. Liquefied petroleum gas is a premium fuel, particularly for automotive use. It has the potential to satisfy 10 per cent to 15 per cent of our liquid fuel requirements, but the conversion of cars has almost stopped. This is because the Government has created uncertainty about price, safety and fuel quality. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's stated policy is to encourage automotive use and discourage houshold and industrial applications, but it works in the opposite direction. The price to industry and households is subsidised but automotive users have to pay the full price set by the Government. Confusion reigns supreme. The whole policy needs to be reviewed and rationalised. We have seen in Australia a very dramatic rise in the price of LPG. In 12 months it trebled from $88 a tonne in January 1979 to $252 a tonne in January 1980. This led to a halting in car conversions and complaints from household consumers. The Government abandoned the policy and in April of last year introduced the three tier pricing structure. Already we have found that we are back to the price where it was adjusted some years ago. The whole LPG policy is in serious need of review. I will be making a more lucid and more comprehensive exposition of the Government's attitude to LPG at a later opportunity. Suffice to say that the present LPG arrangements cannot continue. They needed to be changed. Because this Bill gives effect to the present policy and to the oil pricing policy, the Opposition opposes it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the House for too long. I wish to add to and support the remarks made by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) and particularly the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley). As I recall it the honourable member was discussing the Canadian approach and its policy to its oil problem. He contrasted the policies which were adopted in Canada with what I might call the bankrupt policies of this Government. A very impressive article was published in the Australian on 6 March under the heading 'Massive price-fixing in Canada alleged'. It dealt with an investigation which was launched in 1973 after the Consumers Association of Canada charged that Imperial Oil Ltd, Shell Canada Ltd, BP Refinery Canada Ltd, Sun Oil Co. Ltd and Great Canadian Oil Sands Ltd were involved in fixing prices at the petrol pump and monopolising the market. The article stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A Federal report, which was to be released yesterday, claims massive price-fixing by Canada's major oil companies is costing the public billions of dollars, according to newspaper reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Government officials declined to comment on the reports, which are said to be based on information from a seven-volume study prepared after eight years of investigation by the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Corporate Affairs Minister, Mr Andre Ouellet, told the House of Commons on Tuesday the report would be released yesterday by the department's Bureau of Competition Policy. </PARA>
<PARA>I might indicate that it is badly needed in this country and is long overdue. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Canadian press said the 1700-page, seven-volume report contained details of collusion among the oil companies to fix prices and made specific recommendations on how the practice could be halted. </PARA>
<PARA> The investigation, involving the seizure of hundreds of thousands of oil company documents, showed virtually every major oil firm had been involved in the price fixing over a period of 10 years, the news agency said. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> But Mr Ouellet said the report would be submitted to the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission for a full public airing of corporate practices. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Robert Bertrand, director of the Bureau of Competition Policy, led the investigation into the allegations and recommended holding an inquiry rather than immediately laying criminal charges. </PARA>
<PARA> The restrictive trade practices hearings are expected to begin within the next months, Mr Ouellet said. </PARA>
<PARA>I seriously suggest to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) that any investigation or inquiry carried out under the same terms of reference, with the same criteria, in this country would reach the same conclusions and findings as that report. Our consumers, in all fairness to this country, have been taken to the cleaners by the collusive practices of oil companies in this country for far too long. The scandal in Australia is no different from the scandal in Canada. It was only revealed in Canada because of the pressure by consumer organisations which led to a full-scale inquiry taking place. That inquiry has been going on since 1973. The Minister may recall that the Labor Government instituted a royal commission on petroleum headed by Mr Justice Collins. If my memory serves me correctly, at the moment this Government came into office the commission had reached what was termed the seventh committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> It did not take this Government very long to have that inquiry killed off. The reason was simple. By the time the Collins Royal Commission reached the seventh report, it was dealing with two basic issues, pricing and transfer pricing. It has taken us a long time, firstly, to investigate the real structure of oil pricing in this country and, secondly, to overhaul section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I make it clear to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs that if this Government is concerned about the consumer-obviously it is not because of its policies on oil at the moment-it ought to fund a fact-finding delegation to go to Canada to investigate exactly the structure of the Canadian inquiry and its findings. It should then institute exactly the same inquiry in Australia. I sincerely ask the Government to consider that suggestion because of the vast amounts of money involved and the impact that oil prices are having on consumers throughout the length and breadth of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Swan said this morning, one can assert only that the Government's view of the Australian Labor Party's policy on the establishment of hydrocarbon corporation is odd, to say the least. We are the only country in the world with oil reserves, with the exception of the United States of America, that has not seen fit to set up a government agency to act in competition with oil companies and inject the necessary funds for exploration. The Government, day after day, condemns the Labor Party's policy on a hydrocarbon corporation, but when we consider the Government's foreign investment guidelines and policies we are amazed to find that a number of the corporations that it has allowed exploration rights in this country, for instance in the field of uranium, are basically statutory bodies of governments overseas. One example is British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. There was no reluctance on the Government's part to allow it prospecting rights in Australia. It then says to the Australian public that in no circumstance can it extend the same rights to government bodies in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the mining of diamonds; they will be a very vital resource in the future. Let us consider the ownership and structure of the no-liability Ashton Mining company. The Malaysia Mining Corporation Berhad owns 50.14 per cent. Tanks Consolidated Investment Ltd of the Bahamas owns 10.21 per cent. The company is 39.65 per cent Australian owned. The Malaysian Mining Corporation is 71.4 per cent owned by Pernas, which is an agency of the Malaysian Government. The remaining 28.6 per cent is held by an associate of De Beers in South Africa. I suggest that we ought to be a little more consistent. The inconsistency is on the Government's side. I conclude on this note: There is no doubt that an investigation of the sort to which I have referred would reveal exactly the same findings in this country as have been found in Canada and the United States in relation to anti-trust and collusive practices year after year. It is not good enough for the Government merely to fix oil prices without a thorough investigation. An investigation would reveal that the consumers in this country are being taken to the cleaners by the oil companies in the same way as they are in Canada. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) views with concern the failure of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to address themselves in their statement in the Altona 35-hour week case to the wider public interest and the flow on effect,</PARA>
<PARA> (2) requests the Government to intervene in all Conciliation and Arbitration hearings relating to an extension of the 35-hour week, to present a detailed case outlining the effects such moves will have on the economy, employment, investment and on our international competitiveness, and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) further requests the Government in such submissions to remind the Commission that under section 39 (2) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act it is bound to consider the likely effects of its decision on the economy with special reference to the likely effects on the level of employment and inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that in recent times the decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission involving those unions employed at Altona has brought the 35-hour week matter to a head. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out initially that my concern is not that we will eventually have a 35-hour week but rather the timing of the introduction of those shorter working hours. As I have said in this House before, I believe that, just as we had a reduction from a 44-hour working week to a 40-hour week, eventually we will have a reduction to a 35-hour working week. However, the crucial point to make is that such a reduction cannot be justified at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my hope that there will be a bipartisan attitude to this motion. I note that there is some Labor Party support. For example, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), on 20 May last year said in this House:</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the implementation immediately or in the near future of a universal 35-hour week would have devastating consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe and I trust that he does, that that statement is still true. It gives support to the Government's case. I turn firstly to the Altona decision.</PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that when the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission makes decisions in relation to working hours, it bear in mind the overall consequences of its decisions. I make the point that I am not reflecting on the Commission per se, but rather on this particular decision. The Government has made it very clear that there is a need in the process of conciliation and arbitration for the commissioners to address themselves to the state of the economy and the effect that their decisions will have on employment. The Government has amended the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in an endeavour to ensure that the Commission takes account of the effects of its decisions. Section 39 (2) of the Act refers to the consideration by the Commission of matters such as hours of work. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Commission shall take into consideration the public interest and for that purpose shall have regard to the state of the national economy and the likely effects on that economy of any award that might be made in the proceedings or to which the proceedings relate, with special reference to likely effects on the level of employment and on inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> On 24 March, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission issued a document called a statement. The statement was nine pages long. In it, the Commission discussed the approach it had received from the unions and employers at Altona and also the approaches it has received from the National Employers' Industrial Council and the Commonwealth Government by way of intervention. Page 4 of the statement refers to the employers and the unions at Altona. It states that they:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . submitted that as a result of the cost savings agreed upon, the overall cost impact was negligible and that the other aspects referred to in the agreements, for example, the problem-solving procedures, would lead to greatly improved industrial relations in the complex. This would be in marked contrast to the position which had existed in the six years or so since 1974 when the oil companies had agreed to a 35-hour week. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 8 of the statement the Commission approved of the agreement. One of the reasons it gave was the resultant improvement in industrial relations. Those parts of the Commission's statement raise three distinct problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the employers and unions have made it clear that the granting of a 35-hour week in some sections of an industry causes grave difficulties in other industries and increases the prospects of a flow-on. The members of the Commission, however, leave themselves open to the criticism that they did not address themselves to the consequences of a flow-on to the wider economy of their decision. They say that the new agreement reached at Altona would improve industrial relations and that the employers and unions had submitted:</PARA>
<PARA> This would be in marked contrast to the position which had existed in the 6 years or so since 1974 when the oil companies had agreed to a 35-hour week. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the fact that one section of the industry had agreed to a 35-hour week had made for a more difficult industrial relations situation which was now being solved by the granting of a 35-hour week to yet another group. Surely that decision will have the same result. It is likely to create more problems than it solved. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point of concern is that at page 8 of the statement by the members of the Commission they decided to approve the agreements because of the suggested result of an improvement in industrial relations. On the same page, they state:</PARA>
<PARA> The behaviour of some employees who attended the proceedings before us has given us some cause to question their bona fides in observing the terms of the agreements. This emphasises careful monitoring is essential. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission therefore called into question the likelihood of the greatly improved industrial relations which they said was one of the reasons for the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, I believe that their statement is wide open to abuse. The Commonwealth and the National Employers Industrial Council claimed that the agreements were the product of industrial pressures and that many of the alleged cost saving factors were gained merely by the removal of inefficient work practices, many of which had arisen from industrial disputes. The Commission's statement would then seem to be an open invitation to those unions which are endeavouring to implement a 35-hour week to promote industrial unrest in order that they can then go to the Commission and say: 'We will give you industrial peace if you give us a 35-hour working week'. </PARA>
<PARA> The first section of the motion I have moved states:</PARA>
<PARA> That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) views with concern the failure of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to address itself in its statement in the Altona 35-hour week case to the wider interest and the flow on effect, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The matter was raised by the Commonwealth and the National Employers Industrial Council. The Commission referred to it when it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It was further claimed that the increased costs which would be encountered by some companies were far from negligible and that if the Commission approved the agreements, a precedent would be established which would flow to other areas; first, no doubt, to other chemical companies and particularly those in areas adjacent to the 6 companies. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Commission statement said the employers and the Commonwealth put to it. Apart from that statement recounting the submissions of the Commonwealth, the Commission did not address itself to the effects of its decision to approve the agreement. Yet, it acknowledged, as I have already outlined, that pressure for this reduction in working hours arose out of a previous agreement to reduce working hours to another section of the industry. In other words, it is clearly acknowledged that there are flow-on effects and that this case is the result of those flow-on effects. But the Commission has failed to address itself to the flow-on effects of its own decision. Further, the Commission has said that one of the reasons for approval of the agreement is that it will lead to better industrial relations. At the same time they have expressed concern at the behaviour of some employees at the proceedings which led them to question whether the terms of the agreement would be upheld.</PARA>
<PARA> It is primarily the failure of the members of the Commission to address themselves in this case to the effects of their decision on the economy and on inflation that is my greatest concern. The paramount issue is whether the general economy can stand a reduction in working hours. We know that Australia has been through an economic recession. We believe that we are now on the path of recovery. There are clear indications that we are returning to economic growth. It would be my desire to ensure that all Australians benefit from that growth through an increase in their standard of living. However, it is also my earnest desire that that recovery ought not to be aborted by the early introduction of a 35-hour week. There is no doubt that the flow-on effect of the introduction of a 35-hour week in this case-the Altona case-will lead to pressure for the introduction of the same hours in other industries. Whilst it is debated that the costs to the companies in the Altona case are negligible, it is clear that these companies are capital intensive ones. The labour component is a relatively small proportion of their costs. However, the flow-on of reduced working hours will have a critical effect on the labour intensive industries where reduced working hours will lead to an increase in the unit labour cost. That will either lead to a reduction in the employers' profits, and so a reduction in investment and a reduction in the number of new jobs created, or it could lead to increased product prices which will result in increased inflation and again will jeopardise the improvement in the number of people finding jobs. Either way, it seems clear to me that there is a direct threat to our continued prospects of economic growth. There is a threat that we will re-enter the inflationary spiral. There is a threat that those without jobs will have even less chance of obtaining them. It could put at risk some of those who currently hold jobs. These are the issues which section 39 (2) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act requires the Court to look at when making decisions in relation to this matter. As I have said, the members of the Commission failed to address themselves to this problem in their statement. The Opposition is in an untenable position in this matter. The Opposition has continually been telling us that the economy is not improving and that the economic growth which is in prospect for this country will not eventuate. Let me take the words of the Leader of the Opposition in addressing a National Press Club luncheon on 9 October last year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The expected boom of the 1980s would not match the bonanza of the sixties. </PARA>
<PARA>Later he said:</PARA>
<PARA> On present trends and under present policies, more than half a million Australians would be out of jobs by the new year. </PARA>
<PARA>On 27 June last year, the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA> My prediction is a CPI index in excess of 12 per cent for the year to December. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, of course, the inflation rate that year turned out to be 9.2 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed a twenty-five per cent error. However, if we were to accept the Labor Party's dismal prediction of economic recovery its members cannot with any sincerity come into this House and say: 'The economy can stand a reduction in the number of working hours.' That reduction will further prejudice the economic growth which is in prospect for this country. The Leader of the Opposition is not by himself in these predictions of doom. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) on 29 September said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Inflation will reach 12 to 13 per cent by the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, inflation reached 9.2 per cent. However, I repeat that it is clear that, if we accept the Opposition's view of the economy, it is even harder to accept that the Opposition could in any way support the introduction of a 35-hour week which will prejudice our fight against inflation and our fight against unemployment. As I have said, the Leader of the Opposition has made his position quite clear when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the implementation immediately or in the near future of a universal 35-hour week would have devastating consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>I thoroughly agree with the Leader of the Opposition and I hope that he will come in here to support this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's spokesman for industrial relations, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), argued in this House last week that because the standard working hours were reduced from 44 hours to 40 hours in 1947:</PARA>
<PARA> No other period in history has witnessed the dramatic changes of the last 34 years. Therefore, to the extent that the Full Bench was right in saying in 1947 that, because of changes that had taken place up to 1947, history had not stood still and leisure could be improved, so much more true is the case that, in 1981, it is the height of unrealism to suggest that we have come to the end of the line. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the words of the honourable member for Wills. In other words, he is arguing that because of what has happened over the last 37 years, as a result of what he calls the technological revolution, it is now time to reduce working hours again. There is a fundamental flaw in that argument. The honourable member has conveniently forgotten that hours of work are not the only measure in judging relative prosperity or sharing with employees the wealth they have created. For example, he failed to mention that in 1947 annual leave amounted to about two weeks but now is four weeks and in some cases more. He failed to mention that since 1947 there has been implemented an annual leave loading under which people are paid 17 1/2 per cent more when they go on holidays than when they are at work. He failed to mention the general availability of long service leave. He failed to mention superannuation entitlements, which have been improved and have been extended to many more employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member did not fail on just that count. He tried to promote his argument by quoting an article in the Economist of 19 July, part of which said 'hours are gradually shrinking almost everywhere in the industrialised world'. The honourable member said:</PARA>
<PARA> If that is the truth, and it is happening everywhere else, it is completely misrepresenting the situation to say that as it is happening in Australia our competitive position will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA>I took the trouble to examine the article from which he had quoted. There is nothing like a little bit of mischievous quoting. This was selective quoting at its worst. The first paragraph of the article started by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Trade unions across Europe still have a long way to go to reach their target of a 35-hour working week. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the first three lines of the same article, yet the honourable member tried to give the impression that the article was indicating that Australia was the only country that had not implemented shorter working hours. In other words, he has come in here and argued on behalf of the non-thinking union leaders who are determined to wreck this country's economy for their own self-seeking aims. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me add that, on the matter of wages, it is also clear that the sorts of arguments that have been used in recent times to support the introduction of the 35-hour week have also been used in recent pay negotiations. The estimate for the December quarter 1980 is that average weekly earnings, exclusive of overtime, for adult male full time employees stood at $265 or, in seasonally adjusted terms, $254, an increase of 15.2 per cent over the figure for the December quarter in 1979. Perhaps honourable members would like to compare that with the rate of inflation. It is quite clear that there have been increases in wages that have been way beyond the increase in the inflation rate. In other words, in real terms, employees are now better off, and further to increase production costs by a reduction in working hours at this time, in view of the effect that it would have on the economy, on inflation and on employment, cannot be justified. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion that has been moved by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) is an extremely disturbing one, not just because of the inaccuracies and unrealities upon which it is based but because it represents one of the most insidious attacks upon the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and the intergrity of its members, that we have ever witnessed in this country. I ask honourable members to note the composition of the bench in the Altona case: Mr Justice Williams, who was appointed to the tribunal in 1969; Mr Justice Coldham, who was appointed to the tribunal in 1971; and Mr Commissioner Neyland, who was appointed to the tribunal in 1979. Each of those gentlemen was appointed to the tribunal by this Government or its conservative predecessors. The presiding justice, Mr Justice Williams, is a man of very senior experience which dates back to his appointment in 1969. I ask honourable members to appreciate just what is being said in this motion in respect of those three members who, I repeat, were appointed by this Government or previous conservative governments. I will deal with each aspect of the motion separately. First, let me examine the third part, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable members says: 'Hear, hear'. The clear implication is that these members of the Commission who were appointed by this Government or its predecessors, have not acted according to their oath of office and indeed, have been guilty of a dereliction of duty. The provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are quite clear. Under section 11, each member of the Commission is required to take an oath or affirmation of office. That section provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A member of the Commission shall, before proceeding to discharge the duties of his office, take before a Justice of the High Court or a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State an oath or affirmation in accordance with the form in the schedule. </PARA>
<PARA>That form is quite clear and straightforward. It provides that the person concerned shall swear to be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second and state that he 'will faithfully and impartially perform the duties of that office. So Help Me God'. That is the oath required of them under the Act. Members of the Commission are required to take that oath of office to discharge their obligations which, in turn, are laid down in the Act. Each of those members-appointed by this Government or its predecessor-has taken that oath, part of which is a requirement to act in accordance with the provisions of the statute. Yet, in this insidious motion, the mover and seconder, as supporters of the Government, are implying that Mr Justice Williams, Mr Justice Coldham and Mr Commissioner Neyland did not so act. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make it clear that one may argue about the merits of a decision, as everyone is entitled to do, but this motion is not directed to merits. It goes to the very question of the failure on the part of members of the Commission to act in accordance with the requirements of the statute. Having said that since that forms the basis of the motion, and no more outrageous motion could be moved in respect of the integrity of the Arbitration Commission or its members, let us consider the facts of the matter against the inaccurate assertions contained in paragraphs (1) and (2) of the motion. From reading the motion one would assume that the Commonwealth Government had not intervened in the Altona case. What in fact happened? The decision handed down on 24 March makes clear what happened. Honourable members will recall that in this indictment of the members of the Commission-that they had not done this or that or addressed their mind to anything-the honourable member referred to the pages of the decision. I wonder whether the honourable member took the trouble to read the whole of the decision and, in particular, the last sentence. The last sentence states:</PARA>
<PARA> We will publish full reasons for our decision at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Barker gets up and attacks these members. He attacks their integrity. No greater attack could be made on the members of this Commission. He says that they have not done this, they have not said that and they have not said the other thing, and yet the final sentence in their statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> We will publish full reasons for our decision at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the most contemptible motion one could imagine being put before this House. People appointed by this Government and its conservative predecessors-we can go back to an appointment of 1969-have taken their oath of office and have handed down a decision. They have pointed out that this is merely an interim set of statements and that they will publish full reasons. Then they are subjected to attack in this House on the basis that they have not said X, Y and Z. But they have pointed out that they will hand down their full reasons later. If the honourable member had any decency and respect he would stand up now and apologise to the members of the Commission and ask the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) to withdraw this motion. Of course, he has not such decency and nor have the honourable members around him, so we will deal in these circumstances with the facts as against their assertion. At page 2 of the decision, the judges and the commissioner stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The parties also reported that . . . agreements had been reached for a number of improved and more efficient working methods resulting in a considerable cost saving which would almost entirely offset the overall cost of introducing a 35 hour week at the six companies. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission then says that the parties coming before it under the properly constituted procedures of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act have also reached agreement on a number of matters. It then reports in regard to the shorter working week committee which is to solve problems which may arise, in respect of the introduction of the shorter working week, and the shorter working week monitoring committee which will be a continuation of the working party to monitor the implementation of the costs saving factors. The Commission continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Procedures for settling disputes and for examining technological change and improving industrial relations are also contained in the agreements. </PARA>
<PARA>Are these not matters which go to the question of the public interest, and have not the judges and the commissioner concerned themselves with it? The honourable member for Barker has the temerity to accuse me of mischievous selective quotation which, on it face, is absurd. The point that I referred to--</PARA>
<PARA> Government members-Ha, ha!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members all laugh. That is the best they can do. We will see what they have to say about their inexcusable position of damning members of the Commission when that Commission has said that it has not published its full reasons and will do that later. We will see how they excuse themselves on that. Honourable members should remember what the second paragraph of the motion says. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . requests the Government to intervene in all Conciliation and Arbitration hearings relating to an extension of the 35 hour week . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In regard to that, the two judges and the commissioner, at page 3 of their decision, state:</PARA>
<PARA> Details of the cost of a 35 hour week and the amount of cost savings agreed . . . were placed before us. In addition witnesses were called from each company to explain the nature of the savings and the methods of calculation. </PARA>
<PARA>Then, the Commission had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> These witnesses were, of course, available for cross-examination by the two interveners, namely the Commonwealth and the National Employers Industrial Council. </PARA>
<PARA>So, what happened in the proceedings in terms of paragraph 2 of this motion? The Commonwealth Government did intervene in the proceedings and, as the judges and the commissioner pointed out, it had the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses who were talking about the cost impact of the 35-hour week and the counterbalancing savings and improvements in industrial relations associated with it. So, the Commonwealth Government intervened and it had the opportunity to cross-examine. What were these judges and the commissioner doing? Were they studying the racing form while this was on?</PARA>

Judges hand down decisions and say that they will give full reasons later, but honourable members who get up in this House and do what they have done-it does not matter if they say or do another thing-have sufficiently condemned themselves. The judges and the commissioner said that the Commonwealth Government had the opportunity to cross-examine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So, what have we had? There has been an arbitral hearing with two judges and a commissioner listening to two sides. There have been interveners, including the Commonwealth Government, arguing against the case and being told that they have the opportunity to cross-examine. These men, the judges and the commissioner, have taken an oath of office. They have listened to the arguments and heard the witnesses, and they have said that there was an opportunity of cross-examination. Out of all that, what does the Commission say? It says at page 5 that it has listened to the arguments of the Commonwealth, and that that part of the argument put by the Commonwealth would establish a precedent which would flow to other areas. It is said in the motion of the honourable member for Barker that the Commission failed to address itself to the question of a flow-on. That is what the motion says in its first section, but at page 5 of the judgment the judges and the commissioner say that this argument was put to them. Is it said that the judges say simply that the argument was put to them? Are they so derelict in their duty that all they can do is say that they have heard the argument put and that is where their duty and obligation, with the responsibility of their oath of office finishes? The judges have said that they have listened to the parties and to the witnesses and have given the opportunity for cross-examination and, at the end of that whole judicial process, they have made a decision. At page 8 of the judgment, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we have decided that we should approve the agreements. </PARA>
<PARA>Could there be a more contemptuous attack upon a tribunal than to say, after it has done all those things, that there will be a motion of this type in this House? I conclude by saying that in these circumstances it is no wonder or surprise that Mr C. P. Mills, a reader in commercial and industrial law at the University of Sydney said, when writing in the Sydney Morning Herald of last Saturday, that the real threat to the freedom of Australians lies not in the unions but in a government that tries to get its way by threats and bribery. As this is independent proof of the nature of this Government, I seek leave to have the article incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The article read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA'S BIG STICKS AND BRIBES THREATEN DEMOCRACY</PARA>
<PARA>The real threat to the freedom of Australians lies not in the unions, but in a Government that tries to get its way by threats and bribery, writes C. P. MILLS, reader in commercial and industrial law, University of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Recently we saw the Federal Government threatening the big stick for companies which collaborate with the Builders Labourers' Federation if and when it is deregistered. Blacklists and boycotts would befall these companies.</PARA>
<PARA> Now there is to be a sweeter prescription, a compound of bribery and corruption, for companies which resist the unions' 35-hour working week demands. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, these companies may be given extended terms for paying their bills to the Government and its agencies (including their company tax bills), penalty-free extensions of time for completing Government contracts, and prompt payment of money owed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I had thought that the Government abhorred black bans and boycotts. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have expected that any respectable Government would be concerned to see that all its creditors are paid promptly. </PARA>
<PARA> And I wonder what the Auditor-General and the Commissioner of Taxation, to say nothing of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, would have to say about ministerial directions that contractual and statutory obligations of companies are to be altered in favour of companies which support the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken two more steps along the road to a dictatorship form of rule. </PARA>
<PARA> Previous moves in that direction have been concerned mainly with securing an absolute discretion in dealing with its own employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Now it moves against private sector employers. </PARA>
<PARA> Some are to be pushed from behind to confront the BLF. In the crush, we can expect a few to be squeezed out of existence. </PARA>
<PARA> Others are to get VIP treatment in their commercial dealings with the Government, instead of standard economy class. </PARA>
<PARA> All this is being done without any special authority from Parliament. Mere executive decree is sufficient, without any statutory authorisation. That is the way a dictator rules. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe the Government is right in trying to smash the BLF, but it is a risky business. There is no guarantee that it will succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if it does succeed, we have no way of knowing what side-effects may follow. A divided and warring trade-union movement could easily result and this would cause incalculable harm to our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe, too, the Government is right about the consequences of the 35-hour week, although we might well ask whether the frightening predictions of economic disaster are any more valid now than when they were made 60 years ago when the Arbitration Court made the first reduction of weekly hours from 48 to 44, or 35 years ago when it brought in the 40-hour week. </PARA>
<PARA> Again there is a large element of risk in this part of the plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The 35-hour week probably does not yet have the degree of inevitability that the unions claim. On the other hand, the Government will need enormous support from private employers if its plan is to succeed, and employers are notoriously less cohesive than the trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> And the more effective is the Government encouragement to resist, so the heavier will be the trade union pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a distinct possibility that the Government strategy will increase the number and severity of work stoppages, and the productivity which will be lost has to be balanced against what might be saved by slowing the spread of the 35-hour week. </PARA>
<PARA> Significant numbers of blue-collar workers in the public sector are already working hours fewer than the standard 40 per week, and employers in the private sector might find this and the union pressure more persuasive than the Government lollypops. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is evidently convinced that it cannot rely on too much assistance from the Arbitration Commission in winning its two present objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if the BLF is deregistered by the Federal Court, the commission still has responsibility under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act for settling industrial disputes involving builders labourers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government certainly has not welcomed the commission's approval of the Altona 35-hour deal, and seems to be sceptical of the commission's capacity to limit reductions of hours to cases where no loss of productivity will result. </PARA>
<PARA> In the good old days it was easier for governments to get their way with the arbitration tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1920, when the president of the Arbitration Court, Mr Justice Higgins, had awarded the 44-hour week to timber workers and engineers, the then Prime Minister W. M. Hughes, blocked any more reductions by new legislation which required such decisions to be made by a Full Bench of three judges. But there were only two judges of the court at the time and the Government delayed many months before raising the number of judges to three. </PARA>
<PARA> For Mr Justice Higgins, this was the high point of four years' harassment by the Prime Minister. He resigned. </PARA>
<PARA> About 10 years later there was a similar incident in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government appointed one of the three judges of the State Industrial Commission to the Supreme Court when it appeared that the commission was about to order a cut in the State living wage. Left with only two judges, the commission was unable to function, and the living wage remained untouched. Again it was many months before the Government made a new appointment to the Industrial Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> For various reasons tactics of that kind cannot be used today by the Federal Government for achieving its present objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The only alternatives it sees for itself are threats and sweeteners for employers. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sufficiently old-fashioned to believe that we are entitled to be governed by clear and well-defined rules that can be enforced in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> A system in which we are ruled by an Executive wielding big sticks and dispensing lollypops as it pleases seems to me a most reprehensible way of running a government. </PARA>
<PARA> That is where the real threat to our freedom lies, for employers as much as for unions-indeed for all of us. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) views with concern the failure of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to address themselves in their statement in the Altona 35-hour week case to the wider public interest and the flow on effect,</PARA>

<PARA> (Notice given 1 April 1981). </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to that motion, I also support the statement of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peacock) on the 35-hour working week. This afternoon we have seen, from the histrionics of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) that both he and, indeed, the Australian Labor Party that he represents, look very much to history to justify their position on the 35-hour working week. Whatever the competence of the honourable member for Wills as an historian, he certainly has none as an economist because he has completely ignored the economic impact of the implementation of a 35-hour working week. But beyond that, he is a bad historian. In developing his argument in this debate and in dealing with the ministerial statement, the honourable member for Wills has relied on the decision of the Full Bench of the Arbitration Court in 1947 to reduce working hours from 44 a week to 40 a week. In a previous speech in this debate he quoted copiously from that judgment. Of course, any historian worth his salt would not merely look at the historical events but would place those events in their historical context. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Mr CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Any historian worth his salt would, but unfortunately the honourable member for Wills has completely ignored that. He has not placed the events of 1947 in their economic, social or political context, nor did he look at the consequences of that decision. Let me give him a few lessons in history. In 1947 both in Australia and internationally we were beginning the post-War economic boom. Australia was best placed to benefit from the development of that boom. European industry had been devastated by the effects of the Second World War and, of course, the industrial development that in recent years has been taking place in Asia, was then many years off. Australia had a very efficient primary industry which ensured that we could maximise the benefits to be then derived from the international economy. Indeed, that was recognised at that time by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. In that 1947 decision the Commission stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the appropriate time to add burdens to industry or, from another angle, to give ourselves added benefits is when industry is booming and when nature is bountiful. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission further stated in that judgment:</PARA>
<PARA>All the economists of both sides agreed that never in our history have all the factors been so favourable, nor is it easy to concieve their ever being more favourable. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, in that judgment the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was so right because, as I pointed out, we were then beginning an economic boom which was unprecedented and which is unlikely ever to be repeated. </PARA>
<PARA> But now we need to recognise that the post-War economic boom is over. The international economy has been in a recession for some years. Manufacturing industry, in particular, is in a much more competitive economic environment. To compare 1947 with the position now, far from re-enforcing the Australian Labor Party's case and that of the trade unions in favour of a 35-hour working week, in fact re-affirms the case against a 35-hour working week. We also need to look at the consequences of that decision made in 1947. As a result of the decision, the rate of inflation of 3.8 per cent in 1947 went up to 9 per cent in 1948. In 1949 it went up to 9.3 per cent; in 1950, 10.3 per cent and in 1957 it went up to a massive 20.7 per cent. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Mr CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I relate it because there is no doubt that a shorter working week made some contribution to those inflationary factors. The second piece of bad reasoning from history in the case put by the honourable member for Wills is his claim that in the 34 years since 1947 there have not been any further reductions in the length of the working week and therefore it is now appropriate to reduce it further. Of course, he completely ignores the fact that a number of benefits have been given to workers over that 34 year period. True, the national standard working week of 40 hours remains, but there have been major reductions in working time through increased annual leave, extra specific holidays, increased long service leave, reduced qualifying periods for long service leave, increased sick leave and so on. There has been a significant reduction in working hours in the 34 years since 1947. It also needs to be remembered that although many people attend their place of work for 40 hours of the week, it is very doubtful whether in many instances they actually work for a full 40 hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition, and in particular the honourable member for Wills, claim that working hours are being reduced throughout the industrialised world. But nowhere in the industrialised world are standard hours of work less than 40 a week. Of course, in many countries those standard hours of work are much higher. Even the International Labour Organisation, which the honourable member for Wills is so fond of quoting, acknowledges the fact that the economic impact must be taken into account in the move to shorter working hours. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Mr CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will quote exactly what that organisation states in relation to a shorter working week:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Such measures should take into account-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the level of economic development attained and the extent to which the country is in a position to bring about a reduction in hours of work without reducing total production or productivity, endangering its economic growth, the development of new industries or its competitive position in international trade, and without creating inflationary pressures which would ultimately reduce the real income of the workers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the International Labour Organisation states in one part of its comments with regard to reduced working hours. It also states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the rate at which hours of work are reduced and other benefits made available should remain well below the rate of growth of production. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the International Labour Organisation has to say. It clearly acknowledges that the impact of a shorter working week on the economy must be taken into account. Of course we all know that the economic impact of a shorter working week in Australia would be disastrous. The increased costs have been well documented in this debate. If employers were forced to take on extra labour to cover the reduced working hours, it would result in a labour cost increase of 14 per cent. If they took the second option, of increasing overtime, it would result in an increased labour cost of 21 per cent. If, on the other hand, they reduced output to cover the costs of reduced working hours, the cost increase would be 12 per cent. It is very true, as has been claimed by the Opposition, that as a result of the policies of the Fraser Government, the Australian economy is the healthiest that it has been for some time. Inflation has been significantly reduced, investment has increased and, of course, we are on the brink of a resources boom and the profits of many companies have shown improvement. However, it needs to be recognised that improved profitability is only such when it is measured against the disastrous situation that transpired for those companies during the period of the Whitlam Labor Government. If honourable members look at profitability across the board they will see that it is still significantly below the long run norm that was in existence prior to the advent of that Government. Furthermore, the resources boom which Australia can share in during the 1980s, is very much dependent upon a responsible attitude being adopted by the trade union movement. Irresponsibility on its part would place in severe jeopardy Australia's capacity to benefit from the wealth that we have in resources and the potential for them to be developed. Certainly the 35-hour working week is just such a piece of irresponsibility. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Mr CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not mentioned judges. The call for a 35-hour working week totally disregards the plight of the unemployed. The impact of the increased cost of our economy of the 35-hour working week would result in further destruction of employment opportunities. This is recognised in a paper prepared by Her Majesty's Treasury in England. Treasury Working Paper No. 14, published in June 1980, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The essential weakness of the argument that shorter hours are an effective way of promoting work sharing is that weekly wage rates would probably not be reduced and that any increase in output per man would be insufficient to prevent a significant rise in unit labour costs of production. Under these circumstances additional inflation would be generated and this in turn would over a period set forces in motion that wholly, or largely, offset any first round gain in employment. </PARA>
<PARA> So there we have it. There would be no benefit to the unemployed through the introduction of a 35-hour working week. Indeed, perhaps it could be said that the only benefit for unemployed people of a shorter working week would be that they would be unemployed for only 35 hours instead of 40 hours. A shorter working week would of course accelerate the replacement of men by machines, which the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) is so fond of talking about. </PARA>

<PARA> It is futile to claim that the increased costs of a shorter working week can be covered by improved productivity when, over the last few years, Australia's productivity improvement has ranged between 1 per cent to 1.7 per cent. That is nowhere near the level of productivity improvement required if the extra costs of a 35-hour working week are to be maintained. </PARA>

When some new honourable members such as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie learn something about the Standing Orders they will realise what a cognate debate is. The parties in the Altona situation agreed that the cost would be something like $34,000 or 0.18 per cent of total wages of the current award employees. But they also acknowledged that what they regard as a minimal extra cost arises because they have agreed to undertake to work normally in accordance with existing awards. So in effect the argument for the introduction of the 35-hour working week is on the basis that the employees are being rewarded for getting rid of past inefficiencies. For example, the introduction of correct timekeeping will save $16,250. The correct use of job and work cards will save $40,000. Restricting tea breaks to the existing allocated time will save $30,700.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion is a disgraceful attack on the judges concerned. As far as debate on this motion is concerned, one could sit down because that is all the motion is worth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to the statement made by the Minister for Industrial Relations. Perhaps the honourable member for Barker and the honourable member for Kingston brought forward their motion as a tactic to divert attention from the weakness of the statement put out by the Minister. The Minister in his statement said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware that an estimated 36 per cent of all full-time non-managerial employees are currently working less than 40 hours per week. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It does not follow, however, that the economy can stand an across the board application of a 35 or even a 37 1/2 hour week to the total work force. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think anybody on this side of the House or anybody in the union movement has said that. No one has said that tomorrow a 35-hour working week should be introduced right across the board. In fact we can go back to 1958-60 to look at how this principle developed over the years. At that time, the first moves were made in some industries to bring down working hours. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to recent decisions that have been made in this matter. I will quote from one decision which was made in the Postal Telecommunications Technicians Association case on 3 March 1976. The decision was made by Justices Isaacs and Sharp and Commissioner Cohen. They said:</PARA>
<PARA> After reviewing the circumstances and the submissions in the case, the Commission said it faced the following question: 'Should the Commission deny a claim for shorter hours to workers seeking the hours of work of the majority in the industry, when the granting of the claim would lead to closer and more constructive relations between labour and management, both immediately and in the long run; and when the necessary increase in productivity arises directly from such relations with no inroad on the normal trend of productivity thus making the shorter hours possible with virtually no cost to the consumer and no reduction in the standard of service . . . we would be failing in our statutory duty, if we did not grant this application and applaud the new spirit in industrial relations which it reflects. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the sort of statement that was made in 1976. In 1970, decisions were made in respect of the waterfront, oil, coal and container industries. All of these decisions have been made over a period of years, yet all of a sudden this Government has come into the House with a statement and has tried to stop history. It expects that the world will stop immediately so that it can govern for three years in peace. But these things have been happening. The world will change and can keep changing. There is nothing the Government can do about it except make funny noises as it is doing at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in his statement also said:</PARA>
<PARA>Wage restraint is crucial in meeting primary anti-inflation objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Every worker knows from experience that a wage increase means a price increase. </PARA>
<PARA>Any wage increase that I have seen comes after the wage earner has justified it in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Therefore he has to prove that there has been price increases before he gets a wage increase. So that statement is back to front. The Minister later in his statement went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The most recent statistics available indicate that in the December quarter last year, the series for average weekly ordinary time earnings for full-time non-managerial employees showed a 5.2 per cent increase over the corresponding quarter in the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I am concerned that these labour cost pressures are in the system. </PARA>
<PARA>One would think that the Government was not running the country. This Government-those who sit on the other side of the House-are running the country. It is this country that has created those pressures in the system. The Australian Council of Trade Unions advocate, Mrs Marsh, in her opening submission to the last wage case, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The combined effects of increased profitability and shortage of skilled labour means that some groups, with considerable ease, are able to successfully bargain in the field . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is the way this Government operates. It operates by supply and demand. By mismanagement it has created a serious shortage of tradesmen. Now that that serious shortage of tradesmen is starting to be reflected with the demand in resource development, it wants the world to stop. It wants everybody to hold their horses so that it can do something for three years to try to make up for what it has done. It has had six years to run this country. But we have had six years of mismanagement which has created a situation under which pressures have been exerted. It is no wonder the Minister comes into this House and says he is concerned. He is concerned because of decisions made by his own Cabinet. I turn from page 5 of the statement to page 7, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The effects, both direct and indirect, of the shorter hours campaign have now been felt in all States and many sectors of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister refers on this page to power generation. Anyone who is involved in the power generation area, as I am in my electorate and in the Latrobe Valley, has only to look at the history of the claim for a 35-hour week. That claim has been pursued by workers at the State Electricity Commission of Victoria since 1957, which is a long time, and a decision on that was brought into effect on 1 January 1981. So it cannot be said that a claim put in tomorrow for a 35-hour week will have great ramifications the day after, as seems to be the case put forward by this Government. The campaign gained greater strength in 1960 when the Australian Council of Trade Unions convened a conference of federal unions in Sydney from 5 to 7 May and said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . increasing productivity, further extension of mechanisation and introduction of automated processes emphasises the urgency for the demand for a shorter working week. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in 1960. In the early 1970s the campaign was reactivated. If we look at the history of it we will see that it continued until a decision was reached in 1980. Let us look at some of the statements that were made at the time that decision was taken. An article in the Age of 24 December 1980 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The acceptance of responsibility by employees for improving efficiency is an integral part of this agreement', Mrs Marsh said. </PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Marsh was the ACTU advocate. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Productivity agreements, by their very nature, are not capable of flowing-on.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, they have to be negotiated between workers and employers, and there is no possibility in that case of a flow-on. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an SEC official said the agreement would create an improved industrial relations climate in the power industry and result in a more efficient use of working hours. </PARA>
<PARA> The SEC area administration manager in the Latrobe Valley, Mr George Bates, said an estimated 294,900 man hours a year were expected to be saved by employees taking their morning and afternoon tea breaks on job sites . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Government spokesmen attack any approach by the employer and the employee to get together for discussions. Why is it that discussions are considered to be such a terrible thing as far as the Government is concerned? Another statement that emanates from the other side of the House is that the introduction of a 35-hour week will cost people their jobs. It is said that, if employers and employees get together for discussions and come to these agreements, it will cost people their jobs. The article goes on to quote Mr Bates, the administration manager of the SEC in the Latrobe Valley. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bates said the initial cost of introducing shorter hours would include overtime payments to existing staff while new employees were trained. It was expected to take three years for 600 vacancies to be filled. The main cost after that period would be the wages bill for the extra staff. </PARA>
<PARA>Six hundred jobs will be created by that agreement. Let us look at that cost situation. An article in the Age of 1 January 1981 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The advocate for the Government of Victoria and the SEC, Mr Ian Douglas, said shorter hours would cost the SEC $6.8m in the first year, $10.2m in the second year, $13.8m in the third year and $11.5m each year after that. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a lot of money, and that relates to the cost side. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The agreement provided savings to the SEC of $8.5m a year . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Is that the sort of negotiation that the Government says cannot take place? Are employers and employees not allowed to get together and reach agreement to improve productivity and lower costs? The Government seems to believe that this is wrong, that these people are not allowed to do this sort of thing. The Minister for Industrial Relations went on to say at page 16 of his statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government expects employers to resist industrial pressures for increased wages and reduced hours. We intend to ask employers collectively and individually to resist such claims. I have written this week to three firms which are reported to have conceded shorter working hours. </PARA>
<PARA>We know what has happened since that statement was made. We have seen headlines in newspapers all over the country about ICI Australia Ltd saying that it had decided that it would have to stop its planned program because of threats made by the Government. The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I have asked for details of any concessions they may have made and will be making a report to the Government on appropriate responses. </PARA>
<PARA>We all saw what the appropriate response was. The Chairman of ICI quickly sought to defend himself by going to the Premier of New South Wales, seeking the support of the Labor Government there to put pressure on this Government, which was trying to blackmail people into not talking. The greatest thing that any country can do for industrial relations is to encourage employers and workers to get together and talk out their problems, to find out where they can improve productivity and the cost structures of industry. This is the only way in which we will get better industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what industrial relations are all about. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides, in relation to certified agreements and consent awards, that where the parties to an industrial dispute have been able to reconcile their differences and reach agreement they may make a memorandum of the terms agreed upon and request a member of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to certify the memorandum or request a member of the Commission to make an award or order giving effect to the agreement. The Act goes on to say that awards or orders made under section 28 have the same force and effect as any award or order of the Commission. They are binding in the same way as awards or orders resulting from a decision of a member of the Commission are binding. There is further provision that a memorandum certified under section 28 is to have the same effect as and is to be deemed an award of the Commission for all purposes of the Act. Memorandums of agreement, or orders or awards made under section 28 must be certified by a member of the Commission unless any of the following factors are present: The terms of the memorandum, award or order are not in settlement of an industrial dispute; any of the terms are beyond the Commission's power to include in an award; or it is not in the public interest that the memorandum should be certified or the order or award made. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has repeatedly argued a case in the Arbitration Commission as to why the public interest should be protected. When it puts forward its case, the evidence that the judges look at clearly shows that those arguments do not stand up. As has been stated very clearly this afternoon by the honourable member for Wills about the attack of the honourable member for Barker on the Commission, it is the job of the Commission to look at the evidence and weigh it, and it is the job of the Government, if it wishes, to cross-examine witnesses. The Government does not seem to be able to justify its case. Its argument is so poor that it cannot seem to come up with a winning situation. Its method to overcome that is to come into this House and make statements about it seeking Press coverage. In fact, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) came out and sought Press coverage before the relevant Minister had a chance to report in this House on what would happen. As the Government cannot win its case in the Commission, it has decided to use scare tactics. It is trying to stop the force of history. We have to stop for three years, halt the whole works, so that the Government can get its act in order. I would say that it would be better for this Government if it got its act in order and encouraged people to talk. We might then find that we have a better industrial relations scene. It should do that instead of adopting the confrontation tactics that we are seeing from the Prime Minister of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That amounts to a reduction of about one-eighth of the working time for the majority. When I listened to the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) last week and again today I was rather reminded of one of those Sherlock Holmes stories about the dog that did not bark in the night. Honourable members might have heard it. Watson asked Holmes: 'Holmes, what about that dog?' Holmes said: 'Do you notice anything about the dog Watson?'. Watson said: 'No, I did not notice anything about it at all'. Holmes said: 'That is precisely it, because the dog did not bark'. What was significant about the performance of the honourable member for Wills was the questions to which he did not address himself. What were the questions he did not face and what were the questions that he could not face? Firstly, there was the cost of a 35-hour week and, secondly, who controls the flow-on? Will it be the honourable member for Wills acting as a latter day King Canute holding back the flow-on? There will be very little chance of that. Let us look at the way in which the honourable member went about avoiding these issues. Whatever may be said about his arguments he has a talent approaching genius for avoiding dealing with the questions before the House. Firstly, he said that the proposed 35-hour week would not be across the board. He seems to have forgotten the Australian Council of Trade Unions resolution in 1979. I believe that is an organisation with which he had some sort of attachment in 1979. When the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr N. A. Brown) referred to that resolution the honourable member for Wills said: 'What is your source? How do we know you have been accurate?' The honourable member for Diamond Valley was quoting from a resolution passed at the time that the honourable member for Wills was President of the ACTU. What did the honourable member for Wills do then? He referred to Mrs Marsh. Poor Mrs Marsh is brought in and somehow she is meant to justify the proposition that this will not be an across-the-board application or that there will not be flow-on. The honourable member for Wills would have us believe is that somehow, bit by bit, when the time is right various industries will be accommodated to a 35-hour week. What puerile nonsense. He knows that that is not true and that is the reason he could not meet it. Let us look--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it does not matter. The interjections just reveal the fragility of the case the Opposition is trying to put. Mr Dolan said: 'The role of the ACTU was often misunderstood'. There can be no doubt about that. He also said: 'It was a purely voluntary association and under its rules could not control the action of its affiliates'. There is no doubt about that either. What was the next avoidance mechanism adopted by the honourable member? He delved, like a law student in a mock trial with a bad case and no knowledge of the facts, into the decisions of yesteryear. He started off trying to put things on a philosophical basis with the 1947 decision of the standard hours inquiry. He quoted from parts of that court's decision and left out other parts. I just remind him of two of the things that were said. I refer him to page 599 of the report, under the heading 'Time for Introduction' where we find the following statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All criteria of an active virile progressive economy are present today. Our population has increased and all are working. Our sources of power are taxed to their limit and that limit is higher than ever before. Business is showing a continuous unsatisfied demand for products of all kinds. Orders sufficient to maintain activity at the highest levels are booked for years ahead over a wide range of industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Could that be said to be the case today notwithstanding that we have climbed out of a world depression far better than most industrialised countries? It most certainly could not. That was one of the major factors operating in the minds of the court when it reached its decision in 1947. I wish to make one quote further from page 601 of the same report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> There is . . . another factor the value of which is not yet appreciated, but it will be. For the first time in the history of capitalism we have 'full employment', and what is more important, the promise that it will be continued indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA>Those were the bright, happy days, no doubt when that was thought to be the case. It illustrates just how fragile the human mind is when it tries to grapple with the future. The simple fact is that judges err. Everybody in this chamber has erred in judgment on many occasions. Every judge sitting in every court has also erred. We are human. Sometimes it is worth while bearing that in mind. I wish to deal now with the Altona case and to mention one or two of the things that were said in the statement which was made.

<PARA> Over the six companies as a group the gross cost of implementing a 35-hour week was stated to be $3,871,000, the agreed offsets were $3,837,000 leaving a net increased cost of $34,000 which is 0.18 per cent of total wages of current award employees. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very coincidental figure. It just so happened that the employers on one side, who have been bludgeoned for the last six to eight weeks by continual industrial unrest, sat down with the employees, did their sums, and came up with a difference of $34,000 when they were talking about figures of close to $4m.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JJ4">Mr SPENDER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have said that I do not and never have impugned the integrity of our courts. They err from time to time but that is a different matter. For example, I would not categorise the judgment of a court as an obscenity. To do that would be to bring a court into disrepute. To impugn the integrity of its members is not a course of action which I would adopt. It is a course which is not foreign to the honourable member for Wills. If we look at what was said in the Altona case we have this odd quid pro quo: It just so happens that things will balance out and cost almost nothing at all. The companies were bludgeoned into accepting the proposal that was put to them. Quite often that takes place in so-called productivity deals. The option is to say: 'Look fellows, you should agree to this productivity deal. You should go along with us and present the best possible evidence in support of us in relation to future forecasts because if you do not you will go to the wall'. We all know that sort of an option that is. We all know the sort of answers which would be given to such an option. The next way of avoiding the issue, apart from delving through old judgments and thereby seeking to hang an argument on them, was for the honourable member for Wills to say that he refused to resort to abstruse economic theorising. That simply meant that he refused at any time to come to grips with the argument. This lamentable performance was put forward by somebody who holds the position of Opposition shadow Minister for Industrial Relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now return to the fundamental questions: Firstly, does anybody seriously believe that the conditions that presently exist in any way parallel those which existed in 1947? The answer most certainly is that we do not. Secondly, does anyone here seriously believe that there will not be a flow-on effect? Does anyone here seriously believe that other unions will say: 'Oh well, of course, that was productivity bargaining. That does not concern us. We are perfectly happy for the fellows over the road to work a 35-hour week. We will continue to work a 40-hour week'. What nonsense. Nobody in this House believes that. That is one reason it has never been put forward by the Opposition. Does anyone seriously believe there will be no cost as a result of the introduction of a 35-hour week? Not a soul believes there will not be a cost attached to it. Who will pay that cost? It will be paid by those who can least afford it, not by the unions which are represented by the honourable member for Wills and those who support him here. It will be paid by the old, the needy and those in our society who cannot look after themselves as well as others, those who do not have strong unions to push their interests to the disadvantage of the interests of the whole of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind honourable members of the last way in which the honourable member for Wills sought to avoid the issue. Today he conducted a lesson in English reading which would, I imagine, have shamed a three-year-old child. He put it forward that this was an attack on the integrity of the commissioners, who were a party to the Altona statement. That is not so. What it amounts to is a direction, a reminder to this Parliament and to the the tribunal that there are matters which have to be considered, matters that it does not appear to have considered on the basis of the statement that was made. There is not one word of censure or criticism. I refer honourable members to the relevant part which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Further requests the Government . . . to remind the Commission . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What we have been faced with today in this gamble with the future prosperity of this country indulged in by the honourable member for Wills and others is an attempt once more to divert the country's attention from the main issue-that is, who will pay, what will be the cost and who will stop the flow-on? Will it be Canute Wills? Not likely!</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PH4">Mr KENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it does. The honourable member will hear the perspective in a minute. I enjoyed listening to honourable members opposite who have never clocked on or off in a factory and yet they love to preach to the workers. I also enjoyed the little story of the honourable member for North Sydney about barking. The motion which has been moved today by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter), as well as the statement made by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peacock) last week, were calculated to frighten the workers and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission into submission. But the barking of the honourable member for Barker will not scare anyone. As a matter of fact, this debate brought on by the Government to intimidate the people has had a contrary effect. It has demonstrated beyond any doubt that the Fraser Government represents only a sectional interest, the interest of the rich.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The statement by the Minister for Industrial Relations indicates the Government's alarm, almost panic, that workers in Australia may achieve better working conditions and pay. The Minister introduced his speech by stating that the Australian economy is poised to enter a period of considerable growth. He and his colleagues have been forecasting economic recovery for five years now, and so far their forecasts have been about as accurate as those of the Weather Bureau in Melbourne. However, now that the Minister for Industrial Relations has joined his boss, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in forecasting the boom around the corner, let us, for arguments sake, accept that his forecast is correct. Would it not be reasonable to expect that wage and salary earners, the great majority of Australians, should benefit from the projected boom, that they should work a shorter week? Of course it would be reasonable!</PARA>
<PARA> However, this does not make sense to the Minister. He believes that the introduction of the 35-hour week will harm industry and threaten the benefits of this period of growth. But the Minister is one-eyed and sees the benefits as accruing only to large companies in the form of increased profits, a large percentage of which will go overseas. The Minister for Industrial Relations would like to see the worker back in Dickensian times, in the era of unlimited working hours and unlimited exploitation of workers. This Government appears to be obsessed with the alleged costs that the introduction of the 35-hour week will impose on industry and the economy. However, it has been seen time and again that the better conditions given to the workers, the higher productivity will be. It is not the other way around-that the longer hours people work, the better their productivity, as the Minister for Industrial Relations implied. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's reaction against the struggle of wage and salary earners in Australia for better living standards is predictable. Whenever a disputation occurs it comes down, invariably, on the side of the employers, on the side of its rich friends. Is this because they believe that the boss is always right and the worker is always wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> In the historical struggle for a shorter working week, the workers have been proved right time and again, yet honourable gentlemen opposite worry only about the profits of their rich friends, neglecting their duty to look after the wellbeing of the majority of the people. Whenever they talk about the worker, they always emphasise, as the Minister has done in his statement, that it is crucial that restraint be exercised or they argue along the lines of the well known cliche that workers are pricing themselves out of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> We have never heard them preaching restraint on the astronomic profits of transnational companies, of which an increasing share is taken out of the country. Only a week or so ago we heard the Prime Minister approving the concessional rates of electricity given to Alcoa of Australia Ltd by the Hamer Liberal Government. Yet when it comes to concessions to workers, salary earners and Australian families they object. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have another look at the arguments of honourable gentlemen opposite. They accuse the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) of quoting only from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission's decisions and not mentioning what is happening on the factory floor. I can tell honourable members opposite what is going on at the work place. I worked as a storeman, an ironworker and a railwayman for many years before I entered this House. I can tell honourable members opposite that, no matter how much they try to frighten the workers into submission, the workers will not be bluffed. They will stand up and fight for their just share of the cake. At the work place, it is well known that the Government is not sincere in calling for restraint, as that call is only ever directed at the workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations argues that increases in labour costs inevitably lead to price increases. But why has he never yet issued one call to his wealthy friends to reduce or restrain their prices? The large companies continue to make record profits each year and yet honourable gentlemen opposite claim that the workers are the ones who must exercise restraint. Well, for one, I am not ashamed to stand up for the ordinary wage and salary earners and their families in their fight for a better life. The Minister's statement claims that the 35-hour week will create unemployment by burdening his rich friends with higher labour costs. But he forgets that, unless the worker takes home a reasonable pay, he will not be able to spend and industry will not be able to sell its produce. </PARA>
<PARA> Well before the mention of the 35-hour week campaign, this Government had created half a million unemployed in this country. As well as that, it reduced the real income of the wage and salary earner through increasing taxation, through the exorbitant tax at the petrol pump and through increased interest rates. What can it show for its misguided action? The only result of the Liberal-National Country Party Government's policy of reducing real wages has been to boost the employers' profits without raising job numbers. While jobs have become more scarce, the employers have directed parts of their exorbitant profits into an orgy of takeovers and mergers. A sizable chunk of the profits is also used to keep the wealthy in outstanding luxury with Rolls Royces, overseas trips, yachts, private jets, mansions, children at the best private schools, et cetera. What is left is supposed to go into new investment. This new investment is supposed to create new jobs. But over the last few years employers have been buying labour replacing equipment, with the help of the Government's special investment tax allowance. To add insult to injury this taxation allowance to the bosses has been financed by heavier taxes on wage and salary earners, whose jobs have been placed in jeopardy as a result. In other words, the worker is being forced to pay for his own execution. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you can see it is not the 35-hour working week that is placing jobs in jeopardy, but the very policies of this Government. If this Government is worried about unemployment, it should show more concern at the abysmal situation that its economic policies have brought about. </PARA>
<PARA> For five years this Government has done nothing about our growing unemployment. The only thing it could recommend was to float the idea that young unemployed people should not get unemployment benefit. Whenever this Government finds itself in difficulties, it attempts to blame the worker, the wage earner, for its problems. The Minister for Industrial Relations in his statement said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that these labour cost pressures are in the system. </PARA>
<PARA>Is he concerned that the ordinary Australian family man will earn an extra quid or two a week or work shorter hours? He has never expressed his concern about the income and wealth of his opulent racehorse owner friends. The Minister did not even mention the tax free profits of $16.5m earned by the Bell group of companies overnight. But then why should he mention profits when he considers them sacred? He begrudges only the few dollars in the pay packet of the worker. </PARA>
<PARA> The pious pontification of the Minister and honourable members opposite in connection with the 35-hour week campaign is not surprising if one looks at what the Minister himself is advertising. In the centre page of the Australian Financial Review I recently found a supplement advertising Rydges magazine. This magazine is advertising its books entitled 'Tax Planning for Executives', 'How to Win from Real Estate' and other perks for the rich. Whose handsome face appeared on the back of the advertisement? It was none other than the smiling face of the Minister for Industrial Relations himself. He did not seem to be worried by the text of the advertisement. He was smiling. The pamphlet stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A small amount of money can be 'geared up.' It can return you both an income and tax-free capital gain. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Minister was advertising. The advertisement continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Whether you are interested in the purchase of a rural property, units at Surfers Paradise, a terrace house, a single unit or a shopping complex . . . this excellent book will show you how to obtain maximum returns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The different tactic employed by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) in the debate today compared with his tactics in the debate last week on basically the same subject-today we are having a cognate debate incorporating both matters-is very interesting. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) made the point very well that, when a debater has a factual case, the facts are presented as the basis of his argument. When there are no facts or when the alleged facts have been exposed, as were those of the honourable member for Wills in the debate last week, the usual response-I think this happens to all of us-is either attempted character assassination or horrified righteousness that anyone could challenge the validity of any decision-making tribunal or the basis of the debator's own opinion or argument. I believe that the speech today by the honourable member for Wills is a perfect example of the response in a debate of a person whose argument is blown. I am also interested in what actually is the Australian Labor Party's policy on the 35-hour week. I have before me an article from the Canberra Times of 9 May 1980 which quotes the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 'I have got to say frankly that as an economist, not only in terms of academic qualification but experience as an administrator-a Treasurer of this country-and recognising as a Government we have to administer the affairs of this country with economic sense, I would not support a 35-hour week at this point', Mr Hayden said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'In my view it would have damaging consequences on many industries which would be cost-disadvantaged-especially in the export market'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear and specific statement from the Leader of the Opposition, the leader of the Australian Labor Party, that he is opposed to a general 35-hour week. But the honourable member for Wills is obviously speaking for a different part of the Labor Party. Perhaps he is speaking for a section of the Labor Party that is challenging the leadership of Mr Hayden at the present time. I believe that before members of the Opposition say anything else they should at least tell us what is the policy of the Labor Party in reference to the 35-hour week, because somebody sitting on this side of the House who reads what Mr Hayden, the leader of the Labor Party, has to say--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the Leader of the Opposition has to say and what the honourable member for Wills has to say are completely different. Perhaps the next speaker from the Opposition can enlighten us on what actually is the view of the Labor Party on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point has been made by several Labor apologists that the granting of a 35-hour week in a specific industry would not flow on to the general work force. I shall make two points to dispose of this argument. The first is that one of the major points made by Opposition speakers in favour of the granting of a 35-hour week is that 40 per cent of the workers of this country already have it, and that, by itself, is a major reason why the granting of a 35-hour week should flow on. That is completely contrary to one of the major points that some Labor spokesmen have put, including the honourable member for Wills. They said that it would not flow on. The Legislative Research Service of the Department of the Parliamentary Library, in its paper on the 35-hour week, confirmed the point that it would flow on. As final proof that the Labor Party, contrary to what its members are saying here and to what they said last week, believes the 35-hour week would flow on, I shall quote from a Nationwide interview of 26 March 1981. The transcript of that program reads:</PARA>
<PARA>CARLTON</PARA>
<PARA> I think the argument, Mr Hawke, is that using Mr Peacock's figures that, whilst 36 per cent of the community are working less than 40 hours a week there is strong support in other parts of the community for those who are working 40 to reduce their hours. Now if we get 50 per cent working less than 40 hours a week there will be even stronger support to reduce everyone's hours . . . </PARA>
<PARA>HAWKE</PARA>
<PARA> Of course there will. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for the argument that what has happened and has been raised by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) today will be an isolated case and will not be the vanguard of a general push for a shorter working week. Members of the Labor Party, by their arguments, have exposed the falsity of that argument. Because of those differences, one could raise again the issue of who speaks for the Labor Party on this issue and what is its actual policy on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Several other contradictory statements were made by Labor Party members in this debate. They said that if we have a 35-hour week it will bring increased productivity, and with that we will have more, including more employment. Members of the Labor Party cannot have it both ways because that is a contradictory series of arguments. If there is increased productivity, obviously there will not be more employment. It has to be one way or the other. The fact is that by agreeing to the general introduction of a 35-hour week this country would be getting the worst of both worlds. It would be not be getting increased productivity. The falsity of the claims about productivity bargaining and productivity arrangements has already been exposed. To say that workers, by agreeing to work as they should have been working in the first place-by clocking in on time and sticking to the standard time off for tea breaks-and by coming back to the correct working procedures means productivity is absolute rot. This should be exposed to everybody in this country as that. </PARA>

We hear it said by the Labor Party day after day in Parliament House that the economy is not improving, that it is in terrible shape, that unemployment is increasing, that we are going from bad to worse. The honourable member for McMillan is trying to interject. If he believes that the economy is not improving, that is fine. Yet one of the major reasons why the Opposition is saying that the country can afford a 35-hour week is that the economy is improving. Once again, the Labor Party cannot have it both ways. Its members should make up their minds as to what position they want to take and adhere to it. It should stop trying to ride two horses which are going in different directions at the same time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a cognate debate. I want to refer to the major points made for the Government by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peacock), in his statement to Parliament last week, against the general introduction of a 35-hour week and against the way in which the unions are endeavouring to obtain at this time a 35-hour week. First of all, the campaign threatens the economic recovery of this country. This is now apparent to all, even the honourable member for Wills, who, on 26 March in the PM program, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The second point in regard to the factual economic situation is that while these things have been going on, Australia's competitive position has in fact been improving as evidenced by our growth in export manufactured goods. </PARA>
<PARA>Everybody agrees that the economy is improving. But surely that improvement is gravely threatened by the campaign that is under way at present. The campaign itself is threatening the improvement of the situation. If it actually came about, one could only believe that the worst would happen, that not only would there be no improvement but also there would be a regression into a worse economic situation. We will lose international competitiveness, which is an important matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that this campaign comes on top of a dangerous wages drift-a 15.2 per cent increase last year-which is already threatening the hard fought recovery that has come about under this Government. The third point is that increased costs would inevitably flow on. This has been documented time and again. Depending on whom one wants to listen to, the increase is somewhere between 14 per cent and 21 per cent. If these costs can be recovered in the economy that means one thing-inflation-because employers will pass on the increased costs to other people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen to the poor pensioners whom everybody on the other side thinks they are the champions of? What will happen to the people on fixed incomes who cannot get their share of this 14 per cent to 21 per cent increased return? If those costs cannot be recovered, that must mean reduced employment opportunities in this country because of the reduced competitiveness of this country in the world. The Legislative Research Service's paper on the 35-hour week confirms this when it quotes Mr A. Powell's article entitled 'Hours of Work' in the Australian Bulletin of Labor, March 1980 and then makes a commentary on that article. The point is that employment opportunities will be reduced, not increased, if the 35-hour week comes in. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1980s Australia will be facing a most competitive international situation, particularly for traditional manufacturing goods. It will be a fight for survival for many of our manufacturing industries and employment therein in this country. The honourable member for Wills implied that Australia was just following the industrialised world in providing shorter working hours; that therefore there was nothing to worry about as we were all on the same path. The honourable member neglected two points. He did not mention the reduction in total working hours in Australia, the longer annual holidays, the long service leave and so on which already make Australia a lower total working-hour country than most, if not all, other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The second and more important point is the fact that competition for jobs in secondary industry in the 1980s, particularly in the traditional sector as distinct from infrastructure manufacturing as the result of the resources boom-if Labor lets it boom-will not come from Western Europe and North America, in respect of which some of these figures are quoted. With the exception of the fields of aerospace and computers Japan and South-East Asia generally are now more efficient than is any part of Western Europe or North America. When one reads of Western German television teams and others going to Japan to see how the Japanese can do it one is given an indication of where the real thrust of competition will come from in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the working hours of those countries? They are not about to go to a 35-hour week. Some of them will be lucky to get a 44-hour week. Japan works longer and harder. It is not likely to go to a 35-hour week. What is also of interest is that Japan accepts technology probably more quickly and completely than does any other industrialised country. With its combination of real work and technology it has an unemployment rate of two per cent. How about that as knocking out all of the Opposition's arguments on the level of unemployment, technology and working hours. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, one can say that the points that Labor has put on the matter of the 35-hour week have been, firstly, contradictory. I refer to the statement on the subject by the Leader of the Opposition, which was in contrast to the statements of Labor speakers during this debate. Secondly, we have the internally contradictory arguments put by the Opposition on the question of productivity, employment, wages costs and so forth. Finally, the point made by the honourable member for Barker was that there was a correct way to proceed if this matter was to be debated, argued or resolved in this country. As is usually the case the Labor Party is not supporting the correct procedure in this instance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate by referring to the very last premise of the argument of the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). He refers to the procedures that we should be supporting. Labor is supporting the procedure of conciliation and arbitration. As the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) has said, the honourable member and other speakers for the Government, have done nothing but berate the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission because it made a certain decision in accordance with evidence submitted. Whilst we cannot take much notice of what the honourable member for Murray may have said, he had better face the fact that he represents one segment of the Government with a policy on taxation that is completely different from that of the Government itself. It is about time that the National Country Party contested enough seats in Australia to try to be a government and not merely come in and make suggestions as to what is wrong with the Opposition policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us consider the matter from the point of view of defending the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. What facts and evidence were submitted? Why do not the good lawyers from the Government side who have spoken address their minds to the decision made pursuant to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. One sees there the statement which has caused so much concern that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peacock) had to rush in and make a ridiculous statement to the House. Then we had today this motion which expresses concern and requests intervention. The latter is unnecessary because intervention has already occurred. The motion then reminds the Commission of what it should do, as if that alone were not an indictment of it. What right has a back bencher of the Government to suggest that the Commission ought to be reminded of its duty? I suggest that this back bencher is merely espousing the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and those of the Minister for Industrial Relations. We have on record the fact that for some years now the Government has done nothing but make addresses to the nation concerning what is wrong with the trade union movement, which it berates all the time. Trade unionists happen to be people who work hard for long hours to produce the wealth which Government supporters enjoy by way of dividends. </PARA>
<PARA> From the statement of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission one notes that working parties were set up. Some 45 meetings of the sub-committees took place, so evidence was given. What was that evidence? At the hearing, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and each of the unions concerned were represented. They explained the developments. The request was supported by Mr Douglas, Q.C., who appeared for the companies. Do honourable members suggest that Mr Douglas just lay down because he was afraid of what was going to happen? Again, witnesses were available for cross-examination. Why was that not taken advantage of? The Commonwealth appeared, as did the National Employers Industrial Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost in the Altona case was a mere $34,000 or 0.18 per cent of total wages of current award employees, after offsetting the gains made. What does the Commission say it was doing? It was applying the principles of true productivity bargaining, as they have been applied since 1978 under what have been known as the wage fixing principles. These are the facts. Has anyone on the Government side addressed his mind to that? Again, the results were not contrived arrangements but will in fact lead to cost savings which, the statement says, would not otherwise have been achieved. Finally, there is to be monitoring of the implementation of the arrangement, under the chairmanship of Commissioner Brown, who will report in September or December. If the cost saving factors are not being applied, the agreements will have to be re-examined. Where has there been any injustice? Why is it that workers in this area of activity are so berated? Why cannot honourable members following the lead given in the evidence say: 'Let us look at the number of people who work under awards, both Commonwealth and State, less than 40 hours a week'? This information is set out in detail today in the Sydney Morning Herald. The details occupy two full columns. The employees of Government supporters themselves work 36 3/4 hours and receive overtime if they exceed that number. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would imagine that if they worked for the honourable member he would want them to work 80 hours; that is understandable. In regard to working arrangements, this morning I asked the Minister for the details of the savings. All he could talk about was that a few lazy workers were likely to get a shorter tea break. That was a slander on the workers and on the companies that employ them. I do not believe that the Minister has ever been in a factory except perhaps as a manager receiving dividends. He has never been down on the shop floor.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I am happy to stay out of it. The honourable member would not want to get into it either because he knows that his life would be shortened if he did. Let us consider the matter from the point of view of savings. In that regard I will refer to only one company, B. F. Goodrich. The Minister would have known of these details. Because of changes in work practices-more efficient and flexible shift rosters and so on-the savings to the company amount to a total of $240,000 a year. From changes in manning practices-being able more flexibly to move workers from one part of production to another-the savings to the company amount to $370,000 a year. Therefore that company alone would surely not be so unwise and incompetent as to fail to realise that it could effect savings. For that company alone savings of $694,000 have resulted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it not clear that when we are talking about private enterprise and the ability to negotiate, since section 28 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides for these matters to be considered, and evidence is given as to savings, such matters ought to be recognised and admitted. What evidence was given by the Minister or by anybody else in the debate today to suggest that the Commission's decision was incorrect or contrived? It was nothing of the sort. Benefits obviously can flow on, when one sees productivity and profits increasing. For example, it can be shown that the reported pre-tax profits of the companies under study last year amounted to 33 per cent. That leaves a bit of room to give some benefit to the employees. Also, I am reminded that the Altona agreement will lead to the employment of 160 additional people. This is worth while and tangible and ought to be placed on record. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is a question of the ability to pay, I read into the record evidence relating to profitability right across the board. A Reserve Bank survey of 235 companies released in February 1980 showed an average profit rise of 36.2 per cent over the previous year. There was mention of the oil companies and the fact that there had not been much industrial peace. In the oil industry, for example, the Shell, Caltex, BP and Amoco companies all doubled their profits between 1978 and 1979. Mobil, Total and Ampol all tripled their profits in the same period. A PA Consulting Services survey shows that in 1969-70 companies paid 37 per cent of their gross profits in tax but now they pay only 30 per cent in tax. That all relates to the benefits accruing to those companies. Does anyone think those profits go to Australians? Not at all. It should be noted that, according to income distribution statistics, 92 per cent of dividend income from profits goes to only 10 per cent of Australians. Why is this? It is because we are foreign owned and controlled. Let me provide honourable members with the evidence for that statement. The petroleum refining industry and cosmetic industries are 91 per cent foreign owned, the non-ferrous metals industry is 79 per cent foreign owned, the pharmaceutical industry is 78 per cent foreign owned and the chemical industry is 66 per cent foreign owned. The Government is talking about an inability to meet the demands of its own workers. It should look at the profits, as a percentage of total company income after tax, remitted overseas. In 1974-75 the figure was 25.8 per cent. In 1977-78, it had risen to 35.6 per cent. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) is on record as saying that the percentage appears to have been rising. That level of profits remitted overseas must go in the Guinness Book of Records. </PARA>
<PARA> How do the companies stand from the point of view of foreign investment and ownership? It is very difficult to find any major company in this nation with a majority Australian equity. Most of them are 100 per cent overseas owned. For example, Australian Oil Refining Pty Ltd and Caltex Oil (Aust.) Pty Ltd are 100 per cent United States owned, Cadbury Schweppes Australia Pty Ltd is 61 per cent United Kingdom owned and ICI Australia Ltd is 62 per cent United Kingdom owned. Mobil Oil Australia Ltd, General Motors-Holden's Ltd and Standard Telephones and Cables Pty Ltd are all 100 per cent United States owned. The Government says it is worried about Australia. It is about time we bought it back. That is the important part. What is the Government doing about foreign investment and control? The price of investment in our companies and in our nation is costing us $2 billion a year to service. We now have the silly situation that every man, woman and child in Australia remits overseas by way of interest $130. Why cannot we afford to keep some of that fat? This is the point the Opposition wants to make when we discuss these matters from the point of view of arbitration. It is important that workers, if they can make gains in productivity, should get the benefit of shorter hours. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the statement of the Minister for Industrial Relations and what he referred to as the cost factor of introducing a 35-hour working week. He used three figures, in a three-way proposition-12 1/2 per cent, 14 per cent and 21 per cent. We can take our pick. Firstly, the figure of 21 per cent assumes that all reductions in working hours will be translated into overtime. That is nonsense. Only one-third of workers in the manufacturing industry work an average of eight hours overtime a week. If the figure of 21 per cent is correct, these people would have to work 23 hours of overtime every week. Nobody in his right mind suggests that that will be the situation. Secondly, the figure of 12 1/2 per cent cannot be correct because it assumes employers will cut production commensurate with reduced working hours. Of course, no employer has ever taken a reduction on that basis. Thirdly, if the Minister chooses 14 per cent, the assumption is that employers have to employ more people. That figure could not possibly be an actual reflection of costs because it ignores the fact that if all employers put on more workers, consumption would increase overall demand and therefore profits. The Minister has presented to this House a fantasy world of what the costs will be. </PARA>
<PARA> This year some efforts were made by employers to try to bring in longer working hours. They tried to suggest that there would have to be an 80-hour fortnight. There was a suggestion made by the unions that we could have working parties look into the matter. Those working parties got under way and their discussions would have been of substantial benefit. The working parties were to conduct a three-month investigation during which time all industrial action would be halted. Obviously there could then have been some discussion. As soon as that was likely to come to fruition, against the claim that there had to be an 80-hour fortnight, and it appeared that the talks were likely to lead to a reduction in working hours, what happened? The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Industrial Relations stood over the companies, suggesting that they ought to be taken to the Prices Justification Tribunal. That immediately prevented the employers from continuing the negotiations. Surely any sane person would regard it as important from the point of view of industrial relations that parties be able to get together. Once they started to do that, and particularly when in the metal industry employers were prepared to discuss the matter on the basis of productivity bargaining, they were stood over again by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations. Yesterday we saw the debacle involving the ICI company. The general manager pleaded with the Premier of New South Wales, saying he was being threatened and that he would stop $900m worth of capital works-$400m of which was to be spent in my electorate. Understandably, that development is causing some concern because of pollution and other matters but, after every advantage has been given to that company, again there is the threat that if it dares reduce the hours, the Government will not be able to give it tariff protection. By the way, that company was able to make substantial profits and has experienced a 40 per cent increase in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the matters that the Opposition wants to put before the Parliament. This Government hates the trade union movement and the workers, and does not want to give them any benefit at all in regard to productivity. There was never any substance in the Minister's statement and their is no substance in the motion that has been moved today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I discuss the 35-hour working week, I wish to state that it seems to me that the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) has been very keen to question the right of members of this Parliament to question a determination of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which affects this nation. I ask: What right has the secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to walk out of a Metal Trades Industry Association hearing and what right do workers have to stay away from work one day a fortnight while that case is in progress?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I commend the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peacock) for bringing this important matter of the 35-hour working week before the House. On a previous day the honourable member for Wills, in opening the case for the Australian Council of Trade Unions, quoted from the 1947 40-hour working week judgment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The 40-hour week was to the average worker in Australia much more a matter of a five-day week than an eight-hour day. It removed the need to get up early on Saturdays. It could be argued that we are now talking about a nine-day fortnight, but this is not the case to most of the 36 per cent of the work force who already enjoy working less than 40 hours a week. It has been said that the employment climate was good in 1947 and that prosperity abounded. In terms of trade, Australia stood almost totally unscathed in a world recently ravaged by a world war. Asia was in the throes of departing colonialism and our only substantial imports were refugees. The global economy, as we recognise it today, did not exist. The principal Australian history book we read in school included a drawing of Australia riding on the sheep's back. At that time Australia had no fears of world competition and no obligation to balance trade with its neighbours. Most were desperate for our production. Opposition members constantly tell us that we must not accept the industrial standard of a by-gone era but they conveniently return to it when it suits them. </PARA>
<PARA> The circumstances of urbanisation and industrialisation that exist in Australia today bear no comparison with 1947 and the honourable member for Wills should accept that as an economic fact. Australia cannot continue to rape its natural and farm resources to finance its leisure spree. The future of our children will rely on this generation's ability to industrialise and to export. I mention exports because, even within the next half century, Australia will not have the home consumption market necessary to supply that other great influence on cost, economy of scale. Economy of scale will only be achieved for Australia by substantial export of manufactured goods. Our primary producers have managed to demonstrate and achieve economy of scale and stand as our present salvation. Their efforts to achieve economy of scale, considering the finite availability of our arable land resource, have resulted in a population shift to the cities and to the seeking of employment in manufacturing industries. Australia must therefore become a competitive exporter of manufactured goods to create that employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The importers of this world, unlike many union members, are susceptible neither to the silver tongue and histrionics of the honourable member for Wills nor to the heavy hand of Norm Gallagher. They have some simple questions to ask, like: How good, how soon, and how much? They are not interested in shoddy workmanship which is the result of labour cost-induced understaffing of a production line. They are not interested in delays caused by industrial disruption associated with the 35-hour week campaign; and, above all, they are not interested if they can purchase the same product elsewhere for less. Might I add, our inflated costs do not stop on the production line. </PARA>
<PARA> I spoke with an Australian manufacturer the other day whose company also owns Asian subsidiaries producing the same product. He told me that, due to technology, his works has the lowest cost of production of any of its factories. His product is, however, not competitive in the booming Asian market due to wharfage and the freight premium that shipping companies place on operating into Australia-a premium placed to cover industrial stoppages and the industrial and bureaucratic interference they experience in Australian ports. His factory currently operates three days a week. Now it may or may not be significant in that case that a previous speaker has boasted that the wharf workers already have a 35-hour week. That speaker did not tell us, as I just have, of the price in jobs that that 35-hour week decision has already cost less fortunate Australians. There is nothing wrong with a 35-hour week if one is involved in a completely closed economy and is prepared to accept less goods or a reduced standard of service for one's plastic dollar. The value of that service may be best measured by the house-wife of today as she humps her groceries from the supermarket and compares herself to the poor unfortunate housewife of a 44-hour week worker who sent one of the kids round to the corner store with the shopping order on Friday and got it delivered-a shopping order, by the way, which adequately met the needs of her family. As the son of a motor mechanic in that era, I well remember what #5 a week would purchase. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a suggestion and a quoting of Australian Conciliation and Arbitration court judges to prove that jobs are not lost by wage pushes or leisure related unit wage increases. Only an arbitration court judge, or someone with the security of a senior union position, could make such a statement. A job is a job. When it disappears it disappears for good. The person who lost that job may find other employment. The job which someone else could fill is gone. If one wishes to measure the jobs lost due to the increased cost of labour in recent years, look at the transition from corner grocer to supermarket, from local owner service station to self-serve, from typing pool to word processor. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get away from the closed economy and back into the reality of today's global economy. The global economy requires us to be competitive in a global sense. However, in the case of the Altona Complex, we would not even be competitive if a 50-hour week were worked. The products that that complex produces are based on a petroleum feedstock manufactured from a relatively cheap crude. Yet we find that the scale of tariff duty afforded to their products is as follows: Manufacturer No. 1, Australian Synthetic Rubber Co. Ltd produces polybutadiene and styrenebutadiene which are both covered and protected by a 30 per cent rate of duty. Manufacturer No. 2, Hoechst Australia Ltd produces high density polyethelene that is only protected at 45 per cent, and polypropylene at 22.5 per cent. Manufacturer 3, B. F. Goodrich Australia Ltd, produces polyvinylchloride, or PVC, protected at 30 per cent. Manufacturer 4, Union Carbide Australia Ltd, produces low and high density polyethelene at a protection rate of 45 per cent. Manufacturer No. 5, Dow Chemical (Aust) Ltd, produces styrene, which is protected to 30 per cent and then it sells it to manufacturer No. 6, which is BASF Australia Ltd which gets a further 30 per cent when it turns it into polystyrene. These figures can prove only one thing: That is that by global standards, these industries-set upon by the ACTU and speakers from the other side of the house-and classified by them as wealthy and able to afford a 35-hour week, have a degee of competitive productivity equal only to that of a seagull. If these industries were wealthy, they were wealthy because of the generosity of the Australian consumer, the largest proportion of whom are the workers, and this protectionist Government. The members of the Opposition who support this agreement have demonstrated to me that they suffer from the present decline in numeracy. They think that two plus two equals fine. </PARA>
<PARA> The Altona case was not about productivity; it was about featherbedding-$3.8m worth of featherbedding which the ACTU had the nerve to trade off for a 35-hour week. Had the arbitration court been interested in anything but artificial industrial action, it might have inquired about the effect on the end consumers of the products at Altona, that is, the balance of the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The plastic industry's own magazine Plastic Digest, Volume 4, No. 1 has this to say about consumption by market of its members' products: It indicates that of a total consumption of 699.3 thousand tonnes, agriculture consumes 23.9 thousand tonnes; appliances, 22.4 thousand tonnes; building and construction 90.5 thousand tonnes; electrical and electronic, 47.9 thousand tonnes; footwear and clothing, 9.2 thousand tonnes; furniture and bedding, 55.9 thousand tonnes; housewares, 41.2 thousand tonnes; marine, 11.6 thousand tonnes; materials handling, 50.3 thousand tonnes; packaging-that is only the stuff honourable members find in the supermarket-124.9 thousand tonnes; plumbing and other household, 69.9 thousand tonnes; toys and sporting goods-that is what is needed for that wonderful period of recreation we are going to get for everybody-8.1 thousand tonnes; transportation-the thing that really controls Australia-33.8 thousand tonnes; and other-which honourable members can bet are all consumer products-109.7 thousand tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear to see that there are very few areas of expenditure by Australian consumers that can avoid the pressure of costs on the plastic industry. Even that leisure essential, the 'Esky', is affected. Altona did not need an arbitration court hearing. It needed an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> What a sham were the statements of ICI Australia Ltd that it would curtail its capital expansion program as it was threatened with an IAC inquiry. This is a company that offered no help to its competitor, B.F. Goodrich, when Goodrich suffered a 16-week strike. It gleefully serviced Goodrich clients and, to guarantee continued supply, commenced secret sweetheart negotiations for a shorter working week. It did all this because it believed that it had the umbrella of massive tariff protection. Why now is ICI so frightened of an IAC inquiry? If the tariff protection is necessary, surely IAC will recommend its continuation. Or does ICI know that the inquiry will unearth another flock of featherbedding, inefficiencies and gross profit abuse? If that is ICI's fear, I say we can do without its $900m investment. It will not take very long for the Australian public to recoup that money in cost savings and spend it elsewhere with efficient Australian industry and workers prepared to do a day's work for a day's pay. The present proposal really requires Australians to make a free gift of these proposed extensions to ICI. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at another objection to the 35-hour working week. The Opposition complains of tax evasion. It might be interested in the comments of Dr Chris Trengrove, a research fellow at the Monash Centre of Policy Studies, quoted in the 1 April issue of the Australian. When he spoke of the 'black economy' he included in his possible causes 'increased leisure time to engage in the black economy'. Most of us know of workers who enjoy the benefit of a shorter working week and who use their leisure time to steal jobs from the less fortunate and gain tax free cash. The reasons given for a 35-hour working week are equally convincing for a 30-hour working week or a 10-hour working week. My concern is that, having run out of other reasons for industrial disruption and executive aggrandisement, the union movement might just follow that policy. The only solution is to ask Australian labour first to meet its obligations in the area of global competition. It is further necessary for unionists to recognise that the strike weapon is a sword with no handle and the wielder must get hurt. </PARA>

But we are entitled to expect a better performance from the honourable member for North Sydney. After all, he is not merely a member of the legal profession; he is the son of a distinguished judge. He assures us that he would not be party to attacking the courts. I say to the honourable gentleman that I do not believe, if one endeavours to reconcile his statements to this Parliament with the decisions that were made by the court, that he has read the decision of the court. Let me quote this distinguished member of the Sydney bar. He suggested to the House that the employers produced false evidence to the court; that the employers, under duress from the trade union movement, produced a set of figures to the court and that was the basis upon which the court made its findings. I fail to see how the honourable gentleman can reach that conclusion. </PARA>

The trade union witness and the employers' representative gave evidence. The Commonwealth's counsel was present. Representatives of the National Employers Industrial Council were present and were able to cross-examine, but a conspiracy was not discovered by the advocate of the Commonwealth or the advocate of the national employers. It certainly was not discovered by the Commission, and that is why the honourable gentleman thinks the court is in error. The only person who discovered the conspiracy is the honourable member for North Sydney, aided by his able junior, the honourable member for O'Connor.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What more can this Parliament do in terms of industrial relations? In the House yesterday the Minister for Industrial Relations said that the unions must go to arbitration. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), when it suits him, says that the unions must go to arbitration. When we look at the findings of the court, we need to ask: Could any group of men, on the basis of material that they had before them, on the basis of the evidence that was given to them-evidence which was the subject of cross-examination-find in any other way? Let me read it again:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are also satisfied, having regard to the history of the matter, the examinations by the working party including the various sub-committees and the terms of the agreements themselves, that the results are not contrived arrangements but will, in fact, lead to cost savings which would not otherwise have been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>They then do what is normal for any judicial tribunal operating in this situation. They say: 'We will publish full reasons for our decision at a later date'. I find it an extraordinary and contemptible exercise for any practising member of the legal profession, who understands the way in which our system works, to walk into this Parliament and urge members of this Parliament to support a motion in these terms which condemns judges honestly endeavouring to reach a conclusion on the evidence before them, and in so doing deliberately misconstrue the evidence which was put to the Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have said, point two of the motion clearly requires from this Parliament a resolution that the Government should intervene, because this matter has not been taken into account in the statement of the court. I was not in the court every day to know what was being raised by the Commonwealth when it intervened in these proceedings, or to know what matters were raised by the other interveners who were involved. But it is clear from the published statement of reasons, although not the full reasons admittedly at this time, that the court did not direct itself to those matters. Further we request that the Government in its submissions remind the Commission-I do not think it ought to be reminded, but it appears that if it has not directed its mind to these matters then it needs to be reminded-that section 39 (2) of the Act requires the Commission to take into account the likely effects of its decisions on the economy, with special reference to the effects of its decisions on the levels of employment and of inflation. I do not believe there is anything unreasonable about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Every day in our court system actions are brought which are called appeals. They are brought because in a particular case a judge has failed to give full attention to all the matters that might have been relevant for him to consider to reach a correct decision. There are procedures for these matters to be looked at because courts make mistakes, judges make mistakes and, on occasions, some matters are not always taken into account. This can happen for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it can be because of a misconstruction or a number of other reasons. In the case before us, we have a statement which does not direct itself in any way whatsoever to the wider public interest. It is a simple enough matter, without all these histrionics we have heard today, to draw those matters to the attention of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. We are seeking to draw those matters to the attention of the Commision. </PARA>
<PARA> It is implied by honourable members opposite -some of them have had a very active practice in this jurisdiction-that they have come into this place with clean hands. I must admit that I did not have time today to extract all of the criticisms that have been made from time to time by those honourable members of Parliament opposite or by spokesmen for the Australian Council of Trade Unions in relation to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I am sure that it would not be done in the same polite terms in which it has been done in this case, when it has occurred. As an opposition member is to follow me in this debate, I ask honourable members opposite: What will be their attitude if the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission upholds the case of the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia to establish for three years a 40-hour working week and makes such an award? Having regard to what honourable members opposite have said to date, would that decision be free from comment? If the Commission in its wisdom supported the views of the MTIA, would honourable members opposite fail to make some remarks in this regard in this House? Or do they support the coercion of the ACTU when its principal spokesman walked out of the hearing and left the Commission without putting forward the views of the ACTU? As part of its technique, it wants to be able to say: 'We really did not have an opportunity to put arguments before the Commission', presumably because the arguments of the MTIA are so persuasive. One would think if the ACTU had the answers it would be quite prepared to remain in court and to see it out. The fact of the matter is that it is not. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate we are directing our attention also to the wider issues affecting the Australian community and the ultimate cost to Australia-the wider economic consequences to all Australians. This is an important matter of which the courts and all Australians should be aware. This was the reason for the statement by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peacock). The fact of the matter is-I think it is irrefutable no matter what is said by honourable members opposite-that if people work for fewer hours and expect to receive the same amount of money for the fewer hours worked, the cost to industry and to employers will rise. We cannot get the same sort of productivity out of fewer hours worked simply by decreasing the number of hours worked if people are doing a fair day's work for their pay now. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, what is expected by the unions that are bringing this case is that somehow there will not be any additional cost, that somehow out of some profits that have been hidden away or out of some productivity gains there might be a capacity to pay for these additional costs. Nobody really knows what productivity gains are. If they are like those in the Altona case, it might well be that productivity gains are arrived at because the unions will forgo striking to the extent that they have struck before. It seems to me that may be the type of productivity gain referred to when they speak about levels of industrial disputation. In my view those additional costs to industry will be passed on in additional charges by the companies concerned, if they are to stay in business. </PARA>
<PARA> The Confederation of Industry and the MTIA have said that costs will be in the order of an additional 21 per cent and, because of inflation, those costs will continue to increase. Inflation has an effect not only upon the worker but also upon many people in the Australian community who are not able to protect themselves from its ravages. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) mentioned these and I would like to reiterate them. When we have these additional costs, who will explain to the pensioners why they are not able to make ends meet? Who will explain to those people on superannuation whose incomes are provided from their own savings-the result of their personal exertions of the past-that their savings will be frittered away as a result of inflation and that they will not be able to make ends meet? More importantly, I would like to ask: Who will explain it to the workers who will be without jobs?</PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to recount discussions, particularly where there is a likelihood of coercion. I had a significant employer approach me in the last few weeks. He said that people in his industry were being subjected to a 35-hour week campaign with all of the tactics which we know are associated with it. This employer said: 'We are appreciative of your arguments. We would have to save significantly in terms of costs because there is no way that we will be able to pass them on. It will mean that some people in our industry will have to lose their jobs. We will have to put on more equipment and more machinery and become more efficient in producing our products'. The union officials involved said: 'So what?' They were concerned-in the context of the 35-hour week discussion-only with those people who would remain in jobs, those people who would be participating in decisions in relation to that union and with those people who would be able to continue to re-elect them. </PARA>

The point I wish to make in this debate-a point which is well made and has been well made over a long period-is that unions are not concerned about the consequences facing those people who lose their jobs. They are concerned only about those who continue to remain in employment who are members of those unions. I would like to suggest-the bona fides of this suggestion would be taken up if the honourable member for Wills would join me in advocating this course of action-that all unions be required to keep all their former members who have lost their jobs as members without the payment of additional cost or fees, so that they can continue to play a role in making decisions in those unions. I challenge the honourable member for Wills to join me in approaching all unions to ensure that their rules are amended to provide that when a man loses his job he can remain a member of that union and not be required to pay any fees while he is out of work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was not so long ago-only in 1979-that a member of the Builders Labourers Federation who had been unemployed for two years was told that before he could accept a job in Canberra he would have to pay two years' union membership fees to be allowed back on a building site for a three week job. Where is the compassion of honourable members opposite for the plight of those people who are unemployed and those people who will become unemployed as a result of this campaign? I ask that because I am concerned for those people. They will be looking to government to make it up to them, without recognising that the real culprits are those who advocate shorter working hours and less productivity, those who are acting callously against the national interest and also against the interest of those who support them and maintain them in a job. That is the reality. I would hope that those opposite and those outside of this place who want to sabotage the national interest will think again and rethink their imposition on this important matter. </PARA>

The time for change is now. Only yesterday when one read the newspapers, one found it hard to believe that this is happening. I refer to the heading published in the Australian of 1 April which stated: 'Second big union setback in fight for 35-hour week'. The article sought to stir the pot by indicating that the unions were looking for industrial trouble. In the Sydney Morning Herald of yesterday's date an article appeared under the heading 'ICI meets Fraser head on'. Again a deal was made with the Government. At this stage ICI Australia Ltd is frightened. An article under the heading 'Metal-industry strikes threat' appeared in yesterday's Canberra Times. In that article, the Press stated that up to 600,000 metal workers are threatening to hold national strikes. Is that action trying to get the country alive on this issue? Is it intended to make people fight with each other? This is the tactic of Government and the Prime Minister is involved. I refer to an article which was published in the Australian Financial Review under the heading 'ACTU walkout leaves MTIA in the box seat'. Who is causing all this trouble? It is the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The National Country Party, from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) down to all its Ministers, over the past two or three weeks has stirred up the trade union movement. It has tried to get union members to take direct action. The way things are going they will take direct action. Whose fault will that be? The trade union movement is only trying to achieve wage justice and lower hours. I refer again to the Canberra Times of 1 April in which a headline states: 'ICI suspends its Botany project'. The working class, the employers and the average chap on the job, are confused about this matter. The public relations effort of this Government has not achieved what the Government seeks. Speaking as an ex-trade union official, I must say that I do not think any honourable member opposite has been employed on a job where there are 200 or 300 or 2,000 or 3,000 people involved and has had to explain what that type of employment is all about. If they did, they would be different types of persons. They would not have a clue about the feelings of a person who, as a result of direct action, had been on strike for two or three weeks because of some anomaly in their job or conditions. Such a person may be on the breadline and then someone says: 'That is not what you should be doing. You have to go back to work'. If the employers went out and spoke to their employees, they would understand the situation. They have not done this when they should. We are talking about industrial peace and conciliation. The 35-hour working week will come in gradually. I have alluded already to the policy of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make the point about the hypocritical way in which honourable members opposite talk about the pensioners and the needy. The standard of living of every member of the Australian community depends, for example, on housing. The Government has an extraordinarily bad record in relation to housing, which is now developing as a crisis situation in Australia. The standard of living of the Australian community is dependent upon the disposable income available to families. Let me just say very briefly on that score that the average Australian family is statistically and undoubtedly in fact worse off as a result of this Government's policies than it was previously. It is at least $16 to $18 a week worse off-paying more in real terms in taxation. For those on incomes over $700 a week, income tax has fallen; but, for all those below that income, taxation has risen. The burden on pay-as-you-earn taxpayers has increased under the present Government. The Government has failed to index the family allowance, which has resulted again in an erosion of family disposable incomes by $3.70 a week. The introduction of family allowance was a great achievement-the only one that comes to mind-of the Fraser Government. But in terms of living standards five years later, it has become something of a meaningless initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the average family now has to pay $7 a week more in health insurance payments than in 1975 to get some level of cover again represents a substantial erosion of the standard of living of every Australian. Nearly every member on the Government side who participated in this debate talked about the pensioners and the needy and whether the Opposition was worried about them. Certainly we are worried about them. I agree with the 35-hour week concept. It will bring employment. What chance do we have of achieving extra employment with the introduction of a 35-hour week when, as I have said, approximately 40 per cent of the work force is working less than a 40-hour week? What chance have we got if the Government will not come to the party and become involved in negotiations with the trade union movement? What chance have we got if the employers say: 'We will not talk to you' because the Government has told them not to do so. We will lose the case before we start. The Government is looking for direct action. It is doing everything it can to cause anarchy in Australia. I put the blame on the Government for the trouble that will occur in 1981. I repeat that the implementation of the 35-hour week will take more than 12 months. A head-on collision will occur because of the attitude of the front bench members of the Government taking on the trade union movement. How can we then increase productivity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unreasonable. Government members have attacked the unions today, as they did last week during the debate on the 35-hour week. Why will the Government not negotiate with the trade union movement? Why has the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) intervened and caused such trouble? I would like the next Government speaker to explain to me why many people have been told that the amount of overtime worked will drop? Not only will overtime drop but also people's living standards will drop. That is what we have to discuss. I asked the Prime Minister about two years ago whether under the arbitration system the employers, the unions and the Government could work as a team, on a non-political basis, to determine ways and means of getting the country going. Do honourable members opposite think that the Australian people do not know that there is trouble ahead? Do honourable members opposite think that they do not know that their jobs are in jeopardy? Do honourable members opposite think that they do not understand technology changes? This Government is looking for a fight. It will not leave politics out of it and work down the line to save the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are approximately four million people in the work force. About $10 billion is being paid in social security benefits for the needy in this country. If we do not get together and work out a plan we all know where we will end up-right down in the gutter. I hope there will be some liaison between the trade union movement and the Government. I was pleased to see that some compromise was reached last night with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I think that a little latitude should be given in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say from the outset that I am sure in my own mind that the effect of a 35-hour week upon the Australian economy would be to reduce production. It would affect every other field in this country. My remarks this afternoon will be based entirely upon that belief. In answer to the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Les McMahon), for whom I have the greatest respect, I say that undoubtedly the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) approached ICI Australia Ltd because he believed he had a very great responsibility to Australia to talk to that company as well as other major industries in this country concerning the problems that would follow the introduction of a 35-hour week. Undoubtedly, he placed his opinion before ICI in the knowledge that the major companies and manufacturers within Australia have been harassed over the past year or so by the militant unions with which we have to contend. Unless this Government-not only the Prime Minister and other Ministers but also the back benchers-and the people outside who support it, are prepared to tell the nation of the dangers of a 35-hour week, I am sure that problems will arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not cite any figures. I will refer to common-sense issues that I believe are the crux of the entire problem. The Opposition's spokesman on industrial relations, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), has been the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Labor Party. I believe that he entered the Parliament not only to lead the Labor Party but also to lead the campaign for a 35-hour week within Australia. If this is achieved by the Opposition he will go down as the person who achieved it. Undoubtedly that is why he is here. In the years to come Australia and its working population will regret what has occurred. I wish the honourable member for Wills all the best. He may be assured that, as the representative of a country electorate, I will fight him tooth and nail. When the honourable member spoke on this matter this afternoon and last week he talked in generalities. He referred to what other people had said. He did not address himself to the real effect, technological or otherwise, that a shorter working week would have upon the Australian population. If I usually work 40 hours a week and I am forced to work a 35-hour week instead, is it not natural for five hours of the week I will be less productive than I am if I work a 40-hour week? It necessarily follows that productivity must fall. It has to fall whether technology is introduced or not. Every honourable member in this chamber has to recognise that very principle. </PARA>
<PARA> Somebody said this afternoon that we have to buy back Australia. The New South Wales Labor Government and the Federal Labor Government, when it was in office, were forced to bring in overseas capital to help develop the natural resources of Australia. Overseas experts also had to be brought in. I am not saying that we do not have the expertise but in many fields it is not extensive enough to develop the natural resources of Australia. There is no way that we can buy back Australia unless the working class population is sufficiently well off to buy shares and interests in various developments. If a 35-hour week comes into being in Australia the worker will be poorly off. He will not have sufficient funds to invest in Australian industries. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister said the other evening, not only is this campaign an attack by the Opposition upon industry within Australia but also it is a move to enrich the coffers of the unions which are trying to force the issue. To me that is certainly the case. Opposition members are the people who fought for arbitration and conciliation. As many speakers have said, why do we not recognise the conciliation and arbitration system and resolve such matters in the proper manner? If a 35-hour week were achieved, who is to say that in two or three years the unions that are presently trying to reduce the 40-hour week would not lead the campaigns-Opposition members would support them-for a shorter working week. Such action is irresponsible. In my electorate the other day I received a telephone call from a builder. He advised me that a union representative had threatened that if certain people did not join the union the job would be blackbanned and they would have to walk off the job. That is typical of what is occurring today. That is why the Prime Minister and the Government are so determined to advise industries and workers of the problems that will arise. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer to the effect of a 35-hour week upon the primary industries of Australia. They are responsible for at least 50 per cent of Australian exports and over 12 per cent of employment throughout Australia. These industries are the crux of the economy. Honourable members cannot tell me that people in these industries, whether they be wheat farmers, graziers, dairy farmers, fruit growers or small crop growers, will not be seriously affected by a 35-hour week. I said earlier that I am convinced, in the same way as the Government, that this must mean a rise in wages. It must mean unemployment. It must mean rising costs on the farm. I am a farmer myself. When a farmer pays his accounts at the end of the month, and starts to look at what he has to pay for repairs to equipment, for power for his property and for freight to transport his produce away from the farm, he finds that increasing amounts are involved. Honourable members know that in many cases the primary producer does not have any means of actually getting those extra costs back. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at exports, we see that the farmer has a market on which he gets certain prices for the goods he has contracted to produce. It is only from what he obtains for what he sells for food consumption within Australia that he may have a possibility of recouping his costs of production. This is the only field. But as with most of the overall production from the farm today, we are dependent upon exports. It has been said over and over again on the Government side that we are pricing ourselves out of the markets of the world. I say that we are pricing out of the market not only our manufactured goods but also our goods from the farm. I appeal to everybody to give serious consideration to the effects of this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We know their leader once said: 'They have never had it so good'. I know that the Opposition will never be allowed to forget it. At this time, without a 35-hour week, the primary producer works in order to invest in the farm and he works for hours. He is not a 40-hour man. Most of the primary producers are not 60-hour men, and neither are the families, that is the wives and the children who are also involved in producing on the farm seven days a week. Where would this country be without this type of person who makes such a contribution? This is what we were founded on and this is what we will continue to be founded on. Whether or not we have natual resources, what is important is what an acre of soil produces. We should never look past that. It is what the soil produces that we feed the country on and that we export. I know that members of the Opposition are interjecting. They are the people who, in most compassionate ways, come into this chamber time and time again and say that we have a responsibility to give funds to countries that are war-torn, that have floods and everything else. I tell the House that we have a responsibility to feed the Third World, the people who need the products that we produce on the farm. We have a responsibility. Today, the Australian primary producer is prepared to accept the responsibility to do that if he has a fair basis for production, if his economy is sound and if he is receiving a reasonable return for the work that he does.</PARA></TALK.START>

They do not want to see land prices rise if they want their 20 acres or 10 acres of land. They want to be able to build a home. With a 35-hour week land prices in the country will skyrocket.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with honourable members opposite. The working man is the base of the nation. We should look after him. Do not put him out of work. Half, or more than half, of the working people who belong to unions do not want to see a 35-hour week. If honourable members had closely followed the speech of the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Les McMahon) a while ago they would have seen that he did not want that either. He is a sensible man. A lot of the people here actually do not want it and they are not looking forward to it. What an opportunity this great country has. At this point in our lifetime we are developing natural resources, feeding the world, and achieving and improving a standard of living to maintain what we have. We can forget about a 35-hour week, a 38-hour or even a 40-hour week. We should get that out of our minds and accept responsibility for the good of this country. We are going to need that sense of responsibility over the years to come. We are basically an under-developed land in a great global atmosphere. What will happen if we do not accept our responsibility and the working hours that are acceptable to Australia? If we look at the rest of the world-at Japan and West Germany-we will see that we have practically the lowest working hours in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have some figures here. I took them out the other day. Out of the 365 days in a year, 104 days are taken up as weekends, there are four weeks annual leave throughout the year, 11 public holidays and eight days sick leave. I do not think that one worker in this nation, if he sat down and thought, would not agree that things are pretty good the way they are. The other day a chap who had had a look at our figures informed me that at the present time we are not working an average of even 35 hours a week. We are working about only 34.9 hours a week. That has been said before. If we have a 35-hour week the average workers of this country will be working under 30 hours a week. Let us take our minds back to New South Wales in 1947. The consumer price index in 1947 went up 3 per cent, in 1948 it went up 6 per cent, in 1949 it went up 9 per cent, in 1950 it went up 10 per cent, and in 1952 it went up 20 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not entirely because of the 40-hour week. But do not tell me that that did not affect it. It must have done. I give great credit to this Government because it has tackled the economy and inflation in a sensible way. Is it not right to expect that if a 35-hour week comes in, this will be the pattern that we will see throughout Australia? There will be a rise in the CPI every year. Then we will hear the catcalls and the moanings that will come from members of the Opposition. They will say that because we were in government we were the people responsible for killing the economy. They will say: 'You know you must be responsible'. As I said earlier, this is common sense. It is not a matter of figures. It is not a matter of what is said perhaps before the courts, or what a judge or anybody else says. They will look at the facts placed before them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that as Australians we have a great responsibility to cover the things that I have spoken about this afternoon. I feel that that responsibility is shared today by the great majority of the people of Australia. The effect of this upon the primary producer-as I said earlier, the man responsible for the bulk of our exports, and the backbone of this country-will be tremendous. We will not get younger men to enter primary industries. We will have the older part of the population within the community wanting to leave primary industries. The younger men will not be able to get into the industry because of costs. They will be frightened to attempt it. These are the facts and the House may be assured that we will strongly oppose the 35-hour week proposal. </PARA>

However, the Minister then went on to give us a tale of woe as to what would happen to the economy if the unions were successful in gaining shorter working hours.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Governor-General's Speech made reference to Australian foreign policy attitudes, to the position we have in the world and to the part we ought to play in the American alliance. In a speech that I made in this House last week, in another debate, I referred to one of the problems which I believe have occurred in United States attitudes towards the Soviet Union in recent years in that there has tended to be a swing from one unreal view to another. I mentioned that on the one side there was sometimes a tendency amongst liberal academic circles in the United States to believe that, if only the United States and its allies took a more understanding view of the Soviet Union, all the problems would fade away and we could be friends with each other. When that attitude does not seem to work one gets a swing to the other extreme in which spokesmen for the United States are encouraged to make very strong statements and to indulge in sabre rattling which is not necessarily realistic and does not necessarily convey a proper understanding of the issues. I then indicated that we must not become carried away by our own rhetoric or by adopting foreign policy attitudes that we cannot support, and that we have to understand the essential differences between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Western systems of Government, the essential conflict that exists between them, and be prepared to play our part in the Western alliance. In other words, our foreign policy and the strength with which we express it must be matched by our real diplomatic, military and economic strength. We should not merely take an attitude in diplomatic terms which we cannot support by our own real contribution to the Western alliance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe we should examine some of the achievements of American foreign policy under former President Nixon. In retrospect I think it is fair to say that it is a pity that rightful contempt for the Watergate affair led to a disregard for or even outright rejection of everything that Richard Nixon stood for. It is time that we acknowledged that some of the major achievements of the Nixon Administration were in the area of foreign policy. That was probably the major policy area of the Nixon years with which the Ford Administration was happy to be associated. The reaction against the Watergate affair no doubt contributed to the development of unrealistic expectations of President Jimmy Carter. It also led to a paralysis of the United States leadership at executive level when leadership and decision-making capacity was badly needed in the United States. (Quorum formed). I thank the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton) for trying to ensure that a greater number of his Opposition colleagues are in the House to hear me. Unfortunately there are very few members of the Opposition even at this stage on the Opposition benches whereas, of course, the Government's benches are packed. I was referring to developments in the United States and the attitude which affected the Carter Administration when it came to office. As time went on, it appeared that President Carter did not have the real power to act in foreign policy and defence matters, either diplomatically or militarily, when faced with challenges in, for example, Iran and Afghanistan at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> The public perception of his foreign policy was that it became a policy of confusion, uncertainty and vacillation. There is no doubt that this diluted the nation's will when positive initiatives were called for. Foreign policy should be based on a hard-headed assessment of the realities of the international situation with which one is dealing and the cementing of agreements and relationships in a manner that makes them difficult for one or the other party to break. Such agreements must be based on common interests and hard-headed assessments of both sides, not on some ill-defined, sentimental good will. That is the danger we face in talking about international relationships, particularly those affecting the fundamental balance between the United States and the USSR. I believe that a reading in full of some of the statements by Alexander Haig, the new Secretary of State of the United States Administration, indicates that he is making that broad hard-headed assessment despite some of the rhetoric in which he indulges. I think that that is something from which we can take heart. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from that overall global balance and our position in it, there is a need for Australia to develop its own regional network of bilateral and multilateral relationships. We have developed as a nation practical working relationships with certain Middle Eastern countries, particularly in the Persian Gulf area. That development has occurred despite our strong diplomatic support for Israel in international forums. We have seen the growth of a very substantial trading relationship with Japan, a relationship which is now developing into a broader range of consultations on other issues, not just trading matters, through the medium of regular ministerial meetings. It is not difficult to foresee that we may have some common defence interests with Japan in future in that any maritime threat will present us with a common interest in protecting our sea lanes. Wartime suspicions still exist, of course, but the reality of our growing relationship gives us certain common interests. Australia and New Zealand must grow closer together, no matter what parochial considerations intervene from either side of the Tasman from time to time in the way of underarm tactics on the cricket field. </PARA>
<PARA> Of great significance, of course, is our relationship with the Association of South East Asian Nations. In some instances this will be expressed in consultations and agreements with the Association of South East Asian Nations as a group. On other occasions we will seek separate arrangements and agreements with one or more of the ASEAN countries. I believe that this is an important aspect of the nature of the ASEAN relationship which we should keep in mind. ASEAN is not just a monolithic grouping of countries in South East Asia. Rather, it should be seen as an interlocking network or web of bilateral and multilateral relationships between various combinations of the ASEAN countries. I think that there is a mistaken view sometimes in Australian quarters, particularly in Australian commercial quarters, that ASEAN ought to be seen as some sort of South East Asian version of the European Economic Community. It is not a unified trading bloc in quite that sense. Certainly there is a growing commonality of viewpoints between the ASEAN countries but we still have to look at it in terms of a network of relationships between those countries. In that respect we have not only to develop relationships with ASEAN as a group but also to consider the importance of individual issues, whether they be trading issues, cultural issues or matters concerning the security of the area, in a bilateral sense or with particular groupings of ASEAN countries as well as by consulting with ASEAN as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> In some quarters there has been floated a rather loosely defined idea of some form of grand Pacific alliance involving Australia and other countries on the Pacific rim. The problem with such a concept is that the interests of countries around the Pacific are so diverse that it would be difficult to keep them in harness together. Indeed, any major problem causing one or two significant partners in such an alliance to withdraw would almost certainly result in the collapse of the alliance. In my view we should seek to strengthen bilateral and multilateral relationships in the region to a far greater extent before we seriously discuss the formation of some grand Pacific alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor in world affairs that has influ- enced Australian attitudes recently has been the evidence of the resurgence of Islam, particularly in Iran. I do not believe that we should react to the Islamic countries out of some sense of cultural xenophobia. In some of the attitudes that have been expressed on the emergence of Islamic radicalism there is an implied assumption that Islamic nationalism is a monolithic force which will confront the rest of the world on a global scale. A closer look must surely indicate that there are as many tensions within Islam as there are between Islamic countries and the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, our own substantial cultural, religious and political differences with the Arab states have not prevented Australia from developing a modus vivendi with several Arab countries. This has been achieved, as I said earlier, in spite of our strong diplomatic support for Israel in international forums. In several instances it is a highly profitable relationship to Australia in terms of commodity trading and the employment of Australian consulting firms on Middle Eastern projects. Given the tensions within Islamic countries, such as the suspicions that exist in many places between Sunni Moslems and Shi'ite Moslems, it is quite likely that there will be other flare-ups of Islamic nationalism within the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we must not be carried away by these developments and look at the development of Islamic nationalism as some sort of monolithic force but seek to understand the cultural bases for particular developments in particular countries. The violent statements by some extreme Islamic groups will inevitably hit the headlines, but once the mullahs start executing some of their own countrymen for religious or political offences, and start putting educated young women behind veils, it is likely that the population at large in those countries will tire of such excesses and demand more moderation in national policy. Without having to agree on each other's social structures, I believe that Australia and other Western countries can reach a perfectly satisfactory working arrangement with Islamic countries. Of course, it is of importance to us in that two of the ASEAN countries, Indonesia and Malaysia, are basically Islamic. The brand of Islam which is practised in those countries is strongly influenced by the traditional and cultural attitudes of people on various islands within those countries. These are factors that we must take account of when considering the significance of Islam in any relationships that we may have with those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to turn from the matter of foreign affairs to one matter of debate about defence in this country which has received a great deal of publicity recently. The Chief of Defence Force Staff appeared recently before the Sub-committee on Defence Matters of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. That Sub-committee is better known, of course, as the Katter Committee. Some of the remarks which Sir Anthony Synnot, the Chief of Defence Force Staff, made received a great deal of publicity. I want to draw the attention of the House to the extent to which he was selectively quoted by most of the news media, to the extent of being misleadingly quoted. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) seems to have been sucked in by some of the misleading reports when he quoted the Chief of Defence Force Staff in a speech that he made to the House of Representatives on 26 March-only a few days ago. He quoted a statement in which Sir Anthony said:</PARA>
<PARA> We do not identify one single threat . . . </PARA>
<PARA>To my mind the Leader of the Opposition spoke in a way which implied that the Chief of Defence Force Staff-(Quorum formed). The misquotation of the Chief of Defence Force Staff was particularly evident in a report on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program AM of 18 March 1981 in which Mr John Highfield made the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The Chief of the Defence Force Staff told the Sub-Committee that there was no threat against Australia other than that which could be mounted by the super powers in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a most incredible statement for anyone who was following the public hearings of the defence sub-committee on that occasion because what the Chief of Defence Force Staff said was that there was no single identifiable threat to Australia but there were a number of threats that we ought to be taking account of our defence planning. I am pleased to say that the Melbourne Age was, to my knowledge and from my reading of Press reports, the only newspaper which gave a reasonably full account of what the Chief of Defence Force Staff had to say on that occasion. An article written by Mr Lorenzo Boccabella in the Melbourne Age reports Sir Anthony Synnot as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia could be brought to heel in many other ways. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Sea trade routes could be blocked, offshore resources attacked or harbours mined. Other threats included raids on Australia's hinterland and international terrorist attack. </PARA>
<PARA>That indicates that what the Chief of Defence Force Staff was speaking about was that Australia faces a number of potential threats, not of immediate invasion by a major power but certainly a number of lower level threats which we ought to be considering seriously when planning our defence effort. It was with that background that he went on to answer a number of questions from members of the defence sub-committee on the way in which our defence forces ought to be structured. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter because I want to complain very strongly about the way in which defence matters are often publicised in the media. Often I get the impression from the way in which media reports present defence matters that the Press wants us to say one of two things-either that we are to be bombed tomorrow or there is no threat whatsoever. Apparently any range of threats in between those two extremes is just not newsworthy, will not get any publicity and therefore is not worth paying any attention to. I believe we deserve a better coverage on defence matters from the Press of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must confess that I do not really feel like making a speech for a variety of reasons, not the least being that this evening I saw a film on El Salvador. I want to make some remarks about that because I found the film quite sickening. I would like to quote from a release dated 2 February put out by Amnesty International. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The human rights situation in El Salvador has deteriorated sharply in recent months. Amnesty International is seriously concerned and fears a further increase in summary execution, torture and abduction by government forces as civil conflict continues between guerrillas and the government. Of some 8,000 Salvadorians estimated to have been killed during the past year, many are known to have been the victims of extrajudicial execution by the armed forces. Peasants and young people appear to be particular targets. Sources in the country say that nearly 3,000 peasants were among those killed for political reasons in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that was the situation on 2 February. Practically every day there are reports in the newspapers of the continual killing in that country. I do not wish to dwell on the details of that. I will just perhaps recall to the minds of honourable members a report in the Melbourne Age of 26 March 1981. Under the heading: 'Guns stop in memory of archbishop' the Age reports:</PARA>
<PARA> Salvordoran Catholics flocked to their churches today the first ceasefire to be call in the country's 18-month-old 'rebellion'. </PARA>
<PARA> Salvadoran rebels stopped military action for a day in memory of Archbishop Oscor Arnulfo Romero, the fiery defender of the poor, who was gunned down at his altar exactly a year ago. </PARA>
<PARA>The article concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> While the rebels were quiet today, the Rightest death squads continued their grizzly terror campaign. Five mutilated bodies were found this morning in the outer suburb of Soyapango . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we saw in the film. It is depressing. I do not understand the reasoning or the lack of understanding of the Liberal Government in unquestioningly following the line being taken by President Reagan and the American Administration at the moment. It was quite clear that under Jimmy Carter some efforts were being made-nowhere near as much as I would have liked-to bring about a moderation of the terror in that sad country and to try to get some meaningful land reform. For reasons which I hope to go into in a moment Reagan changed his tack. I find it distressing that all these reports are coming out in hardly communist publications like the Melbourne Age, the National Times and the Sydney Morning Herald. When a person like Archbishop Romero is gunned down and is accused by a spokesman of the junta as being a communist and when the Catholic church is being accused of being communist, I would like to think that a government of this country would take more serious heed of what is going on and not blindly follow the Americans. I want to try to understand why President Reagan is switching his policy as he is, for example, in the case of South Africa. He is seeking to ignore the impact of aparthied and the action that most civilised countries are taking in trying to impress upon the South Africans that that is a hardly reasonable form of behaviour. He is turning the clock back, as it were, in his relations with many of the central American countries. What is the reason for this? It can hardly be that he sees a military threat. After seeing the film tonight and reading these reports, he can hardly see El Salvador as a military threat to the United States. Once again, of course, it is hard to see any of these countries as an external economic threat. After all, we are told that the main product of El Salvador is coffee and the main market is the United States. Whatever happens in that country-whether it falls to the leftists or rightists-I cannot see it being a threat to America when its main export is going to the American market. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that I do not see an economic threat in those terms, I wonder whether, in fact, the problems may not be economic insecurity, doubts and confusion in one of the major powers of the world today. I put it that way. I will deal with the Soviet Union later. It strikes me that the Americans are in fact feeling enormously insecure for a variety of reasons. I quote from the Age of 12 March, an article headed 'The big redistribution':</PARA>
<PARA> The Reagan Administration says the Budget it presented yesterday is a means of fighting inflation while stimulating economic growth-and in the long run it might well do these things. </PARA>
<PARA> But in the short term its most obvious effect would be of a very different kind: to redistribute income in this country. The money would go from poor to rich . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget would alter incomes by giving tax breaks to the better off while significantly reducing programs aimed primarily at the poorest people-</PARA>
<PARA>The article then mentions that the three largest welfare programs, Medicaid, food stamps and housing assistance-the non-cash or in kind programs that help the poor-will be dramatically slashed by the Reagan Budget. The headline above an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 31 March reads: 'Reagan's razor gang shaves the poor to help the rich'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Reagan philosophy is to help the rich to help America. But as the President's razor gang goes to work, it's the poor who will pay. </PARA>
<PARA>The point is that I think there are ideological blinkers on the planners in America, as I will suggest if I have time, is the case in this country. The proposition they are working on is that by cutting public expenditure, this will somehow stimulate economic growth. It will increase demand and do all of those things necessary to revive the economy. Is this, in fact, what will happen? Is this approach to curing our economic problems a wise one, or is it only feeding and aggravating the sense of insecurity that the whole country is feeling?</PARA>
<PARA> I should like to quote from an article which was quoted by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) and incorporated on page 169 of Hansard of 25 February. The article is by Emma Rothschild on the subject, 'Reagan and the real America'. In commenting on his economic approach and on growth she says:</PARA>
<PARA> But such accelerated growth seems unlikely. The United States exports more than 10 per cent of its gross national product, and the countries with which it trades are sickly. Industrial production turned down in the second quarter of 1980 in each of the five largest capital economies. The number of people looking for jobs in the European Community has increased by 20 per cent in one year. The world economy may be moving, as Mr Reagan takes office, towards the synchronous recession of 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly there is not much hope in that revival for the increase in American production being exported. Who is going to be able to afford to buy it? The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The expectation of economic growth thus depends in turn on a further assumption: that some unknown Republican inspiration, some elixir of indigenous capitalist expansion-</PARA>
<PARA>It is almost the sort of faith we were treated to by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in, I guess, each of the last three elections. What is happening? This article states Reagan has commented that:</PARA>
<PARA> The 'strategy' is based on solid economic principles and basic experience in both government and the marketplace. It has worked before, and will work again. </PARA>
<PARA>There have been two great surges in recent economic growth, according to Rothschild, one from 1950 to 1953 and another from 1962 to 1966. These were accompanied with rapid increases in manufacturing output. But-this is the point that I want to emphasise because I think it is relevant to what we are talking about-each was also a period of rapid expansion in the military economy. So we have increasing reports in the Press about the increase in military preparedness in the United States. An article in the Age of 11 March 1981 under the heading 'Reagan bid to lift military aid', talked about sending much more aid to El Salvador. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Despite President Reagan's determination to make big budget cuts in domestic programmes and non-military foreign aid, informed sources said yesterday that the security assistance programme to be presented to Congress would call for outlays greater than those in President Carter's proposed budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Some figures are then given. For El Salvador alone, there is a request to Congress to appropriate $21.5m in credits for the purchase of weapons and military equipment and $34m in economic support. That followed a promise of $21.5m for emergency military aid just the week before. These are massive sums of money for military purposes. Of course, that is only part of it. Total foreign military sales credits that the Administration hopes to provide in 1982 will amount to $3,400m. That would certainly give a fillip to the flagging American economy. In other words, what I am fearful of is that in this time of, one could almost suggest, world depression in economic terms, the economic system that we know is responding in a way that it has done historically. As Emma Rothschild mentioned, on two previous occasions since the Second World War, when there has been a dramatic economic pick-up, it has been associated with an acceleration in the arms race. Of course, historically we must recall that the world pulled out of the great depression only when the arms race started leading up to the Second World War. I am not arguing the pros and cons of whether we should have armed. I am simply pointing out that that is what helped the economy of the world to revive. It was not that capitalism had found new frontiers and was able to regenerate itself. It had to resort to the production of arms to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Is there really any significant increase in the communist threat around the world? Is it really possible that one day President Carter could feel that all was secure and he tried to impress upon the El Salvadorians that they should be more reasonable and less paranoid about communist subversion and so on, and the next day, with the election of a new President, Reagan, suddenly communism threatens to take over the whole world. Surely that is hardly likely. </PARA>
<PARA> An article in the Age of 10 March under the headline, 'US wants bases in the Persian Gulf', indicates that the United States is seeking to spread its military buildup everywhere. That report in the Age expresses the attitude of the West Germans in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> In Bonn, the West German Chancellor, Mr Schmidt said yesterday that he would urge President Reagan to accept President Brezhnev's call for a United States-Soviet summit meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>It was acknowledged on 11 March-a day later than this article from which I have quoted concerning the Reagan bid to lift military aid-that Brezhnev had written to President Reagan elaborating on his proposals to improve East-West relations, including the proposal for a summit meeting. The official commentary was to the effect that the tone of the letter was matter of fact, certainly not a hostile communication, devoid of polemics. President Brezhnev called it a review of Soviet proposals in the area of East-West relations. With the evidence around suggesting that really no one wants to get pugnacious and threatening-it seems hardly likely, in the short time between the exit of Carter and the incoming of Reagan, that the communists should have rallied themselves so dramatically to justify all of this-what really is the reason for the sudden dramatic build-up? I fear that it is not the communist threat but the incapacity of the economic system to adjust to peace in peacetime. I fear that it is the only real stimulus available. </PARA>
<PARA> In case honourable members think I am just seeking to rubbish the United States of America and the Western side of this equation, let me turn now to the Soviet Union where again we have an example of one of the two largest and most powerful nations in the world behaving in the same bullying, insecure fashion. My feeling is that there is enormous insecurity within the Soviet Union and, therefore, it too embarks upon foreign adventures as a means to try to maintain some sort of cohesion within that country. Maybe that is the best explanation of its expedition into Afghanistan. Of course, the source of the insecurity there was, no doubt, the fear of changes in that country stemming from what was going on in neighbouring Moslem countries. After all, the Soviet Union has a very large Moslem population. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things which worries me and exercises my concern is the reason for the Soviet Union's feeling of insecurity. Why is it so unsure of its Moslem population or, indeed, of its whole population? It seems to me that State capitalism in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has not succeeded in winning the confidence and loyalty of its population. I wish to quote from an interview published in the Washington Post, which appeared also in the Guardian on 16 March 1980, with Sakharov, the communist Soviet scientist who has been exiled. He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> What is the future of the human rights movement in the Soviet Union . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Among other things, he replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Exploiting a period of general aggravation of the international situation, the authorities have made a mighty attempt to eliminate any display of dissidence, both in Moscow and the provinces. </PARA>
<PARA>Sakharov was then asked:</PARA>
<PARA> How do you assess the human rights movement of the 1970s and its influence on the internal affairs of the Soviet Union?</PARA>
<PARA>He said that there are:</PARA>
<PARA> Dangerous illusions about the essence of our system which used to be almost universal among the Western intelligentsia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He was then asked:</PARA>
<PARA> What changes will take place in the structure of Soviet society in the 1980s?</PARA>
<PARA>His reply was:</PARA>
<PARA> International security, the preservation of world peace, the welfare and the spiritual freedom of the people of our country demand changes in the structure of our society in the direction of greater pluralism in economic, ideological and cultural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it unlikely that such changes will take place in the near future. Our totalitarian society, with its caste and bureaucratic structure, its complete lack of freedom of expression or democratic mechanisms for decision-making, is extraordinarily inert. </PARA>
<PARA>So the article continues. In answer to a question pushing him on what fundamental changes may take place in the 1980s, he lists a lot of problems and I think the one which I am about to quote is significant. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Our country faces serious economic difficulties. Among these are shortages of goods, especially foodstuffs, rural and urban manpower shortages, deteriorating workplace discipline, growing alcoholism, pay-scale inequalities, shortages of fuel . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He lists a number of other things. He then says:</PARA>
<PARA> All these problems encourage the continuing militarization of the economy. The basic necessity for economic reform . . . appears incontravertible. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to observe that, at the recent congress, Brezhnev made those sorts of comments on the Soviet Union. I note that if anyone else had made those sorts of comments they could be thrown into gaol. He, at last, has to face up to the fact that these things have to be acknowledged. So we see that the Soviet Union is the same as the United States of America in the sense that both are feeling insecure and, in my view, both countries are retreating to militarism as a means of trying to gloss over the crises facing the countries internally in the hope that the community can be lulled into a sense of security. I would guess that probably the events in Poland are further evidence of this crucial struggle to try to democratise the situation in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we are not doing very well in these countries either. In Britain, there has been a reliance on the monetary policy that has doubled the unemployment rate, and where the inflation rate is higher than is in the best interests of the country. Of course, as a result production has gone down. Australia has been told to embrace, as have the British, increased export earnings. Britain has coal and we have our resources; yet if we look into the matter we find that that is a contradiction. Increased income leads to the manufacturing base of Britain-and the same problems would arise in Australia-being unable to compete in markets overseas. In such a situation we would be forced to import more goods with the result that conditions in the country would get worse and not better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to respond to the Governor-General's address at the opening of the Thirty-second Parliament. In so doing I wish to pay my tribute and that of my constituents to His Excellency Sir Zelman Cowan not only for his address but also for the manner in which he performed the functions of his office. I have no doubt that his Excellency will be recorded in history as one of Australia's most distinguished Governors-General. Mr Deputy Speaker, I congratulate you on you appointment to your position as Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker of this House and Mr Speaker on his reappointment. I respond to certain passages in the Governor-General's address. I mention first the establishment of a committee of senior Ministers to review the functions of all Commonwealth departments and associated agencies. It is of immense importance to appreciate that the Fraser Government, this conservative Government, has been able to reduce Public Service staff by 10,000 at a time when States have increased staff-in some States, quite considerably. There has to be an appreciation by the States that the problem of inflation and excess public expenditure is as much in their hands to control as it is in the hands of the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some honourable members have made suggestions to this Committee of review. I am pleased that I was able to make my own contribution to demonstrate a member's personal concern to the Committee for the expanded public sector expenditure where the 1970s, under a Labor government, saw the excesses of government in this regard and expenditure the intention of which was to centralise Canberra control and influence, but unfortunately saw also the duplication of services with the States-Aborigines, education, health, environmental matters, roads and many others-whereby billions of dollars have been unnecessarily spent and continue to be spent and unfortunately wasted. Much of this waste can be accounted for just in personnel. If we as a Government, are to achieve worthwhile reductions in taxation rates and collections, this Government, all State governments, and all authorities must have realised that a reduction has to be matched with comparable reductions in puplic expenditure. If Australians as a people are overtaxed, their expectations from the public purse have to be diminished before relief can be given on the taxation problem It is an unfortunate fact that people's expectations of governments to provide for their needs and, in some instances, their wants are always in excess of a government's ability to fulfill those expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point covered in the Governor-General's address is under the title: 'caring for people'. It is my greatest concern that any Australian government, now and in the future, must as a priority be able to care for its aged. Yet if the present policy is continued, by the 1990s it may be an impossible priority to honour. In fact, whilst our present welfare schemes and the manner in which they are financed through current expenditure are an almost impossible burden for the Government to provide, if carried on under the same policies, by 1990 they will bleed the nation entirely. Some may say that this is an alarmist attitude but let us examine some statistics provided over the 10 years from 1970 to 1979 and those from the last budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I turn to the Budget for 1980-81. Of every $1 raised in taxation revenue by the Commonwealth from every source, 31c was spent on social security and welfare. That amounted to $9,890m, or 27.4 per cent of all government expenditure. During the 10 years from 1969-70 to 1978-79 the number of welfare recipients grew by 125 per cent but the number of taxpayers grew by only 22 per cent. In the group of welfare recipients, age pensioner numbers increased by about 75 per cent. The alarming fact is that the number entitled to age benefits will not decrease or stabilise; it will continue to increase. Australia, with a zero population growth, will become an aging population to be serviced by a declining taxpayer population. Also, government policy on removing gift tax and adopting an income test as against an asset test allows a person a more certain entitlement to the pension than was the situation five years ago. No-one would deny-I certainly would not-aged persons an entitlement to a pension. What alarms me is that this entitlement is quickly growing and no policy, apart from payment from current revenue, has been formulated to meet this growing commitment in the future. This Government must plan immediately to formulate for the future new policies in this regard alone. </PARA>
<PARA> In caring for people, no one should forget that 1981 is the International Year of Disabled Persons. Each of us should be asking the question: What can we do? Earlier in the Address-in-Reply debate the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Adermann) made a special plea for consideration for those afflicted through deafness. Two weeks ago I met with representatives of the Proserpine Activity and Therapy Centre for the Handicapped, which is in my electorate. A program jointly funded by the Federal Government and the community of Proserpine is doing an immense amount of good for those people who attend there and for those people who contribute their time and talent to this work. I pay tribute to them all. This program must be continued. What is required though is an awareness that these people are in the community and need help, an awareness that they wish to remain in or get into the mainstream of the community and an awareness that they can be helped and trained so that they can lead useful lives. It is a short step from awareness to action and concern. However, there are means by which the Commonwealth can extend its concern, particularly in regard to the imposition of tariffs on specialist equipment from overseas, such as wheelchairs, for the handicapped. Also, I understand that sales tax in some instances adds to the cost of specialised equipment. I believe that the Government should give a lead in the International Year of Disabled Persons in seeing what relief can be given to those who carry this massive burden of incapacity. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer now to the exciting future Australia has in the way of resource development, particularly in my own State of Queensland. What was 20 years ago an unexplored and probably unappreciated resource, coal, is today developing the central Queensland and central highlands area and attracting many people to the newly-developing towns. Just on present proposals, development of the Newlands lease, Riverside, Winchester South, Dainia and German Creek will mean the construction of new towns at Middlemount and Glenden and massive extensions to the town of Moranbah. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The electorate of Dawson, which supplies 7 per cent of Australia's national exports. (Quorum formed). However, I do feel that there is a need to reappraise the whole situation concerning this development and other resource development throughout Australia. The matter of foreign and Australian ownership has long been debated in this House and I do not intend to pursue that matter. Honourable members know my feelings in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question that must be asked is: Who should contribute to the infrastructure of these new developments and who should gain from it? The further question that must be asked is: Is the coal or are the minerals being sold at a sufficiently high figure to give a return both to the miner and to the country? For instance, it is established that a company should build the town, the houses, the railway, the port facilities and so on and that if it is not paid for them a sufficient charge should be made at a later date to recover those costs at a profit. Airport, sporting and recreation facilities are also normally absorbed by the company as part of the infrastructure. This Government allows a write-off of capital assets over a period and direct deductions for expenses for taxation purposes, so the Government makes a contribution in that regard. I question whether the developer or government should provide the services. The abnormal and immediate requirements for telecommunications, for instance, come out of the capital budget of a Telecom district, thus denying others that immediate service, although this is recouped at a later date through charges to the developing towns. There is also the provision of health and educational services and the provision of police and welfare services and all the other services normally available elsewhere to Australian citizens. The cost of providing access developmental roads and services not only to the residents but also to the product itself must be questioned. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be argued that these services, being normal government services, should be provided by government, but it would be rational to suggest, firstly, that the employees normally move away from centres where these services have always been available and are available more cheaply. Their departure leaves these services in surplus at the point of their departure and their arrival at the new centres creates a need for those services to be available. Secondly, roads linking these developments are as much a necessary link as are the railways, particularly when a project is getting under way. Too often the construction of and funding for access roads are seldom part of the infrastructure arrangements and local government authorities are expected to take up this responsibility and the financial burden, and they are subjected to criticism if they are not provided or they are not up to standard. </PARA>
<PARA> Who should be responsible, the developer or the taxpayer? I believe that the eventual government share, through taxes and royalties or whatever, has to be reviewed just to see whether the revenue covers sufficiently the capital cost of the supply of services and the recurrent expenditure associated with those services. The suggestion is that there be a review of the total situation-a company's profit expectation, its servicing of capital, government revenue and what is to be provided, and the taxation cost to government of the granting of deductibility for special infrastructure costs. The review may well indicate that no one is benefiting from development, that the price of the product is too low and the only beneficiary is the buyer. For these reasons, governments need to know exactly what is the position, particularly when products are subject to special transfer prices between international corporations and their subsidiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> While dealing with these new developments, the question of resource taxes must also be faced. As far as I am concerned, the States had constitutionality well before the Commonwealth and I would believe the resources belong to the States. Commonwealth shouldshare only to the extent of the taxes paid by the corporations and the employees engaged in those developments. Because there has been no review of the type suggested earlier, there is a real area of contention as to who should provide and maintain the roads system-local government, the State Government or the Federal Government. Unfortunately, at the moment the developers are not held responsible. I believe it to be an unfair argument for the States to contend that the responsibility rests with the Commonwealth. Our record of increased payments to local government and to the States should evidence this. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to say that State resource taxes are already being paid. A major mining company in the coal mining and export business indicates that for the two years ending 31 December 1979 and 31 December 1980 total State taxes of $74m and $80m respectively were paid. These included an estimated profit on rail freights derived by the company of $47,488,000 and $53,890,000 respectively. Royalties in both years amounted to $23m. </PARA>
<PARA> If profits on rail freights are subject to a resource tax, which is then available to use for the benefit of all State residents, one must question the use to which the profits are put. The accounts of the Queensland railways to 30 June for the three years 1977-78, 1978-79 and 1979-80 show the following breakdown: in 1977-78 the net overall result was a loss of $63,451,000. In 1978-79 the loss dropped to $54,651,000. In 1979-80 it rose to $69,802,000. In the central Queensland division profits are made from the rail freight services. Those profits of $38m, $49m and $60m respectively were used in reducing the overall loss, as I said before. This means that the total profits are being used entirely to cover southern losses on the freight and passenger services, and no benefit is given to the producing areas. The central division subsidises the other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Two things are in evidence. Firstly, the State authorities must get their own services producing more economically. I fear that the offsetting of coal freight profits has hidden the real need to update rail services and charges to try to make them a little more viable. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, other transport systems should receive the benefit of profits from the rail freight prior to anything else. If the developers are not to contribute to the road systems-I believe they should-the State has the opportunity of using its rail profits for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> We are often told by our State colleagues how we should use Commonwealth oil levies and petrol excise duties to improve roads and many other things. Surely the use of rail profits for road construction is in keeping with those suggestions. I would find it difficult to find a more appropriate use. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall I am firmly of the view that there is a need for a Commonwealth/State review of all our developmental policies. If it is found that there has been little advantage to Australians from these developments, we will have a reason to seek price increases for our resources in line with oil prices. We need to ensure that profits are not exported internationally through excessively low transfer prices. (Quorum formed). I think it is a pity that a speaker's time should be reduced by the actions of the Opposition in calling quorums. It does not show the respect to His Excellency, the Governor-General, that he deserves. I am very sorry that the Opposition has seen fit to interrupt Government members when it leaves its own members undisturbed. For that reason, my time is almost at an end. I repeat that I support the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's Speech. I commend the comments I have made for the consideration of the appropriate Ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a number of matters in this Address-in-Reply debate. Some things that have been said in the debate by honourable members cannot pass unnoticed. Much has been said both in this debate and in another debate, which has now concluded, about the conditions of employment and the problems for industry that would be created by significant changes in those conditions. For the benefit of the House I will read a statement. I wonder whether honourable members opposite will agree with it. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those misguided individuals, some unfortunately in high positions, who propose this disastrous change in working conditions are proposing the destruction of the prosperity we all enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder how many honourable members opposite would have supported those remarks. I think most of them would have. In this generation they would have applied them to the 35-hour week. They were said in opposition to the abolition of child labour in the mines in Britain in the 1830s and 1840s. There is never a change in the words of those who believe that people who work for wages escaped from their proper position when slavery was abolished. I am the Opposition spokesman on defence. Earlier in the night the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer) indicated that certain remarks which were reported in the Press as being given in evidence before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence were not, in fact, made in that fashion. For the record I make it clear that if the Government's defence policy means anything, the words of Sir Anthony Synnot-I will refer later to what the present Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) said-have to be right; otherwise we will be in grave danger. The Chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee asked Sir Anthony Synnot, the Chief of Defence Force Staff, the following question:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer you to evidence that you gave previously to this Committee on 25 July 1979 when you said: 'We have also looked at the requirements of an enemy which planned a mass attack on Australia to try to capture the country, or subjugate the country. Every look we have had from every point of view indicates this is a most unlikely event? Does that analysis still hold?</PARA>
<PARA>That evidence was confirmed by Sir Arthur Tange who was also present on 25 July 1979. The answer given by the Chief of Defence Force Staff on 18 March 1981, which the honourable member for Casey suggested was not given, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Absolutely. I think it is addressed to some extent, under item two--</PARA>
<PARA>that relates to the Minister's statement to which I will refer later-</PARA>
<PARA>which I think we have moved on to at this stage. I do not believe, and I think anyone who has looked at it from a military point of view would agree with me, that any country in the world at the moment is capable of launching a mass armed invasion of Australia. Even the super powers at this time have quite inadequate amphibious force, and only the United States has sufficient aircraft carriers to get an adequate degree of air superiority over the sort of the area where they might launch an invasion. The Soviet Union and the United States are certainly capable of building up those forces but it would be a different world if one or the other were to attack Australia while other countries sat back. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote from that answer because it is a keystone of the current Australian defence policy. It is not only wrong but also irresponsible for honourable members to come into this House and to suggest that anything other than that is the case. I think it is important that we understand that a major threat is not what the preparation of our defence forces is all about at present. So that no one will suggest that I am trying to drive divisions between the Minister for Defence and the Chief of Defence Force Staff I quote what the Minister said in a written answer to the question on which the Admiral was commenting. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> At the present time, and for the foreseeable future, only the two Superpowers could marshal the range of necessary capabilities. Leaving aside questions of motive and likelihood, consideration of how either Superpower might use their forces against Australia is pure conjecture. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, a major armed invasion of Australia is not regarded as a credible contingency for the Defence force structure planning. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not regarded as a credible contingency. Again I quote the Minister. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There can be no single concept of operations for the defence of Australia and its vital interests because there is no tangible identifiable threat. </PARA>
<PARA>I think those two quotes identify the basis of defence planning in Australia. I hope that they do because during the whole of this Government's time in office the capabilities of the Australian Defence Force have been in decline. They are in decline because equipment is aging and the procurement programs of the Government are continually being deferred in a manner which creates a situation whereby every year our defence forces' capabilities, relative to those defence forces which are keeping up with modern technology, become less able to deal with a major situation on their own. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some serious problems, I believe, in the defence debate in Australia. The first is that there is a two level defence debate. There is that level of defence debate which honourable members opposite engage in to try to create a situation where political advantage is gained by making claims of threats that even the Minister admits do not exist and by making statements which propose defence initiatives which are not met. I think the most disgraceful exercise in recent years was that of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) before the Olympic Committee when he suggested Australia had three years to prepare for a world war. Since that time nothing new in the manner of absolute committed initiatives has taken place in the defence area in Australia. There has been some increase in the numbers of persons recruited to the reserves but no increase in the capabilities which are being provided for training-the equipment being provided-nor the basic ability of the reserve forces to fill a role. More seriously, if the Army Reserve where the recruiting is taking place is a significant part of the defence forces, then the Army itself must also have a key role to play. It is being denuded of any forms of capacity by the Government's total neglect of its equipment needs. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of weeks ago we had the Prime Minister's entourage at Amberley going around to the Press of Australia advising them that backfire bombers could fly over Australia and carry out a raid on Australia. It has subsequently been found that the backfire bombers were not, in fact, located where it was being suggested they were. But if that were true, then it might be a good idea if some honourable members opposite who keep talking about the Government's ability to defend the country looked at the realities. The backfire bomber not only outflies all of our aircraft but also it outflies all of our current missiles. So there is nothing in Australia. I mention one other matter which I think is ironical in the extreme considering that it is about the defence capacities of a government which only two weeks ago was trying to whip up a scare about backfire bombers. It also deals with the denuding of the Army. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro who is trying to interject does not care about defence. He wants votes out of it but does nothing about it. He would send people out to fight with broomsticks. That is the problem with this Government. It did that in 1940 and it is doing that now. I refer again to the Chief of Defence Force Staff when he was speaking about some of our equipment capacities. I hope that some honourable members opposite will listen to this quote. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, the honourable member may one day; otherwise he will not get many questions asked. The Chief of Defence Force Staff stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where are our fine modern anti-tank weapons? We have the Carl Gustav and that is about it. Where are our wonderful surface-top-air missiles? We have Rapier, which is a low level, surface-to-air Army missile. We have the hand-held Redeye, which is almost completely finished. It has another couple of years to run. So we are lacking air support for the Army in its close air support role. We have no long range surface-to-air missiles at all. The Air Force used to have one at Darwin and we gave that to the Singapore Government. So there are many areas in which we have not got things. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the understatement of the year. The Prime Minister is worried about backfire bombers and we have no misiles, no aircraft and no defence capacity in any shape or form which can deal with any form of bomber at all. I just add that this was included as one of the items which was required in the five year defence program set down in 1976. In answer to a question asked last year by myself the Minister indicated that provision of surface-to-air missiles for the Army, which the Chief of Defence Force Staff says will be non-existent in two years, is no longer necessary. The missiles have been dropped from the program. Those honourable members opposite who stand up in this House and talk about defence, those honourable members opposite who tell our young people that they should be prepared to defend Australia, should hang their heads in shame and also be shameful because they are part of an organisation which exalts trust in people when that trust is something to which they are not entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak also about one or two other matters in the few moments that I have left. Since the last election especially, the Government has been making a lot of noise about cutbacks in the public sector. It seems to be a supplement to the Bible that if your cut back the public sector you ultimately improve the lifestyle of those people who profit from it. I make that qualification because the Government says that everyone profits. But the unemployed just do not profit. We have also had claims made in Budget Speeches and on other occasions about the manner in which the Government has been able to reduce the deficit. I think we ought to look seriously at what the Government has done. Firstly, when it was in Opposition it made the claim, fairly regularly, that an increased deficit-increased expenditures without increased revenue-was dangerous to the economy. It voted in the Senate to prevent the levy which it ultimately placed on the national health scheme Medibank. It voted in the Senate to prevent that levy being collected. It would have added to the Consolidated Revenue bill the sum of $800m. That was totally and absolutely an economically irresponsible act perpetrated for one reason only-for politics. It was a case of damn the national economy; damn the consequences. Politics were all that was important. </PARA>
<PARA> We also had a situation in which Telecom Australia borrowings were transferred out of the Budget and replaced by private borrowings. That was then said to represent a reduction in public expenditure or in the deficits on the expenditure side of the Budget. It was a book-keeping entry. Telecom still borrows its money and competes in the money market. It just pays a slightly higher rate of interest than it would have paid. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently we have witnessed a campaign designed to cut down Telecom's business activities, not because Telecom is losing money, not because it is costing the Australian community money but because it is taking profits away from substantially overseas-owned companies which have built up industries in Australia and would like to get control of the profitable operations of Telecom to eliminate their competition, against which in a supposedly free enterprise system they have found that they cannot compete. What will happen when they get control of those sections of Telecom and it is cut back to handling the loss sections of the industry? Firstly, the system will deteriorate. If we look around the world at countries which have free enterprise run public utilities such as telephone services we find very few that are efficient. I invite honourable members to try to make a telephone call in France and see how they go. If they want a good telephone call, they should book three days in advance. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, many areas in Australia are subsidised in respect of telephone services. I do not believe that that is unreasonable because people who live in a vast continent long distances from the capital cities are entitled to some relief in this respect. I have spoken on this matter during the whole of my time in the Parliament. The cumulative cost of such subsidies is of the order of $200m a year. The cost of modernising telephone services and maintaining them at the high standard which we in Australia have come to expect, and complain about if we do not receive, is even higher. The standard of our telephone and other communication services is extraordinarily high. But the Government now proposes taking away the profitable sections of Telecom and giving them to its friends, probably those who subscribe to its election campaign funds. But who is to pay the $200m to maintain the existing services to non-metropolitan Australia? It will not be paid by the people who draw the earnings from the profitable sections. Who is to meet the cost of the inefficiency and for the maintenance of a modern system of telephones, when the profits from industries built up to support the telephone services and other forms of communication have been handed over, probably to the foreign friends of the Government who have priority in almost every area of activity in this country? The taxpayers of Australia will have to meet the cost. They will pay a direct supplement to the profits of the companies to which the Government hands over the profitable operations of Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> If the experience with Commonwealth Oil Refineries and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd many years ago, and what is now proposed for Trans-Australia Airlines, are any guide, those profits will be substantial and the losses to the Australian community will be great. The Government will sell out its interests at substantially below their effective and real value. The most recent example of the Government selling out Australia's interests was provided by the sale of the Ranger uranium deposits. A Labor government would not have embarked on such an undertaking at all. Nevertheless, the Government owned a substantial share of what the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) keeps telling us is one of the most highly profitable resources areas in Australia. But the Australian taxpayer will not share in that profitability; rather, it is to be shared by a few selected friends of the Government. The attack on Telecom is designed to transfer assets and funds away from the taxpayers of Australia and ultimately out of the taxpayers' pocket to friends of the Government and, I am afraid, friends who are financial supporters of the Government parties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not my sympathies; my congratulations, sir. It is quite some time now since we experienced the heat of the election campaign. It is well and truly behind us, but now is the time to look objectively at the issues that confronted the Australian voters at that time-what concerned them and will concern them over the next three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the fifth time that I have had the privilege to represent the Division of Forrest, and that after the most radical alteration to its boundaries in 30 years. In area, it is now almost equivalent to the South-West State electorates and includes a small part of the Upper Great Southern State electorate. It is far more urbanised than the old Forrest electorate. The city of Bunbury is a major regional centre and Forrest includes the greater part of the State's bauxite mining industry and timber industry as well as the coal industry. It is gratifying to know that not only have the electors in the farming areas given their support to the Liberal Party; so too have those in the timber industry areas and those in the Mandurah-Pinjarra region where so many employees engaged in the bauxite industry live. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, there is a grass roots conviction in non-metropolitan, wealth-producing areas that Liberal policies and basic philosophies will best bring about the development that alone creates a higher standard of living. I am more convinced than ever that the greatest continuing issue confronting both the Government and the Parliament over the next three years is the need to cut personal income tax and to cut Government spending to make this possible. This Government, over five years, has shown a real commitment to tax reduction and reform. Some 90 per cent of Australians pay tax at no more than the standard rate. Nobody can deny that he or she is not better off than would have been the case under the 1975 tax scales. Yet the people of Australia feel that we have not gone nearly far enough. This is the message that they have given, not just to the Fraser Government but also to this, the Thirty-second Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxation is a matter for grievance at many levels of our community. Those on higher incomes, who so often are the wealth creators of Australia, feel that our tax laws destroy intitiative. I invite honourable members to speak to accountants and to owners of small and medium-sized businesses. The message which comes back is that our taxation system kills incentive, that it is not possible to amass capital other than real estate and that this ensures that many small business enterprises stay small. Too many enterprising Australians are looking over their shoulders at the tax man, wondering whether it is really worth the trouble to expand their businesses. Some of those who fall foul of the Taxation Office are cynical tax avoiders who deserve what they get, but others may have found that they had to try to minimise their tax to stay in business. Let us not forget that a major group of tax avoiders is made up of the traditional little battlers, small tradesmen in business for themselves operating on a cash-down basis. Thus, the whole national debate on tax avoidance focuses on a symptom, not the real problem. It is not that this Government has been idle or unresponsive. In the 1979 Budget it increased the retention allowance for private companies to 70 per cent so that the accumulation of capital would be assisted. But more remains to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the question of the wage earner in the resource industries, the person who earns a large salary but perhaps living where he would not otherwise choose to live. Many such people feel that they are not getting a fair deal from a taxation system that does not take into account their necessarily high living costs. If they were not earning at a level sufficient to permit substantial savings within a few years, they would not be there at all. So we have to ensure that these workers in our wealth producing industries are not in any way disadvantaged by the taxation system in the context of attempts to achieve tax equity. Indeed, much of the industrial unrest that afflicts the resource industries can be attributed to taxation. If workers go on strike for a couple of weeks, they will not be earning but at the year's end their big tax bill will be less. So, tax reduction could be a powerful incentive for industrial sanity. Also, it would be a disincentive for these wage earners to support extravagant wage claims, whether in the form of more cash or shorter hours. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the Australian public generally hold a hostile attitude towards strikes and strikers. Yet, when the Queensland miners went on strike against the threat of paying extra tax on their housing, the Morgan Gallup poll showed that they had substantial public approval for their stand. This was simply because they were not on strike against their employers for yet higher wages or shorter hours; they were on strike against the tax man. As such, they commanded respect. The Government had my sympathy in that dispute; it was not a simple problem. But I reiterate that lower personal income tax, free from any imposts on such necessities as company-subsidised housing in remote areas, is a sure step to a healthy resources industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We come then to a far larger group who feel that they are paying too much tax-namely, the average wage earner, particularly if he has a non-working wife and children. The best and surest way that the Federal Government can make life easier for these families is by taking less money out of their pay packets. What is more, they know that. They appreciate that there are no simple answers to job creation and that there is no alternative to paying more for petrol; but they do expect us to lower personal tax. Again, it is quite untrue to say we have neglected these people. If we pursued big spending, big deficit fiscal policies, we would soon unleash an inflation that would drastically reduce their living standards. This year the Government increased the spouse rebate to give extra relief to the single income family. This was just one step. We must look again at proposals for income splitting, on the lines that the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) and the honourable member for Perth (Mr McLean) have suggested. We should proceed on the basis that the greatest priority is to lower tax, not provide more services. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of course one thing to talk about cutting taxes and another to point to the areas of spending that can be reduced. We have to look first at those areas that have grown so much in the last decade-social security, health and education. Ten years ago they amounted to 28 per cent of total outlays; now the figure is 46 per cent. Our guiding principle in the field of social security has to be allocation on the basis of need, and not on a universal basis. This will not be easy to achieve, as a great many middle income earners are sincerely convinced that they need certain benefits, particularly in the field of age pensions. For these people there has to be the basic trade-off of more disposable income against fewer benefits. If people are given more incentive to invest, through a reformed tax structure, they will not be so dependent on government assistance when they retire. I believe the family allowance should be directed towards the area of greatest need, by the tax mechanism or through indexation. It accounts for nearly a billion dollars. As I have said, the best way of helping the family is to lower the breadwinner's tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA> It is encouraging to see stirrings of changes in the health field. Duplication of expensive equipment and overstaffing in the hospital area consumed $1.7 billion of the last Budget in the total hospitals area. We must grasp the nettle and put an end to the injustice whereby the middle income and high income earners, uninsured, get free hospital treatment. Free medical care should be directed at the poor alone. Otherwise, it is a corruption of our society. In 1970-71, our universities received $108m; today the figure is $806m. Is the taxpayer getting full value? Is money going to 'mickey mouse' departments and 'soft option' studies, as well as to the teaching of essential technical and professional skills? Would the reintroduction of university fees be such an evil if at the same time the Government made scholarships available to academically gifted students from low income families? Those who have no real aptitude for our expensive system of higher education will have to pay for what is a privilege and not a right. I often think of a worker who lives perhaps in Wollongong and pays $5,000 in tax a year. Probably his children will follow in his footsteps and will have nowhere near the opportunity to go on to higher education as would the child of a highly paid lawyer. His $5,000 tax could be seen as a direct subsidy for the child of a wealthy family to participate in an academic career. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from these areas of big spending, we must look critically at other items and ask whether the taxpayers are getting value for money. A good hard look must be taken at Government instrumentalities. The Prices Justification Tribunal costs us $2m. Is it worth this, when it merely registers price increases? Is the Industrial Relations Bureau giving us a fair return for the $4.6m allocated to it in the last Budget? I mention these as examples of bodies that have attracted ideological hostility from different ends of the political spectrum. They should now be looked at in a strictly practical light to determine whether they are fulfilling their function and, if not, whether the tax dollar can be saved. I do not decry spending on culture and recreation, but I do not feel justified in squeezing the taxpayer in the funding of what may be called non-essentials. The Multicultural Broadcasting Service had an allocation of $21m, up $14m from 1979-80. The National Gallery budget went up $6.6m to $23m. Can we afford this? Certainly these areas have a far lower priority than reducing the tax burden on the Australian family. The same applies to our plans to spend more on sport. Voluntary activites must find their own funds. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes remaining to me I wish to say a few words about industrial relations. Certainly I do not claim to be an expert. Perhaps my comments might be interpreted as expressing a broad feeling that I get from most people in my electorate and with whom I come in contact. The current state of industrial relations is a disappointment to all of us. Ninety-five per cent of all Australians watch with horror as we rip ourselves apart in industrial conflict. The cost to the nation is immense and the end result could well be anarchy. The other 5 per cent are bent on destroying our social order. My greatest disappointment in the 8 years that I have been a member of this Parliament is to witness a steady deterioration of the situation and suffer the frustration of knowing that this Parliament is relatively powerless. How helpless one feels when people say: 'Why don't you do something about the unions', or 'This cannot go on; there must be a way to stop it?' It would appear that no end of patching up of industrial legislation in this Parliament or State parliaments has any effect. I am indebted to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) who is newly elected to this House. During his maiden speech, he laid bare the difficulties. He is a lawyer who has had a great deal of experience in the industrial field, mainly representing trade unions and trade union officials. If anyone wishes to understand why we are in this unholy mess today, I recommend that they read the speech of the honourable member for North Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly, the system we have inherited, patched up along the way, with its divisions between State and Federal responsibility simply cannot work and is not working. The honourable member for North Sydney clearly states why it is not working. I do not wish to canvass his remarks at this time; his speech is in Hansard for anyone who wishes to read it. I am sure that those in this land who have the responsibility of participating in industrial relations, whether they be employers, employees or governments realise we are on the short road to chaos. Something must be done. Industrial law, both State and Federal, is so complex that a few highly paid lawyers, a handful of bureaucrats, a few politicians and a few union officials are the only people who understand the law. I believe that over a period the whole system should be scrapped and replaced. The law should be clear, flexible and as simple as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Systems in other countries should be examined. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), in his brilliant maiden speech, suggested that the Swedish system had a lot to offer. He also advocated a complete change to our system. But how do we get to a position of change? Change is something that happens in this country at the slowest rate. For greater intellects than I have grappled with the problem and failed. Perhaps there should be a conference of people involved or interested in a complete change to the system; people of good will who genuinely wish to see improvements. For them to some up with recommendations and for the Government to act upon these recommendations there would have to be constitutional change. So be it. I know that that path is a rocky one but I am convinced that a more rational approach, even a revolutionary change, to dealing with industrial relations would be welcomed by the people of Australia. Therefore, I would flag constitutional change; it may not be very difficult to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> We are fortunate at this time to have a man of great experience and wisdom in politics as the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer to Mr Andrew Peacock. He has the opportunity, whatever his future success may be, to be remembered as a great Australian if he can guide this nation to a sane, rational, simple system of industrial relations. We are also fortunate to have in this House a man of great experience in industry relations as shadow Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer to Mr Bob Hawke. I am sure that he will approach this problem in a bipartisan manner and that with his assistance over the next few years, we will see industrial harmony within Australia. Whatever his future success may be, he also will be remembered as a great Australian by his participation in this endeavour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is 25 years since I became a member of this Parliament and I must say that I have never seen the place so dull and uninspiring as it is now. The Parliament is degenerating in almost every respect. It is ceasing to count compared with the way it used to count in bygone years. An atmosphere of rigor mortis prevails. This place is like a mausoleum. Months have gone by since the Parliament was opened by His Excellency the Governor-General, yet we are still wallowing away in this unobjective debate about the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's Speech. It gives us an opportunity to wax eloquent about favourite parochial parish pump matters, but the Parliament should be directing its attention to more worthwhile, idealistic and important things in respect of the well-being of this nation. I want to lodge a protest. I think that we are talking on and on about the Address-in-Reply because the Governor-General is out of the country or something like that. But it is not just this debate that I am complaining about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We came here several weeks ago obsessed with the understanding that the Government was about to transform the incidence of taxation in Australia. The Press was animated; the atmosphere was electric. Great changes were to be made. Of course, the whole thing turned out to be a damp squib. In other words, the Government had not worked out where it was going. It still knows and the whole community still knows that there will be a shortfall in revenue in the not too distant future-several years from now-because revenue from the oil parity pricing policy will drop by about $3,500m. We will have to get that revenue from somewhere. We were to get it from retail turnover taxes and all sorts of changes in the taxation system, but we still do not know where we are going in that respect. This whole place has become a farce. Many issues have been talked about tonight. Regrettably there is no legislation of any consequence before us. There is nothing which will transform the state of the nation, nothing that will redress the injustices being experienced by masses of people in this community. Here we have an aimless, unobjective, unanimated government. If I were sitting on the other side of the chamber I would be utterly ashamed. </PARA>
<PARA> The kind of thing that we should talk about tonight, I suppose, is the unbridled sellout of Australia's natural resources at bargain basement prices to the cheapest bidder. I do not want to develop that subject, but there is enormous scope for that. We have lost our national pride. People can drop in from any part of the world and scoop up the resources that we have and this Government is prepared to let them do it. No longer is there the national sense of decency that was typified by the late Rex Connor, who wanted to make us proud and to retrieve our national dignity. This afternoon we touched on the issue of the sellout of our national airline, Trans-Australia Airlines, and we might touch on it tonight. It is a disgrace that we are fattening it up for the kill like a Christmas turkey, turning it into a company so that the assets of the people of Australia can be sold off. We are causing people to believe that because it will be run by some exploitative entrepreneur it will be run better and more beneficially for the Australian people. That is nonsense and crap. We ought to be indignant about the fact that the sale of TAA is even proposed to a self-respecting constituency. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose we ought to be talking about the private sector's exploitation of our resources. Things are just getting stupidly out of perspective in that respect. Money is being poured into the country and we will have a disjointed economy as a result. Already the chickens are coming home to roost in that regard. We cannot have a laissez-faire approach to these things without consequences accruing. The other day I noted that because coal mining development has occurred in such large measure at Gladstone the authorities there are putting a demand on this Government for an extra $120m for infrastructure. Soon an extra 17,000 houses will be required for an aluminium works at Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> How many reservoirs, sewage treatment works, schools, roads and bridges will be required? No one has even stopped to calculate it properly. This Government does not even get around to mentioning the topic, let alone grappling with the $30,000m blow-out of resource development that is contemplated. None of us want to be negative about these things. Obviously there will be some beneficial fallout. Obviously the public sector will be stimulated and so on. We are saying that there will be great casualties. People will be shifted into communities where there will be no schools or child minding centres and none of the other facilities which should be considered the right of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the failure of the Government to take a conciliatory attitude to reduced working hours. When I was a very young man I served as a union organiser. I am talking about the immediate post-war period. Honourable members are not asking, 'Which war', are they? They would not be indecent enough to say that. In about 1946, as a union organiser, I was sent out to factories in relation to the 40-hour working week campaign to talk in favour of the union attitude. In 1981 I hear precisely the same arguments that were put up about the 40-hour working week. I was told then that the whole country was going to collapse and we would never be able to hold our heads high among the nations of the world-how stupid. I remember that at that time I used to quote Henry Ford. He used to say: 'Look, I have introduced the 40-hour week in my factories and productivity has risen as a result. I have had sensible consultation with my workers and they are responding'. That was the dialogue that took place at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot be silly and one ought not to regard other people as silly. We all know that it could be deleterious if we pressed a button and had a 35-hour working week tomorrow. But similarly we know that there is some sense in reducing the working week in some industries from 40 hours to 39 hours and may be over a five year period reducing the working week by 5 hours. We know that already some industries in which the proceeds of profits are unprecedently high can afford the introduction of the 35-hour working week right now. The Government and the trade union movement ought not be so stupidly dogmatic. I think the trade union movement is far more tolerant and reasonable in the situation than this absurd apology for a government appears to be. </PARA>

<PARA> I have heard very little from honourable members opposite about the problems of housing or about the increasing difficulty that young people especially are experiencing in this area. I must not be tempted to get involved in that subject. I have been sickened by the great debate about the disallowance of the Public Service Arbitrator's decisions in respect of the redeployment and retirement benefits legislation. I was absolutely sickened to see the way in which this Government has recklessly abandoned the principles of arbitration which it requires all other authorities to uphold and to which it constantly advocates the trade movement adhere. </PARA>
<PARA> I have outlined some of the situations that prevail in the Parliament today. As I said, I am not going to talk about any of those things. However, I am going to make some deference to and acknowledgement of a very important matter-the International Year of Disabled Persons. I think every honourable member ought to make some contribution to this issue this year. Disabled people are seeking equal rights and the assistance required for them to become integrated into the community. At present they claim they are treated as second class citizens and that the services that are available to them are fragmented, paternalistic and old fashioned. There is at times a general hostility or a denigrating attitude against the disabled. The Bulletin poll of middle managers of 30 community subgroups shows that 34 per cent prefer not to socialise with blind people, 41 per cent prefer not to socialise with paraplegics and 59 per cent prefer not to socialise with spastics. As the programmers of the poll state:</PARA>
<PARA> It augurs ill for the future if such strategically placed groups as middle managers with their potential to become top managers are found to be hanging on to counter-productive values and attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA>There is much to be done to moderate such attitudes and to encourage more realistic attitudes in the community. Our task is to enable the disabled to have access to the same dimensions of life as those who do not suffer disabilities. There are great problems about physical access. The purpose or objective of planning policy should be to create a system of access which would allow people to get into, move around and use the facilities of buildings unaided. The lack of co-ordination of planning has led to some idiotic situations and solutions such as the provision of toilets for the disabled within a building but no provision for access to the building. Lifts in buildings have buttons out of reach of people in wheelchairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that some experiments have been carried out in which people have simulated the dilemma of the disabled for so many hours. One can imagine the problem of trying to press the button of a lift when one cannot reach it. Blind people cannot tell what floor a lift stops at. What an enormous and incredible dilemma to be in. The cost of converting old buildings to cater for the needs of the disabled is very great. Imagine trying to convert this building to cater for the needs of the disabled. That would be a great task indeed. But relatively speaking, the cost of providing facilities for the disabled in new buildings is negligible. The lack of co-ordination in the planning process has resulted even in the International Year of Disabled Persons in the erection of private and public buildings without the most rudimentary facilities for the disabled. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a lot of discontent already. I do not want to politicise the situation. But I notice that Mr Storer, the Chairman of the Australian Capital Territory Planning and Co-ordination Committee for the International Year of Disabled Persons, resigned in protest over the lack of government funding. An article in the Australian of 3 March 1981 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Storer said in Canbera yesterday that matters had been made worse by a $30,000 fund cut last December to the Canberra branch of the Australian Council of Social Services. </PARA>
<PARA>The article also states:</PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales committee appears to have come out best in funding for the International Year with the State Government allocating $750,000 in addition to normal funding for disabled projects. </PARA>
<PARA>Sufficient to say-I have many more quotes but I will not have time to use them-that there is a great concern about funding in the States generally and certainly in the Australian Capital Territory. I notice that the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped has declared the number of existing rehabilitation programs as totally inadequate. The full number of physically handicapped people in Australia is not known. I take this opportunity to seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables which have been provided by the Parliamentary Library. They relate to the 1977-78 Australian health survey of chronic conditions and they provide a great deal of information about the incidence of disabilities under a number of headings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) and I thank the House. At least 9.9 per cent of the population over two years of age suffer from a chronic condition that limits their activities in some way. The 1976 census found that there were 645,520 people handicapped in one, two or three ways. The tables that I have incorporated in Hansard give a great deal of information in that respect. Of those handicapped people, 53,409 were children under 14 years. The census figures probably understate the actual number of handicapped people because of the definition difficulties and the reluctance of some parents to state in a public document that their children are disabled. One can understand that reluctance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By comparison, the Repatriation Commission pays repatriation pensions to 178,471 disabled war veterans. Let us compare that figure with the figure that I have mentioned of some 645,520 disabled people. Since 1973-74 the number of recipients of this pension has dropped at a rate of 4,000 a year. I want to make the point that there seems to be a good case for a special Ministry to be established and to be responsible for disabled people. Such a Ministry would be dealing with a lot more people than the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) would ever deal with. Such a Ministry would deal with many more people than, say, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) would ever deal with. I am not advocating that we should dispose of either of those important ministries, but it is apparent that at the moment there are great unresolved problems which need a lot of attention. </PARA>

This is backed up by the startling results of a recent government survey showing that 45 per cent of Australians suffer from some chronic health condition. I believe that that in itself justifies the establishment of a Ministry. I believe that we need a secretariat. We need an authority that is well informed, which will assist the States and all the agencies and instrumentalities, co-ordinate their work and bring them together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the clock is against me, I will conclude my remarks by saying that I have conducted surveys in my own region. I am able to provide to this Government a great range of suggestions which could and should be implemented in this Inernational Year of Disabled Persons, to assist people to live a full life and to alleviate a great deal of suffering, distress and anxiety, especially the enormous anxiety which is encountered by any parent who has the misforture and the responsibility of caring for a disadvantaged or handicapped child. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to commend the previous speaker in the debate, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) for taking the opportunity provided by this debate to raise the plight of the disabled. I do not agree with everything that the United Nations does. I often wonder whether the United Nations ever achieves many of those things for which it was originally established. However, some of these special years do have the effect of drawing to the attention of the population the plight of certain groups in our community. The plight of the disabled comes more closely to home, as far as I am concerned, than I am prepared to talk about in this place. It is only when one finds that suddenly within one's home or family there is somebody who is not as fortunate as people regarded as normal that one recognises that those who are disabled have particular problems, and, even more significantly at times, that those who care for the disabled are burdened with extra responsibilities that most people would not even recognise exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the Address-in-Reply debate to the speech by the Governor-General in opening the Thirty-second Parliament. As the previous speaker said, the Governor-General's Speech was delivered on 25 November 1980, some four months ago. That Speech was delivered following the general election held on 18 October 1980, which is even further back. Nevertheless, on the day that the Governor-General's Speech was delivered in another place where all members assembled, Australia was presented with a blueprint of what the Government proposes to do in the next three years. That blueprint, in conjunction with the policy speech delivered by the then Prime Minister who, as the result of the election continued as the Prime Minister, can safely be regarded by Australians as an indication of what will happen in this country. Of course, not everything will be achieved, because in three years changes can arise which make it impossible to achieve that which is planned. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I move on to a more general area, I want to refer briefly to my electorate, Fadden, which runs from the southern outskirts of Brisbane to the New South Wales border and out to the Great Dividing Range. In terms of growth, the Fadden electorate is growing as fast as any electorate in Australia. The population of my electorate just grows and grows. The growth is mainly due to young families setting up home. Whether they come from other parts of Queensland or from the southern States matters little. Those people are providing the Australia of tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> One aspect worth noting is that there are more children in my electorate than in any other electorate in Australia. When an electorate has great numbers of children and young people, the demands on educational institutions and facilities are great. I want to make particular reference to these demands, and make a plea to the Federal Government to recognise that it is all happening in the States of Western Australia and Queensland. There must be a redirection of some of the funds to those States where the growth is actually taking place. It is a sad fact of life that the population-I refer specifically to the population of children in the schools-is diminishing in the other four States. It is only in Queensland and Western Australia that an actual growth factor exists. For this reason alone, we require a redirection of the available finance. I speak also of the plight of secondary school children. In my electorate this year a new high school opened. In my electorate last year a new high school opened. This seems to be a regular pattern. It is true to say that we are all born equal but we are not born equally gifted. </PARA>

It might teach him to be a little more careful in this place and not to make this sort of statement. I was speaking about the fact that we are all born equal but not necessarily equally gifted. I talk in terms of opportunities which are available to those young students in secondary schools when they leave those schools next year or in the next few years. We live in a society which requires more and more skills, and for those who have been trained in skills which are not in demand, to find work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a world in which inflation is rife-it is appropriate to point out that, at this stage, compared with most countries Australia can hold its head high in terms of its performance in respect of inflation-the cost of everything becomes dearer and dearer. Australia is highly industrialised and the cost of labour is a big factor. One thing to which we all aspire regardless on which side of this Parliament we sit is full employment with employment opportunities for all. In recent years we have seen the cost of labour spiralling and many established and long term businesses go to the wall. These days the only way for industry to survive is for it to change with the times. As a result of these labour costs we have seen many businesses resort to the introduction of machinery to replace the worker. More often than not, the machines that replace the worker require operators. Often that work in itself requires skill. What I am trying to say--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Armitage" NAMEID="Q07">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last time the honourable member interjected we almost had to have his remark deleted from Hansard. I ask him just to sit down and to learn something. Because machines are taking the place of workers in this era of technology does not mean that job opportunities disappear. It means that a new emphasis is created. There is a new need for the teaching skills. There is no escaping the fact that it becomes more difficult for the totally unskilled to obtain employment. For this reason this Government, which has been in power for the last 5 1/2 years, has placed so much emphasis on retraining people and also training people to ensure that they play a useful role in the work force. Over the last five years, half a million Australians have been trained. On 25 November last year, the Governor-General told us that, during this current year, a quarter of a million Australians will receive assistance of some kind in their preparation for entry or return to the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to refer also to a concept which is called the 35-hour week. We cannot dispute the fact-neither can we escape from it-that the world is very different today when compared with the time that certain other changes took place. Inflation has been a part of the Western world for almost a decade. People look back on the good old days when Sir Billy McMahon was Prime Minister, when inflation was at a level of 3 per cent or 4 per cent. They remember also the time when the Labor Party was in government and the level of inflation rose as high as 16 per cent, 17 per cent or 18 per cent. People have not forgotten those days, as much as honourable members opposite would like to wipe them off the slate. It is a fact of life that inflation is an unfortunate part of the Western world. That in itself has caused a spiralling in the cost of labour and has contributed directly to the unemployment which exists right across the world today. I honestly believe with all my heart that when Opposition members stand up in this place and fight every inch of the way to lessen the working contribution by the average Australian, they are not doing any Australian a good turn. A 40-hour working week is not an unreasonable contribution but the Australian Labor Party does not understand that, when the working week is reduced to 35 hours, it has the effect of increasing costs of employment by anything up to an additional 21 per cent or 22 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I return now to what I had to say when I commenced my speech. My electorate is about the fastest growing electorate in Australia. Wherever one drives in the electorate of Fadden one hears the sound of hammers being used in the construction of new homes. Young people are attempting to buy new homes. There is no escaping the fact that if we were to increase the cost of labour-home building is very labour intensive-by anything up to 20 per cent that great dream of owning one's own home which has existed since the 1940s in this country and has been attainable by the average Australian will disappear further into the background. The Labor Party's proposal to reduce working hours to 35 hours a week will mean an imposition of a further 20 per cent on the cost of home construction. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that honourable members opposite have not given this matter any thought. This afternoon we heard Dr Theophanous-or whatever his funny name is-talk about how he worked in the railways, how he did this and that and how he never got up. He got up in this place and now has an equal opportunity to shape the destiny of this nation from that side of the House. I hope he stays there forever because of some of the funny frangled ideas which he had brought to this place--</PARA>

When we compare the golden opportunities which exist in this country with those which exist in many other countries, when people say Australia is a lucky country it is not a joke. Australia is so far ahead of most other countries that we would be foolish to allow the destruction of that which gives the many Australians described by the honourable member for Hughes an opportunity to succeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the few moments still available to me I want to make reference to an aspect which is creeping into this nation and which causes me great concern. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you also come from Queensland, you would know of the growth that we are experiencing in our great State. I read recently that the Victorian Development Corporation strongly criticised the rivalry between the States in their attempts to attract overseas investment. That Corporation attacked Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. It has been suggested that consideration is being given to taking giant slices off the allocation of Federal funds to Western Australia and Queensland. The Treasurer (Mr Howard), who is sitting at the table, is shaking his head in a way which indicates that that is not so. </PARA>

I know there are a lot of distinguished Victorians in this place, including the Prime Minister. Victoria might be going through a downturn, but in years gone the smaller States had to pay far more for products manufactured in this country and protected by tariffs just to give the southern people job opportunities. We have never argued against that. We believe that job opportunities should be made available to everyone in Australia. Just because we are on the move and the other States are slipping back, do not take a knife to us because Queensland and Western Australia are the States where the golden egg is presently being laid. I can assure honourable members that the growth in the population of the young people there will enable us to provide for the aged pensioners of the other States in the years ahead. Do not kill the goose that is laying the golden egg; rather, wish those two States the best of luck in the future. We will happily help those people in their retirement after they have transferred all their assets to places in the sunshine State.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Commonwealth to provide loan guarantees for the purchase by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd of new front line Boeing aircraft to operate on the trunk network. The introduction of this Bill at this stage is required to enable Ansett to finalise the financial arrangements for the purchase of the new generation aircraft. The first aircraft is due for delivery in June 1981. The most significant initiative of this new, competitive era in domestic aviation is the decision by Ansett on the one hand and Trans-Australia Airlines on the other to acquire different front line wide-body aircraft. Trans-Australia Airlines was the first to announce its choice of a wide-bodied-type jet and orders have now been placed for five of the A300B Airbus, a proven and well accepted twin-engined aircraft which will carry approximately 270 passengers. Trans-Australia Airlines will also modify those of its DC9 aircraft which it is to retain to redesign the interiors to be compatible with its B727 aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> Ansett, on the other hand, chose completely to restructure its fleet, and on 17 March last year announced its intention to acquire 21 Boeing aircraft, comprising five yet to be built B767 wide-body twin jets with a capacity of approximately 210 passengers; 12 B737-200 advanced twin jets; and four long range B727-200 tri jets. These aircraft are the subject of the Bill now before the House. Expenditure to acquire these aircraft and associated equipment is over $800m. Completion of delivery of the aircraft on order will not be until around 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday I announced that the Government has taken an in-principle decision to establish TAA as a public company and has decided to establish an independent fare tribunal. The details are being considered. The Government proposes to bring before the House during this session an airlines agreement Bill which takes into account the Government's decisions on TAA and the tribunal. The Government has also decided to establish an inquiry into whether deregulation is a desirable long term objective. Having in mind that there will be new wide-bodied equipment and a new era of competition between the airlines over this period, with an inevitable impact upon the way in which our domestic airline system will operate in the 1980s, it is logical that time will be needed to make a full assessment of the impact of these changes. In any event, the last of the new aircraft will be delivered in 1984. Therefore, the inquiry will be asked to report within five years so that it can examine the question of deregulation against the experience of our two-airline system using this new equipment. I am confident that both TAA and Ansett will co-operate with the Government in these policy initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Deliveries of aircraft in respect of which loans will be guaranteed under this legislation will commence shortly, with the first of Ansett's B737s and TAA's A300 aircraft arriving in June. The second and third A300s will be introduced in mid-September and early November. At the same time, Ansett will progressively introduce the B727s between June and September, and the B737s between June 1981 and June 1982. The proposed delivery date of the first two B767 aircraft is November 1982. The Bill currently before the House is to introduce legislation to provide for the Treasurer, on behalf of the Commonwealth to furnish guarantees in respect of borrowings by wholly-owned subsidiary of Ansett Transport Industries for the purchase of Ansett's 21 new Boeings and associated equipment and spares. Clause 4 empowers the Treasurer to guarantee the repayment of moneys borrowed, not exceeding $US490m, for the purchase of the aircraft and for related interest on that borrowing. Clause 5 provides that the Treasurer must be satisfied that the terms and conditions of the borrowing are reasonable, and provides that appropriate security be afforded to the Commonwealth. The Australian National Airlines Act already authorises the Treasurer to provide guarantees for TAA's borrowings. This Bill is consistent with the principle of according similar treatment in respect of guarantees to the airlines. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proceedings of this afternoon and this evening have made a farce of this Parliament. Again we see the Parliament being treated with utter contempt by those opposite. Legislation to be introduced in this House this afternoon was delayed until a very late hour to prevent the media and the Parliament from having access to it and, most importantly of all, to prevent the Opposition having an opportunity to respond to initiatives the Government wished to establish. That is what is involved here. Because of the bloodletting opposite, because of the chicanery that has occurred and because of the preference that must be given to Ansett Airlines of Australia, the Parliament is being abused. We are being denied the forms of Standing Orders. We are being denied the opportunity to put a case against the Government's initiatives. Until such time as this Government and this Minister start to treat this Parliament with some proper form of responsibility the Government and the Minister will lapse into chaos, the bloodletting will continue and this Government will fall into utter disrepute. It is already a scandal-ridden Government. We have already seen a series of record resignations and sackings of Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Here we have this way of circumventing the Standing Orders, of devising a way to circumvent and block the Opposition's opportunity to respond to important initiatives. If there are to be inquiries, if those inquiries are to be properly staffed and if they are to be given full access to and the full support of the resources of government it could well be that those on this side of the House would support them. But no opportunity has been given for that assurance. Instead, we have this thief in the night exercise again from the same Minister who, in fact, has practised it repeatedly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some honourable members have asked me to expand upon a proposition that I advanced earlier on the question of unemployed, unfinancial union members being able to retain the right to participate in union activities and unions being prohibited from recouping unpaid fees for periods when members were unemployed. I have given a great deal of consideration to this very important matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to expand upon that proposition for the benefit of the honourable member. I recognise that the law will have to be changed. I have a quite precise proposal for the amendment of section 148 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to enable that to take place. I would have thought that unions would volunteer to accept their responsibility to allow unemployed former members to participate in union activities so that they can make their voices heard when they find that as a result of union activities they have lost their jobs and are out of work. I believe that this is a very responsible proposal which ought to be encouraged. I am sure that with the support of honourable members opposite for this initiative a very worthwhile reform can take place. As I mentioned, it is a simple matter to amend section 148 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. That section states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All . . . dues payable to an organisation by any member thereof under its rules may, insofar as they are owing for any period of membership subsequent to the registration of the organisation, be sued for and recovered in the name of the organisation . . . as debts due to the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> That section could be amended to control the union practice of forcing back payment of dues once a formerly unemployed member regains employment. I believe that the most relevant way in which to enable the unemployed to be protected would be to insert a provision to the effect that an unfinancial member of an organisation, in the event of being or becoming unemployed, shall not cease to be a member only by reason of the fact that he fails to pay union subscriptions as they become due while being unemployed. I believe that a simple amendment in that form would require the automatic amendment of union rules. This would mean that while being unfinancial and therefore, presumably, with limited rights in relation to voting, a person's membership would be protected by the Act until he again became a fully financial member. This protection could be extended further by a provision stating that if an unemployed member regains employment in the same industry or an industry relevant to the union to which he belongs, he shall not be liable for back payment of union subscriptions for the period during which he was unemployed or an unfinancial member. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst proper amendments may be made to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to facilitate this initiative, I believe that it would be appropriate for unions, in their own interests, to amend their own rules and to invite members who would otherwise have forfeited their membership through their inability to pay their union dues once more to take up their membership in an active way. There are very good and sufficient reasons why that should happen. Unions would be able to tend more responsibly to the needs of their members and to take up in a much more genuine way the rights of the unemployed if their unemployed members could still participate in their activities, still have a role and still be able to exercise a right to elect union officials. But as I have said on previous occasions, I believe that there will be many objections to this proposal because union officials are frightened that their former members who have become unemployed as a result of the activities of the unions will seek retribution from them for pursuing such policies. They would seek retribution from officers involved in the 35-hour week campaign which is likely to cost so many unionists in this country their jobs. This is a very responsible proposal and one which I believe should be supported fully by members on both sides of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The adjournment debate gives me an opportunity tonight to welcome the publication of the new monthly magazine, The Australian Pensioner, the first two editions of which I have read. I compliment the editor on its high standard. For far too long the problems of pensioners have been ignored. The social security system is at present under review by the Department of Social Security and it is vital that The Australian Pensioner should allow contributors to monitor that review. The social philosophy of this coalition government is that people must help themselves and this will most surely mean reductions in pensions and welfare payments. I am most pleased that pensioners will now have a voice of their own and I wish the new publication, which is the official organ of the Combined Pensioners Association of Victoria, a long and prosperous future. At last it will be possible for pensioners to exert pressure on government through the columns of their own newspaper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Statisticians have projected that in the next 20 years there will be a 47 per cent increase in the aged population, including females over 60 years. The future will bring an increase in the percentage of people over 65 years from 9 per cent in 1976 to 10 per cent in 2001. That level will rise to 14 per cent in the early years of the twenty-first century. Future governments will ignore such a pressure group at their peril. The present coalition government has chosen to penalise many pensioners by the severe imposition of penny-pinching regulations and the pensioners will not forget this harsh treatment at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken in this House on an earlier occasion about the loss of fringe benefits which many pensioners have suffered as a result of harsh regulations. Another example of harsh regulation has just been brought to my attention by one of my constituents, who is a retired single lady. She is a telephone subscriber who has chosen to have a silent telephone number. The reason for her decision was that, in common with many other females whose names and addresses are printed in the telephone directory, she had been harassed by a number of obscene telephone calls. She has now been asked by Telecom to pay a $10 annual fee for the privilege of not having her name and address printed in the telephone directory. I appreciate that my constituent could have changed her telephone number and asked for only her initials to be printed. However, this does not alter the fact that Telecom is seeking a fee from those who do not wish to have their personal details printed in the telephone directory. This is a totally unreasonable imposition. I am informed that Telecom must handle 1.6 million calls a year from people who seek information about telephone subscribers whose numbers are not listed. I am also informed that each call costs 60c, which represents a total cost to Telecom of $960,000 per annum. Surely this cost should be treated as part of the normal running costs of Telecom and not be a charge against those telephone subscribers who have deliberately chosen not to go public. Retired people, many of whom are pensioners, require a telephone as an essential part of their total security and it is iniquitious that those with silent numbers should suffer this additional expense, in addition to the increasing living costs which retired people incur as a result of government actions. I call on Telecom to reconsider the imposition of this most unreasonable fee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At Albury on 17 February the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Chipp, launched a book called River In Danger, written by Mr E. E. Clarke. It is an important book because it draws attention to the deterioration of river water quality in the Murray basin system, the degradation of the river's environment and ecology and to the need to ensure the preservation of the river for future generations. Mr Clarke, in his book, correctly draws attention to the irresponsibility of developing irrigation schemes without adequate drainage, particularly as, despite past experience, this is still occurring in vast tracts of land. This is so particularly in New South Wales, with the issuing of new water licences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot, of course, agree with everything in Mr Clarke's book. One would not expect to agree with everything. For instance, Mr Clarke suggests that the Hume Weir should never have been built. In a world in which we are desperately short of food and fibre, with vast tracts of land being swallowed up by urban development and with soil erosion occurring to devastating effect in so many countries, we in Australia have a real responsibility to see that agriculture, recreation and the preservation of our resources can live together in harmony. However, I congratulate Mr Clarke on his book. It is an invaluable reference and a significant contribution to our heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I wish to direct my remarks to those made by Senator Chipp at the launching. On this occasion the Senator's hysterical hyperbole was issued in terms which I believe are a grave reflection on many members on both sides of this Parliament. I have an editorial opinion which was published in the Border Morning Mail of Wednesday, 18 February, which is headed 'MPs gutless says Chipp'. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chipp attacked petty-minded bureaucrats and gutless, small-minded politicians who, looking at the Murray River, only cared about the 'fast buck'. </PARA>
<PARA>. . .</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chipp attacked the many district politicians, local government officials and prominent citizens who sent apologies for their absence from the book-launching. </PARA>
<PARA> 'We ought to be ashamed of that number of apologies,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Where are the so-called men and women of this area who get up in council and in Parliament and write letters to the paper about their beloved Murray River?</PARA>
<PARA> 'Where are the people who talk about the need for conservation, about the salinity problem-where the hell are they this morning?'</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot speak for others, but the invitation I received for the book launching arrived two weeks before the launching. I think anyone would recognise the difficulties people have, with electoral commitments so far in advance, to respond to an invitation out of their own electorate two weeks in advance. I make no apologies because of this misunderstanding. I ask: Why did Senator Chipp who made those statements at that book launching forget to mention the fact that this was the first such type of function he had attended in his 20 years in Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> I decided to have some research done in relation to the input that members of this Parliament have made in relation to River Murray problems over the last few years. I came up with some very interesting statistics. I did some research in relation to the comments that have been made by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles) and, of course, some comments I have made. In my hand I hold a copy of the many speeches made and questions asked in this Parliament by the honourable member for Hawker alone. I think we should recognise that in my research I also discovered that in the 20 years in which Senator Chipp has been in Parliament as a Liberal Minister, as a shadow Minister, as an independent member of this House and now as a senator, he has made only one 2 1/2-minute speech in which he has mentioned water or the significance of it to Australia and that speech was made on 23 May 1980 when speaking on the Western Australia Agreement (Ord River Irrigation) Bill. The Murray River has become an emotive issue and a popular cause and our man for all seasons, the good Senator, has found it worthy of his attention for the moment. I only hope that he continues to do so and assist many members of this House in trying to solve some of the massive problems that face water users in trying to protect the environment and one of our most valuable resources. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is having problems in making decisions on the airlines too. In the field of health, the Government is unable to decide the major issues despite a three month debate in Cabinet. So, this week, it produced a very small decision involving simply a change in the regulations. But, in the desert of non decision making, we must appreciate these small virtues. The Government decided to remove from the medical benefits schedule a number of cosmetic operations. Face lifts, eyelid reductions, breast augmentation and certain hair transplants are the major ones eliminated. In principle the Opposition supports the decision made by the Government. I accept the point made by the Minister that there has been distinct exploitation in this field and it is arguable whether the community should subsidise these particular forms of cosmetic procedures. I think there are certain problems which the Minister has not fully recognised. Perhaps he does not fully appreciate the ability of the medical profession to get around any regulation. In some ways I fear that some of the openings offered by these changes of schedules may add costs to cover, for example, the seeking of psychiatric reasons for these procedures. Nevertheless, we support in principle the decisions that have been made by the Government. In addition, the Government has done its best to be particularly selective and to take out those cosmetic procedures which are most clearly open to abuse and which most clearly the community should not underwrite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, one point I raise-I hope the Minister will make some response-is that these decisions were announced on 31 March and came into effect on the next day, 1 April. That poses problems for the many people who had already made arrangements for a cosmetic operation in the next few weeks in the belief that they were covered by Commonwealth benefits and their insurance payments but who are now no longer covered for these planned operations. In some cases, deposits have already been paid; in other cases procedures have already been entered into and are not yet finished. I must say that the Minister has behaved rather like the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and has treated these people as tax avoiders as, at the time of the announcement, only one day's warning was given. </PARA>

It seems to me to be a reasonable proposition that, if we are to cancel these operations, at least there should be a greater period of warning than has been given, rather than to deprive the people of the benefits they expected and have paid for, after a warning of only one day. I ask the Minister to consider a period of between eight to 12 weeks in which these operations can be run down. That does not seem to me to be an unreasonable proposal in terms of the way that this decision has been made.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier tonight the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) drew the attention of the House to media reports indicating that legionnaires disease bacterium had been isolated in a section of the air conditioning unit serving the suite of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He questioned the possibility of this organism being in other sections of the air-conditioning plant servicing Parliament House. I have made inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In July 1980 a check was made on the air conditioning system servicing the Prime Minister's area. Following that check a report in August 1980 from the National Biological Standards Laboratory stated that a total of 16 bacteria and two mould colonies were obtained from the sample and that the level of organisms detected was very low. Those organisms detected were not considered to be harmful. The report suggested that it may be valuable to repeat the tests when filters were next changed to obtain more representative samples. As a result, further tests were taken and Dr Cavanagh of the Fairfield Hospital reported that legionella, a causative agent of legionaires disease, had been isolated from a water sample taken on 8 January 1981 from the standby cooling tower in the Prime Minister's suite. Mr L. F. Dodson, the Director of the National Biological Standards Laboratory reported:</PARA>
<PARA> It does not necessarily follow that the air contaminated by passage through the cooling tower would enter the Prime Minister's suite. This would require a combination of wind and air movements which would permit cooling tower air, exhausted near the base of the building, to enter the air inlets on the roof. </PARA>
<PARA>In his report, Dr Cavanagh of Fairfield Hospital said that he was of the opinion that cases of legionnaires disease in Australia do not reflect the occurrence of the organism in air conditioning cooling towers or in reticulated water supplies. However he said it was clearly desirable that the organism should be eliminated from the cooling towers. </PARA>
<PARA> The action Dr Cavanagh suggested in that report including more frequent cleaning and chemical treatment, has been taken. Regular testing of all units in the building is continuing and in fact tests were taken this morning. The result is not yet available. I am informed that when the previous samples were taken on 8 January 1981 the sample taken from the emergency water cooling tower servicing the Prime Minister's suite was the only one found to contain legionella when the samples were tested. The action recommended by the health authorities was taken forthwith, and will be continued. I will report any change to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am certain that we are all relieved to hear that the only bug in the suite of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is that which appears to be under control. I raise tonight the question of the processing of Australian raw materials in Australia. I draw the attention of the House to a statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) and the Acting Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Sinclair) earlier in the week relating to a report on the potential for further processing of mineral sands in Australia. The report was prepared by the Commonwealth-State Standing Joint Study Group on Raw Materials Processing, a body of officials representing the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory. The group was established to encourage the further processing in Australia of Australian raw materials and to encourage co-operation between the Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the short time available to me I point out that I hope that this organisation, which has stated that excellent prospects exist for the expansion of further processing operations in Australia and notes that such expansion would result in considerable national benefits, will take on board the suggestion I made in this place a little while ago that there may be some benefit in applying a raw materials export tax as some kind of incentive to people to further process Australian raw materials in Australia. The report states that good opportunities exist for private investment in mineral sands processing in Australia. It puts forward a number of proposals for consideration by governments dealing with encouragement of and incentives for the establishment of additional processing plants in this country. I hope that this approach can be extended to many other Australian raw materials. I am glad that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is present. I hope that he also will take on board the proposition that there could be an added incentive in providing a tax disadvantage for those people who simply export our raw materials without processing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 12 December 1980:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is it a fact that Australia is one of the very few countries in the world where there are no signs in languages other than English in our international airports.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Are there any signs in languages other than English on Australian national and international carriers regarding safety procedures and/or seat belt signs; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Do any provisions exist whereby demonstrations of safety procedures on our national and international carriers can be explained in languages other than English.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Is it also a fact that on Australia's roads there are no signs in languages other than English.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Has his attention been drawn to the fact that more than a quarter of the Australian population are recent immigrants; if so, does the lack of signs in languages other than English put the life of many Australians in jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) What provisions exist for rectifying these apparent deficiencies on air, land and sea transport.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1326" SPEAKER="Hunt The Hon R.J.D." NAMEID="GH4" PARTY="NCP" ELECTORATE="PORT ADELAIDE">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. My Department proposes to display some multi-lingual signs, together with advice of the availability of the direct line telephone contact system of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Interpreter Service at International Airports. These matters are currently being finalised by the Regional Offices of my Department. Also, the internationally recognised symbols that depict facilities such as restaurants, toilets, car parking, reception areas and others are used at Australian airports.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. However, the latest safety cards are presented pictorially without the need for words. Qantas safety cards are in this format and other airlines are moving in the same direction. Experience overseas has shown that this is more effective than attempting to provide information in numerous languages.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There are no provisions requiring demonstrations of safety procedures to be explained in more than one language. The necessity for this has been considered and only one airline, Qantas, was found to be carrying sufficient numbers of non-English speaking passengers to warrant the use of other than English. In the case of Qantas, announcements are made in the language of any significant group of passengers asking them to pay attention to the safety demonstration and to study the safety card. Languages used by Qantas include Greek, Italian, German, Dutch, French, Serbo-Croat and Japanese.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) It is true that there are no signs in languages other than English on Australian roads and the difficulty this may present for persons who do not read English is recognised. However, to cover even the major languages would be a large undertaking. The intention, therefore, is to tackle this problem by changing over to a symbolic system of signs, which will also assist persons who have difficulty in reading generally.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1977, the Australian Transport Advisory Council endorsed a Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices which is published as an Australian Standard (AS1742). A comprehensive review of the manual is being undertaken by the responsible committee of the Standards Association of Australia, on which the Commonwealth is represented.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) and (6) I am aware of the large proportion of recent immigrants in the Australian population and the possible problems which lack of signs in appropriate languages could cause.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the provision of internationally recognised symbols such as these in airports or those to be provided on roads is the only viable solution to this problem.</PARA>
<PARA> As already mentioned, provision of these signs is either a fact or under active consideration.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ML7">Mr McVeigh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment tabled its progress report on Australian marine science on 22 May 1980. The report was examined by the Government and a response tabled in the Senate on 4 December 1980 by Senator Durack in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Science and Technology.</PARA>
<PARA> For the benefit of the honourable member, the Government's response to each of the Senate Committee's twelve recommendations may be summarised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>SUMMARY RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Committee Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Government accept responsibility for a significant expansion of marine science. This will involve definition of a national policy, establishment of priorities, development of appropriate programs and allocation of adequate funds and resources. Any national plan developed as an expression of policy should, as far as possible, build on existing institutions and facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>Government Action</PARA>
<PARA> The Government introduced a program of marine science research grants in the 1979-80 Budget following advice from the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) that greater attention be paid to the marine sciences and technologies in Australia, and following recommended priority areas for research by ASTEC's Standing Committee-the Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee (AMSTAC). The Government decided recently that the Antarctic Division of the Department of Science and Technology would be developed as a Centre of Excellence in Southern Ocean marine biology.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government substantially increased its allocations for marine research grants and its funding for the Australian Institute of Marine Science in the 1980-81 Budget following a further report from the ASTEC Standing Committee on marine sciences and technologies.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government decided to establish a $25 million Marine Science Complex in Hobart, the CSIRO Marine Laboratories (including a multipurpose oceanographic research vessel to be used as a National Vessel) to house the new Divisions of oceanography and fisheries.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Committee Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Prime Minister extended the terms of reference of AMSTAC to include advice on the formulation and execution of national policy with respect to marine sciences and technologies, as required to meet the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA>Government Action</PARA>
<PARA> The powers and functions of ASTEC as set out in the Australian Science and Technology Council Act 1978 are wide enough to include the purport of the recommendation by the Senate Committee. AMSTAC is a Standing Committee of ASTEC and it would not be necessary to widen its terms of reference in the way recommended by the Senate Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Committee Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Government adopt as a medium-term aim, the progressive building up of a fleet of civilian ocean going marine research vessels to reach a total of at least 6 by 1986.</PARA>
<PARA>Government Action</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has agreed to the high priority recommendation of ASTEC that CSIRO acquire an oceanographic research vessel. The current fisheries research program of CSIRO is being carried out by a chartered stern trawler. AMSTAC is currently reviewing Australia's need for oceangoing vessels including fisheries vessels and a vessel equipped to undertake research in the marine geosciences and the Senate Committee proposals will be fully considered in this review. The provision of an Australian Antarctic ship with significant marine research capabilities is also being considered.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Committee Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Government move as rapidly as possible towards declaration of an Exclusive Economic Zone for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Government Action</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has this matter under close scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Committee Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The Government examine at once the probable requirement for a second or even third blue-water vessel, within the framework of the overall national need for marine research, with a view to drawing up a medium-term plan for research vessel acquisition, funding and operation.</PARA>
<PARA>Government Action</PARA>
<PARA> See comment on Recommendation 3.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Committee Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 6. The Minister for Science and the Environment explore the possibility of arranging short-term hire of overseas research vessels, as an interim measure, until such time as Australia is able to fully deploy her own marine research fleet.</PARA>
<PARA>Government Action</PARA>
<PARA> See comments on Recommendation 3.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Committee Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The Government explore the possibility of deploying Commonwealth ships, such as navigation aid servicing vessels or Antarctic supply vessels, for marine research purposes, during the time they are not being used for their primary purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>Government Action</PARA>
<PARA> See comments on Recommendation 3.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Committee Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 8. The Minister for Science and the Environment aggregate in the first instance all the marine activities of CSIRO into one institute.</PARA>
<PARA>Government Action</PARA>
<PARA> The Executive of CSIRO recently addressed the general question raised by the Senate Committee and has decided that Oceanography will be a Division as part of the Institute of Physical Sciences, and Fisheries Research a Division as part of the Institute of Biological Resources. Oceanography has strong links with atmospheric and fluid sciences and fisheries with biological resources management. The placement of the Divisions in their respective Institutes will strengthen these ties. To preserve strong links between Fisheries and Oceanography the two Divisions will be located together to form the CSIRO Marine Laboratories in Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Committee Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 9. The Minister for Science and the Environment explore the application of technology other than shipborne equipment in marine science. Such technology could include remote fixed or free sensors, satellites, and aircraft including airships.</PARA>
<PARA>Government Action</PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts this Recommendation. The Senate Committee's proposals are consistent with the Government's policy of a balanced development of Australian marine science within the constraints of budgetary considerations and priorities established on the advice of ASTEC, and are being examined.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Committee Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 10. The Minister for Science and the Environment require the council of the Australian Institute of Marine Science to determine and report on the facilities and funding required to develop the function of collecting and disseminating information relating to marine science on a national scale. This determination should consider at least 3 levels of operation:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the compilation and maintenance of a register of marine research being conducted throughout Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the establishment and maintenance of an inventory of available marine science data;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the establishment and operation of a national computerised marine science data network.</PARA>
<PARA>Government Action</PARA>
<PARA> Collecting and disseminating marine science information on a national scale is a matter upon which the Government has sought advice and which AMSTAC has under consideration. In view, however, of a recent decision that the Australian Institute of Marine Science focus its attention on research on the Great Barrier Reef, it is not appropriate for that body to undertake the task of developing a national marine science information system.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Committee Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 11. The Minister for Science and the Environment review the marine taxonomic effort of the Australian Biological Resources Survey with a view to strengthening its work in the marine area and giving adequate support to the taxonomic studies which are now essential for proper management of the Australian Fishing Zone. The review should include examination of the need for co-ordination with state taxonomic authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>Government Action</PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts this recommendation. The Australian Biological Resources Study provides a mechanism for co-ordinating national taxonomic efforts. Considering overall needs, the ABRS to date has devoted the larger part of its resources to terrestrial biota. This need for taxonomic knowledge of terrestrial biota is not diminished by an increased need for such knowledge of the marine flora and fauna.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Committee Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 12. The Prime Minister direct AMSTAC to investigate and report on the place of university marine research stations, with a view to upgrading the support given to their operation.</PARA>
<PARA>Government Action</PARA>
<PARA> Parent institutions of the Great Barrier Reef Island Research Stations are eligible to apply for Commonwealth marine research and development grants (see also comments on Recommendation 1).</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Yes. Recommendation 4 does recommend such a course of action.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. No. See the above summary statement.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) In its report the Bureau of Transport Economics has published one cost benefit ratio for the recommended route-that is, along the present alignment.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr Malcolm Fraser</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There is mounting evidence that the school system is not adequately meeting the needs of all young people, especially those who are not academically inclined. The Schools Commission, in its recent report: 'Schooling for 15 and 16 Year Olds', criticised the preoccupation of secondary schools with preparation for tertiary study and drew attention to the situation in which many students experience a curriculum unsuited to their needs or interests, and from which they gain little of a positive nature. It is a fact that a significant number of young Australians who leave school each year do not have an adequate preparation for the world of work and face considerable difficulty in making a successful transition to employment, within a reasonable period.</PARA>
<PARA> It was largely for these reasons that the Government decided in January of this year to examine as a matter of urgency further ways of increasing the opportunities available for under 18-year-olds in education, training and employment. I wrote, at the time, to each Premier asking them to consider ways of substantially increasing the capacity and range of suitable courses in secondary schools and TAFE institutions, particularly for potential early school leavers and of improving the retention rates in full-time education.</PARA>
<PARA> (2 and (3) The Government has sought and obtained the co-operation of the States in the current Review. The matter was discussed at the recent meeting of the Australian Education Council.</PARA>
<PARA> There are no simple answers to what is a complex problem. Any changes to existing arrangements will be effected carefully and in co-operation with the authorities responsible for administering education systems when the current examination is completed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In pilot tests leading up to the 1981 Census of Population and Housing, very little concern was expressed by the general public over the need to record individual names on the census schedule.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Under the Census and Statistics Act 1905 persons are required to supply names on the census forms. The reasons for this are:</PARA>
<PARA> census collectors need to obtain names so that if it is necessary to call back to seek further information on missing data, they will have a reference point for their inquiries;</PARA>
<PARA> during processing, information on individuals is used to compile data on families, and in two family households names are needed for this purpose; and</PARA>
<PARA> a survey is run immediately after the census to check on the completeness of coverage of persons. Names are necessary to check whether everyone in the households selected in this survey was included on census forms.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The ABS is concerned that people may mistakenly believe that information from the Census will be recorded and filed under their names. Assurances have already been given that names will not be transferred to computer records and that census forms will be destroyed as soon as processing is completed.</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Census is to gather statistical information and the legal obligation on people to answer census questions is accompanied by strict measures to ensure the confidentiality of the information provided. The Government believes that it would be inconsistent with that purpose and with that guarantee of confidentiality to retain information on identified persons or households.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) It is considered that removal of the requirement to supply names would have a serious effect on the quality of the data collected. Because of the importance of producing reliable data from the Census, and in view of the safeguards adopted to protect the confidentiality of individual information, the Government does not consider it necessary to amend the Census and Statistics Act to remove the requirement to supply names.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Assuring the public that identified information will not be retained or divulged is only one aspect of the public awareness campaign planned by the ABS for the 1981 Census. The campaign also aims to inform the community of the importance of the Census; the uses to which the information will be put; the availability of assistance in completing the form; and the procedures available if people do not want their form to be seen by other members of the household or the collector.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) There are no specific plans at present to extend similar treatment to invalid pensions. This is a matter for possible Budget consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Single persons in receipt of sheltered employment allowances may be in receipt of non-allowance income (including any earnings from sheltered employment) of $20 a week before their allowance is reduced under the prevailing income test. For married couples, combined non-allowance income must exceed $34.50 before allowance is reduced. Above these amounts allowance is tapered away by 50 cents for each $1 of non-pension income. A concession from income of $6 a week is also allowed for each dependent child.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The purpose of the taper in the income test is to provide incentives for those in receipt of pensions and allowances to supplement assistance provided by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Under current arrangements, some pension or allowance remains payable until non-pension/allowance income exceeds $148.20 a week (single persons) and $248.10 (married couples). These limits are increased where the pensioner/allowee has dependent children. These limits rise automatically each May and November by virtue of the automatic indexation provisions applying to pensions.</PARA>
<PARA> Unlike most other pensioners, recipients of sheltered employment allowances (and invalid pensioners under age pension age) enjoy the benefit of their payments being non-taxable.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There are no specific plans at present to (a) extend eligibility for an income-test-free pension to invalid pensioners suffering from cerebral palsy, or to (b) raise the limits on earnings ('free areas') of $20 a week (single person) or $34.50 a week (married couples) before allowances are reduced for disabled persons in sheltered employment. These are matters for possible Budget consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> As with most other pensions invalid pensions and sheltered employment allowances are paid subject to an income test in order to concentrate assistance on those most in need.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, encouragement is provided for pensioners and sheltered employment allowees to supplement assistance from the Government by the withdrawal of only 50c of pension or allowance for each $1 of private income above the free areas.</PARA>
<PARA> Under current arrangements some pension or allowance remains payable until non-pension income exceeds $148.20 a week (for a single pensioner) and $248.10 a week (for married couples). These limits are increased by $26 a week for each dependent child, and rise automatically each May and November by virtue of the automatic indexation provisions applying to pensions.</PARA>
<PARA> Recipients of sheltered employment allowance are already advantaged compared to some other pensioner categories because their allowances are not subject to personal income tax. A similar provision applies to invalid pensions paid to persons under age pension age.</PARA>
<PARA> Sheltered employment allowees also receive an income-test-free incentive allowance of $5 a week in lieu of supplementary assistance which is subject to a strict income test.</PARA>
<PARA> They are also eligible for pensioner fringe benefits on a more liberal basis than other pensioners. Fringe benefit eligibility ceases when their weekly non-allowance income reaches $68 for a single pensioner and $73 for a pensioner couple, as compared with $40 and $68 for other pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government is concerned that, though there are many individual groups of disabled persons, the goals of 'full participation and equality' set by the United Nations, should be achieved for all disabled people.</PARA>
<PARA> Through a national publicity campaign and community awareness program the Government is identifying measures which can contribute to the welfare and independence of all those people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is playing its part, not only in providing the overall co-ordination of the year's activities, but within almost every portfolio particular emphasis is being placed upon projects and programs which will assist in providing for disabled people the same opportunities, choicies and personal dignity available to the rest of the community. Activities range over a wide spectrum, from developing skills of disabled people to the modification of buildings to facilitate access.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As these insurers are operating outside the provisions of the National Health Act, I do not have figures on the number of persons who have cover with them. Indications are, however, that the impact of commercial health insurers has been very small.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The commercial insurers, by virtue of the conditions imposed on persons wishing to take out such insurance, would mainly attract low risk persons. If a large number of persons withdrew from traditional health insurance to take out cover with the commercial insurers, or for any other reason, the principle of community rating would be weakened. This could lead to higher health insurance contribution rates for those remaining in traditional health insurance. Availability of commercial insurance is only one factor affecting an individual's decision to drop traditional health insurance. To date, commercial insurers have had no discernible effect on health insurance contributions.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As these insurers are operating outside the legislation administered by my Department, I have no regulatory mechanisms for controlling their activities.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Commonwealth's Insurance Act 1973, administered by the Insurance Commissioner, enables the Commonwealth to exercise controls relating to the financial viability of authorised insurance companies but it does not provide for any control over classes of business undertaking or over premium rates.</PARA>
