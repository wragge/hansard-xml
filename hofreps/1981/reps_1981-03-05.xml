As to the other part of the matter, the honourable gentleman knows quite well the standing rules in relation to security matters of that kind. I think he would know quite well also that any operations of the United States would be declared to the Australian Government and consequently agreed to by the Australian Government. I have been given no information of any breach. That is a rule that has applied to successive governments, not just to one government. I have not been advised of any breach of that rule at any time. If I can give any additional information to the honourable gentleman, I certainly will make it available to him.

In view of the current visit to the United States of America by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will the Prime Minister assure the Parliament that this Government will take no action to condone, endorse or encourage in any way the growing United States involvement in the civil war in El Salvador where American arms are being used by the military dictatorship in a most brutal manner to crush the aspirations of a grossly deprived and repressed population? Will the Government take steps to ensure that it obtains objective advice on the true situation in El Salvador and does not rely on an American interpretation of the events as we did, to our sorrow, in Vietnam?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The honourable member asked a question about a serious matter indeed. I hope that all members of this House will try to look at the issues in El Salvador without prejudice and with a clear mind as to what is happening. Whatever one might say of the government of El Salvador-many people have views as to that and they are not necessarily particularly pleased with the nature of the government-I think it is also possible to have views, and important to have views, about the gun running to rebels inside El Salvador from Cuba or from communist sources which is deliberately designed to foment revolution of a very serious kind. I think it is also fair enough, whatever one might say about governments of the right with extreme views, to take the same kind of view of governments of the extreme left because there never has been any freedom in any communist country anywhere. I would have hoped that the honourable gentleman, in asking his question, would have a more balanced approach to it and would have paid recognition to the extreme danger to the South American continent of Cuba or other communist countries running guns into areas of difficulty or concern. Quite plainly, I believe that the United States is entirely right in seeking to cut off that source of disturbance, that source of revolution, from the South American continent.</PARA>

I know that his predecessor was as concerned as the honourable member about the availability of telecommunication services in the Gold Coast area. It has been a problem in recent times. I am told that the planning projections for the Gold Coast have been rising at an astronomic rate. The original projection for 1980-81 showed a 22.7 per cent increase on the 1979-80 figures. Indications are that the actual demand will be even greater than that. As a result there has been some delay in the provision of equipment for exchange capacity, junction and trunk circuits, and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also true that there has been some shortage of skilled tradesmen in both the lines and the technical fields. However, an additional 33 lines staff and 13 technical staff have been engaged this financial year. Whilst they will help to fill that training gap, unfortunately they are at the moment still relatively unskilled and they will require further training. I can assure the honourable gentleman that there is a very significant fund allocation for his area this year. Gross capital expenditure of $11.3m is designed to try to provide a range of equipment that will be used largely in that part of Queensland.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that some 64 units in New South Wales, 57 in Queensland and some in other States have been affected by the ban to which the honourable gentleman referred. The ban was imposed late last year as a result of concern apparently felt by members of the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association that the intention of the Government was that this inter-connect market, as they called it- that is all those things that plug into the main network system operated by Telecom-was to be taken away from the control and function of Telecom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's concern has been, firstly, to try to make sure that adequate funds are available within Telecom for the main network system. A moment ago the honourable member for McPherson canvassed the problems he has in one area, in part because of the inadequacy of basic equipment. There is no doubt that Telecom has a tremendous financial requirement to meet its prime obligation. The Government is concerned that, as far as possible, we should keep up to date with the technological advancements in the inter-connect market. We believe that there is a range of areas in which private enterprise can well assist Telecom in providing facilities to consumers and also helping to ensure an adequacy of funds within Telecom to meet its prime task.</PARA>
<PARA> I have had some discussions with the executive of the ATEA and I understand that a recommendation has gone forward to the union that the ban be lifted. I have not yet been advised whether the union has met and the ban has been lifted, but I understand that the recommendation has been made by the executive for it to do so. I commend the members of the executive for that recommendation. I believe it is very much in the interests of Telecom that, to the maximum, we allow it to get on with its prime task of providing telephonic communications to the Australian people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's position regarding the application of the oil levy to old and new oil has been stated frequently in the past. The decision taken last year regarding the status of the field mentioned by the honourable gentleman in his question was based upon a proper evaluation of the oil coming from that field. The decision was made in accordance with principles which, I think, are accepted by a wide number of people in the resources area as being correct in applying a policy which discriminates between new and old oil. I think the honourable gentleman will be aware that there is a degree of support on his side of the House for the principles that are applied in discriminating between what is categorised as new and old oil.</PARA></TALK.START>

Finally, is it a fact that the letter did arrive the following day and was a formal request in the terms of the discussion on budgetary needs which Mr Holcroft had with the Minister the day before, that it was nothing more than that, and that as a consequence of those discussions it would clearly have been understood by the Minister to be nothing more than that?</PARA>

Two of them were that two members of the inquiry had overseas commitments in, I think, the month of July. It is true that, as a result of the difficulties encountered by the committee, Mr Holcroft met with me on 13 November and expressed his concern-a concern of which I was aware. He formalised the position by writing to me on 14 November. I have tabled that letter and sought to incorporate it in Hansard. I said that I would represent the position to the Government, which I did. As I said yesterday, the Government resolved not to extend the reporting date because the Government wished to have that report available to it before legislation to approve the new airlines agreement was introduced into the Parliament this session.

All interested parties will be invited to present submissions and to take part in public hearings. Likewise, the Federal Opposition will be invited to participate. More specifically, last week, at the beginning of this parliamentary session, I invited the Opposition's spokesman on immigration matters to travel to the capital cities of Australia with me and to observe, to listen to and to participate if he wished in the discussions which will be held. Those discussions will be without commitment, on his part and mine, in terms of what we hear and what we express. I would hope that, at the end of that time, the recommendations which I would make and which he would make to the Opposition would be similar enough for us to return to the days when we did have a bipartisan policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe it is essential for Australia to have a bipartisan policy on immigration because the long term benefits that come from it, and the overall effects, are far more significant than can be achieved in a three year term of government. It is a refreshing change to find that the Opposition spokesman is willing to explore the possibility of a bipartisan policy. He must have read the three statements that came from the Opposition last year, as I did, and found them incomprehensible and conflicting. Whereas they might have created division within ethnic groups, they were so incomprehensible that in fact they did not. But I would welcome any prospect of a return to a bipartisan policy and I hope that the Opposition will join with us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can advise the House that, as reported, a Melbourne insurance broker by the name of Kinloch (Insurances) Pty Ltd, on its own petition was placed into liquidation last week. At this stage losses are estimated at $3m. It is not possible precisely to quantify the extent to which the failure will affect members of the insuring public. However, it is my understanding that most of the creditors of Kinloch are insurance companies. Of course this failure raises the question of legislation affecting insurance brokers. In that context I would like to say something about remarks that have been attributed to the New South Wales Minister for Consumer Affairs, Mr Einfeld, who has accused this Government of shilly-shallying on this subject. I made it very clear some time ago that any consideration of Federal Government legislation in this area ought to await the report of the Law Reform Commission on insurance, a reference that was given to the Law Reform Commission by the former Attorney-General some three or four years ago following consultations with my colleague the honourable member for Hawker, who takes a very deep and intelligent interest in insurance matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have thought that there was common sense in the Government's having a look at the report of the Law Reform Commission. We are doing that. We have asked the industry to let us know its views on the subject. We have also asked the State governments to let us know their views. It is very instructive to know that, as late as this morning, one of the governments which has not yet indicated its attitude to the Law Reform Commission recommendation is none other than Mr Einfeld's Government. In other words, Mr Einfeld's Government, in a passion to regulate any and every form of business activity in this country, has not sufficiently got its own act together in order to let us know its views.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government will give prompt consideration to the responses it receives from the industry on this subject. In saying that, let me sound a word of warning to those in this House and elsewhere who believe that one can solve these problems simply by piling more government regulation on top of existing regulation. It never will be possible by legislation and regulation to eliminate totally financial failure and economic fraud. We can minimise it, we can impose higher standards, but the idea that it can be eliminated totally by passing legislation and increasing the level of regulation is a pipe dream. Governments have to assess the cost to industry of additional regulation before they rush headlong into adding more Acts of parliament to the statute book.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Honourable members will recall that a decision has been made by the members of the Commonwealth to set aside the second Monday in March each year as a day on which the purpose and achievements of the Commonwealth would be duly marked. As this is the last sitting day before this year's Commonwealth Day I would like to take this opportunity to make a brief statement to that end. This year's Commonwealth Day is especially noteworthy for Australia in two respects. First, it marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Statute of Westminster an Act of the British Parliament which gave birth to the Commonwealth. Secondly, this year Australia will host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting for the first time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To an exceptional extent the history of the Commonwealth has been one of gradual evolution, marked by continuity and subtle modifications rather than abrupt change. But if there is one event which constitutes a decisive step in that evolution, it is surely the passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931. That event marked the decisive transition from Empire to Commonwealth. By establishing the principles of autonomy, equality and free association among members, it created the conditions for the Commonwealth to grow, diversify and establish a distinctive role in an era of far reaching changes. Thus as decolonisation proceeded with great rapidity, most of the newly independent countries found it natural and advantageous to become members of it. </PARA>
<PARA> A leading Australian authority on the Commonwealth, Professor Bruce Miller, has referred to the Statute as 'a masterpiece of ambiguity', and no doubt in legal and constitutional terms it was that. But politically it pointed clearly in one direction. The time when discussion of the Commonwealth tended to be clouded by rather dubious metaphysics and the search for the definition of an essence is long since past. The contemporary Commonwealth is confident enough to take itself for granted, to define itself in terms of what it does. Its form is flexible and accommodating; its bent is pragmatic and problem solving, its atmosphere is informal and unpolemical. </PARA>
<PARA> No one who is aware of the recent record of the Commonwealth would be foolish enough to characterise it as a 'talking shop' or an anachronism. At the two Heads of Government meetings I have attended we have agreed on an effective declaration against apartheid; we have made a substantial contribution to progress on a common fund for commodities; we have initiated an inquiry into factors inhibiting economic growth and structural change; and we have made a major contribution to the solution of conflict in Zimbabwe. We have shown a capacity to make progress on problems which major powers and global groupings have found intractable. Organisationally, we have initiated regional Commonwealth meetings of Asian and Pacific members. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the Statute of Westminster was passed the Commonwealth had six members. At this year's conference in Melbourne over 40 Heads of Government are expected to attend and it will be the most important international conference ever held in Australia. The agenda will cover a wide range of issues, but I anticipate that NorthSouth issues-that is, issues concerning relations between developed and developing countries-will be of prime importance. These issues are of vital importance for the future peace, stability and prosperity of the world. Yet at present it is proving difficult to have them addressed with the urgency and commitment which their seriousness demands. In these circumstances, the Melbourne Commonwealth meeting assumes a special significance. The composition of the meeting ensures that North-South questions will be seriously addressed there, in practical and constructive terms. I hope, therefore, that in September we shall seize the opportunity to contribute towards the removing of some of the roadblocks to a progress on these issues and help generate a momentum which will carry over to other forums. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, the Commonwealth is important to Australia as a link with our past. But it is even more important as an instrument which we, along with others, can use to help shape the future, to strengthen the forces of moderation, co-operation and good sense in a world which badly needs more of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Commonwealth Day was instituted at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Jamaica in 1975. Since that time, the Parliament has noted its passing in various ways. Only once, in 1978, has it been the subject of a full debate. On that occasion the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) expounded at great length on his own achievements at the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting held in Sydney. On this occasion, he has taken the opportunity to begin the massive promotion of the full Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting to be held in Melbourne later this year. On that occasion in 1978, I said that it was an anachronistic institution, a talk-shop of dubious value to Australia. On this occasion I remain firmly of that view. Indeed, everything that has happened in the intervening years has reinforced what I said then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, for the Prime Minister the Commonwealth provides a handy forum in which he can strut as an international statesman. It is made up of countries sufficiently large and numerous to give it an air of importance, but few of which are big enough to prevent him grabbing for the limelight. We can be sure that, with the conference in Australia, the Prime Minister will spare no effort to galvanise the increasingly grotesque multi-million dollar propaganda machine he has built up to polish his cult of personality. It is a big and expensive propaganda machine-but then it has a big and difficult task. We can expect to hear much more of this over the coming months. This curious buildup of the Commonwealth is also a diversion from the deep-rooted problems at home, a cover-up of the sell-out of Australia's resources which will gather pace this year, and the social, economic and political problems that will flow in the course of a desirable but inexpertly controlled development. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I last spoke in detail on the Commonwealth I acknowledge that it has achieved one notable success. It provided the institutional framework within which the settlement on Zimbabwe was negotiated. The rebellion in Rhodesia had dragged on for more than 10 years but, as time went by, the position of the Smith Government became untenable. The murderous war between the black guerrilla forces and the technically superior Rhodesian army meant much damage in lives lost, property destroyed and social stability shattered, that negotiations were inevitable. The Lusaka summit of the Commonwealth provided the forum. There is a quaint irony in the Prime Minister, an unregenerate apostle of cold war politics, acting as the mid-wife for the new nation state of a self-confessed marxist, Robert Mugabe. I have never hesitated to compliment the Prime Minister for his role in this matter and I do so again. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition recognises that on questions of apartheid the Prime Minister, whilst totally silent in 1971 at the time of the disruptive Springbok visit to Australia, has more recently sought to atone for his omissions then by expressing suitable objections to that policy. However, strictures bandied abroad do little to help our black Australians who are the victims of racist policies in Queensland and West Australia. Their welfare is neglected as a result of a cumulative real reduction of $307m by his Government over five years. Posturing about overseas neglect, intolerance, repression and so on is fine. The Prime Minister's indifference to his moral obligations to our black Australians is outrageous. The unkind would feel justified in claiming that when there is a cost or a tough act for him at home he surrenders the costless moral passion he spreads abroad. I fear, however, that this very success of the Commonwealth over Zimbabwe may have finally robbed it of any substantial raison d'etre. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Winston Churchill said, when Prime Minister during the early 1950s, that he had not become Prime Minister to preside over the dissolution of the British Empire. He was partly right. It has been the Commonwealth which has presided over the end of British rule in its last substantial colony-Zimbabwe. With hindsight it is now possible to see that the real function of the Commonwealth in the post-war era has been to provide one of the forums in which the withdrawal of Britain from its imperial role, especially in Africa, could be effected. The Commonwealth has been valuable for this purpose if for nothing else. Now that it has completed its major task, however, it is hard to see that the Commonwealth is any longer an institution to which we should ascribe much importance. </PARA>
<PARA> A political institution cannot be assessed separely from its roots: Whilst one can admire the resilience with which the British Empire merged in the British Commonwealth, and subsequently into the Commonwealth, its history has not changed. For the sole common link between the members of the Commonwealth is that they are all former British colonies. I do not for a moment deny that many of those colonies have received some benefits from this. Aspects of British culture-a genuine liberalism of a kind unknown to the proponents of Fraserism and a model of democratic representative government; all these and many other things-are inheritances well worth having. But is this enough to warrant designating the Commonwealth as a major focus of our diplomacy? Is the fact that heads of government of diverse ex-colonies can talk to each other in a common tongue sufficient to warrant the great emphasis placed on the Commonwealth by the Government? To me the answer is clearly no. </PARA>
<PARA> Developments within the various member states and a new generation of leaders mean that the nostalgia which can often unite those who have been bitter enemies in the past is no longer present. This is a new age, a new generation and a vastly different and more complex world than that of yesteryear when as schoolchildren we had to intone indoctrinating doggerel about the eternity of an empire already crumbling. We have been on our own for some time now-even though this Government seems reluctant to accept the fact. We are a sovereign nation despite the residual trappings of our colonial past. For the Australian Labor Party a truly independent foreign policy is a fundamental belief. Australia and Australians can achieve anything on their own. Whilst we have drawn much from our past, we feel no nostalgia for it, no hankering after past certainties and past securities. The Commonwealth has been an important part of our past: it has little relevance to our future. The Labor Party believes that a hard-headed assessment of our interests requires that we concentrate our efforts on our regional relationships. That is a much more difficult task, of course. </PARA>
<PARA> We lack a long history of close connections with countries such as Indonesia and Thailand; we do not have the same mutual understanding of a particular kind of political institution inherited from a common source; we have serious differences with some of our neighbours about their policies on human rights. But irrefutably and inescapably Australia's destiny is here in this region in which we live, and our destiny is enmeshed, not just with some of our regional neighbours who happen to be former British colonies. It is inextrictably locked in with all of them. That for me is the compelling reality and for a regional grouping-like the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting-to function without important regional nation states like Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and some of the island states of the South West Pacific, is an extraordinary deficiency and liability. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has said many times that we must look at the world as it is, not as we would like it to be. Whilst he might want to believe in the comfortable good fellowship of a Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, that is not the reality. Reality for Australia is the hard slog of building an independent self-reliant role for itself in the world and, above all, in our own region. We do not really mind very much about our membership of the Commonwealth. If it is seen as an occasional talking shop and perhaps as an administrator of some minor aid and research program it should not do too much harm. But as an international institution of major importance to Australia its day is done. Our duty is to look to the future-to an Australia confident in its ability to find its own way, prepared to learn from its mistakes, eager to build a new identity which it can truly call its own, and determined to stand on its own feet with a proper sense of national pride and aspiration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in supporting the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) concerning Commonwealth Day. As we have just heard from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), the Australian Labor Party sees the Commonwealth as an anachronism. Of course, that is especially so among those in the Labor Party who advocate the republican cause. That is why the Leader of the Opposition attempted today to diminish the significance of the Commonwealth of Nations and, therefore, Commonwealth Day.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Mr CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is trying to retain the support of the Left to maintain his position of leader. The Leader of the Opposition has shown by his remarks how he is completely out of touch with reality and how he misunderstands the nature and role of the Commonwealth of Nations. We should be thankful that he will never have an opportunity to formulate Australia's foreign policy as he will never be in a position to do so. His churlish comments reveal that he is mean and envious because Australia's standing in the Commonwealth of Nations has never been higher than it is under the leadership of the present Prime Minister. Other members of the Commonwealth recognise Australia's contribution. That is why they are pleased to have Australia host the next Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. It will be the first time in our history that we have hosted such a meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is appropriate that the second Monday in March each year should be set aside for recognition of the Commonwealth of Nations. As the Prime Minister indicated in his remarks, Commonwealth Day this year celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the enactment of the Statute of Westminster. That was an important event in the three fold transition from the British Empire to the British Commonwealth and through to today's Commonwealth of Nations. Progressive decolonisation has been an important aspect of this. It should be recognised that by and large British decolonisation was better handled than that of other imperial powers. This has made a major contribution towards the continuing relevance and success of the Commonwealth of Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to the arguments we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition, the Commonwealth of Nations is relevant because it gives each member country an equal right to share and participate in its discussions. It enhances the role of the Commonwealth and the understanding between the peoples of the countries who belong to it. It allows the gradual development of new links within the Commonwealth as well as the preservation of traditional links. Of course it is those traditional links which the Leader of the Opposition seeks to diminish and destroy. Over the years the Commonwealth has demonstrated its capacity as a forum to discuss international issues of common concern to its members. The Commonwealth has direct relevance and significance for Australia in that it provides a vital link between the old and the new world, the developed and the developing world and the rich and not so rich world. It is therefore appropriate that this year Australia will host the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting for the first time. That meeting will undoubtedly further enhance the role of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> An important aspect of the Commonwealth of Nations is the work of the Commonwealth Secretariat and its associated programs. Examples of those programs are the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation and the Commonwealth Youth Program, in which I have had particular interest. In the current financial year Australia has provided $644,000 towards the expenses of the Commonwealth Secretariat. This figure represents 9 per cent of the total cost of running that body. Australia has also provided $1.8m for the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation. This year the Australian Government has provided $131,000 for the Commonwealth Youth Program, compared with $120,000 last financial year. However, compared with our having met about 9 per cent of the costs of the Commonwealth Secretariat, that amount represents only about 7 per cent of the total cost of the Commonwealth Youth Program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Youth Program, apart from conducting various training programs, in recent years has conducted three conferences of significance. In May 1977 the first Meeting of Young Commonwealth Leaders was held in Ocho Rios in Jamaica and was attended by the former member for McMillan, Mr Barry Simon. In May 1979 the second Meeting of Young Commonwealth Leaders was held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, at which the Australian Government was represented by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack). In March 1979 the Commonwealth Countries Conference on Government Policy on Youth Affairs was held in Chandigarh, India, at which I had the privilege of leading the Australian delegation. Each of these meetings has played an important role in the continuing emphasis of the Commonwealth Youth Program on preparing young people in Commonwealth countries for participation in national decision-making and on enhancing the role of young leaders within the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The meetings have also made a worthwhile contribution to the development of policies relating to youth within member countries. They have therefore provided unique opportunities for young people of related nations to meet, discuss and decide together on matters of mutual concern to them and their countries. Such exchanges not only benefit those who participate in them but also advance the cause of peace and goodwill between members of the Commonwealth of Nations. The third Meeting of Young Commonwealth Leaders was scheduled to be held in Lusaka, Zambia, in May this year. In view of the value that has been derived from those previous meetings, I was concerned to learn recently that this conference had been cancelled by the Commonwealth Secretariat because of lack of funds. I think it is a serious matter when lack of funds causes the cancellation of such worthwhile events as these conferences have proved to be. </PARA>
<PARA> Undoubtedly, the Commonwealth Youth Program has experienced difficulties in the past with regard to mismanagement of programs and, to some degree, finances. However, under its new director, Peter Brooks, I believe these problems are being redressed. By way of example, I understand the administrative staff of the Commonwealth Youth Program has been reduced recently from 14 to six members. Its operation has been tightened up to make it a more effective and efficient unit. I therefore urge the present Government to increase its commitment to the Commonwealth Youth Program, at least to the extent that we contribute 9 per cent of the total budget of that program, as we do for the Commonwealth Secretariat. This may then allow to continue worthwhile events such as the conferences to which I have referred as well as the other significant programs which the Commonwealth Youth Program administers. The Commonwealth of Nations is made up largely of young countries whose populations contain a high proportion of young people. Therefore, I believe that it is important that there be continued opportunities for dialogue between the young people of the member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations. In conclusion, once again I urge the present Federal Government to increase its commitment to the Commonwealth Youth Program to enable its very worthwhile programs to continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I was interested in the comment of the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman) when he suggested that there was a republican flavour about my leader's speech. That is true. Let me place on record that the majority of member countries of the Commonwealth are republics. I cannot understand why the honourable gentleman felt that that was a problem. The other matter which interested me from a legal point of view was the reference in the speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to the Statute of Westminster. It is worthy of note that we do not have to look to the Statute of Westminster for the reason we moved from the status of colony to that of independence. If it were the reason, and the British Parliament were to repeal the Statute of Westminster, which was passed in 1931, we would be placed in the ridiculous situation of having our status returned to that of colony. That will never happen. It is important for us to develop an independent national image embracing the aspirations of our people. We would not accept the view that the British Parliament had power even to amend the Australian Constitution, much as it needs amending.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We make the point that too much emphasis should not be put on the Statute of Westminster. A problem is already developing in Canada on this subject. A wrangle is going on between the provincial governments and the Federal Government of Canada. The remarkable view is taken by the provinces of Canada that the Statute of Westminster is an international multilateral agreement which can be amended only with the consent of all who are party to it or affected by it, including Australia. I do not see that applying in practical terms, but it shows the extraordinary positions which can develop when emphasis is put on statutes that have long since lost their relevance. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to realise that nations are progressing and aspiring to independence. We are not the least of them. It is quite clear that this is a very difficult Statute even to refer to. Nobody really knows what it means. It relates to the political development that took place in Australia, as a nation fighting wars in a particular region and a nation that has long since cut the apron strings of the mother country. If we are to have a standing tribute to that development at the bicentenary in 1988 I suggest to the Government that the best birthday present we could give our nation would be a new constitution which left Australia's nationhood and sovereignty in no doubt. For over 120 years we have been deemed to be a collection of separate colonies. Conservative leaders and State Premiers who want to return to some sort of colonial status are certainly fragmenting and trying to destroy the Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor governments have always emphasised Australian content. It was a Labor Government that first appointed an Australian Governor-General-an admirable appointment. During the crisis of the Second World War John Curtin made it very clear that we had to turn our sights to the Americans as our allies, as they still are, to help us in that war against the Japanese. The records show that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom did not place such a high priority on the Pacific area during the war as we did. That is understandable because he was in another theatre of war. But can honourable members imagine the Australian people accepting the proposition that they could be saved at a later date when they were threatened with being overrun by an enemy? I doubt it very much. I repeat that we should not put too much emphasis on the Statute of Westminster. It did not stop a constitutional coup in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the rhetoric and policy, particularly of the Prime Minister, in the North-South dialogue. His behaviour is very much that of the big fish in the little pond. The establishment of a forum or a talking shop to discuss matters is not to be encouraged. But let us consider the posturing that is taking place in the North-South talks as against the progress that has been made. I submit that no progress has been made despite the many meetings that have been held. This is not only my opinion. It is also the opinion of the most influential leader in Africa, the President of Nigeria, where I understand, the Prime Minister will pay a visit shortly. President Shagari said:</PARA>
<PARA> Nigeria wants to see a new international economic order that would enable the developing countries to regain complete sovereignty over their natural resources, acquire appropriate technology, have easy access to capital funds and achieve an equitable distribution of the world resources. We would also like to see positive actions to back up the numerous pronouncements of the new international economic order so that the present ambivalent attitude of the developed nations is replaced by a genuine gesture of co-operation and understanding. </PARA>
<PARA>At meetings of heads of governments anywhere in the world it is normal to expect to deal with the haves and the have-nots. The poorer countries are calling for the reform of international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to make them more responsive to the desperate plight of those countries. This requires Australia to put its money where its mouth appears to be. When we were asked to do this recently by supporting the establishment of a food import finance facility, we not only did not support it but also we opposed it. We should not just adopt the posture, we should also support the solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst there is an advantage in heads of government talking together, let us note that many have little influence in our region. We have to get our governments and Ministers to concentrate on the problems of our region. Unless that is done we will face grave and serious consequences. Our responsibilities require regional initiatives to be taken in respect of Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Kampuchea and in the challenging Pacific Island states. We cannot go back to the old empire days and the old imperial institutions. They are no answer to the problems of the modern world. However, there is some value in the old institutions which came from the people and not from the rulers. I refer to the Magna Carta and all it stood for, the parliamentary system and what it means and the value in having Prime Ministers rather than Presidents. Prime Ministers are subject to parliamentary control so this shows clearly that there is more value in a Prime Minister. There is value in the parliamentary institution and I give it that credit. The great contribution of the British people to the world was a thing called democracy. It is wrong for Prime Ministers either in Australia or elsewhere to promote other regimes which are always afraid of the ballot box and will never use it. They are afraid of parliaments and never want to see them. They are afraid of the wishes of elected representatives who may remove a Prime Minister and put another in his place. Democracies are of no danger to the world but other regimes are. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the question of an effective declaration against apartheid. Again, that is commendable. Heads of government of the Commonwealth are always talking about the problems or weaknesses of countries not adhering to the principles of human rights as happens in a number of former Commonwealth countries. Last weekend Mr Moi, the leader of one of the Commonwealth countries, Kenya, appealed to fellow leaders for continued strong opposition to apartheid. Our Prime Minister is on record as saying that we are also opposed to apartheid. The words are commendable but the deeds are not there. Our trade with South Africa has doubled in the last three years. It has been suggested that at least tacit approval has been given for a trade delegation from Western Australia to visit South Africa. That delegation had a chance to visit the Prime Minister before it went. I hope that the Prime Minister clearly indicated that he did not approve of its going. I have not heard any comments about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that it is fine to hold meetings of heads of government. But we should not place too much emphasis on the likely results. Let us consider what has happened in the past. I attended a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Jamaica in 1975. Some countries were deploring the failure of countries such as Australia to take action. I listened to President Nyerere and President Kaunda clearly say that they were fed up with former Australian prime ministers, particularly those in the 1950s and the 1960s, telling them for 20 years that something would be done about the problems of Rhodesia. They said that nothing had happened. I remember President Nyerere of Tanzania saying to the British Prime Minister: 'I warn you that there will be warfare in Rhodesia within 10 weeks because we will not wait any longer'. That clearly signalled how President Nyerere saw the problems at that time. He was roundly criticising Australian prime ministers from 20 years earlier for doing nothing except espousing rhetoric. He was warning that there would be bloodshed in that area within a matter of weeks and saying, virtually, that it would have to be encouraged. One had to recognise, Nyerere said, that once Mozambique got its independence further pressure would be exerted. He was saying to everybody around the table: 'We have to get democracy into this area'. It has come belatedly, but it has come, and we ought to support Mugabe and others who have a big role to play in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me also decry some of the suggestions that flowed from the Jamaica conference, where we had the unpleasant experience of the leader of the Government of Singapore indicating to the United States that he did not altogether approve of the Labor Government of Australia. I do not approve of that sort of conduct and put that fact on record. I notice that in recent months he has been saying that he felt that Australians were perhaps not doing their best, that they were loafing on the job a bit. Let us face the fact that in this nation we have oppositions and we have governments. In Singapore they are a bit hard to see. That is one of the other matters that one must talk about. We see, in the region to our north a frantic desire to support the Chinese communist philosophy on what should be done to achieve peace and stability in Kampuchea, and the urging of continued recognition of the Pol Pot regime. </PARA>
<PARA> I place high value on certain statements made by Mr Trudeau as far back as 1975. When asked how he saw his country's position, as one that was alongside the United States, he gave an answer that was pretty graphic: 'It is like sleeping alongside an elephant'. That is the position. We find Prime Minister Trudeau clearly indicating an independent course of action in El Salvador and not encouraging a solution through armament. I commend Prime Minister Trudeau on such aspirations and expressions because it requires courage to say to the world: 'We want leaders to meet but we want them to discuss matters as a result of which something will be done. We do not want any such meeting to be just a forum'. </PARA>
<PARA> While we talk of security, let us bear in mind that the people who lost their lives at the last Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sydney were two council employees and a police officer. We should emphasise the need for security for our people. The heads of government were somewhat secure. If we embark upon world armament and its escalation, we will all be in danger. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I am pleased to announce that the Government has agreed on a series of wide-ranging decisions concerning the future of phosphate mining on Christmas Island, and the purchasing and distribution of phosphate rock for Australia's requirements. The changes to be implemented are among the most significant made since mining operations first began on the island. They have a key importance for Australian rural industries, as Christmas Island phosphate is a major component in superphosphate production throughout the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decisions followed long and careful consideration of the many conflicting issues involved, and extensive consultation in recent months between the governments of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. I have spoken to trade unions, manufacturers' and farmers' representatives, and the existing management organisations currently in charge of the industry. The changes that I will announce are to take effect from 1 July of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall that, under the existing structure, mining on Christmas Island is carried out by the British Phosphate Commissioners as managing agents for the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission. On behalf of Australian and New Zealand manufacturers of superphosphate, the BPC also purchases phosphate rock from various sources and ships it to both countries. The BPC was established by the Nauru Island Agreement 1919 between Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and each government appoints one commissioner. The Christmas Island Phosphate Commission was established in 1949 by the governments of Australia and New Zealand to control the phosphate mining operations on Christmas Island on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the report of the Sweetland inquiry into the viability of the Christmas Island phosphate industry was tabled in the Parliament. It made several recommendations for changing the present arrangements for the mining of phosphate rock on Christmas Island and for the purchasing and distribution of phosphate rock generally. Other recommendations on what might be called non-phosphate matters were dealt with by the Government last year and the decisions announced by the Minister for Home Affairs on 25 June 1980. Subsequently the commissioners of the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission and the Board of the British Phosphate Commissioners separately recommended to the governments of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom that the organisations be wound up. I wish to pay tribute to the BPC for its efforts over 61 years in providing Australia and New Zealand with assured supplies of phosphate. It has performed its task commendably in the interests of the three countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Mining on Christmas Island</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Australia and New Zealand have now agreed that the BPC will cease to be the managing agents as from 30 June 1981 or as soon as possible thereafter. The two governments are also seeking the concurrence of the United Kingdom Government to the BPC being wound up, its assets being realised, and the proceeds being divided among the three partner governments. The governments of Australia and New Zealand have also agreed that the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission should be wound up as soon as possible. This reflects some profound changes which the governments of Australia and New Zealand have agreed upon. New Zealand wishes to withdraw from the present arrangement and relinquish its right to extract phosphate and its related rights under the Christmas Island Agreement. It wishes, however, to retain the right to purchase up to half the total phosphate rock output from the island, at the same free-on-board price as that of the rock supplied to Australia. These and other changes which I shall mention shortly will be reflected in an entirely new Christmas Island agreement between the two countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The new mining operator on Christmas Island will be an organisation owned and controlled by the Australian Government, initially in the form of a government company. It will not be exempt from company tax. The question of establishing the company as a statutory corporation will be considered when the life of the operation has been more firmly established. I mention in this connection that the Government currently has under study a very recent report on the impact of the mining operation on the bird known as the Abbott's booby. The company will resemble other Commonwealth-owned companies and will be headed by a board of directors. In accordance with the relevant recommendation in the Sweetland report, one of the directors will be nominated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Another will be a farmers' representative. I hope to be able to announce the names of the directors shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> An appropriate firm of chartered accountants and management consultants will be retained to advise on the establishment of the company generally and the steps necessary to ensure a smooth transition from the present to the new institutional arrangements. The question of responsibility of municipal and similar type functions on the island and their operation and financing will also be examined in this context. Honourable members wil be aware that the net cost of administering Christmas Island is now met largely by the mining operator. It is also responsible for the provision of many services which on the mainland are the responsibility of local or State Governments. In the Government's view, it is timely that these arrangements be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the need to establish the new company quickly, it will begin life by replacing the BPC as the managing agents for the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission under the Christmas Island Agreement. I will be seeking parliamentary approval very shortly of the changes to the agreement to enable this to occur. These proposed amendments will be separate from the revision of the Christmas Island Agreement, to which I referred earlier, under which the new company will become responsible for the mining operation. </PARA>
<PARA>Purchasing and Shippng of Australian Phosphate Rock Requirements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Under the present arrangements, the British Phosphate Commissioners act as purchasing and shipping agents for the phosphate rock used by superphosphate manufacturers in Australia and New Zealand. The Government has decided that with the winding up of the BPC, Australian manufacturers will assume responsibility for the purchasing of phosphate rock, including rock from the traditional sources of Christmas Island and Nauru, and for shipping it to Australia. The manufacturers are now in the process of forming the Australian Phosphate Corporation to perform these functions. I understand that the manufacturers are in touch with relevant shipping organisations and maritime unions as to the future use of three Australian-crewed ships presently under charter to the BPC. These new arrangements will come into effect on 1 July 1981. I understand that New Zealand manufacturers are to take similar steps. </PARA>
<PARA>Stockpiles</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the question of future arrangements for the ownership and control of the phosphate rock stockpiles in Australia and New Zealand, which are at present owned by the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission. The governments of Australia and New Zealand have agreed that the stockpiles at manufacturers' plants in Australia and New Zealand as at 30 June 1981 should become the property of the respective governments, it being understood that the proportions will roughly reflect historical procurement patterns. The two governments have also agreed that it will be for each of them to determine the means and timing of the disposal of the stockpiles whilst aiming at the maximum possible uniformity of approach, and that any reduction in the stockpiles be undertaken in an orderly and non-disruptive manner, having regard to the viability of the mining operations. Detailed provisions on these matters will be negotiated with New Zealand and will be included in the new Christmas Island agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the phosphate rock stockpiles in Australia, it has been decided that ownership of them after 30 June will be retained by the Government. The stockpiles will be managed on the same lines as at present; that is, manufacturers will buy rock from the stockpiles at current market value at the time of sale, or they will replace what they buy. Detailed arrangements for the administration of the stockpiles are to be a subject of further consideration by the Government and an announcement will be made in due course. The Government does not, at this stage, see these arrangements as necessarily continuing indefinitely. The whole question of stockpile ownership and management will be looked at again no later than one year before mining on Christmas Island ceases. I should add that in taking this decision the Government was anxious not to make too many changes at once to the present arrangements affecting phosphate generally. </PARA>
<PARA>The Sweetland Report</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to the specific recommendations of the Sweetland report on phosphate matters. The Government has accepted the first two recommendations dealing with the continuation of the mining operation and shipping targets. Recommendations 3 to 6, dealing with new institutional arrangements, have been dealt with earlier in this statement. Recommendations 7 to 12, dealing with cost reductions in the mining operation, provision for reserves, markets in South East Asia, shipping operations, a review of the manning of the mining operation including more professional training for island employees, and improved domestic accommodation on the island, have been generally endorsed by the Government and will be referred to the new mining company for consideration and action as appropriate. I take this opportunity to express again the Government's debt to Mr Sweetland for his report. Honourable members will be aware that the Government has recently appointed Mr Sweetland to undertake the further task of looking at the long term future of Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The changes I have announced are significant. They directly affect many varied interests-the community of Christmas Island currently dependent upon the mining operations, the shippers, the seamen who transport the phosphate, the manufacturers, and the farmers who ultimately depend on the benefits of superphosphate. Difficult decisions of such major importance demand the most thorough consideration by the Government. I have visited Christmas Island to see the mining operations and have had face-to-face discussions with those parties on the island. On the Australian mainland I have met with all those parties who wished to express their point of view. I am now confident there will be a general acceptance amongst them of all those matters which the Government had power to determine and which I have announced. </PARA>
<PARA> In making these changes the Government has been glad to have been able to preserve our long-standing association with New Zealand on phosphate matters, although in a different form. In conclusion, I say on behalf of the Government to all parties concerned in the new arrangements, that we are confident that, given their goodwill and a desire to co-operate, the new procedures will work well and to the benefit of us all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Opposition welcomes the statement of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) on measures concerning the future of phosphate mining on Christmas Island and the measures in regard to the purchase and distribution of phosphate rock for Australia's requirements. The Opposition has a keen appreciation of the way in which the rural sector values its superphosphate and the dismay with which the rural sector regards the $12 a tonne bounty because of the way the price of superphosphate is inflating. For example, in addition to paying a $12 a tonne bounty, recently the price of superphosphate in New South Wales went up by $4.35 a tonne. The total bounty payment this year will be $46m which is less than last year. That is due mainly to the estimated levels of superphosphate usage. The National Farmers Federation is very concerned about the price of fertilisers and it has set up a task force to investigate all possible ways of containing their cost to Australia's farmers. It is very concerned about the skyrocketing fertiliser prices, particularly the price of nitrogenous fertilisers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all know that the Christmas Island deposit has a limited life, but we welcome the fact that the Duchess deposit in Queensland can again be producing by 1981-82. This will give the Australian producers a fairly long term supply of superphosphate. The price is the main thing. The only qualification the Opposition would like to put forward is that there is a need for more details on the amount of money involved in the stockpile and we need to be informed about the way it is financed now. I have been told that the value of the stockpile is about $80m. I am not saying that we oppose the new arrangements, which basically will involve a government organisation replacing the British Phosphate Commissioners. There would be a similar organisation for the fertiliser producers here. There has always been this linkage and I think the new arrangement is very sensible. By and large, it is one that the industry is used to. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister already has said in his statement that there are more announcements to be made. The Opposition would like more details so that we can understand the economics of the situation. Eventually the mining will cease and there will be a stockpile. It will be a revolving stockpile virtually being held in trust. I can see that at the end of it all, with escalating fertiliser prices, the Government may make a handsome profit. I make that qualification. I note also that the Minister has said the question of stockpile ownership will be looked at again no later than one year before mining at Christmas Island ceases. That is seven years off. </PARA>
<PARA> I visited Christmas Island in 1974 as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation which investigated endangered species on the Island, particularly the Abbott's booby bird, the Christmas Island frigatebird, a species of turtle and a type of pigeon. There was a range of species specific to that island. I never actually saw an Abbott's booby bird but I am assured there are 2,000 nesting pairs on the island. Christmas Island is a beautiful island and an ugly island. The part mined is totally devastated; it presents a moonscape. There is some vegitation trying to take hold but, particularly in the areas mined in the early days with horses and carts and shovels and buckets, there is virtually no phosphate left and there are simply limestone pinnacles. It presents a rather unique but ugly landscape. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members might be interested in some of the pearls of wisdom we gained while on the island with respect to the Abbott's booby bird. The bird nests on Christmas Island and nowhere else. It nests in emergent trees, trees above the existing tree cover. When we suggested to an engineer there that this species would be endangered if all the trees were lopped, his reply was that the birds would have to land somewhere. The Malaysians who work the deposits on the island also have a hard-hearted approach to the birds. There are rather large basaltic cliffs on the island; the birds hover in the updrafts and they are quite easy to knock on the head. Apparently they make good eating. As an old chook farmer, I suggested that we put some chickens on the island for eating purposes but they assured me that they far preferred to eat the native birds. I will give honourable members another pearl of wisdom that arose: As we had not seen an Abbott's booby bird, we asked what their habits were. We were told that they came to the island for a few months, nested and when the young birds could fly they took off. We were assured that they took off at an angle of about 45 degrees, went up to a height of 30,000 feet and were not seen for another nine months. When we pointed out their need for oxygen masks at that altitude, we were greeted with an attitude of some dismay. I am sure they do not go quite to 30,000 feet. Apart from that, they are truly unique. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see that the commission of inquiry into the viability of the Christmas Island phosphate industry-the Sweetland report-and the Minister's statement have both expressed concern with regard to endangered species on the island. The Minister has set out for honourable members the management structure that has prevailed and that which will prevail in the future. The Opposition believes that the new arrangements are sensible enough but it will insist that the new organisation owned and controlled by the Australian Government takes decisive steps to look after the people on the island in a less paternal way than has occurred in the past. The Sweetland report on the viability of the island's phosphate deposits brought these matters into full focus. Briefly, the report stated that Christmas Island is viable and there are at least eight years of rock on the island, even given the payment of workers at Australian Federal minimum award wage rates. We have allowed the British Phosphate Commissioners to discriminate against the workers for all the years of rock extraction in what is an Australian territory, in what is a multiracial society. The Sweetland report states that the British Phosphate Commissioners did not adapt to the passing of colonialism. Page 3 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The institutional framework within which Christmas Island operates is out-moded, discredited, and in many ways repugnant. Many of the Island's problems can be traced to this fact. The British Phosphate Commissioners (BPC) is an organisation which has not adapted quickly enough or willingly enough to the passing of the colonial era. Its shareholders, the governments of Britain, New Zealand and Australia have not required it to adapt to these changes. Responsibility ulti- mately rests with those governments and their servants. The structure of the Government Administration on the Island, and much of the law that is in force, is more appropriate to a colonial possession than it is to a remote multi-racial mining community on Australian territory. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to talk about the problems which have arisen because of parallel partnership between Australia and New Zealand. In his statement the Minister for Administrative Services said that the New Zealand Government has withdrawn from those arrangements and now seeks only to be involved in a commercial way. I think one needs to acknowledge the bargaining and the negotiations that must have gone on to secure that arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major point that the Sweetland report makes is that Christmas Island will have a competitive edge now and in the future and that demand for superphosphate is ensured. The recommendations in that report put forward measures that put beyond doubt the continued economic viability of the island while phosphate rock remains. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the 16 recommendations of the Sweetland report. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Christmas Island phosphate mining operations should be continued with the objective of extracting at minimum cost all mineable reserves of A grade material together with the maximum volume of B grade material that the Wash-Screen Plant will treat. Sufficient mineable reserves are available to ensure a life of eight years from the present time at the current rate of production. It is axiomatic that this operation be conducted in an environment of comparative wage justice. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The annual shipping target should be 1.4 million tonnes of rock to the specification required by Australian and New Zealand manufacturers, and 150,000 tonnes of bagged dust, or of rock to be crushed for bagged dust production, in Malayasia. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Australian Government should seek from the New Zealand Government an indication of New Zealand's willingness to continue to participate as a full partner in the Christmas Island operation. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. In consultation with the New Zealand Government, the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission (CIPC) should be reconstituted with a Board of five Commissioners. Two Commissioners with mining industry background should be appointed by the Australian and New Zealand Governments. Two should be nominated by the Australian and New Zealand fertiliser industry and the fifth should be nominated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The Australian Government should seek the agreement of the governments of the United Kingdom and New Zealand to terminate the appointment of the BPC as managing agents for the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. The reconstituted Christmas Island Phosphate Commission should create two divisions-Mining, and Distribution and Marketing-with a General Manager in charge of each division reporting directly to the Board. The General Manager Mining should be located on Christmas Island with a minimum staff based in Melbourne, to attend to corporate, purchasing and technical matters. The General Manager Distribution and Marketing should be based in Melbourne, and this Division should take over from the BPC those functions for which the CIPC has responsibility as principal under the Christmas Island Agreements No. 87, 1949, and No. 69, 1958; the Agreement between the CIPC and the BPC in relation to the Purchase and Distribution of Phosphate 1968; and the Phosphate Supply Agreement between the BPC, as managing agent for the CIPC, and the fertiliser manufacturers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Full consideration should be given by the Commission (CIPC) to proposals for the expenditure of capital on projects directed towards cost reductions, particularly those involving labour savings. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Christmas Island f.o.b. prices should include a provision for contribution to reserves during periods when world phosphate prices are high, which could be drawn upon when Christmas Island costs are greater than prices of phosphate rock from alternative sources. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. The CIPC Distribution and Marketing Division should actively pursue markets in South East Asia for by-products of the A grade rock, and the B and C grade rock which have been developed from research projects. The possibility of calcining C grade rock at a location in Malaysia should be thoroughly investigated, possibily in conjunction with ICI Malaysia and Chemical Company of Malaysia (CCM). </PARA>
<PARA> 10. Shipping operations should be planned, if possible, with the objective of minimising the 'ballast running' of vessels in the trade, and minimising the programming of vessels to load during the heavy weather seasons. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. (a) The manning of the Island operation should be reviewed as soon as possible. The review should be undertaken in consultation with the unions and it should, if necessary, be done with the assistance of experienced management consultants. Its objective should be to maximise efficiency of production. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) The CIPC should select from among the Island workforce employees those who are most likely to benefit from professional training. It should provide that training with a view to filling senior supervisory positions from among members of the Malay and Chinese communities on the Island, and remove any further discrimination between their remunerations and benefits and those of staff of European descent. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Unless the circumstances or requirements are exceptional, the following order of preference should apply in further recruitment to the Island's labour force:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) former Island workers and their children now resident on the mainland;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) other Australian citizens;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) citizens of Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. (a) A capital provision should be made to upgrade domestic accommodation in the older sections of the settlement, both for single men and families. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) As the labour force is reduced and single accommodation becomes surplus to requirements, these units should be modified and made available for married couples. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. The Christmas Island Industrial Relations Ordinance should be repealed as soon as possible, and the full provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act extended to cover Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. (a) Residents of Christmas Island should qualify for citizenship in exactly the same manner as foreign nationals who take up permanent residence on the Australian mainland. The provisions of the Citizenship Act 1948 as amended should be extended by ordinance to include Christmas Island. The citizenship provisions of the Christmas Island Act 1958-1973 should be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Migration Act should be extended by ordinance to include Christmas Island so that further movements of people to the Island from foreign countries can be regulated in the same manner as occurs on the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Island residents who would not yet have qualified for Australian citizenship under the provisions of the Citizenship Act as extended to Christmas Island, and whose positions become redundant as a consequence of any restructuring of the phosphate mining operation, should be accepted as eligible for permanent residence on the mainland, subject to health and character checks. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. (a) The cost of maintaining the Island Administration should be met by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) The objective of the Island Administration should be redefined to ensure the earliest possible removal of the administrative anomalies that distinguish Christmas Island from the Australian mainland. Christmas Island's social and political institutions should become progressively closer in form to those that characterise isolated mining communities on the mainland, and progressively less like those of a colonial possession. To this end, Article 8 (1) of the Christmas Island Act 1958-1973 should be amended to provide that Commonwealth Acts shall include Christmas Island in their coverage unless specific provision to the contrary is made. At present, no Commonwealth Act applies on Christmas Island unless appropriate provision is specifically made. Evidence was given by representatives of the Department of Home Affairs that in the extension to Christmas Island of existing legislation a large backlog of drafting has arisen. Steps should be taken to eliminate this. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Advisory Council should be set up as quickly as possible, and the Administrator should invite it to sound community opinion and advise him on what form of political and community representation consistent with those that exist on the mainland would best accord with the wishes of the Island's inhabitants. Parliamentary representation should be included among the possibilities to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) As soon as an acceptable form of political representation has been established, the office of Administrator should be abolished and responsibility for liaison with the Department of Home Affairs should be assumed by a 'Department of Home Affairs Liaison Officer'. The residence of the Administrator should be made available to residents of the Island for a purpose of their choosing. </PARA>
<PARA> (e) Early consideration should be given to the appointment of a small number of Justices of the Peace with limited judicial function, or alternatively to the appointment of one or two Special Magistrates with limited judicial function, from the different ethnic communities on the Island. </PARA>
<PARA> 16. The newly constituted CIPC should expand its program of reafforestation on the Island, making greater use of back-filling in mined areas. Bird populations should be monitored as accurately as possible so that any signs of significant decline can be detected and appropriate action taken. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Finally, I ask the Minister whether he will report regularly to the House on the progress of the new organisation, when it is set up, which is owned by the Australian Government, particularly with respect to the continuing economics of the phosphate extraction, whether there are any changes in the level of reserves, the conditions in the work force, the future of workers when mining ceases and the question of endangered species. The Opposition notes that, within the statement, there were hints in these areas, particularly with respect to the Abbott's booby bird. A report is now before the Government. I think that all these matters need to be reported to the House. I hope that the Minister will undertake to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That this House censures the Minister for Transport for his failure to fulfil his Ministerial duties by failing to provide essential information and support to the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares and further by repeatedly misleading the Parliament and the public in relation to the purposes and conduct of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>The principle of ministerial responsibility, trust and accurate accountability to the parliament is fundamental to the proper functioning of the Westminster system of government and fundamental to the operation of our parliamentary system. A Minister of State's commission from the Queen's representatives not only carries with it power, prestige and a set of onerous duties but also places upon the Minister a heavy responsibility for efficient performance, propriety in conduct and honesty in reporting to the parliament on the conduct of his duties. </PARA>
<PARA> From copies of correspondence attached to the report of the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, from statements made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) to the Parliament and from public reports it is abundantly clear that the Minister for Transport repeatedly misled the inquiry team as to the intent and purpose of its task. He denied the inquiry assistance and information essential to the proper conduct of its affairs. It was his responsibility to ensure that such was provided. He deprived the inquiry of adequate time in which to carry out the responsibilities with which he had charged it. He repudiated firm undertakings as to the life of the inquiry and the provision of data resources. He had given these undertakings to members of the inquiry on their appointment and at subsequent meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Minister blatantly and despicably misrepresented statements made by members of the committee as to the undertakings he gave them. He adopted a partisan approach in favour of the major beneficiary of the two-airline agreement, Ansett Airlines of Australia. He failed in his relationship with the inquiry to ensure that the interests of air travellers and the owners of Trans-Australia Airlines were properly protected. He embarked also on a campaign of character assassination of the committee members once he found out that they were not prepared to carry out his will, once he found that they were determined to act in an honest and professional manner. In these circumstances, the Minister does not deserve the confidence of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> To appreciate fully the insincerity of this Minister, his incompetence, his partiality towards Ansett Airlines of Australia and his abject failure to perform his duties responsibly and in an honourable fashion it is necessary to relate the sequence of events associated with the inquiry. One has only to recall the lackey-like behaviour of this Minister and the pretence he carried on when, as Minister for Health, he destroyed Medibank. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the fares inquiry a similar pretence was perpetrated by the Minister because the inquiry, in the course of its investigations and its duties and in seeking relevant information from Ansett Airlines, began to get too close to the bone. It was likely to expose the rip-off of air travellers under this Government's high air fare policy. Let me make it clear that this Government and this Minister owe their political survival to the proprietors of Ansett Airlines of Australia, Mr Rupert Murdoch and Sir Peter Abeles. The Government is effectively a captive of the proprietors of Ansett Airlines. When the inquiry sought to explore the handsome financial benefits derived by Ansett Airlines at the expense of air travellers under the terms of its licence to print money-the two-airline agreement-the proprietors called for a brake on the committee's activities. The Government, through the bumbling, compliant Minister for Transport, readily obliged because the Minister was well aware that so far as the Government is concerned Ansett's financial interests took preference over the interests of air travellers. </PARA>
<PARA> To understand the behaviour of the Minister in this matter, I should like to mention the events leading up to the establishment of the inquiry. In the face of growing public criticism of the Government's high air fare policy and the two-airline agreement that the Government decided that action needed to be taken to blunt the criticism of those policies. Following the gigantic stock exchange battle of 1979 when Mr Murdoch and Sir Peter Abeles gained control of Ansett, discussions were commenced with them on a new two-airline agreement. In that stock exchange battle the Government had given its mute endorsement to the new ownership. In December 1979, the Minister said that it was in the interests of all Australians that major changes were to be made to the two-airline agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> I inform the House that the first preference of Sir Peter Abeles for the two-airline agreement was that Trans-Australia Airlines should be sold to commercial interests. We all know that inevitably that would lead to a private monopoly in the provision of air services in this country. The second preference of Ansett Airlines of Australia was that TAA financial structure should be changed and that TAA should be required to produce a 10 per cent profit on revenue after tax compared with a 6 per cent profit on revenue before tax and interest recommended by the inquiry. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a money making machine for the supporters of the Government. The people being ripped off are the air travellers of this country. The inquiry was established then by the Minister to defuse air fares as an issue and to head off the moves in Western Australia for the nomination of a Senate candidate under the heading of 'cheaper air fares for Western Australia'. The Minister sought to head off the possibility of the nomination of that candidate at the coming election. When the inquiry was established the Minister then faced the dilemma that his masters at Ansett Airlines who wanted faster and larger fare increases and greater profits had to be balanced with the interests of those of the public who wanter lower air fares and better public accountability by airlines. Subsequent events have shown that Ansett won again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite his statement on 20 March that details of the fare inquiry would be announced the following week, it was not until nine weeks later that the Minister was able to tell the Parliament who would be members of the inquiry. He indicated at the beginning that there was not going to be much to the inquiry because he said: 'I do not think the inquiry is any great panacea for travellers round Australia. I do not think it will resolve the issue by obtaining cheaper air fares'. He underestimated the capacity of the committee. When the Minister met the committee on 3 June last he made it abundantly clear to its members that no time limit was stipulated on the activities of the inquiry. He gave his personal assurance to the members of the committee that the co-operation of all major parties had been vouchsafed. On 9 June the inquiry opened in Sydney. It was not until 28 June that submissions were invited and they closed in August. The Budget Papers last August showed that some $379,000 was allocated for the inquiry. Importantly-this is the point the Minister cannot get around-the notes on the estimates of the Department of Administrative Services state:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government has not set a date by which the Committee is to report and should the completion date not be achieved, it will be necessary to review the estimates . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those words expose the falsehoods of the Minister in recent days in relation to this matter. They expose the maliciousness of the Minister in attempting to impugn the integrity of the chairman of the committee, Mr Holcroft, by claiming that the committee had an intent to terminate on 31 January 1981 and by implying that Mr Holcroft is a liar. The Minister for Administrative Services has confirmed the notes on the Department's estimates of August last year and the Minister for Transport has confirmed to me in writing, through the committee, the accuracy of the information provided by the Department of Administrative Services, that is, that the inquiry was expected to conclude in mid-July 1981 and that it was the responsibility of the inquiry to determine its own program of public hearings. He clearly and precisely confirmed that information. We have learned subsequently that Western Australian back bench members of the Government-let those who deny it stand up and be identified-have since confirmed that the Minister told the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in their presence that the committee was due to report in mid-July of this year. Thus the Minister's attack on Mr Holcroft's integrity was cowardly and a debasement of his office. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the denial of support to the committee by this Minister. In chopping short the activities of the inquiry, the Minister was fully aware that the people of several States would not have access to the committee's hearings and that Western Australia would not have the benefit of the resumed hearings that had been promised. Mr Holcroft has told the Parliament of the personal assurances given by the Minister, assurances which have since been repudiated. The Minister's Department did not place a submission and did not provide the co-operation that the Minister had promised. It was not until 13 days after the committee had been ordered to conclude that the Department of Transport lodged its submission with the inquiry. The Minister, falsely, has offered the pressure of work by his Department in the preparation of the new two-airline agreement as an excuse for the delay of nine months from when the inquiry was announced and the Department of Transport, with this Minister as its head and some 11,000 employees, put together a submission to its own inquiry. The delay was part of the cover-up. The Government did not want the information revealed. Last night the Government's back bench committee was told again by an officer of the Department of Transport that that Department had been advised by the Minister's office that there was no rush to put in a submission. Again, the Minister has been exposed as to the way that he suppressed the activities of this committee and tried to mislead and misrepresent its activities. Additionally, Mr Wheeden of the Department of Transport told the inquiry last year that no published information was available on airline cost components other than the work done by the Bureau of Transport Economics. </PARA>
<PARA> But this Minister, who professed that there was a public inquiry and who wanted to see the facts, ensured that the BTE did not submit a submission, despite the evidence of his own officer that it had the only public information available on that subject. That information was absolutely critical to the conduct of the inquiry. Again, the Minister sought to blame somebody else: First Mr Holcroft and then the BTE. What has happened to the BTE since? The Director has resigned. In his devotion to the proprietors of Ansett, the Minister instructed the committee not to examine the two-airline agreement with the ridiculous assertion that the two-airline agreement is not relevant to an examination of the air fare structure. The air fare structure is a product of the two-airline agreement. It is inseparable from the agreement. The Holcroft committee recognised this fact. On 3 March, Mr Holcroft exposed the real reason that the Minister did not want the two-airline agreement examined when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't think the Department of Transport--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>or Sir Peter Abeles saw it that way and you would have to believe that they filibustered on us a bit. There were delaying tactics all the way through to stop us getting information. </PARA>
<PARA>Added to the committee's difficulties in obtaining relevant information was the Minister's connivance in having the committee turned out of its premises part way through the inquiry. But the supreme insult to the committee came when it had to be advised by Sir Peter Abeles that there was to be a change in government policy. The advice was given not through the Minister but by his real master, Sir Peter Abeles, who advised that a new two-airline agreement was being signed. The Minister's difficulty with the committee then was that, having set up an inquiry into air fares to carry through a pretence of Government concern with public criticism of the air fare policies, he had to head off plans that would expose the real profits being made by Ansett and the real benefits being given to that company under the guise of the two-airline agreement. The dishonourable course taken by the Minister was to favour Ansett again and to curtail the activities of the committee, even if it meant betraying his responsibilities as a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Holcroft committee, despite the denial of information and support to it by the Government, has done the Parliament a great service. It has exposed the pretence carried on by this Minister, it has revealed the excessive profits being made by Ansett Airlines at the air travellers' expense and it has highlighted to all Australians the power of the proprieters of Ansett over this Government. Honourable members will recall that on the last night of the last parliamentary session this Minister introduced the Australian National Airlines Commission Amendment Bill-a phoney Bill. That Bill embodied the requests made in January of last year by Sir Peter Abeles to this Minister that Trans-Australia Airlines' financial structure be changed and that TAA's profit objective be changed. The major beneficiary of the extra profit that would flow from that change to airline arrangements-increased fares would have to flow through to provide the additional profit-would be Ansett Airlines. It would be the major beneficiary of the real purpose of the amendment to TAA's legislation. Ansett and TAA have to charge the same fares under the two-airline agreement, so that when TAA's fares go up, Ansett's have to follow. If the Government forces TAA to increase its fares through this legislation, Ansett will be the major beneficiary of the windfall gain. Ansett is already making excessive profits. Mr Holcroft has shown that in his report.</PARA>
<PARA> The legislation I have referred to would bring super profits to Ansett at the expense of the public of this country. Sir Peter and Rupert Murdoch have got their way so far. But this Government and this Minister, who has repudiated his undertaking to a public body, owe their positions to the Ansett empire. The services rendered have now to be paid for. The first payment is the curtailment of the fare inquiry and the continued suppression of information on Ansett's financial performance. Ansett has again escaped from having to provide detailed and substantive financial information on its performance. Throughout the life of the two-airline agreement under previous conservative governments and this Government, Ansett Airlines has never had to produce the detailed information that is necessary to a proper examination of what is going on in that company and in the airline industry of this country. The second payment is to be the new, more restrictive, 10-year two-airline agreement with its automatic fare increase. Another request which was made in writing-it sits on the Minister's file-by Sir Peter Abeles to this Minister as part of the payup, was provision for an automatic fare increase, and that is proposed in the legislation affecting TAA. </PARA>
<PARA> The third payment-to tidy it all up-is to be the amendment to TAA's legislation, so that fare levels will have to go up. Towering over this scandalous affair and this disreputable Minister is the shadow of Ansett's proprietors. Partners with this Government in a disgraceful deal, they are ripping off the Australian travelling public and deluding this Parliament and the people of this country as to the true conduct of airline affairs and the profits being made by Ansett Airlines in this country. The Opposition's views, and the views I have expressed in respect of the inquiry, are shared by many of the major media journals published in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to some august journals which are not necessarily sympathetic to the causes of the Australian Labor Party. I refer to the Australian Financial Review of 27 February and the Sydney Morning Herald also of 27 February. The report in the Australian Financial Review refers to the Holcroft inquiry as being nobbled and warns any other businessman asked by this Government to participate in a public inquiry to beware. When this Government sets up inquiries it wants dummies and yes-men who will carry out the bidding of subservient Ministers whose first responsibility is to the Murdoch and Ansett empires. The editorial in the Australian Financial Review states:</PARA>
<PARA> The nobbling of the Holcroft inquiry is therefore a serious matter. The committee's report has performed an important public service by drawing attention to the unsatisfactory conditions in which it has had to work and the way in which the beneficiaries of Government largesse have been allowed to evade any public accountability. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial also states:</PARA>
<PARA> For the behaviour of the Government towards the committee, and the behaviour of a number of parties which should have assisted the committee, has been nothing short of scandalous. The Government effectively precluded the committee from thorough examination of a number of central issues and forced it to report with such haste that the report is inevitably deficient in many respects. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst it is deficient in many respects, the substance of its recommendations bear worthy consideration and the committee has exposed much of the largesse that is being handed out to Ansett by this Government under the two-airline agreement. Ansett will receive more if the new two-airline agreement happens to be ratified by both Houses. An editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald made the point that any public citizen invited to participate in a government inquiry should beware. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Why should such citizens, who suffer from the delusion that the Government genuinely needs their services, put up with the contemptuous treatment that they ultimately receive. </PARA>
<PARA>This Minister is hiding behind the privilege of this Parliament. He is not outside making these statements publicly. But in here during Question Time he is nice and quiet. He is defaming, denigrating and abusing the character of three honourable men who have done all that was asked of them and who have responsibly carried out their public duties. As these three men have said: 'We are three honourable businessmen who want to tell the truth all the time about what we are doing'. This Minister is hiding behind the cowardly cloak of parliamentary privilege. He has not told the Parliament or the public the truth and has suppressed a public inquiry. He has treated air travellers, the public and the Parliament with absolute contempt. He has repudiated the trust placed in him and he has repudiated his own undertakings. He has misled the Parliament and the people as to his role in the conduct and actions of the inquiry. He has been exposed by a courageous and upright committee. He is now embarking upon a campaign to denigrate the members of that committee. This Minister has breached the trust placed in him as a Minister of State. In doing so he has destroyed any entitlement he had to the confidence of this House. He has been responsible for the squandering of some $378,000 of taxpayers' money and in these circumstances he does not deserve the confidence of this House. </PARA>

I want also to refute the allegation that the Director of the Bureau of Transport Economics resigned because of this incident. Dr Gannon's appointment was for a limited tenure.

Soon after I became the Minister for Transport I was convinced that there was a need for an inquiry into the way in which air fares were set on individual routes in the national network by the use of an air fare formula. As a result of submissions from Western Australian members of parliament and organisations I felt it was essential to establish whether inequities existed in the air fare structure to the disadvantage of long distance travellers. I am on record as having made known my concern on a number of occasions in this Parliament. I seek leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard a number of references from Hansard which indicate my concern.</PARA></TALK.START>

Following my recent announcement that the Government had decided to establish an independent inquiry into the domestic air fares structure, I can now release further details. The chairman of this public inquiry will be Mr W. J. Holcroft, who has had a long association with the transport industry and with various government advisory bodies. Amongst other tasks, he has been chairman of the Transport Industries Advisory Council and the Manufacturing Industry Council. He will be assisted by Dr Harold Bell and Professor Warren Hogan. Dr Bell has had a distinguished career as an economist in the insurance industry and has also been associated with the transport industry. In particular, his role as a member of the Transport Industries Advisory Council, I am sure, will place him in good stead to understand the factors involved in the inquiry. He is also a Commissioner of the Australian National Railways. Professor Hogan of Sydney is of course a very well known Professor of Economics at Sydney University and a distinguished economist.

<PARA>INDEPENDENT PUBLIC INQUIRY INTODOMESTIC AIR FARES TERMS OF REFERENCE</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The inquiry is to examine air fares on the trunk routes and regional routes operated by the two major domestic airlines, Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia, with special reference to the way in which fares are set on individual routes in the national network by use of an air fare formula. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. In respect of these routes the inquiry should report, and make recommendations as appropriate, on</PARA>

<PARA> (ix) other relevant factors. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr HUNT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government agreed to set up such an inquiry. I wish to read from a media release which I made on the issue. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inquiry will examine air fares on the trunk routes and regional routes operated by the two major domestic airlines, Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry will also look at the way fares are set on individual routes in the national network by use of an air fare formula. Existing and alternative pricing policies and the degree of cross subsidisation will also be examined. Its investigations will be concentrated on the air fare formula used to determine Australia's domestic trunk route fares and whether this formula produces cost related fares. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government appointed three outstanding people of the highest calibre to undertake this inquiry, namely, Mr Warwick Holcroft, Professor Hogan and Dr Harold Bell. It was a logical progression from the 1978 domestic air transport policy review which initially identified substantial cross-subsidisation in the air fares system. That review also recommended the continuance of a two-airline system operating over the major trunk routes. It also recommended a new agreement to deregulate freight and to provide for a greater measure of competition within the system. The Government adopted the domestic air transport policy review recommendations and sought the rewriting of a new agreement along the lines recommended. As Minister for Transport, I have negotiated a new agreement on behalf of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Holcroft inquiry undoubtedly builds on one area of DATPR. It is untrue to say that I have not supported the inquiry. Indeed, I have been one of its strongest advocates. There is not the slightest doubt that the Department under my control provided the inquiry with as much information and material as it was able to do. I offered the complete co-operation of my Department, and I am convinced that it did fulfil its obligations and responsibilities. My officers refute the allegation made by the honourable gentleman that last night officers told a gathering of back benchers that my office conveyed to the Department that there was no hurry to provide information. The departmental report was delivered to the inquiry on 10 December. Admittedly, this was later than we all would have desired. However, I am informed that considerable material was made available to the inquiry prior to the report. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as TAA is concerned, I assured the committee that TAA would co-operate with the inquiry. That TAA's submission to the Inquiry was so extensive bears out its co-operation. With respect to the Bureau of Transport Economics, Mr Holcroft's letter of 1 December was the first expression of dissatisfaction in that he noted that the BTE had not lodged its submission. I would like to make two points in respect of that comment. Firstly, the BTE had never made a formal commitment to provide a submission to the inquiry. The executive members of the BTE in fact decided in September not to proceed with a submission. Secondly, the BTE, like the Department of Transport, had extensive discussions with the inquiry and its staff. Indeed, I would also like to mention that two BTE officers were seconded to the inquiry research staff. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it was never the Government's intention for the inquiry to be a full-scale review of the regulation of domestic civil aviation. In all my statements on behalf of the Government I have made that point clear. The Government reaffirmed its commitment to a two-airline policy and repeated its position clearly prior to the election. In a speech at the opening of the Skywest Air Services Pty Ltd administrative building in Perth on 28 July I stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Implementation of these domestic air transport policy review recommendations has had to await the outcome of extensive negotiations on a new airlines agreement. Discussions with the major airlines on issues related to the agreement are completed. I therefore hope to be in a position to make an announcement on domestic air transport policy shortly. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently some further issues were raised and the legal drafting of the document took some time to finalise. On two occasions I stressed to the Holcroft committee that the real purpose of the inquiry was to inquire into the ways in which air fares are set on individual routes and the national network by the use of an air fare formula. At no time have I misled the Parliament or anyone else on the Government's intentions. The Holcroft inquiry chose to interpret the terms of reference in its own manner, and that was its prerogative. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the date on which it was to report, I was never explicit about the duration of the inquiry in my discussions with members of the inquiry. Let me repeat: It was originally expected that the inquiry would report by January 1981. There were indications, as time went on, that additional time would, in the committee's view, be required. It was quite clear that Mr Holcroft understood that the original expectation was for the inquiry to finalise its report by January 1981, and that is borne out by his letter dated 14 November.</PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to mention that it is quite clear from the evidence given at Estimates committees and from departmental understandings that it was originally expected that the reporting date would be January 1981. Indeed, a letter from the Acting Prime Minister on 9 December confirms this position, and I seek leave to incorporate the letter in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Prime Minister Canberra 9 December 1980 My dear Minister, I refer to your letter of 27 November 1980 relating to the Holcroft Inquiry request for an extension of time for the completion of its report. </PARA>
<PARA> I would emphasise the importance of the inquiry completing its report by the end of January 1981. In your letter of 27 November 1980 to Mr Holcroft you informed him of the substantial and pressing reasons for completion of the report by this date. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government would be most concerned if the target date were not met. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, you will recall that it was originally envisaged that six months would provide sufficient time for completion of the Inquiry report; by the end of January 1981 eight months will have elapsed since the establishment of the Inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust you will ensure that the Inquiry complies with Cabinet's decision on this matter. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr HUNT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just read from the second last paragraph of this letter which is dated 9 December 1980. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, you will recall that it was originally envisaged that six months would provide sufficient time for completion of the Inquiry report; by the end of January 1981 eight months will have elapsed since the establishment of the Inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter is there for all to see. I also refer to the statement made by the honourable member for Shortland in this Parliament on 11 September 1980. On page 1176 of Hansard he is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Predictably the inquiry, sham that it is, is not expected to report before February 1981 at the earliest-well after the coming election. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable gentleman did not expect the committee to report before February 1981. Yet he has brought forward this matter today for discussion. Let the honourable gentleman answer that in his own way. </PARA>
<PARA> As time progressed it became apparent to the committee that more time would be needed. Ultimately Mr Holcroft and his committee met me on 13 November, when the position was explained. As I said earlier, this was confirmed in the letter dated 14 November. I assured Mr Holcroft that I would put the request before the Government. The Government considered the request, but because of its desire to receive the inquiry's report before legislation to approve the new airlines agreement was introduced into the Parliament this session I conveyed to the inquiry by letter dated 27 November the Government's wish that the inquiry report at the end of January. The rest is history. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to another contentious section of the transmittal letter, in which Mr Holcroft says:</PARA>
<PARA> It is also appropriate to record that the members of the inquiry felt in some degree misplaced when learning on 9 September that they had been proceeding with an inquiry requiring them to have regard, inter alia, to 'Government domestic aviation policy . . . in ignorance of the fact that the Government was meanwhile negotiating a new ten-year two airlines agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>On no fewer than five occasions I informed this House that I was negotiating a new airlines agreement on behalf of the Government with TAA and Ansett. I am at a loss to know why the inquiry members were so surprised. It was never the Government's intention to break off negotiations in respect of the two-airline agreement while the Holcroft inquiry was being undertaken. As far as the Government was concerned, the two-airline policy had been reaffirmed and was the cornerstone of our domestic aviation policy which should have been taken into account in the course of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude by saying that the Holcroft committee is to be commended on the report it has produced. It is a most valuable report and will be of immense value to the Government, the Parliament and the public. On behalf of the Government, I thank the committee members for their tireless efforts and for meeting the Government's reporting requirements. Secondly, at no time have I undertaken any action, either in regard to the Holcroft inquiry or the negotiations for the new airlines agreement, that did not have the authority of Cabinet or the Government. (Extension of time granted). I thank the House. I would like to say one final word about the Australian Labor Party and its shadow Minister for Transport. To my knowledge, the Australian Labor Party in recent times has refrained from uttering any coherent domestic aviation policy. Does it still adhere to the nationalisation of the aviation industry with one government-owned airline? To describe the Opposition's policy as ad hoc would be to pay it a supreme compliment. All that the honourable member for Shortland does is yap and yap behind my heels like a pomeranian pup. The Australian Labor Party has not put forward a coherent domestic aviation policy since the 1940s, when it attempted to nationalise or socialise the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I refute the serious allegations made against me. In no way do I criticise the attempt of those involved on the Holcroft inquiry to come to grips with a very complex and important issue relating to the setting of air fares. The inquiry complements the domestic air transport policy review and will be of value in assisting the Government in determining future fare setting arrangements. The Government will give urgent consideration to its 36 recommendations and will give proper regard and consideration to the public interest. </PARA>

He said it was the Cabinet that was responsible and he was just the mug out front. We might have guessed that. In the transport industry the stakes are enormous and who would leave it to poor old ineffectual Ralph Hunt to destroy the results of years of careful nurturing by the political heavies of this Government?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The carve-up of the bribes from ATI could not be left to the Minister for Transport. His party, the National Country Party, could not have it all. After all, the Liberals have done their bit in the past and continue to do so at present. So, at a time when the two-airline agreement was up for grabs, both parties saw a great opportunity to extract the price of their compliance. That is why the Government had publicly to commit itself before the last general election to the then secret agreement. You will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that a Bill relating to the deal was brought in during the dying hours of the last Parliament. Rupert Murdoch and Sir Peter Abels were able to reciprocate due to the fact that the Bill was introduced into the Parliament before the election. They had time to reciprocate and the coffers of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Country Party were topped up in grateful acknowledgment of the obedience of their political slaves. That all had to be done before the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All would have been well had it not been for the fact that Holcroft, Hogan and Bell were still on the loose. Everybody had forgotten that. They were honourable men and they had been given a job to do and were setting about their task of doing it. Apart from that, the Western Australian Liberals were getting jumpy. They knew that they could not survive the next election if they continued to support the two-airline agreement and the raw deal it had meant for Western Australian travellers over many years. They could not continue to support the high air fares policy of this Government and not be exposed as the charlatans I suspect they are. That is when the Government panicked and when the whole deal looked like coming unstuck. That is when, in November last year, a compromise was reached. A meeting took place between the Minister for Transport, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Liberals from Western Australia. That compromise and that meeting have been attested to not only by the Minister but also in recent days by the Western Australian Liberals who attended that meeting. It is strange to see how they remain gutlessly mute during this debate. They said that they would review their attitude to the two-airline agreement only if the Government tabled the Holcroft report before debating the legislation to ratify the two-airline agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> But wait; there was still another problem. It all had to be done before the middle of this year in order that the legislation could go through before those unreliable Australian Democrats took their place in the Senate. That is when the directive went out to Holcroft. That is when the Prime Minister ordered the Minister for Transport to direct the Holcroft committee to have its report in by 31 January. No amount of dissembling by the Minister for Transport can disguise the fact that he led the committee to believe that it had until mid-1981 to report. Mr Holcroft confirmed this fact to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) again this morning. The Minister for Transport can continue to disparage Mr Holcroft and his colleagues. He can continue to dredge up semi-relevant documents to confound us, but the simple unanswered testimony remains. From the 3 June meeting in the Minister's office, Holcroft and his colleagues believed-there is no question about this-that they had until the middle of this year to complete their report. </PARA>
<PARA> The very great shame, the eternal shame, is that this Minister has not had the courage, or apparently the capacity, to tell the truth and to reveal the details of this whole messy business. He does not seem to realise that the game is up. He may well survive as Minister for Transport today but as a Minister he is finished. Through his incompetence he has imperilled the most cherished jewel in the political fund-raising of conservative parties in this country. He has exposed and put at risk the special relationship, the intricate corruption, that has underpinned the dealings between this Government, the Liberals and the National Country Party, and Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. He will not be forgiven for that. In a sense, we are indebted to him for his incompetence because it is his incompetence which has revealed more of the details of this special relationship, this corruption, than we knew of already. We are even more indebted to the Holcroft committee for the way in which it revealed the situation and the way in which it has rammed it home to the people of Australia. It is as a result of that committee's report that this Minister has had to resort to the tactic which is usually adopted by people on that side of the House, people of his party and the Liberal Party, when they prevaricate, dissemble, and defame-in brief, to say anything other than the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Holcroft committee revealed which is so damaging and so unanswerable? What is it that this Minister will not face up to? What is it that this Minister has to continue to prevaricate about? What is it that has led this Minister to continue to defame and to misrepresent three honourable and honest men? First, the report in total is a colossal indictment of this Minister's trustworthiness and his reliability. Secondly, it reveals his utter ignorance of the issues for which he has ministerial responsibility. Let me deal with a few of these. </PARA>
<PARA> He said it was not the Committee's job to consider the two-airline agreement. From that we can only conclude that he has not even read the terms of reference. Honourable members will realise that the terms of reference were not written by him in the first instance; they were written by a few Western Australian Liberals who were able to convince him, or bully him, into setting up this inquiry in the first instance. I refer to a couple of the terms of reference. The second term of reference, referring to trunk routes, states:</PARA>
<PARA>In respect of these routes the Inquiry should report, and make recommendations as appropriate, on:</PARA>
<PARA>amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) existing and alternative pricing policies including special discount arrangements</PARA>
<PARA>Further, the third term of reference states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Inquiry shall have regard to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) government domestic aviation policy including the objective of increasing competition,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the effect of competition on fares,</PARA>
<PARA>I really ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the Minister how on earth-or anywhere else for that matter-can the committee begin to consider those matters without first considering the matter of the two-airline agreement. The two-airline agreement is the antithesis of competition. It has prevented competition in this industry for as long as it has existed. Yet at the same time as the Minister said that it was not the job of the committee to consider the two-airline agreement, the Government asked the Committee to consider the objective of increasing competition. It also asked the committee to consider the effect of competition on fares. It is an inescapable fact that one cannot consider the matter of competition, ways of extending competition and the effect of competition on fares, without at the same time considering the effect of the two-airline agreement on the whole matter of competition and fares. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is not enough to convince us that the Minister is prevaricating and dissembling on this matter, we need only to look at his statement of 26 November, when he announced the truncation of the inquiry and the fact that the committee had to report by 31 January. In one paragraph he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends to table the Holcroft report before proceeding to introduce legislation to ratify a new agreement with the airlines. Therefore Parliament will have the benefit of that report before debating the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>That lets the cat out of the bag. If the Holcroft report has nothing to do with the two-airline agreement, why would we want to have it before debating the legislation? It is quite clear, of course, that that paragraph had to go into the Minister's Press statement because it was the basis on which he was able to buy off the opposition, at least temporarily, of the Western Australian Liberals. They were able to insist that the Holcroft committee's report had to be available to them and the Parliament before they would guarantee to vote for the two-airline agreement and the legislation which was to ratify it. But, in doing so, the Minister has given the game away. He has known at all times that the report of the Holcroft committee is entirely germane to the whole question of the two-airline policy. What he is now attempting to do in abusing the committee for not understanding that is a total insult to the intelligence of those three honourable men. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that after the committee had been appointed and while it was doing its work the agreement was secretly concluded without the knowledge of the Parliament or the public. It was secretly concluded before the election in order to satisfy Ansett in relation to the undertakings which the Government had given to it in return for its political donations. It also had to be concluded secretly at that time to strengthen Ansett's hand before the inquiry. Ansett had not wanted the inquiry in the first place. It always considered it to be irrelevant. The signing of the new two-airline agreement provided immunity for Ansett in relation to the meddlesome interference of the committee. When the committee sought to get Ansett before it to answer questions Ansett was able to say smugly that the questions were irrelevant because they had already been dealt with by the two-airline agreement which had been secretly concluded between the Government and Ansett Transport Industries. It also meant that the committee was prevented from examining some of the very sensitive areas. </PARA>
<PARA> To name just one, I refer to the fact that a number of submissions before the committee, including my own, raised the question of the use of the excess capacity of the planes of Qantas Airways Ltd travelling across the continent. Of course, the use of that excess capacity would mean lower air fares for people travelling to and from Western Australia. Now, as a result of the new two-airline agreement, Ansett has an effective veto to prevent the use of that excess capacity of Qantas or any other international carrier. The committee was not able to make recommendations or to consider that very important question which would have resolved the problem of air fares to Western Australia if it had been implemented. It had already been recommended to the Government by a former non-public inquiry. The simple manoeuvre of allowing Qantas to use its excess capacity would have cut by half the fares between Perth and Sydney or Melbourne. Yet this committee, which had the express task of looking at air fares, particularly the problems on the longer routes, was prevented from looking at that simple manoeuvre. The Minister also misled the committee about the co-operation of the Department of Transport, Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett. I refer to the letter of transmission from the committee. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> In your initial meeting with us in June 1980, you emphasised that you had been assured by both airlines that the inquiry could expect to receive their full and willing co-operation and that the same could be expected from your own Department. In the event TAA honoured its undertaking. The contribution from Ansett, however, proved far from spontaneous and the delay in settling the basis of agreement to supply information hampered the Inquiry's operation.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for Ansett's co-operation and the assurance of the Minister in relation to that co-operation! The Department of Transport did not make its submission until six weeks before the committee's report was due; that is, six months after the co-operation had been promised by the Minister. In the event, the Bureau of Transport Economics did not submit one at all. In answer to the Leader of the Opposition on 3 March the Minister said that the Bureau of Transport Economics did not wish to make a submission. Who is running the Minister's Department? He promised the Department's co-operation. He should have insisted on a submission from the Bureau of Transport Economics as well as from the Department. The Minister says this matter is trivial. He says that the inquiry should have been able to proceed without that information. Yet the airline industry is the most regulated, secretive and arrogant industry in Australia. It has always operated as a cosy and exclusive club. Of course the committee could not proceed without the information which only the Department and the airlines had. By the simple manoeuvre of refusing to honour his assurance the Minister was able to frustrate and, in the end, scuttle this very important inquiry. The real reason for not wanting to disclose all the information the Department had was that the Department and the Minister realised that they had utterly failed to honour their public trust in failing to protect the interests of the travelling public and has failed to ensure that they got a fair deal from this duopolistic-virtually monopolistic-industry. This industry has felt free to exort the travelling public for years. This Department and this Minister were not going to see that little arrangement exposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion of censure of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) was launched earlier today by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). During his address we heard words such as disreputable, disgraceful, shameful, dummies, yes-man, defaming, denigrating and contemptible. Those of us who have shared this Parliament with the honourable member for Shortland for a number of years will know he has always made up for lack of argument with colourful words. Today he tried to make up not only for lack of argument but also for lack of stature in the Parliament with colourful words of abuse. All I can say about the effort of the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) to make a contribution to this debate is that if he is not careful he will very quickly follow the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) and be downgraded. Worse still, he will follow the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) and be sent to the back benches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition was reading an old Hansard for the whole of the honourable member's speech and the alternative leader of the Labor Party was yawning his head off, so there is not much of a future for the honourable member for Fremantle. Let us look at the words of the censure motion. The first part states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this House censures the Minister for Transport for his failure to fulfil his Ministerial duties by failing to provide essential information and support to the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I thought the Minister answered that allegation perfectly well in his speech and I will not bother to repeat the information he gave. I think that the second part of the censure motion is more germane to this debate. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and further by repeatedly misleading the Parliament and the public in relation to the purposes and conduct of the Inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>What were the purposes and conduct of the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares? I think the purposes are well set out in the terms of reference, which commence by stating:</PARA>
<PARA> The Inquiry is to examine air fares . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing ambiguous about that. I would have thought that the three members of the committee of inquiry would have had no difficulty understanding that. The terms of reference continue:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . on the trunk routes and regional routes operated by the two major domestic airlines . . . with special reference to the way in which fares are set on individual routes in the national network by use of an air fare formula. </PARA>
<PARA>That is perfectly plain. The second paragraph relates to the first and refers only to air fares. There is no mention of anything else. The Labor Party turns its attention very much to what comes out of the third paragraph, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Inquiry shall have regard to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the public interest,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) government domestic aviation policy including the objective of increasing competition,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the effect of competition on fares-</PARA>
<PARA>This is the nub of the matter-</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the report of the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that the secretariat, if not the committee of inquiry itself, and certainly the honourable member for Shortland-certainly not the honourable member for Fremantle; he would not know enough about it-would have understood that the reference to the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review Committee was a direct reference to government policy. As a result of that committee's report the Government restated its intention to continue the two-airline policy. That point leads me directly to what the Opposition is claiming as the Minister's misleading the Parliament as to purpose. The Opposition bases its charge on that point alone and I am staggered that it has not properly thought through what the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review Committee recommended and what was publicly stated, when I was Minister for Transport, following the tabling of its report. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the matter is that subsequent to March 1978, when that report was tabled, there was a series of Press statements, speeches, articles and questions relating to the two-airline policy. On 20 December 1979 the Minister issued a Press release on the subject. On 22 January 1980 an article appeared in the Bulletin. On 5 March 1980 a question was asked on the subject. On 17 March 1980 a Press release was issued. On 27 March 1980, during the second reading debate on the Airline Equipment Loan Guarantee Bill another statement was made. On 14 and 15 May 1980 further questions were answered and on 18 September 1980 another speech was made. For the Holcroft committee to suggest that it did not know that the Government had a firm policy in respect of the continuance of the two-airline policy is quite extraordinary. The most charitable conclusion one can reach is that there has been a failure on the part of the secretariat to do its homework and a failure by the committee of inquiry itself to attend to the terms of reference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that if the committee of inquiry read the terms of reference properly it failed in its duty to understand what those terms meant. This means that the Labor Party, in accusing the Minister of misleading the Parliament, has not understood the question at all. Let me turn now to the next matter of controversy, the date of completion. It is hard to follow why this should have been an issue in this debate. Even the honourable member for Shortland knew that the report was to be completed by January or February 1981 because as, reported in the Hansard on September 11 1980, and as the Minister pointed out this morning, the honourable member said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Predictably the inquiry, sham that it is, is not expected to report before February 1981 at the earliest, well after the coming election. </PARA>
<PARA>He recognised quite clearly that the report was to be concluded. He is not too bright and if he recognised it surely the members of the committee ought to have known about it themselves. There is no doubt that the committee did know; that is unquestioned. The first paragraph of Mr Holcroft's letter to the Minister of 14 November states:</PARA>
<PARA> In recent discussions I referred to the fact that the inquiry is unlikely to complete its task by the original reporting date indicated, January 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>So it is quite clear that the committee was aware of the completion date. It had conversations with the Minister also about it and the Minister expressed some sympathy for their problem. He took that problem to the Government but the Government, for broader reasons that I will come to, decided that the report ought to be completed on the initial date so that it could be considered in the debate on the two-airline policy. Another question emerges at this point. Apparently-this is a serious matter-all the correspondence relating to the exchange between Mr Holcroft and the Minister on this matter, with the exception of this letter, was included in the appendix to the report. I refer to the letter in which it was recognised by Mr Holcroft that the original reporting date was to be January 1981. That raises a very serious question that the committee itself ought to answer. On that point its integrity is somewhat under challenge. Nobody has greater respect for the members of that committee than I do. Nobody has worked more closely with its chairman. I ask the chairman of that committee publicly to state why the letter had not been included in the report. I thought it appropriate that it should have been. It was not until the Minister himself tabled the letter that the fact was brought out that the chairman had known of the completion date for the inquiry. The last question to be answered is why the Minister confirmed that he wanted the report concluded on time. When Mr Holcroft wrote seeking the extension, the Minister promptly referred it to the Government. Thus it was the Government, not the Minister, which decided that the report should be available for the debate on the new two-airline agreement when it commenced in Parliament. That is quite appropriate. One can imagine the Opposition yowling its head off were that report not to be available when the Government brought the two-airline agreement before the Parliament. Just imagine the furore that the Opposition would have created, with the Holcroft inquiry proceeding and the Opposition not having the benefit of that report during the debate. That is the complete opposite of what the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) has said. It was quite appropriate that it should be here so that Parliament could consider both aspects of the aviation policy-the continuance of the two-airline policy which followed the domestic air transport review and the question of air fares which flowed out of the Holcroft inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that has been common to aviation debates in this place for a long time is the blinkered view that the Opposition always takes of Ansett Airlines. Every Labor speech that has been made in this Parliament during the 20 years for which I have been here has attacked Ansett Airlines. Sir Reginald Ansett used to cop it in speech after speech from the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones). It was a tiresome business. The honourable member for Newcastle always threatened that when Labor got into government it would dismantle Ansett, send it broke or do something to it. Of course, the honourable member failed in his objective. Ansett is carrying on as strongly as ever. Not only Sir Reginald Ansett has been attacked. It has been transferred to the new proprietors, in the person of Sir Peter Abeles. The speech of the honourable member for Shortland was a bitter attack upon Sir Peter Abeles and Mr Rupert Murdoch. The same sort of difficulty is experienced by the new management in dealing with the Labor Party which has a blinkered view of free enterprise. It is scared stiff that private enterprise might succeed; that the people of Australia will see that socialism cannot provide the answers; that free enterprise can provide both the answers and the jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> In the five years during which the honourable member for Shortland has been leading for the Opposition in aviation debates in this Parliament he has failed to produce a comprehensive and cohesive platform for aviation. I refer to the Australian Labor Party's platform, constitution and rules. We ought to have the benefit of that document's being tabled so we can see how much aviation is mentioned in it. Under the reference to transport the only relevant word is the word 'air'. It refers to 'road, air and water'. That is the totality of Labor's policy on aviation. It comes here bereft of policies and attacks a Minister who has done a genuine job, whose integrity and honesty since he has been in Parliament have never been in doubt. The best that Labor can do is move a censure motion of such a poor nature as this. I move:</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Government has, over the years, pursued policies that are aimed at protecting the Australian coastline. In keeping with that history, I am now introducing a package of legislation entitled 'Protection of the Sea'. The package represents a major advance in marine pollution prevention and combat in Australia. These matters have been the subject of detailed discussion with the States in the Marine and Ports Council and also with industry. Australia has been participating for more than 30 years in international organisations that develop international conventions on maritime matters. Australia has a good record in implementing these international agreements after they come into force. Australia as an island continent has a long coastline that, in places, is environmentally extremely sensitive and I believe it is now opportune to introduce legislation to augment the existing law. </PARA>
<PARA> The 'Protection of the Sea' legislation package contains the following Bills: Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Bill, Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Bill, Protection of the Sea (Discharge of Oil from Ships) Bill, Navigation (Protection of the Sea) Amendment Bill, Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Bill and Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Understandings on Offshore Matters reached at the Premiers Conference in June 1979 provide for Commonwealth legislation on certain matters relating to ship-sourced marine pollution. The six Bills accord with the Understandings. The Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Bill will implement the provisions of the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969 and the 1976 Protocol to that Convention. The Convention requires ships carrying more than 2,000 tons of oil in bulk as cargo to maintain insurance to cover liability for pollution damage. The Convention and the Bill provide for ship owners to limit their liability to an amount determined by the size of the ship. The maximum level of compensation available under the provisions of the Convention is in excess of $A14.9m but this amount relates to tankers with a register tonnage of more than 105,000 tons. No tankers of that size trade to Australia. The maximum liability for an incident involving the largest tanker in the Australian fleet would approximate $A7.8m. The Bill preserves the operation of State and Territory laws that give effect to Convention requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is appropriate to outline the other measures that are envisaged by the 'Protection of the Sea' legislation package so that honourable members will be aware of the interrelationship of the various Bills. The Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Bill will implement the provisions of the 1969 International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties. The Bill will also implement the provisions of the 1973 Protocol to that Convention. Where pollution or a threat of a pollution incident exists the Bill empowers the Minister to take any appropriate action on the high seas or in territorial waters in regard to Australian or foreign ships. I, as Minister, will be required to have regard to Convention constraints which are incorporated in the Bill in using this power. The Bill preserves the operation of State and Territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1970, Part VIIA of the Navigation Act 1912 has included provisions based on the Civil Liability and Intervention Conventions. The Navigation (Protection of the Sea) Amendment Bill will repeal Part VIIA of the Navigation Act so that the Bills I have just outlined can give full effect to the provisions of the respective Conventions. Part VIIA of the Navigation Act currently contains intervention powers which are broader than the powers conferred by the Convention or Protocol. Australia has always asserted that customary international law provides a nation with powers to protect its territory and coastal sea. The Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Bill will continue to apply these provisions in Australian pollution legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Protection of the Sea (Discharge of Oil from Ships) Bill will repeal and replace the Pollution of the Sea by Oil Act 1960. That Act gives effect to the provisions of the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil. The new Bill picks up the provisions of the 1960 Act and, in addition, will implement the requirements of the two 1971 Amendments to the Convention. The first amendment will provide increased protection to the Great Barrier Reef by prohibiting the operational discharge of oil within or near the reef by redefining the Convention term 'nearest land'. The new arrangement will ensure that oil is not discharged within 50 miles of the outer edge of the Great Barrier Reef. The second 1971 amendment to the 1954 Convention imposed limits on the size and location of cargo tanks in tankers. The new Bill applies these provisions to Australian ships. </PARA>
<PARA> The Navigation (Protection of the Sea) Amendment Bill repeals Part VIIA of the Navigation Act 1912, as I mentioned earlier. It also inserts a new Division 12 in Part IV of the Navigation Act. The new Division imposes requirements on tanker owners and masters in relation to survey, certification and production of certificates. These provisions are included in the Navigation Act to maintain the various survey and construction requirements in one piece of legislation. In addition, I, as Minister, will have power to direct foreign tankers to take certain action while the tanker is within the Australian jurisdiction. These powers will be exercised only insofar as it is necessary to do so to protect the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining Bills in the package are the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Bill and the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Bill. These Bills respectively repeal and replace the Pollution of the Sea by Oil (Shipping Levy) Act 1972 and the Pollution of the Sea by Oil (Shipping Levy Collection) Act 1972. The new Bills maintain all the provisions of the existing Acts, but change the titles of the legislation to maintain uniformity with the remainder of the legislation package. </PARA>
<PARA> The Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Bill includes a new provision to ensure that the minimum amount of levy able to be collected will be maintained at an economic level. In addition, the definition of oil in the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Bill has been extended to include a wider range of hydrocarbon pollutants. That establishes the relationship of this Bill to the other Bills in the package. I commend the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

These provisions implement the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil. This Bill makes provision to bring into force the 1971 amendments to the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil. These amendments relate to cargo tank sizes and location in tankers and also make provision for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef. The Pollution of the Sea by Oil Acts of 1960, 1965 and 1972 are repealed and replaced by this Bill. I commend this Bill to honourable members.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1967. The Australian Tourist Commission Act 1967 established an Australian Tourist Commission for the purpose of the encouragement of travel to and within Australia by people from other countries. The act was assented to on 23 May 1967. The principal Act has been amended on three occasions to date; namely, in December 1973 by the Statute Law Revision Act 1973; in October 1974 by the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1974; and in June 1978 by the Administrative Changes (Consequential Provisions) Act of 1978. The 1974 amendments allowed the Australian Tourist Commission to engage in domestic tourism promotion and extended the membership of the Commission from seven to nine. The amendments to the Act which I now propose have three main purposes; namely, to increase the total number of commissioners from nine to 10; to increase the number of State and Territory representatives on the Commission from two to three; and to bring the financial provisions of the Act into line with legislation covering comparable statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Increase in number of commissioners</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In discussing the proposed amendments I turn firstly to the need to increase the membership of the Commission to enable Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory representation on the Australian Tourist Commission on the same basis as the States. At its meeting in August 1979 the Tourist Ministers Council, a body comprising the Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers having responsibility for tourism matters, agreed that the Northern Territory should be accorded membership of the ATC through incorporation into an existing rotational system of representation. This decision was made in the light of progress in the Constitutional development of the Territory. In its March 1980 report on Tourism in the Australian Capital Territory, the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory recommended:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Tourist Commission Act 1967 be amended to allow the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory to be represented on the Australian Tourist Commission on the same basis as the States. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Right Honourable Sir Phillip Lynch, and the former Minister for the Capital Territory, the Honourable R. J. Ellicott, raised the question of Commission membership by the Australian Capital Territory at the April 1980 meeting of the Tourist Ministers Council. The Council agreed to the proposal subject to the number of State and Territory representatives being increased from two to three. The Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are important tourist destinations with tourism making a significant contribution to the economies of these areas. Some two million people visited the Australian Capital Territory last year. It is logical, therefore, that each Territory should be able to take its turn along with the States in providing membership of the national body concerned with the promotion of tourism. </PARA>
<PARA>State and Territory representatives</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Against this background and in recognition of the wishes of the Tourist Ministers Council, the amending legislation provides for the increase in total membership of the Commission from nine to 10, thereby allowing three members to be persons nominated by the States and Territories. Consequent upon the increase in total membership of the Commission, the Bill provides for the increase in the number of members required for a quorum from five to six. Needless to say the Bill preserves the position of existing commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial and other provisions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to financial and other provisions of the principal Act, aim to bring the Act into line with legislation covering comparable statutory authorities and incorporate further consequential amendments as necessary to accommodate these changes. Clause 4-removes reference to the redundant Superannuation Act 1922. Clauses 5 and 6 bring the provisions of the Act into line with recommendations of the Bowen Committee relating to removal of members and disclosure of interests by members. Clause 8 brings the financial provisions of the Act into line with legislation covering comparable statutory authorities. Clause 9 repeals section 28 of the principal Act, which relates to the application to the Officers' Rights Declaration Act, which will become redundant on the proclamation of the Public Service Amendment Act 1978. Clause 10 repeals reference to section 29 of the principal Act, concerning reports, which will become redundant on the twenty-eighth day after the day on which the Act receives royal assent. Provisions concerning reports are embodied in Part V-Finance of the amendment Act 1981. Clause 11 takes account of formal amendments to the principal Act as scheduled. Clause 12 clarifies the commission's powers to function pending the enactment and proclamation of the amending legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the Territories will wish to see the way cleared as soon as possible for the new system of representation, under which they will in due course enjoy representation on the same basis as the States. It was with this in mind that the Government accorded a high priority to this legislation. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The continuing policy of the Government is to strengthen the parliamentary system and to enable Parliament adequately to review the activities of government administration. In recent years the Government has taken a number of major steps in this area. These include the establishment of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure to allow for closer examination of the effectiveness and economy of public expenditure in the delivery of Government policy, and the expansion of the Public Accounts Committee's charter to bring within its purview the accounts of statutory authorities and other government bodies. The Bill now before honourable members provides a similar expansion to the role of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. </PARA>
<PARA> The current Public Works Committee Act 1969, provides as a general rule that a public work to be undertaken within Australia or an external Territory for a Commonwealth department and estimated to cost more than $2m, shall not be commenced unless it has been considered by the Committee. The major thrust of this Bill is to bring the works of statutory authorities, instrumentalities and other bodies as well as overseas works, under the purview of the Public Works Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Some authorities and types of works will continue to be exempt from the Act because of their special nature. The works of the Northern Territory Government and the Administration of Norfolk Island are exempted because of the relationship between the administrations and the Commonwealth, while Commonwealth works in these territories will continue to be subject to Public Works Committee review-these arrangements are parallel to provisions in the Public Accounts Committee Act. Similarly the works of bodies established jointly by the Commonwealth with the States or other countries are exempted, as are overseas aid works because of their bilateral nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The works of the tertiary education institutions in the Australian Capital Territory are already subject to careful examination by the Tertiary Education Commission. These works are therefore exempted to avoid duplication. The National Capital Development Commission and the Parliament House Construction Authority are also exempted because of their specific legislation and functions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is recognised by the Government that certain authorities which trade, or which provide services and compete with the private sector, require considerable autonomy and flexibility. In some cases their investment proposals and financial and consortium arrangements should not reasonably be subject to an external review. The Bill therefore enables regulations to be made to exempt such authorities from the Act. It should be noted that provision is made for specific works of authorities which are not subject to the Act to be declared examinable by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a number of other amendments to improve the workings of the Committee. The Committee is being given the discretionary power to conduct inquiries in private, and in respect of urban land development works the Committee may report without an inquiry. Repetitive type works may also be exempted from review following agreement with the Committee. With regard to the Committee's inquiries into overseas works, the Government is mindful of the legal and constitutional difficulties if the Committee were to conduct inquiries and take evidence in overseas countries. The Bill therefore limits the Committee's inquiries into these works to the consideration of plans, models and statements placed before it, and to the taking of evidence from people already in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to allow a period of 12 months to elapse after the Bill's date of assent before the works of authorities become subject to the Act. This is in recognition of the need to allow for the alterations to lead times and work loads involved in allowing for Public Works Committee review. The Public Works Committee had requested that the Act be changed to enable the Committee to make random investigations of works costing less than $2m. The Government has rejected this request for two main reasons: Firstly, the responsibilities of the Committee have already been considerably widened by this Bill; and secondly, there would be severe administrative difficulties for Commonwealth departments and authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is understood that the Committee was particularly concerned with cases where major works costing over $2m have been phased in over several years with small projects, that is below $2m. These projects have either escaped Committee scrutiny, or if referred to the Committee, have been referred at a stage where proper Committee investigation has been pre-empted by the work already done. The Government expects works totalling over $2m to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, and will do all it can to ensure that all works required to be examined by the Committee in accordance with the Public Works Committee Act will be so examined. I have assured the Committee that should it wish to examine any work below $2m the Government would treat any request sympathetically, and would facilitate Committee investigation of any such work. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also sought authority to examine works proposals of the National Capital Development Commission. Clause 6B of the Bill enables the Government to prescribe certain works of the NCDC as public works for purposes of the Public Works Committee Act, and thus open for scrutiny by the Committee. However, it is anticipated that the bulk of works by NCDC will be exempted from examination by the Committee. The Government can assure the House and the Committee that should the Committee wish to examine any specific work of the NCDC, the Government would treat any request sympathetically and would facilitate Committee investigation of any such work. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, let me say something about the timing of the debate on these three Bills because it is indicative of the way this House is being mismanaged at the present time. These three Bills were listed for debate last night. I was ready to open the debate on them. The Government Whip had asked me courteously how long I thought I would take with them. I was given every indication that the debate would be brought on at that time. Indeed, just as I was about to be called to speak on the legislation, without any warning being given to me and without the normal courtesies at all, the Minister in the chamber at the time moved that the House adjourn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to refer to the timing of the debate, to the organisation of the House, and to record my objection to the way in which the House is being run and to the discourtesies which are being shown to the Opposition. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I know that the excuse will be given that the change was due to certain moves to suspend Standing Orders in order to bring on a debate relating to a censure motion of a Minister which had been due to come on for some time. The fact is that that censure motion eventually was brought on this morning. With the benefit of hindsight the Government surely recognised that the censure motion would be brought on eventually. If it had told the Opposition that the motion were to be brought on before the end of the week we would not have lost all the time we lost yesterday seeking to suspend Standing Orders so as to bring on that debate and we would not have had the sorts of discourtesies that we had in relation to debate on the legislation now before us. To add insult to injury I would at this stage merely mention that having moved the adjournment of the House 20 minutes or so early last night, the Government then gagged debate on the adjournment. I take this opportunity to object to that as well. No notice was given that it only wanted--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very much related to the timing of the debate of these Bills. I am glad that the point has been made to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I hope that the point has been made to others who are organising this House that if they treat the Opposition in this way then the time of this House will be wasted in divisions instead of being used in debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We eventually get around to these three Bills. On the one hand they are about what I call social democracy or democratic socialism-I do not care which of those two phrases is used-and they are also about industry policy. I want to say a little about each. I raise the subject of democratic socialism under the heading of these three Bills because the three measures are an example of the Fraser Government, in spite of its rhetoric, intervening in the market-place on behalf of the community. In spite of all the words that are spoken about free enterprise and the Government not intervening in the private sector, at least two of these three Bills add up to a sensible example of a government deciding that subsidies are required and that intervention is necessary. As a democratic socialist I applaud this. On behalf of the Opposition, I support the example of intervention in the market-place displayed in this piece of democratic socialism. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as we believe that there must be macro-economic management of the economy to minimise unemployment and inflation, and just as we believe that there must be action by government to provide those services on which the private sector defaults to such a large extent, such as moderate cost housing, health care and more satisfactory urban transportation, so too we believe as democratic socialists in democratic socialist measures such as this one-intervention to subsidise some area of production where otherwise jobs would be lost. True liberals indulge in rhetoric against this sort of approach. They hold that all possible economic decisions should be left to the freely competitive market. While we have a government of the political complexion of the present coalition government there is always a danger that its actions might live up to its words. The whole of the Australian motor vehicle manufacturing industry at the present time is in danger because the Industries Assistance Commission has issued a draft report making recommendations which follow the liberals' free market philosophies. While we have a non-Labour government in this country those IAC recommendations could be adopted with enormously adverse results for our country. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to give the impression that there is not a place for the market. Of course there is. It renders highly useful service. But in economics there are no absolutes, and we should not allow the rhetoric which suggests that there are absolutes. The only sensible policy towards the market is one of open-minded pragmatism. Where it works, the market should be allowed to work; where it does not work, there has to be intervention. I am very glad to note that the Government has forgotten its rhetoric, adopted a piece of democratic socialism, and intervened in the market as it has in two of the three Bills that are before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of the Bills I will discuss is the Bounty (Non-adjustable Wrenches) Bill, which provides for temporarty assistance to be given to the industry producing non-adjustable wrenches or spanners in Australia. The local spanner industry essentially comprises Siddons Industries Ltd, an Australian company which manufactures spanners under the Sidchrome name at Heidelberg in Victoria. Siddons suffered a decline in market share from 25 per cent to 16 per cent between 1976-77 and 1979-80. The Temporary Assistance Authority recommended in August last year that a bounty of 11c per unit be paid to preserve the local industry. We in the Opposition consider that it would be lamentable if the capacity in Australia to produce such implements were lost. Up to 400 jobs depend on this industry, and the continued production of wrenches has some defence industry relevance. So there we have an intervention in the market-place which is of a democratic socialist nature and which, of course, we in the Labor Opposition can therefore support wholeheartedly. </PARA>
<PARA> The next Bill is the Bounty (Polyester-Cotton Yarn) Amendment Bill, which extends the application of the bounty scheme for this industry until the end of 1981. It will then be replaced by new industry until the end of 1981. It will then be replaced by new bounty arrangements determined within the overall assistance measures being adopted for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. We in the Labor Opposition have supported the provision of this bounty in the past, and its benefits have been reflected in the strong growth of this section of the industry in recent years. Cotton mills in Australia are substantially located in decentralised areas and provide important employment opportunities in regional centres. Mr Deputy Speaker, you represent regional areas of Queensland and you will understand the great need for employment in regional towns like Maryborough. I am not sufficiently acquainted with your area to know whether you have any textile, clothing or footwear plants in your part of the world, but you will know, as I know, that there are many other regional centres of this nation where so many jobs are very dependent on this industry. There is great need for it to be supported, and in my case I am particularly pleased that that support comes in the form of a bounty to encourage scale economies and, we hope, re-industrialisation improving the productivity of an industry so that it becomes more competitive with imports. Accordingly, once again, this is a good democratic socialist piece of legislation, providing for intervention in the market-place. I readily support the Bill and so do my colleagues on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coal Excise Amendment Bill 1981 is in a slightly different category. It is essentially a machinery measure which extends from seven to 28 days the allowable period for making an entry in respect of excise duties imposed on coal. The previous period allowed has proven too short and is administratively difficult to comply with. We have no objection to the Bill. In fact, the Coal Excise Act goes back to 1949, when there was a Labor Government in this country. The purpose of the Act was to ensure that funds were received to pay for long service leave benefits granted to certain employees in the coal mining industry and for the Coal Research Trust Account. We understand from the research we have done that the collection of funds for these very valuable purposes was difficult because the Act laid down only seven days for that purpose. So, we are glad that in this third piece of legislation machinery is now being instituted which will enable those funds to be collected in 28 days instead of seven days. The Opposition has no objection to the third Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned in my introduction that these three pieces of legislation were to do not only with democratic socialism, or social democracy, but also with industry policy. Just as I have talked about the former, I would now like to talk about the latter of which bounty Bills in particular are so much an essential part. Discussion of bounty assistance measures provides us with an opportunity to consider the overall effectiveness of bounties and other industry assistance measures. At the present time there is a growing concern in the community that, as a consequence of structural change pressures in the Australian economy, the manufacturing industries of this country will decline in importance. This is a real threat. Leading Government advisers such as the Secretary to the Treasury, John Stone, are on public record as advocating a reduction in activity levels in a number of areas of manufacturing in order to facilitate development of mines, quarrries and capital-intensive mineral processing plants. John Stone is on record as suggesting that one of the offsetting features of policy against what will happen in the so-called resource based boom, is that there will be more imports into this country, which of course will be an enormous threat to our existing manufacturing industry, which manufactures products in competition with imports and seeks to get out into the export market and win new revenue through exports and new job opportunities for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I say in passing that I find it a very sad feature of government in this country at the present time that a lot of the major speeches on economic policy in particular are being made by senior public servants. I think we should do more than just pay lip service to the Westminster system. We should see to it that the policy which is being mooted and discussed in the community is being discussed by Government Ministers or Opposition shadow Ministers, not by public servants who have to serve both sides and who ostensibly, under present procedures, would serve both sides of politics. That is not happening. Some of the more prominent pronouncements are coming from people such as the Secretary of the Treasury, John Stone, instead of from his Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there are occasions when heads of departments must read speeches on behalf of Ministers when the Ministers are unable to speak when they have been invited to do so. But I think it is totally wrong that policy options are being flown, as kites are flown, by heads of departments who should serve whichever party is in government. It is almost as though the ideologues in the Treasury and in the Government's ranks-following on from what John Stone of the Treasury has said-want to ensure that the worst possible effects of the expansion of our resource based industries actually occur. They seem utterly unconcerned about the tens of thousands of jobs that are at stake. They are quite unable to show where replacement jobs are to be found, particularly when the problems of regional and skill imbalances are taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> It is imperative that these destructive attitudes be rejected. There is absolutely no need for a sharp reduction in activity levels in Australian manufacturing industries. The resources, labour and capital in those industries are generally not transferable to the mining and quarrying industries. Moreover, the employment likely to be generated in the current decade by the expansion of resource industries will not be sufficient to provide jobs for even half of the expanding work force. Up to a million extra jobs will be needed in the coming decade just to keep up with the work force growth. We have up in the Gallery young people who will be coming into the work force in the years to come. We have at the moment a net figure of about 120,000 people coming into the work force each year. Even though the bulge in the birth rate will mean that from the mid-1980s onwards the figure may reduce to a net 80,000 or 70,000 a year, honourable members on both sides of this Parliament will still face an enormous challenge in ensuring that the number of jobs required to meet that net increase in the work force is found in this country. We should go beyond that and find the extra number of jobs required to reduce the present horrific figure of half a million people unemployed in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not find those jobs entirely out of the quarrying or entirely out of the resource based industries. The best research shows that that will not happen. That brings us back to manufacturing industry policy and to tertiary industry policies as well. It brings us back to the sorts of policies that are involved in the Bills before us, through which we have bounties as one means of encouraging the expansion of manufacturing industries in order to create those jobs. I repeat, the resource based industries will provide directly only about 10 per cent of the jobs we need and will provide indirectly another 30 per cent at the very most. This means that at least 60 per cent of employment growth must be generated by other means. So manufacturing industries must not be dismantled. In fact, we must build up our manufacturing capacity because a lot of new jobs in the tertiary sector are related to that manufacturing capacity. I believe that we need to find new areas of manufacturing industry growth and not just ensure that existing manufacturing capacity is not dismantled. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Government's policies are not addressed to this need. The manufacturing industries of Australia have been hammered by the restrictive monetary and fiscal policies which are so central to the Government's economic and social attitudes. The production index of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd has shown almost no growth over the past 12 months. Indeed, to be accurate-the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume), who is interested in this debate would know this-the figure is 1.9 per cent, indicating almost no growth. We must all have as an objective a far greater growth rate than that if we are to create the number of jobs necessary to keep pace with the increase in the work force and, indeed, to make a dent in the present disgraceful level of unemployment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In most industries capacity utilisation is extraordinarily low-typically about 70 per cent-the only exceptions being a narrow range of industries supplying materials and equipment for their resource projects. But of equal importance is the fact that pathetic efforts have been made to encourage new industries in this country. The Government has placed virtually its whole emphasis on the resource based industries, namely, the mining, quarrying and aluminium industries. A comparable effort has not been made in the technology based industries-for example, in electronics, communications, bio-industries, new materials and aerospace. These rapidly growing industries in the world market have not been adequately promoted within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) has been busily lauding the merits of the Government's offset manufacturing policies. Lately the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) has been trumpeting the benefits of new industries based on high technology. But what are the facts? They are certainly not as one would imagine them to be, judging from some of the public relations outbursts from those two Ministers. The offset policy is presently miniscule. Offsets generated represent as little as one-fifth of one per cent of manufacturing industry turnover. The Government's disastrous failure to define appropriate defence producement requirements for Australia has meant that the largest project, the tactical fighter replacement, has been subject to one delay after another. Indeed, if we had such offset policies we might not need this bounty Bill in relation to wrenches. </PARA>
<PARA>There might then be sufficient work and sufficient demand for the product of the Siddons factory referred to and others instead of our having to pay out from revenue this amount. I am simply suggesting that that is a possibility so that I keep my remarks within the scope of this Bill. I see that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, think-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for the compliment, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think you understand that this legislation represents an essential part of industry policy generally and gives me an opportunity to talk about other aspects of industry policy. The experience with the industrial research and development incentives program has similarly been one of mismanagement by the Government. In the recent 1979-80 annual report of the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Board, the chairman states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Board's task was again made somewhat difficult by the limitations placed at various times during the year on project grant commitments. Similarly additional funding required to acquit industry entitlements under the commencement grant scheme was not received until mid-June which meant that a substantial number of applications had to be held in abeyance pending the availability of these funds. </PARA>
<PARA>In the offsets policy and in the research and development policy we see the real nature of this Government's commitment to Australian industry. It is one of mismanagement, of not taking advantage of all the opportunities that present themselves-indeed, one of penny pinching of the most disruptive kind. Needless to say, the experience has been similar in the various export incentives schemes under which, typically, payments have been delayed for many months. In the meantime, Australia's industrial potential is declining. I mentioned earlier that the rates of factory usage had fallen to between 60 and 70 per cent. In other words, our existing factories have an enormous capacity which we should utilize before we start to build new ones to promote growth in order to create new jobs which, in turn will absorb the net increase in the work force and reduce the present terrible levels of unemployment in this country. I repeat that instead of being regenerated, the industry of this country is declining. Whereas the electronics and communications industries have been areas of strong demand growth, Australian employment in these industries has fallen by 45 per cent since the beginning of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not listen to anybody from the other side of the House suggest, as perhaps some of them will try to suggest, that this decline came mainly during the Labor Government's period in office. That period was part of an international economic downturn. The sorts of things happening in the country at that time were happening in other parts of the world. Since then there has been re-industrialisation in many other countries. There has been a growth in the number of people employed. In this country, in spite of an energy equation which is in our favour, we have not, because of a lack of proper government policies, been living up to our potential. A lid has been kept on our economy. We have had virtually no growth. The figure recorded for the last financial year was 1.9 per cent. That is a disgrace. It means that many more people are unemployed now than need be. New opportunities have now arisen which should be taken advantage of. They are not being taken advantage of because of the policy of stagnation in this country at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Electronics component production has virtually ceased. This is just one example of the neglect of the technology-based industries. It is high time the Government recognised that the resources industries are not a panacea for all our ills. They will not provide enough jobs for all our needs. They will not provide satisfying and varied employment opportunities for our growing and increasingly better educated work force. They will not alone guarantee a secure and balanced future for this country. Australia's development strategy must include a reinvigoration of manufacturing industry. Leadership must be provided by the national Government, as it is in most other advanced countries, and not left to the effects of so-called market forces. Development strategies depend so much on government policy, the co-ordination of investment and the development of technological advantages that markets simply do not work. We are not talking about following comparative advantages but determining for ourselves what are our comparative advantages and what they should be. </PARA>
<PARA> The national Government can provide this leadership by devising a plan for the development of industry. This planning approach should then be backed by selective industry assistance policies which combine research, export, investment and production subsidies in an appropriate mix. Two of the three Bills before us contain some subsidies but they are interim ones until others take over. Bounties are probably the most efficient form of subsidy but I repeat that the Bills before us are interim measures. Bounties have minimal price effects and are readily adjusted. Direct government involvement may also be necessary in some instances, particularly where an industry is internationally dominated by a few firms, such as the computer and aerospace industries. In circumstances such as these, complete reliance on private sector entrepreneurship is not sufficient. We need government departments such as the Department of Science and Technology and the old Department of Productivity to stimulate such entrepreneurship. I give credit to some of the innovations that have taken place in that field in recent months. The Australian people will not get the sort of leadership, not the necessary amount of it, from the Fraser Government. So many of its members are still paying lip service to a market-only approach. We need more stimulus and partnership between the public sector, the government and the private sector for the sorts of objectives I have outlined to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The bounty measures we are considering, like virtually all the Government's industry policies, aim not at new development but at protecting industries which have been long established. We need both. In these Bills we can fairly observe that this Government's approach to industry is one of living on our historical inheritance, either benefits handed from former entrepreneurs or the benefits of what can be dug from the ground, instead of getting out into the new world and seeking new jobs built on new areas of activity. What we badly need now is a series of new initiatives which develop Australia's potential for participating in higher technology industry. The continued neglect of this need by the present Government is deserving of the strongest condemnation. However, I repeat that a little is better than nothing. The two bounty Bills are supported by the Opposition because they at least preserve some of the jobs in areas where they should be preserved. However, in themselves they are insufficient. We need a whole new approach to creating jobs in manufacturing industry instead of the laissez fairism we are suffering in this country at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We on this side of the House sympathise with the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) in his difficulty in being obliged to speak for half an hour about three Bills, the Bounty (Polyester-Cotton Yarn) Amendment Bill, the Bounty (Non-adjustable Wrenches) Bill and the Coal Excise Amendment Bill, which he supports. He sought synthetically to discover elements of the Government's policy in this area with which he is in disagreement. There were elements of what he said with which I agree. Bounties are certainly the most efficient and proper manner in which support should be given to Australian industries. If we rely on tariffs or other hidden benefits the taxpayer is not clearly aware of what sort of support is being given to individual industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that many people in the cities complain bitterly about the level of bounties and subsidies to people in rural industries because the costs of these bounties and subsidies are so clearly evident. If we could ensure that all support for the manufacturing industries in the cities were clearly available in the form of bounties rather than being hidden in tariffs so that one cannot state exactly what the real cost is, I believe that the debate which divides the city and the country in many areas could be eliminated. One could see quite clearly what were the costs of the support given to manufacturing and other city industries and many country industries. I recognise, of course, that there are many manufacturing industries in rural areas. That is true of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I am surprised that the honourable member for Adelaide is so sensitive about his commitment to socialism that he felt obliged to explain and justify it. He regarded these three Bills as democratic socialism because they involve an intervention in the market-place. The nonsense that the honourable member for Adelaide raised is worthy of investigation. I wonder whether he would regard the erection of borders as being intervention in the market-place. These Bills are concerned with the borders of a nation. They deal with the relationship of this nation with other nations. That does not, I imagine, represent to the honourable member intervention in the market-place. If it does, it is surprising. When the honourable member's Government was in office-I know that he was not a Minister and so I suppose he cannot be blamed-its level of activity in this area was to bring about the destruction of 125,000 jobs in Australian manufacturing industry by an across-the-board, not thought out, irrational 25 per cent cut in tariffs. This had a devastating effect on Australian manufacturing industry. If that is democratic socialism at work, I do not think the Australian people want much of it. I submit that perhaps the wrong definition has been given by the honourable member for Adelaide in a desperate attempt to justify his curious philosophic position. Having supported the wiping out of tariffs as a member of the Labor Government with the consequent loss of 125,000 jobs, he now commends the present Government for being democratic socialists by doing exactly the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise now the realities of these Bills. Certainly, as the honourable member for Adelaide has said, the Coal Excise Amendment Bill simply makes it easier in an administrative sense to implement the requirement that collections should be made of information on the production of coal. Making the period 28 days rather than seven days is simply a sensible proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The bounty on non-adjustable wrenches is, as the honourable member for Adelaide has said, simply a temporary one. He said that in a critical sense, as if it was somehow unpleasant or unreasonable. What he did not go on to say is that an assessment of the need for the continuance of the bounty assistance beyond 12 months will be undertaken by the Industries Assistance Commission as part of its overall examination of cutlery, industrial knives and hand tools manufacture on which it is to report to the Government by 30 June. I cannot see that it is a matter for criticism that, pending a detailed investigation and a report being made to the Government, this temporary assistance should be given. I cannot understand why the honourable member for Adelaide should find that to be an issue on which he should be critical. </PARA>

To the contrary, an overall study is clearly under way and a report is due by June of this year. I would have thought that it would have been fairer of him to have adopted a more bal- anced approach on that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of the bounty for polyester-cotton yarn, the same situation applies. In fact, this is an interim measure. From 1 January 1982 new bounty arrangements for polyester-cotton yarns will come into effect. They are part of the Government's proposed program for assistance to the textiles, clothing and footwear industries beyond 1981. This is not an ad hoc measure. It is an interim one while long term proposals are being introduced. It was unreasonable and unfair of the honourable member for Adelaide, in his desperate search for things on which to criticise the Government about three Bills which he supports, to have raised these matters in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it worth while to mention, however, that there are some problems about this kind of legislation. Many people take the view that it is in the best interests of Australia as a whole not to have artificial support for industries which are in competition with industries overseas. I stress that this does not involve intervention within the market place of corporations in Australia. It concerns the relationship with other countries. It seems to me that if one seeks to protect Australian industries one will naturally be increasing in one way or another the costs to Australian taxpayers. A bounty is a simple method because it is the taxpayers alone who carry the burden. It is not carried forward into a cost of living figure, as would a tariff. That is why I believe that the way in which the Government is going about it is by far the most sensible one. I am glad to see that the honourable member for Adelaide agrees. </PARA>
<PARA> However, many people take the view that the cost to the taxpayer can never be justified by the number of jobs that are created or saved in this way. All that I would like to emphasise is that, despite the comments of the honourable member for Adelaide, in the last five years there has been an increase of 400,000 in the number of people at work in Australia. In the main they have been males. The allegations of honourable members opposite that the bulk of this employment has been in part time female work is arrant nonsense and they know it. This 400,000 increase in the number at work in Australia comes as a surprise to the people who listen to the rhetoric of honourable members opposite and to the criticism that manufacturing industry has not expanded,that it has done nothing. When one puts into reverse a loss of something like 125,000 jobs in manufacturing industry under a Labor Government, in a period of some 18 months, as a result of that Government's determined tariff policies, a fair case is made out for saying that Australian manufacturing has progressed far better under this Government. Certainly it has far greater prospects. This can be seen from the dramatic recovery in the export levels of manufacturing industry since the Government came to office. It has been largely as a result of the increasing competitiveness of Australian industry as against that of overseas industry. This emerges largely from the fact that we have managed to hold our inflation rate far below that of other countries. That is why I was intrigued to hear the honourable member for Adelaide say that the reason Labor had problems when in government was that it was part of an economic downturn which affected the whole world at the time. Let me remind him of what has been happening around the world in the last couple of years. If that has not been an economic downturn, I wonder what it has been. In fact, Australia has managed to be largely insulated from the economic problems facing the rest of the world. That has been possible because of the sound economic management that the honourable member for Adelaide so denigrates. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me to be curious that he is prepared to diminish at all times the real achievements of this Government in increasing the numbers of people who are employed, in manufacturing industries in particular, and in bringing to an end the downturn in employment which took place under Labor-not because of special overseas factors which are not now affecting Australia but simply because Labor's economic management allowed runaway inflation, which put our costs far above those obtaining in the rest of the world. Because this Government has held the inflation rate down, relative to that of other countries, costs have enabled manufacturing industry to play a much more competitive part in the trading world. As a result, we have achieved a big increase in employment. </PARA>
<PARA> But why do we have to put up with these bounties? Why do we have to protect ourselves against other nations of the world? It is disappointing to note that this is not a perfect world. Many Australian industries which could compete very successfully, particularly those in the rural sector, are not given the opportunity to do so by the major trading groups, such as the European Common Market, in particular, because of the offensive and restrictive trade policies adopted by those nations. Instead of allowing the sort of access that Australia and New Zealand, in particular, used to have to Great Britain before it joined the Common Market, products from that group are now being dumped around the world-I might say by the use of the same sort of bounty and subsidy arrangements that we have in this Bill. It may well be that this Bill could be regarded as some sort of retaliation for the unfriendly trading practices which now are commonplace throughout the world, particularly in the European Common Market. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to stress especially the impact that this kind of bounty, when applied to agricultural products in Europe, has on Australia. Cheese and other dairy products which used to flow from Australia to the Common Market have been effectively blocked by unfair bounty payments in the Common Market. That practice is now spreading heavily into the meat industry, and I must declare that I have an interest in that area. Meat industry support, through subsidies and bounties, in the European Common Market has been so great that instead of being a massive importer the Common Market will probably this year become the world's biggest exporter of meat. The meat industry there has been artificially subsidised by the taxpayer. This should underline for Australia the dangers and the excesses of the sort of measure that we are employing now. However, we are not using it to excess, rather to protect the position that obtains. It is disconcerting to find that we are required to bring in this kind of legislation because of the unreasnable way in which bounties and subsidies, as well as prohibitions and limitations specifically on imports by developed countries such as the European Economic Community are putting us in such a disadvantageous position. I emphasise, for example that a figure of some 570,000 tones of carcass weight equivalent last year the Common Market was the world's second largest exporter of meat, after Australia, having been previously one of the major importers. This was made possible only because of the huge subsidies to which I have referred</PARA>
<PARA> An added burden to Australia is that these subsidies mean that the Common Market then dumps subsidised meat products in many meat markets to which we used to export. I refer, for instance, to the Middle East. It is disconcerting to note that quite recently the European Economic Community Commission proposed making a further increase of 9 per cent for the coming financial year in the support given to these bounty and subsidy prices. </PARA>
<PARA> That will mean much higher production and make things worse for the rest of the world. There is no doubt in my mind that the general principle of bounties, tariffs and restraints of this kind is not sound unless we live in a perfect world. Regrettably, we do not live in such a perfect world. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the coal levy because, although it is only very nominal, it does relate to an industry which has another levy, that is the coal export levy. The other day in this House I described what is, in my view, the best way to overcome the relative disadvantage the coal industry suffers because of the discriminatory application of the concept of a levy for coal exports. It seems to me that if it is good enough to hit the coal industry with an export levy it should be good enough to hit every other raw material export with an export levy. It seems to me that such a levy would massively encourage the upgrading and processing of Australian raw materials in Australia. It seems that there is a real need for this encouragement, especially when one considers the pellet plants lying idle in the north-west of Western Australia. Rather than approach this problem the way the Australian Labor Party has approached it by talking about a resources tax or a super-profits tax, which in fact would simply result in a disincentive for people to invest, if a levy similar to that applied in the coal industry were applied to all raw material exports a massive incentive would be provided for all raw material producers to upgrade their products in Australia before exporting. This may be, in the terms of the honourable member for Adelaide, an intervention in the market-place. Once again I would say that in effect this is an intervention at the border of one's nation just as I suggest that two of the three measures the House is discussing represent an intervention at the border but not within our own market-place. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly I hope the Government will give strong consideration to extending the levy on the coal industry to all other raw material producers. I hope that this will serve not only to diminish the use of Australia as a quarry-which some companies have been doing in the sense that they have not upgraded their produce in Australia before exporting it-but also that there would be merit in adopting this approach in some areas of primary industry. There should be, for example, an export levy placed on live animals, but there is no levy on meat being exported. Such a levy would encourage the maintenance of a thriving meat processing industry to the benefit of all Australians, particularly primary producers. Once again I declare my interest in that industry. The same can be said for the wool industry. It is absurd that we export greasy wool when we have a great capacity to produce wool tops. It seems to me that the tradition of Bradford has tended to dominate us far too much in our decision to maintain our exports of wool in greasy form. It may well be that we will have some difficulty dealing with customers overseas because of this, but we do have a capacity to negotiate in regard to these raw materials and the increased revenues that could come from such levies could allow a reduction of the burden which, as the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has quite rightly pointed out, has been carried by pay-as-you-earn taxpayers in recent years. There is no doubt that they have contributed far more to increased revenue in Australia than any other group of taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> The coal levy is a very nominal matter but, nonetheless, it raises an interesting issue in that it relies on the appropriate railway authorities for the issuing of weighbridge certificates. In New South Wales at the moment it is fairly difficult to get effective weighbridge certificates if the shunters will not move the coal. I am particularly disturbed to see that the New South Wales Government has been prepared to accept the existence of industrial disruption which does not cost the people involved any money. It allows this kind of industrial disruption which holds up exports, which is damaging to our balance of payments and which costs jobs in the coal industry, without the New South Wales Government's taking any strong action against the people causing the disruption. The same thing applies to the coal loaders, for example, at Port Kembla. There is a continuing dispute which has cost members of the Transport Workers Union who truck the coal from my electorate something like 62 per cent of their earnings over the last three months. There seems to be a great need for the governments involved-as the Federal Government is involved, through this excise legislation-particularly at the State level, to take a far more responsible view of the services they provide to the users of those services. I hope that the New South Wales Government will accept its responsibility to provide a proper service to the coal industry, particularly through the railways and the coal loading facilities. I support these three Bills. </PARA>

The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) suggested in the course of his speech that policies I supported during the years of the Whitlam Government were responsible for a loss of jobs. I deny that those policies were the cause. I said in the course of my speech that it was international economic factors which were responsible and that, indeed, the picture here was the same as elsewhere. I want to illustrate this very briefly by using some figures which the honourable member used and distorted. He used August 1975 to August 1980 figures and said that employment had increased by 400,000 people. He used that figure today; he has used it previously. This is a distorted picture because the Labor Government policies were still in force until February 1976. When one takes that into consideration, and realises that the Hayden Budget was responsible for what happened between August 1975 and February 1976 when there was a growth of 80,000 jobs in this country, one realises that the honourable member's figures are a distortion of the growth pattern over those five years. Finally, he suggested that my policies during the Whitlam years were worse than his Government's policies since then. I need say no more than that from February 1973 to February 1976 employment growth in this country was 246,000, that is over three times the growth of that during the time of his Government from February 1976 to February 1979. During that period the growth was a mere, paltry 71,900 jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>

He said that the Whitlam Government's policies proceeded in their effect into the following years. He is quite right, because there was a very stagnant employment position and, to dramatise the position of why I resent the allegation of distortion, I point out that in the last two years alone there has been an employment growth of 300,000 jobs. I was being very generous to the honourable member and I find it offensive that he should suggest that I am distorting the figures when the reality of the situation is evident.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Currency Amendment Bill now before the House is not contentious and I do not intend to detain the House for very long. The Bill gives authorisation to the Government to mint a $10 silver coin to commemorate the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane in 1982. This coin is to be 92.5 per cent silver, otherwise known as sterling silver. It will be minted in the second half of this year and issued at a price which will be determined nearer to the time of distribution. As the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said in his second reading speech, it will be issued at a price substantially above its face value. The other main aspect of this Bill is to provide that any future issue of new coins will be capable of being implemented by way of regulation rather than by having to amend the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should like to make a few general comments in relation to collector or commemorative coins. The distribution of such coins clearly is something which is very popular in the community. It is an attractive way to hold precious metal. If one looks at the distribution of the gold coins which were minted last year one will find that there has been great community demand for them. As I understand it, the Government has already sold 50,000 of the special proof gold $200 coins at a price of $300 and 207,000 of the $200 uncirculated or bullion-type gold coins at a price of $240 a coin. There was an unmet demand from some 70,000 people for the collector coin which sold at $310. Quite clearly, this is something which has attracted considerable interest in the community and has been an interesting exercise on the part of the Government. In view of this demand for gold coins at substantial prices we can therefore expect that the issue of a silver coin also will be very popular, particularly because it will be offered at a lower price. As I mentioned, that price will not be known until nearer the issuance stage. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted in passing that the distribution of these coins has been a very profitable exercise for the Government. In the second reading speech made last year by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) when amending the Act to allow the gold coins to be minted, he said that the collector coin which sold for $310 would show a profit of some 33 per cent. On that basis, with 50,000 of them having been sold, one can roughly calculate a profit of some $5m. With respect to the bullion-type coin, of which 207,000 have been sold, the Treasurer said that the profit would be relatively small. He did not elaborate further. Assuming that the profit is at least 10 per cent, then a profit of about $5m, and perhaps more, will result from the sale of those 207,000 gold coins. Altogether in this exercise we are looking at a profit in excess of $10m, which is an interesting exercise in public sector activity. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that, according to a recent article in one of our weekend papers, the Government has incurred a considerable cost in the distribution of these coins, and this may have dinted the profit expectations of the Government. I understand that the Ward's organisation was the distribution agent and that it charged some $7.50 delivery for each coin. Presumably, that was well in excess of what the Government thought delivery costs would be because it expected the deliveries to be made by Australia Post at an unspecified cost but, one assumes, well below the eventual cost of $7.50 a coin. Even taking into account the distribution costs, it is clear that the Government has made a considerable profit from the minting of these gold coins. It is also interesting to note that the gold coins were minted when gold prices were near record levels. As I am sure most honourable members are aware, gold prices have fallen considerably since then, and persons who purchased the gold coins from a speculative viewpoint may be rather disappointed about what has happened since. Of course, I suppose eventually gold prices will rise again. I mentioned earlier the provision that in future new coins will be minted by changing the regulations rather than by amending the Act. This seems to us to be a worthwhile amendment. I think that the Parliament has more important matters to debate than the issuing of new coins of this kind. Therefore, the Opposition supports this Bill. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Mr BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member says, they might have got rid of them fairly quickly. Some aspects of this legislation are worth mentioning. Many honourable members hope that the Royal Australian Mint has a greater capacity to cope with the anticipated demand for this silver coin than it showed in its handling of the first gold coin issue, when there was widespread unhappiness throughout the community. Those people who had applied for coins were unhappy to find that not only was there a massive delay in the meeting of their orders or, if they were unsuccessful, in the return of their money, but also that a curious set of rules was introduced after the event which meant that many people who had applied for gold coins were not supplied with the proof coin as requested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that we should adopt a far more business-like approach. I regret to say that the Mint did not cover itself with glory in the manner in which it handled that issue, and I think that it would be wrong for us to pretend anything else. I hope that that unfortunate experience will be usefully noted so that the same thing does not happen when the silver coins are issued. I also suggest that if any other government instrumentalities are involved in what could be described as a merchandising venture of this type which involves the receiving of cheques, that some better system be adopted than simply cashing the cheques, holding the money to the disadvantage of the people involved for up to five months and then sending the cheques back with no interest payment whatsoever. That was not a decent way to deal with the people who applied for these coins and I believe that the Mint acted badly. I hope that measures will be taken to ensure that people are not deprived of what in some instances were quite large sums of money on which interest could well have been earned had the money been invested. It is quite wrong for the Mint to have handled this matter in this way and I must express my disappointment. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter that I think should be discussed is whether it is a good measure to allow future coins to be issued as a result of regulation rather than an Act of parliament. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), rightly, in my mind, said that he thought it would be a sensible development because the Parliament has more to do with its time than just pass Bills of this nature. It is interesting to note the suggestion that if this were done 100 years ago it would have brought about a bloody revolution. Anyone tampering with the coins or with the content of the coins certainly would have caused a fuss. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter that the honourable member for Gellibrand did not raise and which I think is perhaps even more significant than the question of whether new coins can be made by regulation, is that clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill provide for the composition of existing coins to be varied by regulation and for the denominations of the composition of new coins to be prescribed by regulation. This is an interesting measure because it certainly enables the government of the day to play around with the content of the coins if there are major changes, say, in the value of the metals involved or in the value of the currency. Some Government members did express concern about this and they have raised the matter with the Treasurer (Mr Howard). Undertakings have been given that under this Government proper notice will be given to the Parliament of any such regulations which can often slip through unless clear notice is given. I am glad to see that the Opposition supports this Bill which, of course, has the strong support of the Government's back bench. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the House long, but I take this opportunity to make some remarks on the distribution and availability of what are deemed to be collector coins from the Royal Australian Mint and the lack of access of the general public compared with commercial operations to this distribution. This lack of availability did not come to my notice until recently. Last year a series of questions directed to the distribution point at the Mint elicited different information on each occasion on the availability of proof coins. I am not talking about the gold coin at this stage, but the normal annual proof coin distributions. On the first occasion, which was some time in February last year, advice was given that postal applications could be made until some time in August. Subsequently it was indicated that postal applications had in fact closed at the end of February. It was also indicated that coins were available from the Mint on certain dates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I am making is that the general availability and methods by which collector coins are made available are not widely known. Certainly, in seeking information there seems to be some confusion at the Mint itself. There may not be, but the information which was supplied to inquiries I am aware of was inaccurate and it ultimately prevented the inquirer from ordering or obtaining coins. At the time of the initial inquiries, which was early in the year, coins were in fact available from professional dealers at double the price the Mint would normally charge, which would indicate that dealers have first access to supplies of proof coins. There may be reasons for that but I think it is something which the public should be aware of and I think that a statement from the responsible Minister, indicating the means by which people can apply for and obtain coins, would not be inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to refer to the availability of direct sale coins. There is only one production point for these coins. Last year, on the first day of issue of proof coins, some 1,600 people queued up in Canberra for the supply of these coins which are at this stage fashionable items to collect. That means that some 14 million Australians who do not live in Canberra either had to spend considerable sums of money to travel to Canberra or had to apply by post some seven months earlier for such coins. I do not think that is a reasonable method of distribution of items which are designed by the Government for commercial sale for profit. There is no question that that is the reason why this type of collector item is produced. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that everyone is aware that the production and distribution of the gold coin was a fiasco. I do not think that anyone anticipated the problems which arose. I think this House ought to be aware of those problems, that it should learn the lessons and ensure that these problems do not arise again. For instance, when orders were called, they were called in a certain fashion. I could name a collector organisation in Melbourne-but I will not-which decided that some of its members were going to purchase coins. It applied through the secretary for a number of coins. A decision was taken that multiples of the coins were not to be provided with the result that although some nine applications were made, I think only one coin arrived. I presume they raffled it. No advance advice was available to people, as far as I am able to ascertain, that multiple applications would not be met and therefore it was advisable for individuals to apply separately. If they did that they would at least have had some chance of obtaining the coins which they sought. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) mentioned the long delay in the holding of money for the purchase of these coins where some $300 was involved in each case. The holding of that money for over three months meant the loss of fairly substantial amounts in interest to the people concerned. I am not going on a vendetta or anything of that nature against the Mint but I think it is essential that people are able to obtain information of the means by which the coins are available and that members of the general public have an opportunity which is at least equal to that given to those who live in Canberra or to the dealers who are able to cream off a very substantial profit because of the lack of opportunity to members of the public to obtain coins through what I indicate are unsatisfactory sales methods. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose the Dairying Research Amendment Bill. I wish to raise a few issues relevant to the dairy industry. At present the Australian dairy industry is under the microscope. The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations is looking into the affairs of the Australian Dairy Corporation and the Australian dairy industry. Of course, any discussions which take place in the industry create a degree of interest which normally would not exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Once again this House has before it legislation which seeks to amend the Dairy Research Act 1972. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) has mentioned that three of the proposed amendments have been sought by the Dairying Research Committee and the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation. These proposed amendments are designed to bring the dairy research legislation into line with changing circumstances. The major change in the legislation is that the Dairying Research Committee is to be renamed the Australian dairying research committee. The Minister for Primary Industry commented that this name change will give the research committee a national identity in international research circles. Apparently the Government has now decided that this legislation should embody a national outlook for the industry. This approach possibly highlights more than anything else how, when it comes to dealing with dairy industry matters, honourable members on the Government benches are inclined to cry after the milk has been spilt. There is ample evidence to show that, in the last five years, the industry, particulary in the manufacturing milk sector, has moved from a national industry to an industry based in Victoria. Today States such as Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia are producing only export products in minute tonnages in short periods of the year. Basically they are city liquid milk producers. </PARA>
<PARA> All this research being conducted within the dairy industry, which is aimed at increased productivity, sales and manufacturing techniques, will be of little consequence unless this Government gives a positive indication of what is required of the industry. Much of the research is being conducted into producing new products but there is grave concern as to whether it would be wise to invest in long term planning until the industry is confident of its future. </PARA>
<PARA> I would take this opportunity to canvass the issue of Federal and State responsibilities in the area of research in the dairy industry. The facts of life over the last decade clearly point to the manufacturing industry contracting to the State of Victoria. This change has come about by market forces, coupled with natural climatic conditions, where the State of Victoria is ideally suited to dairying. When decisions which try to hold back the natural climatic and market forces of any industry are made by government, eventually there will be a price to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Research has shown predictions for the production and export of dairy products in the 1981-82 season as amounting to only 13 per cent. This is well below the accepted level of production to guarantee products to the Australian market at all times of the year. Some 90 per cent of prescribed products-that is, products which come under the jurisdiction of the Australian Dairy Corporation-other than city liquid milk, will be produced by Victoria. The Dairy Corporation's record of management is being scrutinised at present by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. It is high time that some research was initiated by this Government to consider seriously whether there is a need to scrutinise the future of the ADC. A question that should be asked is whether there is a need to have a dairy corporation at Federal level with a charter that is no longer suited to the production patterns which have developed. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though Victoria produces 90 per cent of prescribed dairy products-that is, butter, butter oil, skim milk powder, buttermilk powder mixture, casein and wholemilk powder-a decreasing amount of these products will be exported in 1981-82. The majority of these products will be sold interstate on the Australian market. In order to illustrate this point we should look at the ADC's powers and functions. The Corporation is responsible to the Minister for Primary Industry for the performance of the following functions described in the Act: To promote the export from Australia of dairy produce; to control the export from Australia of dairy produce; to control the sale and distribution of dairy produce after its export from Australia; to promote trade and commerce in dairy produce amongst the States, between the States and Territories and within the Territories; to improve production and encourage the consumption of dairy produce in the Territories; and such other functions in connection with dairy produce as are provided by the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clearly seen from this charter that the Australian Dairy Corporation has no powers to import dairy products to make up any shortfalls in production in Australia. If the Corporation, either through being unable to collate accurate production figures, or through mismanagement, both of which we have seen just recently, causes a shortfall in a particular product, private industry would have to import the required product. It becomes quite clear that, if Queensland or Western Australia finds that it is short of butter this coming winter, the companies that will import the product will be the Ballantyne Export Co. Pty Ltd or Lavery Distribution and Sales Pty which already have agreements with New Zealand. There is a false belief in the industry that the Corporation will import the product. The Corporation has no such powers. There is a false belief also that by having a Federal body there will be some protection from imports. I ask the Minister for Primary Industry, who is seated at the table, to make clear to the industry just what is the true position. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1982, there will be a new free trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand. Just this week, I received a submission from the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation which has been sent to all honourable members of Parliament. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The dairy industry's policy is that dairy products should be excluded from any phased reduction of trade barriers between Australia and New Zealand. Any relaxation of the formal and informal restrictions on trade would result in unfair and unreasonable disruption to the Australian dairy industry. The Australian dairy industry also contends that the current informal arrangements between the two industries should be formalized at government level. In other words, the present agreements between the industries on access for New Zealand butter and cheese should be confirmed on a government to government basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Primary Industry should come clean with the dairy industry and state just what is the Government's policy and how it relates to the proposals of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to indicate what would be the scenario if the Fraser Government opts for open free trade. For every tonne of product imported from New Zealand or the European Economic Community into Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales or South Australia, an equivalent tonne of Victorian product will have to be traded on the lower priced world market. That is the reality of the present situation. What is the alternative? The alternative is for the industry, with Federal Government support, to attempt to allow the Victorian Dairy Industry Authority to take over those charters which at present the Dairy Corporation carries out on behalf on the Victorian industry. Instead of the Victorian industry having to export products at lower prices, that industry finances the promotion and research for markets within Australia, under the Victorian dairy industry charter the industry could get its chop of those interstate markets and actively compete for its rightful markets. If necessary it could even market its product in New Zealand under the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Perhaps it could try a little of the free enterprise about which we hear so much from the Government benches. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take up the matter of whether we should be economic realists as far as industry is concerned. Some States, such as Western Australia, have great mineral deposits. As these deposits are developed they will earn great income from exports to world markets-markets which have a demand for energy which States such as Victoria and Tasmania cannot supply because of their lack of those mineral discoveries. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0G4">Mr CUNNINGHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Latrobe Valley has brown coal, but at this stage it cannot be exported because it contains too much water, but brown coal is used in the manufacture of aluminium and other products which can be exported. At this stage States such as Queensland, Western Australia and even New South Wales have every advantage as far as exports are concerned. The southern States have their great advantage in terms of agriculture. It is from this source that a State such as Victoria must earn its income. It is the overall responsibility of the Federal Government to co-ordinate the economy so that the mineral exporting States give first preference to the dairy products of States such as Victoria and Tasmania. If the present situation whereby the dairy industry remains under the control of an outdated corporation is allowed to continue we will see States such as Queensland and Western Australia sharing their wealth with the New Zealand dairying industry. This would be an intolerable situation and an indictment of this tired Government's approach to economic management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do not oppose the Bill. We welcome the fact that updating is taking place in the dairying industry at all times. There is a great need for research generally. There is a great need for research into the way in which this industry will go in the future. I urge the Government to act and to act fairly quickly because time is not something which is on the side of those in the dairying industry. I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendments to the Dairying Research Act. In 1958 legislation was first brought into this Parliament to set up a dairying research organisation in Australia. New legislation was introduced in 1972. In the light of experience and progress in the dairying industry, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) is now seeking to amend the Act to allow for further progress insofar as research is concerned. A great change has occurred in our dairying industry. I do not suppose that one would find any primary industry in Australia which has faced more challenges and which is as difficult to handle as the dairying industry. If the Government were to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham), the States would be in severe competition with each other. On the one hand, the honourable member advocates co-operation between the States and the establishment of a national organisation, and on the other hand he suggests that Victoria should be given the opportunity to move into the markets in the other States and engage in straight-out competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to have reliable information available to us in our thinking on the dairying industry because of the challenges that exist in the industry and because of the fact that we can be subjected to imports from overseas. In fact, many tonnes of European cheeses have come into Australia over the years. The legislation of 1972 has certainly done a tremendous amount to stabilise the industry within Australia. The Commonwealth has been prepared to subsidise 50 per cent of the actual cost of research. I know that the State departments of agriculture have played a very big part in doing that research. It is important to remember that the research being encouraged relates not only to the farm but also to the factory and the education of the people involved in the factories. Farmers have to be advised of the results of this research. I believe that over the years, particularly in recent years, the Australian Dairy Research Committee has met its obligation to pass on its findings to the farmers. The Committee has been set up as a steering organisation to co-ordinate research in Australia and distribute the results in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased recently to see the adoption of a four-year program for the marketing of our cheese. It is anticipated that by 1984 we could be marketing up to $40m worth of cheese a year. In 1979-80 almost $1.2m was spent on dairying research. In excess of $400,000 was spent on farm research and $524,000 was spent on manufacturing research. Many aspects of farm management are being developed today as a result of research. I am sure there are many dairymen in the States who have not had the opportunity to avail themselves of advice regarding the proper use of fertilisers. Many farmers today do not know whether they should be using superphosphate or nitrogenous fertilisers simply because they are not aware of the quality of their land and the climatic conditions under which they farm. </PARA>
<PARA> Many farmers are most anxious to know more about the relationship between the input of feed and the output of production of the cow. Of course, we can say that basically the production in Great Britain, Europe and America is so much greater than ours. However, their feeding conditions are so different to ours. They feed their cows hay and grain. Any Australian dairy farmer who feeds his stock grain and hay can get a great production per cow. But, as I said, the system of farming in Australia is different from that practised overseas. Farmers in Australia are dependent mainly upon pasture feeding. As such they can get fluctuations at certain times of the year. But that is the economical way to dairy farm within Australia, particularly in the southern areas, such as Victoria and Tasmania. These are the sorts of things that we have to research so that the farmer will know what his output will be if he feeds certain types of feed to his cattle. </PARA>
<PARA> The dairying industry is subject to challenge by substitutes, markets and the seasons. It is particularly concerned with the quality of its product. There has been a great increase in the quality of the product over the years. I believe that today Australian farmers are producing as fine a quality of milk as is being produced anywhere in the world. They have met their responsibilities, and are meeting their responsibilities, insofar as the demands of health departments are concerned. I do not wish to say a lot more about the Bill. However, I think it is important that I should say something as I am a representative of a dairying electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I was delighted the other day to hear the Minister for Primary Industry tell producers of an underwriting scheme which will date from 1 July next. It is important that the Minister should keep such schemes under constant review. We know that there have been discussions between New Zealand and Australia concerning future ties in respect of primary production and other areas. I do not know whether it is possible to exclude the dairy industry from these discussions. I know that the Minister is well aware of the matters of concern to the industry and that he is consulting closely with the States and the industry. We have to examine the level of assistance that New Zealand farmers obtain from their government compared with the level that Australian farmers receive from their government. I believe that our farmers have met their responsibilities, given the assistance that has been made available the marketing schemes within Australia and the benefits which have resulted from research. </PARA>
<PARA> While, as a government, we continue to encourage production and to lower the cost of production then I am sure that we will never be afraid of importation of other dairy products. If we fail to do this then, as a government we do not have an argument to use. When we look at the dairying industry or any of the primary industries, as I said here the other day, we have to appreciate the capital investment, the hours of work by the farmer on the farm and the challenge of a 35 hour week. We know that in the dairy industry or in any other primary industry these are the things that will force up our costs at home. There will be consumer demand on State and Commonwealth governments for the importation of cheaper food if it is available. I have reason to believe that the Premier of New South Wales has already indicated to the State that we may have to look at the importation of primary products from New Zealand. This is what is approaching this country. We are not only talking because of price; we are talking because people are becoming afraid that our dairy industry within Australia may not be able to meet its own domestic requirements, whether it be for liquid milk or other manufactured products. We never want to see this time arrive in a country that is suitable for the dairying industry. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is that governments have to live up to their responsibilities, both Commonwealth and State, to see that the industry is assisted. We must take into account all those other social aspects about which I spoke before and the high investment cost for a person to be in the industry. This is an industry that has to survive here because of the livelihoods and the family units that are generally involved within it. I am very pleased to see today that the amending legislation provides for four direct representatives of the dairy industry on the committee. We do not have three people to represent the manufacturing side and one to represent the liquid milk side. One thing that I regret, after having been a Minister for agriculture in New South Wales for just a short period, is that governments before that day encouraged the dairy industry to be split and encouraged certain products to be actually paid for on a very variable basis. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is a recognition by the Government that the dairy industry throughout Australia is an industry in which the States have to work together. I believe that Victoria is tackling the problem now in a proper way. It is working around to establishing one price for a litre of milk. This is very important indeed. As a representative of New South Wales I say that if there is to be a challenge from New Zealand or from anywhere else I hope that all the States of Australia will get together to support basically the ones which rely upon the manufactured product and not the liquid milk supply. I am very pleased to support the amending legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all I would like to thank the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) for allowing us to have a separate debate on the Dairying Research Amendment Bill. There are five agricultural Bills; they could all have been put into one cognate debate. The reason the Opposition requested that we have a separate debate on the dairy industry is that the dairy industry is under a great deal of stress at present. Many issues are coming up in the dairying industry. As this is a talking institution I think some of these things need to be aired. I thank my colleagues the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) for speaking and addressing themselves very much to these broader questions. I also need to thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing the debate to range so widely because this is a very limited Bill. It just relates to changes of names and getting the dairy research fund in line with other agricultural research committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was recently in the electorate of McMillan speaking to dairy farmers in Warragul, Trafalgar, Traralgon, Kooweerup and Sale-not that Sale is in the electorate of McMillan-and right through the Gippsland area. The dairy farmers in that area are very concerned about a host of issues that are affecting them. The dairying industry throughout the 1970s went through some rather dramatic changes. It is an industry which was over-producing in a way, or was being denied market access. The phasing out of the subsidies by the Australian Labor Party Government in a way forced the industry, in terms of its manufacturing sector, out of butter into cheese. I think that has all been to the good. We have now reached the stage where, because the industry has been reconstructed and production levels are now getting down to domestic consumption plus an exportable surplus, there are real doubts within the industry as to just how far this reconstruction will go. The concern is not due so much to the reconstruction measures themselves but rather to various social economic values within the industry, within the dairy farm, such as the conflict in some areas between different farming interests or the conflict between a need for industrial use of some land, particularly in the Latrobe valley. There are a whole range of factors. There are a lot of tensions and stresses in the industry. A lot of questions are being debated now within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the numbers of dairy farms it is quite obvious that they are still going down. It was said on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program National Farm Report yesterday that the latest figures show that the number of operating units within the Australian agricultural sector shows that there were some 3,256 fewer dairy farms in 1978-79 than three years earlier. If we had a few more updated figures than that I am quite sure we would see that the number of dairy farms have more than halved over the past 10 years. I am not saying that production levels have dropped by that much because they have not. A lot of the adjustment within the industry, of course, has been with respect to farm buildup. Now we are at this level of production and we are dealing with some degree of exportable surplus-at present there are good export markets for the products we are producing-one of the pressures on the farmers of course, is that they would like to get more land and take the opportunity of being able to guarantee the supply of dairy products to Australia and also to export to the better markets that seem to be opening up.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not know how any government or anyone will determine the exact degree of how much we should have as an exportable surplus. When we have an industry that is so clearly seasonal it is very hard indeed to predict just what level we should aim at. Although I believe that the Government should make some statement on what size it sees as desirable for the industry, I also acknowledge how difficult that will be. At present, as honourable members are aware, we have gone through one of the most damaging droughts. It is still on in many areas of the south-east corner of Australia right up the coast into Queensland. This is not predictable. It is no more predictable how long the drought will last than the drought itself was predictable. This has put a tremendous stress on the industry. A whole series of problems relating to this matter need to be discussed. This includes the price being paid to the farmers for their product, whether it be liquid milk or manufactured products. </PARA>
<PARA> There is real debate in the industry as to whether we could get more out of the market. The United Dairy Farmers of Victoria organisation maintains that it could get more out of the market for butter and for manufactured products. The dairy farmers of New South Wales and Queensland, given the pressure of the drought and the price of stock feed, believe that the price must go up for the domestic consumers, otherwise the farmers will be going out of business. I think we can see some evidence of the numbers going out of business, particularly those close to the big metropolitan area of Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong where there are pressures by Pitt Street farmers, people going into hobby farms and studs. Good dairying land is going out. Without an increase in price it is quite clear that more and more land will go out of dairying. That is some of our better dairying land. Macarthur, the last electorate that I represented in this House, has very good dairying land particularly around Mittagong, Bowral and Moss Vale, the basalt country. This land is steadily being eroded and taken over by rural or other pursuits. That is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria people want access to more irrigation water, particularly in the Sale area which the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) represents. I am sure that the Minister is well aware of those pressures. In Victoria there are pressures acting on the factories as the level of production has gone down and their seasonal production is coming in. Because of the mode of production by farmers the factories will get into more and more trouble. There is the question of trade with New Zealand. Already the honourable member for Lyne and the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) have raised these problems here this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the proposition set out by the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation will need to be taken into account very carefully by the Government. The level of protection and assistance given to the New Zealand dairy industry also needs to be taken into account. I believe that the New Zealanders apply a long term strategy with respect to their trade in dairy products because that trade is essential to their economic wellbeing. As long as both sides of the Tasman at governmental and industry level appreciate the problems inherent in the fact that Australia does not represent a long-term solution to New Zealand's problem in that regard, I think some kind of agreement can be worked out which both sides respect and acknowledge as being the best that can be arranged. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems raised by the honourable member for McMillan relate to Victoria, which is very much the pre-eminent dairying State. If we look at the full dimensions of the industry in that State, at the way in which the towns throughout the moister parts of Victoria are dependent on the dairying industry, at the absolute level of dairying in Victoria in terms of the overall level for Australia, we can almost say that the manufacturing dairying industry in Australia is concentrated in Victoria, the south-east of South Australia and Tasmania. Victorian farmer organisations put forward the case as they see it. They have a case which makes a heck of a lot of sense to them, as I am sure policy makers appreciate, but the Australian dairy industry still has to be regarded on a national basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The discussions I had with dairy farmers throughout the electorate of McMillan showed me that many producers believe that the days of the Australian Dairy Corporation may be numbered. Some of them are adopting a more extreme view and saying that even now we should be looking to phasing out that organisation. I would say that, overall, the Australian dairying industry does regard it as essential to have a national body. As long as we need to be engaged in export, as long as there is a need for promotion, as long as the various marketing arrangements are administered by a statutory authority with powers delegated by this Parliament, I think it will be essential to have a body such as the Australian Dairy Corporation. The States have powers in those areas, and we all freely acknowledge what the States could and could not do. However, I hope that before it reaches that stage wiser heads will prevail and some of the special problems Victoria faces will be recognised by all the other States and at the national level. </PARA>
<PARA> The organisations are always in some degree of dispute. I understand that at present the new underwriting arrangements are not being accepted particularly well by the organisations. Although I am not privy to the discussions, I know that at this time the Minister for Primary Industry is engaged in wide ranging discussions with the industry to have a form of underwriting accepted. I have said on other occasions that underwriting does not really represent much of a plus to the industry, given the present levels of production. Even so, I think that the industry still wants that guarantee of underwriting as part of the marketing arrangements and that that will continue for quite a while. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of State competition was raised by the honourable member for Lyne, and one could comment on quite a few aspects of that. For example, the New South Wales producers want the price of liquid milk to be quite a bit higher than it is at present. They have had two small rises, but if the New South Wales producers were successful in obtaining these further price rises the Victorians quite sensibly would be able to divert milk into the New South Wales market. That is one of the fears. If we do not adopt a national approach, there will be nothing to stop Western Australia and Queensland importing butter if they wish. It is best that competition between the States does not get out of hand and that we adopt a national approach for some time yet. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, determining the size of an industry and gaining some idea of how much exportable surplus is needed to take care of seasonal conditions is exceptionally hard. Say, for example, that the level of exports had to be 20 per cent more than the level of domestic consumption. If production were to drop below 120 per cent-say it dropped down to 90 per cent-we would be in a very difficult position indeed. If there were a seasonal upturn or if more people moved to the land and the level of production was 140 per cent instead of 120 per cent, we might face some of the problems we faced before. It is very difficult to determine. It is a testing task for government and for the organisations. It is an area which needs to be given quite a lot of thought at all levels in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently there has been quite a bit of disputation about whether we can meet our butter requirements this year. Arguments have been put forward by the Australian Dairy Corporation. I am not quite sure whether it is 100 per cent right or whether the case put by Mr Pyle, the President of the United Dairy Farmers of Victoria, is correct. However, it is quite obvious that we were very close to the margin, if we are not still short. I suppose one could say that there are two main reasons for this. Firstly, we are consuming more butter than was earlier anticipated. Secondly, errors in calculation were made in respect of the amount of product that would be available. I do not know exactly how one determines those things a year ahead when export quotas are being allocated. Again, one can appreciate both sides of the argument. I think it is very important that the Victorian farmers put forward their very strong view on this matter because they know darned well that they can produce and supply all the butter this country needs. If we were to consider importing butter without taking that into account and applying our minds to the problem Victoria has we would be very negligent indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The last matter I wish to talk about is the problem of Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd, the Australian Dairy Corporation, and the inquiry under way in the Senate. I will not talk in specific terms about this matter because the Minister, in answer to a question, indicated quite clearly that he will not enter into any debate on this until the Senate has finished its inquiry. Nevertheless, it is quite clear that individuals within the Corporation and Asia Dairy Industries have been subjected to some scrutiny. I think that all members of this House would really like our large marketing corporation for primary products to be in a situation in which the industry, the producers and the Parliament know what is going on. We would like a situation in which these sorts of questions did not arise and such matters were put beyond debate. We have seen a range of organisations and marketing corporations, such as the Grain Elevators Board of New South Wales, the Australian Wheat Board and a whole range of statutory authorities at Federal and State levels, in which errors of judgment have been apparent. There have been quite a few cases of absolute negligence. </PARA>
<PARA> Although some political commentators outside this House say that they would like to see politicians out of the areas of agricultural policy and agricultural marketing, I believe that as long as the Commonwealth has the export powers and we are exporting our primary products, as long as the farmers invite the Parliament, the politicians or government-call it what you will-into their industries and need the public purse for underwriting, stabilisation or whatever, it is incumbent on all members of this House and the Senate to make sure that proper procedures of accountability prevail. It simply is not good enough to say that farmers should control all aspects of marketing. They simply cannot do everything themselves and so organisations are set up. When those organisations have powers which are delegated by parliaments, it is up to us to scrutinise them. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the allegations being made about ADI and Holland Milk Products Industries Inc. and the fact that we may have breached international agreements will be put behind us when the Senate report comes out. I am still critical of the fact that the one matter which the Minister has said is outstanding has taken so long. I hope this is not a reflection on the Australian Federal Police and that one day the Minister will be able to make a full statement on the matter to the House. This inquiry places yet more tension, more stress, on the industry, and I hope that the Minister will see and acknowledge that the sooner this is all cleaned up the better for the industry; otherwise, we will not get people with the competence we need to handle the dairy industry's affairs. It is absolutely essential that these matters are cleaned up so that the industry can get on with the job. Quite frankly, what has happened in the past within these organisations is not as important now as is looking to the future of the dairy industry and trying to decide where it should go from here. I have itemised a whole heap of stresses, as have the honourable member for MacMillan and the honourable member for Lyne, and I think they are the issues to which policy makers at the Federal and State levels should address themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry is at a turning point in many ways. The concerns of the producers in the industry are very real. They are particularly intense in Victoria at present. I believe that we should be directing our minds to the positive aspects of the problems which dairy producers face rather than continuing an investigation month after month into a marketing organisation, the Australian Dairy Corporation, and into things that happened years ago. I think it is essential that that investigation go on but it is just as essential that we wind it up as quickly as we possibly can. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-Firstly, I thank the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham), the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) and the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) for their contributions to the debate. They all made very reasoned and thoughtful speeches relating to the problems of the industry. The honourable member for McMillan asked whether the Australian Dairy Corporation has the power to import butter for sale on the Australian domestic market. I think he took the positive point of view and stated that it does not. That is correct. Any power on importation relates to individual companies. The role of the Australian Dairy Corporation in relation to any importing of dairy products is only a co-ordinating one. I can say only that I believe the various companies and organisations engaged in the industry are wise enough to recognise the need for the ADC to be used at any time in a co-ordinating way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the whole question is hypothetical. As the honourable member for Werriwa rightly said, there were errors in the estimation of product. Of course, this was largely brought about by the seasonal conditions throughout Australia. As he pointed out, the eastern part of Australia suffered perhaps the worst drought it has had for a great number of years. This affected seriously the volume of production available that would have normally made up the estimates on which the ADC relied. The second factor is that there has been a very successful promotion of sales of butter and cheese. In particular, reports of increasing sales of butter are pleasing. It seems that people are at long last waking up to the fact that the claims made by some people about the use of butter and heart disease have been stretched beyond all imagination. Consumers are coming back to a very good product. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought the honourable member for McMillan was a little depressing in his prognostications about the future of the industry. Those in the industry know that the difficulties they have gone through in the past years far outweigh any that lie in front of them. I think we can be reasonably optimistic about the future of the industry rather than negative. I do not believe there is a need for the pessimism exhibited by the honourable member for McMillan about the future. There always have been and there always will be problems in the dairy industry as in other industries. I do not know that there will ever be a time when there will not be some problem facing the dairy farmer and other agricultural industries throughout this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal in short compass with one or two of those problems. The first relates to underwriting. I am in discussion at the moment with the industry on a longer term underwriting proposal. For too long underwriting has been bound up in an ad hoc annual estimate of what the industry expects and what it ought to get. I want to get away from that and adopt a more mathematical approach that is more satisfying to the industry and which is more sensible. I believe we will get there given the co-operation that is being extended to me in the discussions at this point. I welcome the words of the honourable member for Werriwa in relation to the question of closer economic relations with New Zealand. It would seem that the Opposition and the Government are very close on this matter. Both are prepared to work towards closer economic relations but both realise that there are difficulties facing particular industries that will need to be worked out equitably before closer economic relations can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that the honourable member for Werriwa raised related to the outstanding questions concerning Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd. As I said in answer to a question in the House on Tuesday, I cannot determine the timetable for the completion of the report I am expecting. However, I share his view that the sooner it is in my hands and the sooner a statement can be made clarifying all the issues that have flowed out of this problem, the sooner the industry will be satisfied and the sooner I, as the Minister, will be satisfied. Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing honourable members to range over issues far beyond the nature of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose these Bills. They are consistent with the Government's policy of converting from stabilisation to underwriting with respect to our export horticultural industries in accordance with the principle that stabilisation does not expose industries to the full impact of overseas prices for our products whereas underwriting does. Economists have a cute term for this. They refer to market signals. By and large that is what it means. Stabilisation, particularly the scheme operating for apples, inherently required the Government to pay in more than the industry could ever have been expected to pay in. The horticultural industries have been subject to Industries Assistance Commision inquiries over the years. Their problems are well understood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Dried Vine Fruits Stabilization Legislation Repeal Bill actually repeals the stabilisation measures without putting up the underwriting scheme that will be introduced. One can say quite clearly at this stage that an underwriting scheme will be introduced. I understand that the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and the Department are in discussion with the industry at present. The Bill before the House relates to the termination of the present dried vine fruits stabilisation scheme. The scheme applies to dried sultanas produced in 1978, 1979 and 1980 and provides for grower contributions to a stabilisation fund, if the average return received by growers in a season is above the established seasonal base price plus $10 a tonne. If the average return for the season is more than $10 a tonne below the base price, payments are to be made to growers out of the fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Growers contributed approximately $1.2m to the fund in respect of the 1978 season. It has become clear with the prices being received that further significant payments will also be the ultimate result of the 1979 and 1980 seasons' returns from the accounting if the scheme were permitted to run its full course. This would not be of any advantage to the industry. In fact, it would be a clear disadvantage. It would deny growers the use of substantial moneys which, under the legislation, would have to be collected from them in due course for these two seasons as grower contributions to the fund. Growers would than have to await the winding up of the fund at the end of the stabilisation term before these moneys could not have been made before 1982. The Government has accepted a request from the industry that legislation be introduced to terminate the scheme and to authorise the refunding to contributing growers of moneys presently in the Sultanas Stabilization Fund. Interest has been accruing to the $1.2m that growers have paid in and this also will be returned. It is hoped that such repayment will take place during this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry overall is essentially confined to the Murray Valley irrigation areas between Swan Hill in Victoria and Cadell in South Australia. About half of the industry's 3,800 growers are in the Sunraysia region. Farmers producing multipurpose grapes at present do not have suitable alternative crops available. Farm size is small. The industry is heavily dependent on labour-intensive technology which, in the main restricts farm size to what can be handled by a family unit without the need to employ a full-time hand. A number of grape varieties are dried but the dominant variety is sultanas and the industry is dependent on irrigation. The more labour-intensive flood furrow techniques predominate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industries Assistance Commission, in a series of four reports, made strong recommendations with respect to the Riverland. It is a pity that governments, both Federal and State, have not addressed themselves properly to the recommendations in those reports, particularly in regard to reconstruction in that region. Growers there face quite a few long term problems. The volume of grapes available for drying in 1981 is expected to decline by about 28 per cent to 280 kilotonnes from the near record production of last year, but that estimate was made by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics before the current harvest began. I understand that there have been adverse weather conditions during the last few critical weeks of drying and that in some areas crops are down by 50 per cent. Thus, we do not yet really know how much less than last year's record crop this year's crop will be. Dried vine fruits production is notoriously difficult to predict because it also depends on the intake of multipurpose grapes by wineries and distilleries. On average this has increased by 4 per cent or 5 per cent annually over the last few years. However, last year the intake increased by 25 per cent, to 141 kilotonnes. As far as we know at present, for 1981 the dry weight equivalent of the forecast 280 kilotonnes-I am quite sure that that figure will now be lower-will be about 70 kilotonnes. That is less than last year's extremely high level. Gross value of production this year is expected to be between $80m and $90m; so it is a reasonably large industry that is concentrated in one area of Australia. Its prosperity or otherwise has a decided regional impact, and on three Federal electorates in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> About 41 kilotonnes of the total dried vine fruits pack is expected this year to be directed to export markets. However, if we assume an average crop-and as I have said already it will be a little below average-it will nevertheless be about 40 per cent down on that available for export last season. In this situation the unit return to Australian growers from exports is forecast to increase only sightly. Over the last year, as is shown by the very fact that we have a surplus in the 1978 fund, overseas prices have been near the price obtainable internally. This is not a typical situation. The indications are that world production of dried vine fruits will be a little lower also. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter that is concerning the industry is the entry of Greece to the European Economic Community but, again, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has reported that its impact upon dried vine fruits producers, or multipurpose grape producers, is not likely to be extreme. On the other hand, at any stage the EEC can change its mind on some of these matters and doubtless the industry is concerned about what could happen in that regard. By and large, this is a straightforward measure and one which the Opposition does not oppose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills which relate to the apple and pear industries are more complex and are concerned with both the phasing out of stabilisation over four years and the phasing in of underwriting during the same period-taking into account the fact that other measures apply to this industry. I am glad that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) is now present in the chamber. When the matter was last debated the Opposition moved an amendment to have the stabilisation payment increased to $3 a box. The Government proposed to raise the amount by a whopping 20c from $2 to $2.20. Of course, the Opposition was accused of playing cynical politics, but some of the comments of Government supporters on that occasion are very interesting. For example, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), who is now the Minister for the Capital Territory, at one stage advised the Opposition that it would not know the difference between a crofton and a geeveston fanny. I am still trying to find out what a geeveston fanny is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member. Also, the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman), as is reported at page 1130 of Hansard of 19 September 1978, advised the House that he had not been locked in a toilet. The honourable member for Mr Murray (Mr Lloyd) then said: 'Let us get away from toilets for a minute and get back to the question of apples'. Having been thus enlightened, I think I should do likewise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Apple and Pear Stabilization Amendment Bill really concerns a winding down process and follows very closely the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission. This industry has undergone quite a bit of reconstruction. Although I have not been able to obtain the exact figures, the expenditure for that purpose during the years 1973-1978 was very large. For each of the 1981-1985 export seasons separate guaranteed minimum return levels will be established by this Bill for apple and pear exports. The guaranteed minimum returns will be determined by calculating 95 per cent of the weighted average per box free-on-board return for all apple exports and for all pear exports over the figure for the immediately preceeding four export seasons. I understand that the industry would have preferred a level of 120 per cent rather than 95 per cent but the IAC recommended about 80 per cent. Still, by and large, the industry is satisfied with what the Government is doing in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> At the close of each export season, there is to be a determination of the average per box f.o.b. export return for all apple exports in the season. The same is to be done in regard to pears. In the event that either of these average per box f.o.b. returns falls below the relevant guaranteed minimum return an underwriting payment is to be made. Such payment will be the difference between the guaranteed minimum return and the relevant average per box f.o.b. return. In the case of fruit exported at risk, underwriting payments will be made to the owner at the time of export. In the case of fruit sold before export, they will be paid to the owners of the fruit prior to that sale. I think I can work out what that means. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the underwriting arrangements for apples and pears, and the continuance of the stabilisation scheme for apples on a phasing out basis over the four years to 1984, the Commonwealth is to continue to provide supplementary assistance on a dollar for dollar basis with participating States over that period. The Commonwealth commitment is for a maximum of $3m over the period in respect of apples, and $800,000 in respect of pears. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of the assistance is to be flexible and is to be available to fund orchard reconstruction and related adjustment measures by growers particularly affected by the changed marketing support arrangements for at risk exports. It may also be used to provide additional at risk export price support assistance for apples, but not for pears. The Government has placed a ceiling of 750,000, and a maximum payout per box of $2.20, on Commonwealth funds used in 1981 to supplement export price support for apples. These maximums will be reduced by one-quarter in each of the three succeeding years, again following Industries Assistance Commission recommendations. The Commonwealth is currently discussing with the States proposals on the form and amount of supplementary assistance to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The Apple and Pear Stabilisation Scheme was introduced in 1971 and at that stage it covered only apples and pears exported at some degree of risk to the owner. Prior to 1976 it covered all exports sold at risk, but since then it has been limited to apples sold at risk to Europe and to pears sold at risk to Europe and North America. Support prices for each variety exported were set in 1971 and since then they have been indexed forward by changes in cash costs of production and no adjustments have been made to varietal support prices for changes in market returns for individual varieties. The level of assistance for apple and pear sales covered by the scheme has been, subject to certain limits, the difference between the support price for each variety and the corresponding varietal average free-on-board return for all export sales both at risk and forward. The limits in any one year have been a maximum support payout per box and a maximum total payout on all apples and pears. </PARA>
<PARA> Separate stabilisation funds have operated for each variety. When average varietal returns for all sales have exceeded the varietal support price, owners of fruit sold at risk have paid into that varietal fund on a sliding scale basis. If there has been insufficient money in a varietal fund for a required payout, the Commonwealth Government has made up the deficiency. Over the period, the Commonwealth has paid in quite an amount; I think it is about $22.4m. The maximum level of potential assistance available through the stabilisation scheme and supplementary assistance has exceeded the level of assistance paid out in most years. Between 1971 and 1979 about $50m was available to the industries for support but only about $31m was paid out. Of the $31m paid out, $30m was paid to the apple industry and $1m to the pear industry. Around two-thirds of the assistance paid to the apple industry was received by Tasmania and a quarter was received by Western Australia. The bulk of the assistance received by the pear industry was received by Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> I have tried to point out the mechanism of the existing stabilisation scheme, which had the inherent characteristic of government payouts exceeding grower payins. Payouts from the apple and pear varietal stabilisation funds have totalled $22.4m since 1971. In part, that has been as a result of varietal support prices for apples being generally higher than average varietal returns for all export sales and in part as a result of exporters having inducement under the stabilisation scheme to avoid payins by shipping less fruit at risk when market prices are high or expected to be high. In the absence of the stabilisation scheme and supplementary assistance, growers would have found it more profitable to divert some fruit sold at risk to other markets, including processing, or to grow a new varietal mix removing those varieties which have depended on assistance in most years. I could speak at length about this but I do not have time to go through the whole mechanism of the scheme. All governments have tried to give a measure of support and stabilisation to the apple and pear industry at the same time as they have engaged in policies to have the industry reconstructed. These measures were started before the Labor Government of 1972-75. They continued during that period and have continued since, so there is no disagreement between the parties on this question. </PARA>
<PARA> By and large, the Opposition accepts and welcomes what the Government is doing. However, honourable members should note what I have said about the stabilisation scheme having the inherent characteristic of the Government paying in a lot more than the industry. The underwriting scheme we are now phasing in has the same potential for that if export prices drop. On a four-year calculation, over four seasons, the underwriting scheme will protect the industry, cushion it particularly well, against sudden drops on the export market. In this way, even though there is potential for the Government to pay in a lot of money, at least it will be paid in evenly and at all times it will cushion the industry. That seems to me to be a reasonably sensible measure. No one can calculate how much the Government may have to pay in, but as long as the industry continues to reconstruct in the ways it has been, and as long as this supplementary assistance is also directed into further reconstruction, in another five or eight years the amount the Government pays into this industry will be quite minimal and the industry will be fully reconstructed. I suppose the term 'reconstruction' in the apple and pear industry means that many trees have been pulled out. </PARA>
<PARA> The current year is an 'on' year in the biennial bearing cycle in the mainland States. This will result in more apples being made available for all outlets. One of the worries about the at risk and other markets with the new arrangements is that more apples might move onto the Sydney and Melbourne markets from Tasmania, but at this stage we cannot predict exactly what factors will prevail and what decisions growers will make. It is almost impossible to predict that. Total Australian production is a lot less than it used to be but, even so, it will be over 300 kilotonnes this year. Bearing tree numbers for apples are expected to remain at around 5.2 million trees. Increased availability of apples as it is the on year might result in about 185 kilotonnes coming on to the domestic fresh market. That is a rise of about 12 per cent. Shipments from Tasmania to mainland markets should fall below the level of last year as Tasmania is expected to experience an off year. Projections of past trends suggest that the total fresh apple consumption over the medium term could lie in the range of 160 to 180 kilotonnes a year. This implies a declining consumption per person. </PARA>
<PARA> Exports this year are expected to total about 45 kilotonnes, which is only slightly up because the off year in Tasmania will limit supplies of export quality fruit. The overseas supply situation is that the 1980 European apple crop again was above average, but it was slightly below the crop of the year before. Approximately 25 kilotonnes of Australian apples could be expected to go to the United Kingdom and European markets. This is the classic at risk market. However, the possibility of high European Economic Community stocks of stored fruit at the beginning of the 1981 importing season, increased competition from Chile, South Africa and New Zealand and increases in freight rates will mean lower returns than those achieved in 1980. United Kingdom and French problems arising out of the EEC Common Agricultural Policy could see fewer French apple sales in the United Kingdom and that may provide opportunities for southern hemisphere exports. Australia has a geographic advantage in Asian markets. New Zealand could be Australia's major competitor in the region. Shipments of Australian apples to this region in 1981 should be similar to those of 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> The implementation of this underwriting scheme, along with the phasing out of the stabilisation scheme which will operate for the 1981-84 seasons, will enable producers and marketers to adjust more gradually to changes on the export market. As I have just pointed out, the export market is notoriously difficult to predict but this set of measures will enable the returns to growers to be cushioned and evened out. Whilst providing some degree of security against sharp falls in export prices, an underwriting scheme is likely to result in the diversion of fruit from at risk markets. Diversion to the processing sector, particularly in the expected on years of 1981-83, could result in lower average real returns for apples because of the lowering of the price paid for processing apples. Placing more Tasmanian fruit on mainland markets may not seriously affect the fresh fruit prices if the Tasmanian on year coincides with an off year for the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 and later, if adjustment has not occurred, large quantities of Tasmanian fruit could be placed on mainland markets in on years, reducing prices paid to both Tasmanian and mainland growers. Development of new forward markets could enable previously at risk fruit to gain more remunerative prices. The longer term developments in grower incomes will thus depend on the actual diversions and adjustments made by growers, demand conditions and the effects that such changes will have on prices in the various markets. It is a rather complicated set of measures, particularly the mechanisms for paying in and paying out and for the phasing out of stabilisation, but, as I have said, the Government's moves square very closely with the IAC recommendations. I think the last report on the apple and pear industry was delivered last year. The Opposition puts forward no objections to the legislation. We welcome it and also look forward to the future of these great industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other matter which I should like to mention relates to some lobbying by the Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association with respect to the number of people on the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation. For a while the South Australian and Queensland producers who produce only for the domestic market have been annoyed by the fact that they do not have State representatives on the Corporation. The Minister has agreed that the four places on the Corporation will be expanded to six. I understand that he is not prepared to say that the two extra people should come from South Australia and Queensland but I think that by making this concession he has indicated his concern or agreement with the industry case that there is room for every State to be represented on the Corporation. If that is in his mind, the Opposition welcomes it. The Opposition commends these Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, my good friend the honourable member for Wilmot draws attention to that fact. He is a very good representative of the apple growers in the north of the State, which is a very important part of the apple growing area of Tasmania. Tasmania is known throughout the world as the apple isle. Apples and the export of apples, not only to the mainland of Australia but also overseas, have been a very important part of the economy of Tasmania. In the past I may have been, to a degree, critical of some of the functions of the Industries Assistance Commission. I have often thought that members of the IAC were a pack of armchair theorists but I am starting to change my mind. The Minister for Primary Industry is smiling and I am sure that he will not go crook at me for saying that. Sometimes people like to think that they know everything about everything but in fact they know very little; they read a book and they seem to think that they can do everything from a book. But that remark does not apply to the members of the IAC. I take back my previous comments about them. I was young, enthusiastic and I let my head go when making some remarks in those early days. The members of the IAC have done a dashed good job and they have been able to reconstruct the industry to a level which I believe will be in the interests of the people of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said on other occasions that it saddens me to see a reduction in production in the Huon Valley, the home of apples in Tasmania. Incidentally, it is in my electorate of Franklin. I, and many other Tasmanians such as the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr), the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom), the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), who is from the north of the State, saw the demise of the apple and pear industry in the Huon Valley in particular. It saddened us to see such a reduction in production and the almost desperate decision in 1973 to create what is now the famous tree-pull scheme which enabled orchardists to stay on their own land and to meet their urgent financial commitments at that time. Of course, the scheme probably was brought in out of desperation. When the scheme was introduced in October 1975, 40 per cent of the total tree area was removed. Admittedly, some of the trees were old. It is not my intention to criticise governments but the orchardists at that time must have been wondering in which direction they should turn. They have now answered the call for efficiency in the packing shed and sometimes-this is well known-they have worked themselves to a standstill to sustain an industry that has been their life and their livelihoods. They combated spiralling costs of labour and materials coupled with high transportation costs. Of course, they had to put up with the elements-the varying climatic conditions-and the problems of transportation. But they have now won through and they should be applauded by every city dweller who goes into a shop, a greengrocer or a supermarket to buy an apple. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that I had that dinner break. To a certain degree it has ruined my train of thought on that very important symbol of Tasmania-the apple. Every time a person buys an apple in a supermarket, a shop or elsewhere, he should think very carefully about the farmer who has produced it. People must realise that the continuation of the industry in Tasmania has meant a lot of heartaches and problems. The people who faced those changes stood up to them and have come back fighting. That is why the apple industry in Tasmania today is as good as it was some 10 or 12 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that apple exports fell sharply from a peak of about 150,000 tonnes in 1971 to about 88,000 tonnes in 1975. Freight rates increased dramatically during that period, and the Tasmanian people should be aware of how vital the apple industry now is to the economy of Tasmania. It employs about 2 per cent of the total population and contributes approximately 11 per cent of the Tasmanian gross value of agricultural production. About one-third of all apples grown in Australia are produced in Tasmania. Tasmania supplies two-thirds of the total Australian export trade. If I sound a little Tasmanian I do not make any apology for it. The most important single form of assistance given, and this is what the Bill is about, is through the Apple and Pear Stabilisation Scheme. This is the scheme restructured by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), who is at the table. I may have been a little critical five or six years ago, but I am not critical any more because the Minister had the interests of the apple industry at heart. He restructured it, with the assistance of others, to make it the viable industry that it is today. I repeat that the most important single form of assistance is the stabilisation scheme, and in the short time available to me tonight I would like to elaborate on that scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I and a lot of other Tasmanians, including the honourable member for Braddon, realise that there would be a horrific situation if the apple industry in Tasmania came to a stop. The returns flow right through the economy into transportation, labour, and the money that comes to Tasmania as a result of exporting a fine variety of apples. The Tasmanian Labor Government is making stupid decisions, and I believe that it is being caught. It cannot make positive decisions and it cannot see that Tasmania is unique. It is pondering, starting to equivocate on certain things, and it is losing support and making the people of Tasmania hesitant. If the State Government does not heed the warning then it will lose government. I only hope that the Opposition down there wakes up and starts fighting a little harder for Tasmania and the people. If it does, then Tasmania once again will be a great State. It will be referred to with pride. It is the Apple Isle. It is the isle that produces the best apples in the world. It is the State that offers the most beautiful, scenic spots in the world, and I refer specifically to the Huon Valley. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that a lot of politicians should realise that the only way people can come to Tasmania is by air. It is most important for people to realise that we are dependent on air services. We have no ships, and we cannot drive cars across Bass Strait. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Eve was tempted by Adam. I notice that the Minister has on his apple tie. He is proud to be a Tasmanian, and he should not refer to Adam and the apple. Apple cider, apple wine and apple pies could all be promoted. Every passenger who comes to Tasmania should see this very simple slogan: 'You may smile, you are now in the Apple Isle'. Some may smile at the slogan and say that it is stupid, but it is something very simple to attract people to Tasmania. They should be given an apple when they arrive and there should be an apple in their motel room. Promotion is terribly important, and it is the only way that a place can be sold. People are too negative. I am afraid that some of the Tasmanian people seem to think that the apple can be taken for granted. I hope honourable members agree that we should do more about promoting the apple. I am a firm believer in that. On Tuesday, 15 March 1977, when the Queen was visiting Tasmania, the Daily Telegraph carried an article under the heading 'It's apples for Queen in Tasmania' which stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The pressure is right off the Queen on the happy apple isle. Tasmania has presented no problems, friendly crowds, no hints of demonstrations and the almost leisurely program of the tour. </PARA>
<PARA>It is apples all the time. In biblical times the apple was referred to as a symbol of purity, goodness and friendliness. I believe that with a few positive decisions, with a few politicians of fortitude who are prepared to stand up for Tasmania and not be influenced by some of the mainlanders, the apple could make Tasmania once again a great State. I quote from a 1931 document about Tasmania which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Fruitgrowing proves of paramount importance to Tasmania, not only on account of the large export trade, but also because the money received is distributed amongst many small holders and in consequence is circulated more than in the case of any industry. Tasmania is particularly adapted to the growing of fruit. That is, of course, for the production of temperature fruits such as apples, pears, plums, apricots, cherries, raspberries, etc. In fact, every fruit which is grown in England seems to thrive still better in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>It is like our cricketers; we do better in Tasmania. Even today our young Boone is trying to get selection for the Australian team. The document says: 'It is apples for Tasmania'. We always refer to apples but we do not stand by them. As politicians who represent Tasmania, we should. My friends the honourable member for Denison, the honourable member for Braddon, the honourable member for Wilmot and I all stand by apples. We need to make certain that we promote them in this House. It is no use mucking around with it. We need to fight. Today the Sydney market is most important to the Tasmanian grower. New Zealand was at one time a very promising market and shipments were made occasionally to Rio de Janeiro and Cape Town. I am still referring to the 1931 article to let honourable members know that the industry did not start today. The apply industry started 90 years ago, and much hard effort has been put into it. The English export trade began in 1884 with a trial shipment to London of 100 cases. That was our first shipment, on the S.S. Warwick. </PARA>

After that several Convent Garden firms directed their representatives to come to Tasmania as agents and they have stayed ever since. Tasmanian apples now find their way to all the important markets of the world. I would like to thank the Government Whip, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) for bringing in that lovely apple. I do not think that it is a Tasmanian one but it is not too bad. It is cold too. The industry started in those years has boomed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Everybody should realise that this assistance which is given through the Apple and Pear Stabilization Act and the underwriting of returns from all export market sales of apples and pears is of vital importance to the economy. We do not ask for anything. We do not want to subsidise some of the strikes that occur in the mainland. Everybody seems to criticise Tasmania. People say that we get too much from Victoria. We subsidise the motor industry-we subsidise all the industries. But when we get a little to assist an ailing apple industry, people say that too much is going to Tasmania. The great Premier of Victoria, Mr Hamer, criticises Tasmania; Tasmanians settled Victoria. The stabilisation legislation after making vital changes has enabled the industry to get back on to its feet. It is now starting to thrive. The people who objected to this scheme originally must now say that they were wrong and that the thoughtfulness and original planning of the Government has been to the advantage of the fruit growing industry in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to relate that the industry now has a highly skilled and effective national organisation that has come to grips with the marketing problems that have beset it. Many experts, including those in government and industry, have come forward with recommendations for a continuing viable industry. Some have taken into consideration that fact that it should be restructured. Some have looked also at social considerations. I believe we have been able to pinpoint the problems. They have not been the problems of growers. The apple growers of Tasmania are the best in the world. They have been muddled by bureaucracy and by other people who seem to think that they know all about marketing. That ruined them to a degree but they have been able to come to grips with these problems and the industry is now a very viable one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know much about the hard core apple. Tasmanian orchardists are able to compete in terms of quality on any given market. The reason for so much controversy from other growers in Australia is their fear that Tasmanian apples may glut the mainland markets. It is a fear only of quality. The stabilisation scheme and the ability of growers to export Tasmanian apples at a fair and reasonable price, returning a fair and reasonable profit for these hard-working orchardists should be defended and assisted by the mainland growers. If this is not done, the Tasmanian orchardist will find it necessary to look for alternative markets. In fact, growers may be forced to glut the mainland market in Australia, and as a consequence nobody would win. There would be once more complete pandemonium in the industry. But given the right incentive and the right direction, the industry once again will prove to be a valuable asset to the economy of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apples are regarded as a delicacy in many countries. People regard them as a fruit that not only tastes good but also assists in a healthy diet. Many markets in the world are crying out for good quality apples. People marketing apples from Australia should seek out even more markets than they do at present. They should seek out markets which have been disregarded in the past. In Taiwan apples sell at $1 each. They are regarded as a delicacy. The honourable member for Denison who was one of the best representatives in the Tasmanian Legislative Council that the Huon has ever known would lament the fact that thousands of apples have gone to waste when many people in the world are starving. A lot of people talk about poverty but unfortunately we can never direct some of these valuable food resources to those people in need. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said on many occasions that if EZ Industries Ltd-a lot of people in Tasmania depend on the company-and the apple industry failed it would be the end of Hobart. Honourable members must realise that when I talk I may sometimes smile or make a joke but this industry is a very important one to Tasmania. The scheme and the principle of the Apple and Pear Stabilization Act are an extension of earlier schemes and are designed to cover apple exports. My friend, the honourable member for Werriwa explained the Bills we are debating in great detail. I hope the Minister for Primary Industry who is sitting at the table has learned a little about the situation in Tasmania. He has been a very good Minister. I wish the Tasmanian orchardists a very good year this year. The freight equalisation scheme has proven to be an important asset to the apple industry. I only hope that a scheme such as this can be extended to air fares so that we can get cheap air fares to Tasmania on a freight equalisation basis. The industry is important to Australia. It is most important to Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> I end my speech with a sincere wish that the orchardists in Tasmania and Australia have a very good season which will give them a fair return for their work. They are not interested in socialism or in other ways and means of producing apples. They are interested only in working hard, making a profit, trying to provide an income and a way of life for their families and work for the people whom they employ. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to send my greetings to the people of Tasmania and wish them all the best for this year. I hope that they have a very good season with their apples. Now that we have got down to the core of the matter, perhaps we can proceed. By agreeing to underwrite the apple and pear export returns in each season at 95 per cent of the weighted average return for the four immediately preceding seasons, the Government shows commendable concern for the welfare of this section of primary industry. Honourable members on this side of the House also commend the Government for its decision to provide a phasing out period for the supplementary assistance arrangements to cushion the immediate detrimental effects of the change in the nature of financial support. As a result of restructuring within the industry and the changing patterns of marketing apples and pears, measures taken in recent years to maintain stability within the industry have led to some distortions in the pattern of returns to producers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is fitting that having been treated to a very comical 20 minutes from the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) that perhaps we should at least get back to the subject matter of the Bills before the House. Honourable members will be aware that the stabilisation scheme and supplementary assistance have provided incentives that have directed sales towards at-risk markets with too little consideration given to changes in market preferences. The effects of this process have led to the formation of a structure in this industry that is out of line with market demands. It is not only out of line with market demands but also it is out of line with seasonal variables. This has slowed down the response of growers to market realities. Under a more apt system of assistance to the industry the growers might have been redirecting market activities to other markets or restructuring their own production by re-arranging their varietal mix. The Industries Assistance Commission report of 28 March entitled 'Apples and Pears' has this to say in its summary and conclusions on page III:</PARA>
<PARA> By diverting apples and pears to the less profitable 'at-risk' export sales, the Stabilisation Scheme and Supplementary Assistance have reduced incentives to develop new markets, and have discriminated against the processing sector in some years. </PARA>
<PARA> For some varieties, assistance has been used to subsidise exports at a considerable loss, whereas processors would in some years have been able to utilise the fruit at prices which would have required little if any support from government to bring farm gate returns up to the final payment they would have received 'at-risk' sales including various forms of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>Because the Government's financial commitment to the stabilisation scheme and supplementary assistance scheme has remained unchanged since 1976 and, of course, was less in real terms, there has been no desirable reduction in the fluctuations in prices and incomes. Generally, like the Government itself, the scheme has outlived its usefulness. It is to be hoped that the process of rearranging assistance to the apple and pear industry by way of an underwriting arrangement should provide some stability for the industry to assist it to ride out the vagaries of export market fluctuations and seasonal variations. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House support the phasing out of the stabilisation scheme and support also the underwriting arrangements as proposed. The need for government action to protect important industry is indeed worthy of recognition by this Government. Free enterprise is not the undiluted system that the Government so monotonously pronounces it to be. That is probably the Government's ideal, but the reality is more likely to be something which is closer to the sorts of things which we, believing in a mixed economy, would propose. Public protestations, extolling a phoney adherence to the myth that this nation is or can be an undiluted example of private enterprise, bring no credit to this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Government funded projects that are aimed at ensuring the viability of an important industry of this kind gain our support as they enable a large number of people to be maintained in stable employment, including people employed in service industries in areas such as the Goulburn Valley in Victoria, an area which would be deleteriously affected if such projects were not introduced. In an area such as Ballarat, which electorate I am proud to represent, there is a number of orchards growing primarily apples. It is not a large area. I might say, inter alia, that I have some expert knowledge of the excellence of the qualities of these apples. I do not claim that they are as plentiful as apples in Tasmania; but I must say that I thoroughly enjoy their quality. It would be sad if the livelihood of these orchardists were to be jeopardised by an inefficient system of income support. I think it must be recognised that, whilst we are primarily talking about export industry, we are talking also about the flow on to the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA> Many jobs are maintained and family life supported by these orchards. The measures proposed in the Apple and Pear Export Underwriting Bill should help to continue the maintenance of these jobs. We on this side of the House hope that this Government will be equally diligent in providing adequate programs of support for those other industries which are crucial to the maintenance of jobs and hence family living standards. We are aware, however, of the double standards of this Government, and so are the people of this country. For the army of the unemployed who will not benefit from measures such as those proposed to support the apple and pear industry, the Government has obviously very little sympathy. They are the victims of a policy of harsh judgments. Cutbacks in the Community Youth Support Scheme programs such as that which occurred in Ballarat are a cruel example of the partiality of this Government and its callous indifference towards the most vulnerable members of our society. As I said, we on this side of the House support the Bill. We hope that the Government will also develop positive policies that give similar sympathetic treatment to all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The four Bills that we are discussing tonight represent in my view a further example of this Government's commitment to agriculture and primary producers. I congratulate the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) on the introduction of these Bills so early in the new session. For a few moments I turn to the two Bills which, as far as my electorate of Mallee is concerned, have much more relevance. They are the Bills which relate to the dried fruit industry. The Dried Vine Fruits Stabilization Legislation Repeal Bill seeks to terminate the operation of the present dried fruit stabilisation scheme. As the Minister for Primary Industry said in his second reading speech, growers have contributed some $1.2m to the stabilisation fund in respect of the 1978 season. It has been assessed that further significant payments would also be the ultimate result of the 1979 and 1980 seasons accounting if the scheme were permitted to run its full course. Therefore, as a member representing some 80 per cent of the dried fruit industry of Australia, I believe this Bill will be of significant advantage to the industry. If it had not been introduced, growers would have been denied the use of substantial money which under the legislation would have had to be collected from them in due course for the two seasons I have mentioned as the grower contributions to the fund. If that had happened growers would then have had to wait for the winding up of the fund at the end of the stabilisation term before these moneys could be refunded to them. Such refunds could probably not have been made before well into 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government and the Minister have therefore accepted a request from the industry that legislation be introduced to terminate the scheme and to authorise the refund to contributing growers of the moneys presently in the sultana stabilisation fund. As the second reading speech states, the moneys contributed by the growers in respect of the 1978 season have been invested, the last maturity date of such investments being 1 October 1981. After consultation with the growers' organisation-the Australian Dried Fruit Corporation-the Government has therefore made provision in this Bill for the investments to continue until their maturity. In this way a considerable amount of interest will be earned and no risk will be incurred of loss of capital value through early redemption. After these investments have matured, all moneys standing to the credit of the fund are to be distributed among growers in proportion to each growers share of the total contributed by the growers. I think it is reasonable to state also that at the present time further discussions are proceeding with the industry and with the Australian Dried Fruit Corporation which are designed to conclude mutually acceptable provisions for an underwriting of the scheme commencing with the 1982 season. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways, 1980 will be remembered by the Australian dried fruit growers as a vintage year. Both prices and production have been at record or near record levels. Total production was 98,000 tonnes which is a near record while export prices for sultanas have been between some $1,500 a tonne and $1,650 a tonne. Whilst it is not a reflection on the Government in power at the time, I just mention that in 1972, when I first represented the electorate of Mallee and this industry, export prices were some $260 a tonne. That fact gives honourable members some idea of the tremendous progress that has been made by the Australian dried fruit industry in promoting exports and, of course, making progress in relation to the expansion of export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Last month I was able to visit the Robinvale packing shed, which is one of the larger sultana packing sheds in my electorate. I learned that to date approximately 90 per cent of the 1980 season pack has been sold at the opening prices that I have mentioned. The unsold stock of some 2,000 tonnes of raisins and 8,000 tonnes of sultanas will be carried into this year and realistically I believe it may be necessary to accept slightly lower prices for this fruit. Nevertheless, 1980 was a good year and, if real estate values are any guide, there is plenty of confidence in the future. At the present time, a 20 acre fruit block in the Sunraysia district is selling somewhere around $130,000. As I said, the prospects for 1981 are good and much is going to depend on the success or otherwise of the harvest that is almost completed and a continuation of good export prices. Based on early crop estimates, this year's crop is expected to produce some 65,000 tonnes. However, because of unfavourable climatic conditions, particularly unseasonable rain in the sultana growing areas, this estimate of yield is probably down to about 40,000 tonnes to 45,000 tonnes. However, it is still going to be a good year for the dried fruit growing areas. </PARA>
<PARA> On the domestic market, sales of dried vine fruit have responded well to a very successful promotional campaign and have shown renewed growth in per capita consumption in recent years. At the present level of consumption, approxi- mately 25,000 tonnes per annum will be sold on the domestic market and this accounts for some 30 per cent to 40 per cent of fruit. There are some problems on the horizon in relation to the Australian dried fruit industry. Perhaps the most significant problem will be Greece's entry into the European Economic Community. Australian exports of sultanas to the EEC in 1980 totalled in excess of 30,000 tonnes or almost one half of total exports. Although Greece has traditionally supplied 20,000 tonnes to 25,000 tonnes of sultanas to the EEC annually, the prospect of Greece becoming a full EEC member has been a concern for some time. However, it is generally believed that Australia's exports will not be severely affected because at the present time two-thirds of Greece's exports of sultanas amounting approximately to 40,000 tonnes to 45,000 tonnes per annum go to eastern European countries. Any major diversion of that tonnage to the EEC could cause considerable disruption to established, and therefore Australian, trade with the EEC. </PARA>
<PARA> The outlook for increased world production of sultanas, apart from the entry of Greece into the EEC, is that the system of production aid for dried fruit producers will apply to all EEC members and the prospect of increased production by Greece and other EEC countries should not be ignored. There is a possibility of increased dried fruit production in Mexico. However, production has already reached some 20,000 tonnes per annum in that country and, with the limited availability of water and the prohibition on the sinking of further wells in the dried fruit regions, I do not see this as a threat to the Australian dried fruit industry. Over the last three or four years the Australian dried fruit growers have achieved considerable success in regulating their production and in meeting the markets that are available. I believe that they can look forward with optimism to their future, particularly as this Bill has now been introduced and discussions are under way for an underwriting scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the discussion tonight has been in relation to the Apple and Pear Export Underwriting Bill. Tonight I shall speak on this Bill in lieu of the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who is attending an agricultural meeting in the country. Having listened to the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck), recognising the tremendous interest he has in the apple and pear growing industries, I would like to make the point that these industries are not able to share the same optimism for the future as most of Australia's other agricultural industries. Under this Bill export underwriting will be provided for export market support and assistance will be based on recent export market price experience. I believe that this Bill will go some way towards ensuring the future viability of people involved in the apple and pear industries. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will set a guaranteed price at 95 per cent of average returns in the preceding four seasons. This is in contrast to the stabilisation scheme, which provided assistance on the basis of notional average cost of production factors indexed annually for inflation. This scheme has led in many years to support levels and export production being out of line with market demand realities. Therefore, underwriting is designed to provide support to growers in the event of a sudden downturn in the returns from the export market for either apples or pears. It will not provide ongoing assistance in the event of a sustained trend to lower market prices. The scheme will cover all apple and pear exports, unlike the stabilisation scheme which covers only at risk exports and provides a disincentive to the development of more profitable sales outlets. There is to be one guaranteed minimum return for all apple varieties and another for all pear varieties-a departure from the separate varietal support rates established under the stabilisation scheme. This will facilitate the structuring of a varietal production mix more in line with consumer preferences. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is fair to point out that there has been some criticism of the scheme that we are now implementing. The Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association requested that the guarantee be set at 100 per cent of the average returns in the preceding two seasons. I know that the Western Australian Minister for Agriculture wished to have the guaranteed level calculated only from returns realised in the forward sales market, for the calculation to be in respect of the preceding two seasons only and for the average return to be indexed in some way. However, the level of 95 per cent of average returns was arrived at by the Industries Assistance Commission after suggesting in its draft report an 80 per cent level plus an allowance for movements in the consumer price index. This concept of adjusting for CPI movements was rejected by the IAC at a final report stage and levels of underwriting were raised to 95 per cent to compensate for that. The period of four years for calculating the guaranteed level of returns was considered most appropriate as it provided a more representative sample of export years. Of course, it will not allow a particularly bad or good season to influence unduly the guaranteed return. </PARA>
<PARA> As the underwriting is to apply to all exports it is appropriate that the guaranteed price be calculated in respect of all exports and not just forward sale exports. If the guaranteed price were based on forward sale returns it would increase the support given to growers who continue to produce for at risk markets only. In any debate such as this where a large percentage of exports goes to the EEC, I think we must recognise that it is of major concern that the overprotective policies of the European Economic Community apply to imports, particularly, of canned fruit-in this case pears. As if a combined import duty, an added sugar duty of around 25 per cent on most products, were not enough, there is also an import licensing system for canned fruit, particularly pears, and latterly production aids or subsidies for EEC producers of this product. Continual access to the EEC markets is of great importance to this industry, particularly for canned pears, which have traditionally been supplied to the United Kingdom and West Germany in substantial quantities. </PARA>
<PARA> The subsidies which have been introduced for EEC canners are generous by any standards. In 1979 and 1980 the subsidies represented over half the selling price of canned pears. With this level of incentive it is inevitable that production by both efficient and inefficient canners within the EEC will increase and eventually exclude third country suppliers, such as Australia. Notwithstanding the higher transport costs involved, Australian suppliers would be able to offer high quality fruit products to the EEC consumers at lower prices if it were not for the increasing protection that is being allowed to local manufacturers. If these policies are not checked and greatly reduced, the payment of high subsidies to the EEC pear canners will have a long term potential threat for third country suppliers, such as Australia. Production could be stimulated to a point where it is in excess of EEC requirements. With other commodities, such as dairy products and sugar, the EEC production aid policy has led to surpluses which have been dumped on world markets. Such a development would have most unfortunate consequences for the Australian canned fruit industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry, although active at the trade level, recognises that the most effective relief can be obtained through government to government negotiations. It is most important, therefore, that the Australian Government continues to liaise and negotiate with the EEC and its member countries to ensure that access for Australian canned fruit is improved or, at the worst, maintained at present levels. Although the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation believes that Australia's access to the EEC markets is logical and fair, other considerations enter into international negotiations. It is therefore of great importance that the needs of the Australian fruit industry be kept in mind by our Government in its overall relations with the EEC. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of the continuing decline in the exports of apples and pears, world exports seem to have some type of appeal to many within the industry. Its future, no doubt, is questionable and the amount of money spent each year in the entire export area of apples and pears should be matched with the overall value to the industry. The payout by the Commonwealth Government over the past 10 years of approximately $22.5m in the form of stabilisation has kept many growers in the export field, but the encouragement it has offered to restructure has often failed. Whilst I admire the tremendous support that the honourable member for Franklin has given to his industry tonight, I think it has to be recognised that in 1979 over 40 per cent of Tasmania's production was of varieties unattractive to mainland consumers. In addition, it cannot be overlooked that the Western Australian production consisted of over 85 per cent of one variety. </PARA>
<PARA> To briefly summarise, I think that the industry has realised the potential of Australian markets and the urgent need to correct the components currently impeding an expansion of sales in these areas. All in all, the Australian apple and pear industry no doubt is approaching a crossroads. Whilst the outlook is not a joyous one, I am quite sure it is challenging. The solutions are there for the industry to act upon. I believe there is no necessity for government intervention, but there is a need for government support. For that reason I am very pleased to support these Bills tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the three Bills before the House-The Shipping Registration Bill 1981, the Flags Amendment Bill 1981 and the Navigation Amendment Bill 1981-is to abolish the requirement for British legislation to register Australian owned vessels, to establish the criteria for Australian registration, to set up a single Australian register and to establish the Australian Red Ensign as the colours of the Australian merchant fleet and the Australian national flag or the Australian Red Ensign as permissible colours for other Australian vessels. The Opposition does not oppose the Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) mentioned in his second reading speech, the principal Bill of the package, the Shipping Registration Bill 1981, seeks to repeal Part I of the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act 1894 insofar as it applies to Australian law. That will abolish the present Australian registration system which registers Australian owned ships as British ships, hence enabling Australian nationality to be granted to Australian owned ships. The British Commonwealth Merchant Shipping Agreement of 1931 permitted Commonwealth countries to establish their own registers but retained the common status of British ship. That agreement was rescinded by all member countries in mutual agreement in 1978, yet Australia is the only independent member of the Commonwealth, apart from Britain, to continue to operate under the Merchant Shipping Act system. This legislation, which will cut our dependence on the British shipping legislation, is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal Bill seeks to establish criteria for both compulsory and voluntary Australian registration. Compulsory registration is required for commercial vessels which are more than 50 per cent Australian owned and are of more than 12 metres in length. Voluntary registration is permitted to government vessels, fishing vessels, pleasure craft, Australian-owned vessels of less than 12 metres in length, vessels less than 12 metres in length solely operated by Australian nationals or residents and ships on demise charter to Australian based operators. A single Australian register is to be established with a central office and with branches as required. This will overcome the present peculiarity of having 20 ports of registry with no complete record in one place of all registered vessels. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of this move there will be no ports of registry as such. However, due to the importance of the port of registry concept for legal and other purposes, the Bill provides for the adoption of a concept of 'home port' for each ship. The continued practice of marking the port on the ship's stern is thus maintained. The two subsidiary Bills, the Flags Amendment Bill and the Navigation Amendment Bill, are consequential to the principal Bill and together make provision for the Australian Red Ensign to be the colours of the merchant fleet. For all other Australian vessels the Australian national flag or the Australian Red Ensign is to be the national colour. The Australian national flag and the Australian Red Ensign are of identical design, except that the former is blue and the latter is red. The Navigation Amendment Bill also provides for the updating of penalties relating to offences under the Navigation Act. The Flags Amendment Bill removes any reference to the British Blue Ensign in describing the Australian national flag and, hence, in describing the Australian Red Ensign, in line with other provisions of the Bills which seek to establish Australian registration independent of British maritime law. The Opposition shares the concern of the Minister for Transport that Australia should develop its status as an independent nation. This legislation is an important step in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission of Inquiry into the maritime industry undertaken by Commissioner Summers, which inquired into all matters relating to the development of the Australian maritime industry, including maritime legislation, was established by the last Labor Government in 1973. Such legislation had its roots in the late 1960s, with the entry of Australian flag vessels into overseas trade and the swell of Australian nationalism. The coalition Government at the time moved slowly on the question of maritime legislation geared specifically to Australian conditions and not tied to traditional British maritime law. It was in June 1972 that the Department of Transport issued a summary of changes proposed during discussions on the topic of the revision of the Navigation Act, the cornerstone of Australian maritime operations. It was then a singularly inflexible body of legislation, geared more to traditional British maritime needs than to the requirements of an independent Australian maritime industry. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the views put forward then was that the Australian national flag, not the Red Ensign, should be the proper national colours. This question assumed practical importance as Australian flag vessels were now plying the high seas, and under the Geneva Convention on the High Seas of 1958, to which Australia was and is a party, ships had the nationality of the country whose flag they were entitled to fly. The Australian Red Ensign, officially recognised by the Admiralty in 1934 and under section 406 of the Australian Navigation Act, is officially recognised as the proper colours of merchant navy ships registered in Australia. It is, however, described in the terms of the British Red Ensign, defaced by the stars shown on the Australian flag. I find it rather incongruous that we should describe the Australian flag as being a British flag defaced by the addition of the stars of the Southern Cross. I would rather have described it as the British flag embellished by the addition of the stars of the Southern Cross. </PARA>
<PARA> The Red Ensign was also authorised under British law as the proper colours of ships and boats belonging to British subjects resident in Australia and was thus considered to be of ambiguous legislative pedigree. It was thought that if Australia was to confer its nationality on ships plying the high seas, in line with developing independent Australian maritime status, it could not permit the Australian Red Ensign to be the national colours. The proposed Bill containing this view had not been drafted by December 1972, when the Labor Government was elected. The Summers inquiry was established, and in the fourth report of that Commission in June 1976 changes to maritime legislation affecting Australia were recommended, including a recommendation that the national flag, not the Red Ensign, should be the proper colours of Australian-registered vessels. This Government in its Shipping Registration Bill of 1981 proposed that this flag recommendation be adopted, with little prior consultation with the Australian maritime interests involved. The response from interested parties was so great and so negative that the proposal was allowed to rest to permit interested parties to put forward their views. The initial proposal was subsequently altered to enable the Australian merchant fleet to continue to fly the Australian Red Ensign as our national colours. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the Australian national flag and the Australian Red Ensign, or Red Duster as it is affectionately known, are identical but for the colour, the former being blue and the latter red. The Red Duster thus portrays not only our national unity but is also a special badge of honour for the Australian merchant fleet, bearing witness to a long and distinguished heritage of gallantry and service. The Government seemed to consider the Australian Red Ensign as an ambiguous flag, authorised under both British and Australian laws and described in relation to the British Blue Ensign. As I have said, their solution initially was to scrap the flag. It would seem to me to have been a far more appropriate step, both in establishing a national identity and out of sensitivity to those most affected by the legislation, to have consulted them adequately beforehand and then to have amended the ambiguities of the legislation rather than scrapping the flag to secure the legislative clarity. The Australian Red Ensign is Australian enough. One has only to ask any merchant seaman to discover that. It is the legislation around the flag that has been ambiguous. I suggest that it is far more important to national spirit to be allowed to wear a distinctive badge of courage and pride that has a long and honourable tradition and is close to the hearts of all merchant seamen and master mariners than to phase it out as legislatively ambiguous. As I have said, unfortunately at the initial stages that was the view taken by the Minister for Transport. It has subsequently been changed as a result of the wide reaction against it. </PARA>
<PARA> Historically, the British Red Ensign dates from the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The privilege of flying it was bestowed upon the British merchant service in 1864 in recognition of its gallant role in time of war. The Australian merchant service has continued this honour of flying a special kind of national flag, a characteristic of merchant fleets in the British Commonwealth. The Royal Australian Navy has the deserved honour of flying the White Ensign, its own special kind of national flag. The Australian merchant navy, like the RAN, has a distinguished record in wartime service and one which is often forgotten, I think regrettably. Approximately 12 per cent of Australian merchant seamen who served on Australian ships from 1939 to 1945 were killed or lost at sea. The Merchant Navy War Service Association of Western Australia has prepared material in which it states that 364 seamen lost their lives. They were either killed in action, died subsequently from injuries, died in prison camps, or were lost at sea. In all, 16 Australian merchant navy ships were sunk. </PARA>
<PARA> The merchant service had a vital defence role. The war was only a matter of hours from its home ports. Merchant navy ships were used as troop carriers, hospital ships, and to maintain essential supplies. The HMS Bulolo, a merchant cruiser converted from a passenger and freight liner, convoyed merchant ships, hunted raiders, was the flag ship of several rear admirals in the invasion of North Africa, code named Operation Torch and was at the Anzio landings. At the end of the war in Europe HMS Bulolo was commissioned as headquarters ship for the South East Asia Command under Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten. It had a very distinguished war record. In a way, it seems rough justice that members of the Australian merchant fleet who served in war zones are still not accorded the right to a Service pension. Although during wartime they were always closely associated with the dangers facing the armed forces, they are still considered to be civilians and are denied recognition of their service in combat zones. Members of the merchant navy share equal honour on many of our war memorials and they generally qualify for full membership of the Returned Services League. Yet despite this and numerous citations for bravery and official government praise, they still do not qualify for the practical and real assistance of a Service pension. </PARA>
<PARA> Other deserving groups, such as members of allied partisan armies, have been generally recognised as worthy recipients of such an entitlement. Civilian journalists taken aboard merchant ships and working in close association with the armed forces can get a pension at 60 years of age under an act of grace, but Australian merchant seamen who served in combat zones during World War II cannot. I believe that this is a most unfair way to treat Australians in the merchant navy who have fought for our nation in time of war. It is a difficult decision of government to understand. On the one hand, it recognises the qualities of our merchant navy and the need for independence of our merchant fleet; on the other hand, it does not recognise the men who served to defend this country in a time of war. I come into contact with a number of merchant seamen in the course of my responsibilities. One man in my own electorate who has played a very prominent part in promoting the interests of merchant seamen and the role of our mercantile fleet is Bob Nelson. Mr Nelson has played a very valuable and effective role in respect of Service pension entitlements for merchant navy men who served in war zones during World War II. The Opposition hopes that the general direction of the proposed legislation, which favours a more independent Australian position in maritime legislation and a greater regard for the merchant fleet and its members, will be extended in a practical fashion. I refer not only to pensions for members of the merchant navy who saw war service but also to providing for an expanded merchant fleet in time of peace. Government support ought to be extended from the field of legislation to providing substantive support for an independent and adequate Australian merchant fleet. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a move also finds support in the reports which emanated from the Summers inquiry. Its seventh and final report recommends that the Commonwealth Government should extend financial support to both coastal and international Australian shipping ventures. It would be shallow indeed if the references by the Minister for Transport to Australian independence in maritime legislation were not developed into positive measures to build up an independent Australian maritime fleet. That would be a travesty of the word 'independence'. We have the Australian Red Ensign but relatively few ships, certainly in world terms, from which to fly it. Legislative independence must not be allowed to mask our continued commercial dependence on overseas shipping companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1972-73, annual Australian participation in the carriage of its exports and imports has been dismal. In terms of bulk cargoes, Australian flag vessels have carried between 0.1 per cent and 3.1 per cent of our exports and between 0.3 per cent and 2 per cent of our imports. In terms of general cargoes, the respective figures are 3.3 per cent to 7.3 per cent of our exports and 6.1 per cent to 12 per cent of our imports. These are abysmally low figures. Most of the remaining cargo is carried in ships owned by British container shipping companies in the conference system or bulk ships and tankers belonging to multinational companies. Most bulk exports from Australia to Japan are transported in Japanese bulk carriers. Japanese flag vessels have carried between 39 per cent and 45 per cent of bulk cargoes which have left these shores since 1972-73. Since bulk exports account for between 80 per cent and 85 per cent, in volume, of all Australian overseas trade, the power of Japanese ship owners can be readily gauged. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of an adequate Australian overseas fleet and, consequently, of control over the conditions of shipping Australian exports and imports places Australia in a weak commercial and strategic position, as a result of which all Australian suffer. Each year we lose hundreds of millions of dollars in freight and insurance payments to overseas ship owners. This has had a tremendous effect in keeping the Australian ship building and ship repair industries in a position in which they are starved of capital and unable to develop for want of markets and work. The resultant loss of jobs, both direct and indirect, is substantial. Jobs for seamen and for those who could build or repair such vessels are lost abroad. If this freight expenditure were retained in Australia the multiplier effects on Australian industry which I have mentioned, especially ship building and ship repairing, would be substantial. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, the conditions and cost of shipping Australian overseas trade rests in the hands of foreigners. This affects domestic freight pricing also. Australia is an island continent and most of our markets are a great distance from where our goods are produced. The costs of transport are of great significance in determining whether our goods will be internationally competitive; yet we have very little say in the prices charged for shipping those goods abroad. The conference system is largely outside our control. This means that pressure is exerted by producers and manufacturers, where and when they can do so, on the costs of Australian domestic freight systems. Often this means the Government providing what I term commercial welfare to local exporters in the form of freight subsidies via government instrumentalities, cost recovery on the cost of road freighting and the construction of export roads. Australia is a major trading nation which has about 6,000 vessel calls a year, carrying upwards of 200 million tonnes of cargo, yet it is not a maritime nation. Only a meagre amount of our overseas trade is carried in our ships. The cost of this to the Australian public, to the Australian community, to Australian industry and to Australian primary producers I have mentioned already, but there are a number of reasons for this detrimental imbalance. Some seek to explain it by way of economics, by the claim that our costs are too high, our wages are too high and so on. I rather think that it is better explained by Australia's colonial heritage, against which we are still struggling and which the Bills now before us help to remedy. Australia has never been a major maritime nation, due to its historical ties to Britain which as a strong maritime and colonising nation, had little interest in seeing a local maritime industry develop in Australia. We became a captive market. Even our shipping registration system was a captive of the British system. Our lack of a large, locally owned fleet led to the short term expediency of seeking the best freight conditions from overseas ship owners, rather than building up our own fleet. It has become the policy of conservative governments and it constituted a policy of neglect, one which Labor rejects. We support the extension of the Australian fleet, both internationally and on the Australian coast. The last Labor Government supported the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 40-40-20 decision. This is often quoted as representing a fair international distribution of freight carriage. In essence, it states that Australia and other trading nations should carry 40 per cent of their trade; that 40 per cent should be carried by the importing nation, 40 per cent by the exporting nation and the remaining 20 per cent by cross-traders. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that a similar policy could be developed in respect of repairs to overseas vessels. At present we perform only between one per cent and 2 per cent of those repairs. Clearly a 40 per cent share of sea carriage and ship repairs would have a far-reaching impact on the balance of payments, on our national income, on providing additional jobs and have other positive ramifications, including an expanded defence potential. </PARA>
<PARA> Under present conditions, little positive aid is given to the shipping industry. No assistance, apart from a subsidy on locally-built ships, is provided to coastal shipping and no Australian commercial ship of significant size has been built in the last few years. On the other hand, land transport is subsidised, so we have the anomaly of high energy consumptive inland freight carriage when 80 per cent of our population lives on the coast. </PARA>
<PARA> No financial assistance is provided to Australian overseas shipping, yet every country whose ships ply our shores receive significant financial support from their governments. The maritime unions, which are often used as a scapegoat to explain the sad state of our shipping industry, have made positive moves to obtain greater Australian participation in the carriage of our overseas trade. There have been welcome developments between industry and the unions towards obtaining a greater Australian participation, adopting a more balanced approach to the costs of operating vessels in overseas trade and to the levels of manning vessels in overseas trade. There is a better understanding on the part of both parties involved as to the responsibilities and problems of each side. I regard that as a welcome development for Australia, something that is supported on both sides of the chamber. I hope to see a greater development of it. </PARA>
<PARA> After an eight-year campaign, which is continuing, and partially due to pressure from the six sea-going unions to extend Australian participation in oil import carriage, a negotiated provisional settlement has been reached. The settlement involves the oil importing companies each putting one Australian tanker into the trade and this eventually will account for 15 per cent to 20 per cent of total oil import trade. </PARA>
<PARA> In that connection I mention, as the Minister has on previous occasions, that Ampol has introduced the Ampol Sarel, that H. C. Sleigh-Total-Amoco have introduced the William Dampier and that Mobil has decided to introduce a ship called the Pacific Star. I understand that discussions with BP, Shell and also Caltex are continuing. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one paramount reason why the development of an Australian overseas flag fleet of some magnitude is even more crucial than ever. That reason is the mineral boom following the global fuel crisis. The directions of Australia's hoped-for path out of the low growth period we have long been in is exporting energy related minerals such as coal, alumina, aluminium and liquefied natural gas. This will involve a vast expansion of our bulk exports of these commodities, potentially in Australian ships. If the present pattern of relying on overseas shipping companies as a short term expediency continues, we will see Japanese ships carrying our burgeoning mineral exports, as they carry most of them to Japan now. Our dependence on them will be great; the profits will be high; and they will be siphoned off abroad. If the fuel shortage favours Australia due to our abundant coal supplies for export, it certainly favours us in exporting them in ships propelled by that fuel and owned, repaired and even built by Australians. I suggest that not to carry coal exports and all our overseas trade increasingly in Australian coal-fired vessels would be a commercial disaster for the industry and for the people of this country, not to mention the waste of liquid energy that would occur if we ignore the potential that coal-fired vessels offer. </PARA>

I think there is a bipartisan view to that statement in that the use of coal-fired vessels is desirable in the national interest, and there should be accelerated development of it. An increase in Australian flag participation should be seen as an economically viable downstream venture deriving from Australia's global advantage in mineral and energy mining, processing and exporting. Consequently, it would be a national disgrace if the Government did not back up the spirit of its Shipping Registration Bill package, for national maritime independence, by giving greater and long term support to the development of an extensive and modern Australian shipping industry, both coastal and international. This should be part of a nationally planned transport policy, co-ordinated with a national energy policy of the same scope. This would support and foster by required policies the use of each mode for its most technically appropriate task. This package of Bills is an important step in developing the stronger administrative independence of the Australian shipping industry. In these circumstances, the Bills are not opposed by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They will be half mast; I will be dragging the anchor, as it were. In respect of the Shipping Registration Bills, it is most significant to note that Australia is the only remaining independent Commonwealth member, other than Britain, to continue to operate under laws of the United Kingdom. In other words, whilst that situation has prevailed up to this time, we are really confronted with an anachronism, or relic. In effect, this represents a significant occasion so far as navigation matters or shipping registration matters are concerned, because Australia has appeared to have come of age and to have taken on a sense of nationalism. I believe that that is a very good thing. We have been operating under the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 or legislation that is closely attuned to principles enunciated under that legislation. Of course, for many years that legislation applied right throughout the British Empire. If a country was a member of the Empire, it was virtually regarded as British and it flew the British flag. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster provided that nations would be free to repeal such arrangements provided they complied with the general principles that had been in operation up until that time. Therefore, this Bill facilitaties the registration of most ships so that ships can have Australian nationality. The honourable member for Shortland made some reference to nationalism in respect of the extent to which we use Australian ships for Australian trade purposes. The Minister, in his second reading speech, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Shipping Registration Bill is an important step forward in the development of Australia's status as an independent nation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it does not really throw an effective switch to give us a very real involvement in trade. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at some pertinent statistics on how much Australian involvement exists in the transportation by ship of our imports and exports, we are in for a very rude shock. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has provided figures which indicate that, in 1978-79, cargo loaded for export from Australia by Australian vessels was 3,962,000 tonnes out of a total of 165,094,000 tonnes. It is a mere 2.4 per cent of exports. I believe all Australians would be very concerned to learn about our inadequate involvement, about the small share that we are able to claim for ourselves. It is apparent that there is much to be done to redress that unsatisfactory situation. The import cargo carried by Australian vessels amounted to 338,000 tonnes out of a total of 21,884,000 tonnes. Again the figure is very small. Expressed as a percentage it is only 1.5 per cent of all imports. </PARA>
<PARA> Our balance of payments shows that the situation is very seriously affected by the figures I have just given. The net cost of transportation, or the net payments to other countries for transportation-which admittedly is for all transport, not just shipping; I do not want to confuse the House-was $939m in 1978-79 and in 1979-80 the figure had risen to $1,151m, an increase of 22.6 per cent on the previous year. So, we are going backwards rather than forwards. I think the Minister will take on board his obvious obligation to give Australia a better deal as an exporting, trading nation, and a share in our own shipping activities to a greater extent than we have been able to observe up till now. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the Flags Amendment Bill, I noted that mention was made in the second reading speech about the continued use of the Australian Red Ensign. I indicate my lack of enthusiasm for this concept. I cannot understand why we have to be as weak-kneed as this. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is proposed to declare the Australian Red Ensign the national colors for Australian merchant ships. </PARA>
<PARA>He then mentioned that in some circumstances other ships can fly either the Australian national flag or the Australian Red Ensign. This kind of option represents a shemozzle. I cannot see the need for compromise. I notice that the Deputy Clerk is looking at me very discerningly, if not critically. I know his nautical background. I know the prejudice that has grown up in a traditional way in the Navy and even in the merchant navy. The Deputy Clerk knows a great deal about that. I understand all that. But there comes a time when one needs to throw a switch and become a nation. The main point I want to make is that we ought to have one flag in this country. I do not want to belt it unduly. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the British Admiralty has issued individual warrants to certain members of some 16 yacht clubs in Australia, authorising them to wear the British Blue Ensign, either underfaced or in a defaced form. </PARA>
<PARA>They can wear it in a bastardised form, if you like. It is incredible that members of these yacht clubs will be able to wear the British Blue Ensign. They are lucky to have their yachts in Australia. They probably derive from the exploitation of Australian workers and Australian resources. I think it should be good enough for them to fly the Australian flag. They should be required to fly it. I do not set aside the obligation I place on the Minister to tell the House why he has compromised on this important principle. </PARA>

<PARA> The British Blue Ensign is similar to the Australian National Flag but without the stars. Approximately 400 Australian yacht owners have been issued with such warrants. This causes some difficulty as under the Geneva Convention on the High Seas 1958, to which Australia is a party, ships have the nationality of the country whose flag they are entitled to fly. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no justification for this. The Minister also made a point about the States. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also preserves the use of the flag of a State or Territory in Australian waters and contains provisions in respect of flag rights for unregistered Australian ships. </PARA>
<PARA>I happen to be an Australian-not a New South Welshman, although I come from the great city of Sydney. I am very proud of the fact that the Australian Parliament is making Australian flags available to schools, benevolent organisations and the like. I am not anywhere near as enthusiastic about the fact that prisoners in various States perform the task of making State flags, and that concurrent with the distribution of the Australian flags is the prolific distribution of State flags. I cannot see why State flags should be allowed to be flown on ships sailing in Australian waters or on the high seas; Australian flags should be flown. I think the Minister ought to demonstrate some Australian spirit, instead of conniving, grovelling and crawling to miserable parochialism. I understand that democracy starts at the parochial level. I know that it has an expansive factor about it. One can be proud of one's city and one can be proud of one's State, but primarily one should be proud of one's country. We should not be as bastardised about these things as we are. I criticise this legislation from that point of view. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FG7">Mr CHARLES JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not say many nice things about the Minister this morning, but when credit is due I extend it. In this case, I extend my congratulations to the Minister for having introduced this Bill. I regret that an honourable member from this side of the House did not originate the Bill. Much work was done on this legislation between 1972 and 1975. Unfortunately, due to events that are now history, the legislation was not taken to the stage that it has reached today. The man who spoke most in this Parliament over the years about the establishment of a shipping register was the former honourable member for Werriwa, the Honourable Gough Whitlam. He spoke consistently and regularly on this matter. Whenever a shipping Bill or a maritime Bill of any type was introduced, the establishment of an Australian shipping register was always mentioned by him. Unfortunately, the Ministers of that era did nothing about it. It was very high on the list of priorities of the Whitlam Labor Government. If a particular event had not occurred, such legislation would have been through this Parliament by now. It is pleasing to see that the Liberal Government is slowly but surely getting rid of the shackles of the old Acts of the United Kingdom Government. It is good to see once again severance from the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. Australia is becoming a maritime nation in its own right with its own register. So much for that point. I think this is a good Bill. I think that it covers all the points that are required to be covered. I think it has the full support of the industry and the trade unions. I certainly support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should like to bring a few points to the Minister's attention about the exemption from registration of ships that are demise chartered. How long will this exemption apply? Some companies in Australia today charter ships and use them for a considerable time. The Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd had two ships on the coast for almost the whole of the life of the ships. I refer to the Iron Cavalier and the Iron Clipper. Ships of that type which operate for that duration should not be permitted to operate on the coast or in the overseas trade under Australian charter conditions without being required to register. I hope that the exemption will be extended only to ships on charter for a very short period. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the Minister to clause 13, which refers to exemption from registration. Government ships, fishing vessels, pleasure craft and small craft are exempt from the requirement to be registered under Section 12. Of course, we know that government ships are men-of-war and I do not think they should be registered. However, we have to realise that fishing vessels are no longer the six-metre, seven-metre or eight-metre launches that used to operate in the estuaries and just off the coast. The fishing vessels of today are very large ships. There are mother ships, and other ships operating from them. Sooner or later ships of that nature will become established on the coast. </PARA>
<PARA> I am trying to keep my remarks as brief as possible. The same thing can be said of pleasure craft. I cannot see any justification for the exemption of pleasure craft. They should be included in the register. A fixed tonnage, length or whatever could be used as the yardstick. After all, there is provision in the Bill for the calculation of the size of a ship. There are umpteen different methods for calculating the size of a ship. I am not the least concerned about the formula that the Government will use. Some people I have spoken to disagree with the formula. I consider it of such minor consequence, and so do they, that I am not making an issue of it. Pleasure craft are becoming quite substantial in size and there are many of them on the coast. They are getting bigger every day. I think it is time that the Department of Transport considered preparing an amendment to the Act to include pleasure craft. Certain things have to be taken in consideration. For example people no longer exclusively sail their own pleasure craft. People are employed on them. Once that stage is reached there should not be any differentiation between what is a commercial ship and what is a pleasure craft. The owners of these pleasure craft, if they employ people, should have their vessels put on the register. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I raise concerns clause 5 of the legislation: 'Act to bind the Crown'. I think it is time that if a State or Commonwealth owned shipping line breaches the Act then it should be required to pay the penalty as privately operated shipping companies have to. I do not think there should be any exemption just because the shipping line is owned by a government. The Australian National Line is an authority set up by this Parliament. It is responsible to this Parliament and it is financed by this Parliament. Therefore, if it breaches the Act it should suffer the penalty. I know that it is only a case of taking the money out of the left hand pocket and putting it into the right hand pocket, but if it is good enough to penalise the other shipping lines then it should be good enough to penalise the Australian National Line for breaching the Act. I know that government operations are expected to observe the letter of the Act but unfortunately that is not always the case and breaches occur. Therefore I would like to see clause 5 of the Bill deleted as I do not think government owned ships should be given exemption. As honourable members know, I am a great supporter of the ANL. It would have been a much larger shipping line if I had had my way. </PARA>
<PARA> In my opinion the Government is putting great stress on this alleged mineral boom in Australia. The Government has no control over the expansion of the mineral industry. It is one of those things that happen. What concerns me is the fact that so little of the exports of Australia's resources have been carried in Australian bottoms. The oil tanker, the William Dampier-about an 80,000 tonner-is owned by an overseas company operating to the Middle East. Then there is the Ampol Sarel operating to Sumatra. There has always been an Australian ship on the Sumatra trade. I believe it is time the Government really expanded its fleet. If the trade union movement had given the Whitlam Government greater co-operation-the type of co-operation it is prepared to give to the oil industry today to bring tankers on to the coast-it would have had some 400,000 tonnes of tankers operating five or six years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> It is thanks to the previous Australian Labor Party Government that we have the four P class vessels operating in the carriage of iron ore. These include two 120,000 tonners and two 140,000 tonners. When the decision was taken to have those ships built we had an understanding with the Japanese steel industry that cargoes would be provided. Mr Bert Weymouth, when he was chairman of ANL, and the manager, Mr Robin, went to Japan and talked to the steel industry management. They got an assurance that cargoes would be available for those ships. The only reason they were not built in Japan-it was common sense to have them built there-was that the Japanese shipbuilding industry was so loaded with orders that it was impossible to get a delivery date from it. It was not the wish of ANL, the Department of Transport or the Government that those ships be built in Sweden and Germany. Even though the Japanese may have used that as an excuse for not giving cargo or agreeing to the charter of the ships, the reason they were not built in Japan was the fault of Japan. Its industry was so loaded with orders that it did not have the time to build them. </PARA>
<PARA> The percentage of coal exported from Australia in foreign ships is absolutely ridiculous. Yet that amount of coal is being exported and carried almost exclusively in overseas bottoms. I understand that only one Australian ship carries any of that coal, and that is one of the P class vessels that on every second trip picks up a load of coal from Hay Point. We should have used the opportunity when the price of ships and the charter of ships was at rock bottom to acquire sufficient ships to set up the nucleus of a substantial overseas trade, particularly in this area of the carriage of our mineral exports. This would also have helped in the importation of crude oil. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Government has taken adequate measures to ensure that gas tankers will be provided to carry Australia's export of gas from the North West Shelf. If countries want to buy our gas, they should buy it at a fair and reasonable price. Having in mind the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development resolution-40 per cent of that gas to be carried by the supplying country, 40 per cent by the buyer and 20 per cent by cross traders-then at least 40 per cent of that gas should be carried in Australian bottoms. The cost of those ships is horrendous. Of course Australian maritime conditions are a bit higher than those in other countries but with all the facts taken into consideration such as the cost of the ship, depreciation, interest payments and all that is involved, put against the difference in wages, then the difference is infinitesimal. Now that the Government has taken the step of setting up an Australian register it should move into the field of ensuring that Australian resources are carried in Australian bottoms. Again I say that I support the legislation and commend it to the House because I believe it is a progressive move and one which is in the interests of the Australian maritime industry. </PARA>

They have brought to this House the diversification of their various electorates, and I feel sure that their contributions have been of great interest to those of us who have been in this Parliament for some time. Some very expansive statements have been made during the debate. I wish to refer to some extraordinarily expansive statements made by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), who indicated that 500,000 people in Australia were unemployed. That is not so. Statistics show that in January 1981, 374,800 people-216,000 males and 158,000 females-were looking for full time work, compared with 380,900 in January 1980 and 391,000 in January 1979.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The figure has been noted. That is the most lively the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) has been since coming to this Parliament. I am pleased that I have woken him up. The honourable member for Port Adelaide also indicated that in the recent McPherson by-election the National Country Party's campaign cost $200,000. If he took a couple of noughts off that figure he might be nearer the true figure. He indicated that the National Country Party receives $10 for every $1 received by the Australian Labor Party for election expenses. That is absolute rubbish. We know that the Labor Party is assisted by big business. There is no doubt about that. It gets funds from big business and from the trade union movement for election purposes. The honourable member for Wills, who is sitting at the table, cannot deny that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> New South Wales and Queensland have had a devastating drought which has had a very serious effect on grain production, sheep and cattle numbers, and wool production. Although there has been scattered rain throughout New South Wales and southern Queensland, it has not been nearly enough to satisfy the farmers. At this time no water is flowing into the creeks or our great dams. These areas are going into the winter months without any surface water, and there is a very serious situation indeed. Wheat crops failed last year in this area which is the biggest wheat producing area in Australia. Farmers have had no income from wheat sales, and they have lost sheep and cattle; the numbers are down. We are experiencing tremendous problems at the moment in country killing works. I am chairman of the Gunnedah Shire killing works, which to date has been very successful. This killing works commenced operations on 15 July 1957 and has traded profitably right up to the present time, but with the shortage of stock for slaughter it is facing serious problems. That is the situation at practically every meatworks in New South Wales and, to a lesser extent, in Queensland. Of course, this problem has exacerbated greatly the unemployment situation. Honourable members have probably read in the newspapers about the closure of killing works at Moree, Guyra and Newcastle. This is creating great unemployment problems for the people in those areas, and the Government of New South Wales is being approached for funds to help those killing works continue. </PARA>
<PARA> It will take primary industry from two to three years to recover fully in these areas. Sheep farmers who usually get 120 bales of wool this year will be down to 45 bales or 46 bales of wool. The quality of the wool will not be the same, and this will seriously affect the export income of this country and country towns that support these wonderful agricultural areas. The banks will have to come to the party to assist the primary producers. If the primary producers are not successful in producing, there is a flow-on to the cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane, which rely on the prosperity of the people on the land. The Commonwealth Development Bank will have to be given funds so that it can come to the assistance of these people. The Primary Industry Bank of Australia also will have to come to the party. It is up to this Government to see that funds are made available in these areas so that these great industries can get back on their feet. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very disappointed to read that at the last Australian Water Resources Council meeting which was held recently, no mention was made of any programming for great dams in this country. We have to establish more dams and weirs for the conservation of water. Honourable members will be aware that Australia is the driest continent in the world. We would be very pleased if this matter were taken up and some action taken by this Government and the various State governments. It is only through co-operation with the State governments that results can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem facing the meat industry, not only in our country areas but right throughout the nation, is the meat inspection service. It is pleasing to note that the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) is making every effort to establish a single meat inspection service. At present we have two inspections, and in some cases even three inspections, with local government, State government and Commonwealth meat inspectors. The Minister for Primary Industry recently told the Australian Agricultural Council that he wanted it to review two options for meat inspection services. Those options were: The delegation of commonwealth responsibility for export inspection to those States who wish to assume it; or the Commonwealth to assume total responsibility for inspection at export establishments. The dual system of meat inspection has caused tremendous increases in costs. Most meat works have two sets of inspectors, one for the export market and the other for the State market. If we can get the service down to a single inspection the cost of meat to the Australian housewife should be reduced, as well as the cost to industry generally. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to coal development in the Hunter Valley. My electorate of Paterson has the greatest coal production in Australia at the moment. We are extracting even more coal than is being extracted from the great mines in Queensland. Severe problems exist in development, which is growing very rapidly. Oil companies such as BP Aust Ltd, the Shell Co. of Aust. Ltd, and Caltex Oil (Aust.) Pty Ltd are putting capital into very big coal mines at Warkworth, Singleton, Muswellbrook and over the range to Gunnedah where I live. Local government is having a great problem in providing the infrastructure for these great mines. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately the New South Wales Government has lacked the foresight to provide the rolling stock to take this coal to the seaboard. It has not provided the rail facilities. Most of the coal from Singleton and Muswellbrook is being carted on our highways in 27-tonne semi-trailer trucks. As a result, the devastation that will take place on our highways will cause a grave financial situation. The shire councils of Singleton and Muswellbrook are running out of land which is needed to provide homes for people who are employed at the mines. There is a need for infrastructure such as increased schooling facilities, increased housing and increased water and sewerage. The people in these areas are facing great problems. The New South Wales Government and the Federal Government will have to give them assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Coal companies in Queensland have provided infrastructure and the coal companies in the Hunter Valley will have to be approached to assist in the infrastructure that is required. The committee which I represent has been to the mines in Queensland. We have seen what Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, Thiess Brothers Pty Ltd and Utah Mining Australia Ltd have provided at Blackwater. The mining companies have provided houses and swimming pools-the whole infrastructure. They have built roads and railways. The mining companies in the Hunter Valley will have to assist in the development of the infrastructure in this region. Over the last few weeks railway shunters have followed a practice of permitting trains travelling to the ports of Newcastle, Sydney and Port Kembla to carry only 500 tonnes of coal at a time. I often travel by train in this area and I have seen eight or nine trucks being pulled by a diesel locomotive down to the port of Newcastle. Because of this practice, ships are taking up to eight or 10 days to load instead of two days.</PARA>
<PARA> I have travelled to various countries-Japan, Korea, China and Hong Kong-which import coal from Australia. I am informed that these countries are very dissatisfied with the delays that are taking place not only in the export of our coal but also in the export of wheat and other products. Last week 36 bulk ships were waiting off the port of Newcastle to load coal, wheat and iron. I understand that the same situation existed in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something about the Australian economy. We are fortunate we live in this country. Unfortunately, we do not have a truly nationalistic outlook. We should all be working like eager beavers to attain the good things of the world but we are not doing that. We seem to have people who, at the drop of a hat, are prepared to create industrial problems. They are injuring only themselves, their wives and their kiddies-they are doing this nation a great disservice. The economy of Australia is sound. The consumer price index increased by 2.1 per cent in the December quarter and by 1.3 per cent over 1980 as a whole. So that gives honourable members some idea of the sound state of our economy. Both retail sales and new passenger vehicle registrations showed strong growth in the December quarter. Employment growth remained strong. The combination of a steady current account deficit and stronger private capital inflow resulted in an overall balance of payments surplus of $288m in January. Private dwelling approvals rose further in the December quarter. Our overseas trade is suffering because of the delays in shipping which I have mentioned. We are lucky people to live in this great country. This is the greatest country in the world yet we have people who are endeavouring to destroy it. </PARA>
<PARA> This week we were visited by executive members of companies involved in the great North West Shelf project. This is the biggest project of its type ever attempted in the world. It is estimated to cost $4,000m on 1980 values. It is 48 per cent Australian owned despite what we hear from some honourable members opposite and other people in this country. The project is made up of Woodside Petroleum Development Pty Ltd, the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, California Asiatic Oil Co. Shell and Hematite Petroleum Pty Ltd. BHP has huge holdings in the project. It is based on gas fields located in the Dampier sub-basin approximately 130 kilometres offshore from the port of Dampier. The project will initially produce liquified natural gas for Western Australia and, of course, for export. Just imagine the employment possibilities that this huge project will give young Australians. Production platforms will have to be erected, ports will have to be constructed and pipelines will have to be laid. Also, there will be a greater requirement for shipping. The infrastructure development will lead to more employment opportunities in the towns. As I have mentioned, the project will be the biggest undertaking of its type ever contemplated in Australia and, indeed, the world. </PARA>
<PARA> We are very fortunate to have such natural resources as coal, iron ore, petroleum, natural gas and uranium. Unfortunately the left wing and the socialists of this country will not allow us to get on with the mining, milling and marketing of yellowcake. Anybody who opposes the mining and milling of this valuable commodity is socialistic, communistic or left wing. These people want to stop this country from exporting uranium. When one asks members of the French Parliament what the French communists and socialists think about uranium, one is told that they want France to import this material. By 1983 France will be producing 47.5 per cent of its electric power by nuclear means. This country ought to get stuck into the export of uranium. We should forget about the socialists and the left wingers and export our yellowcake. Yellowcake is not dangerous. It becomes dangerous only when treated with such chemicals as texachloride. The export of yellowcake could assist our balance of trade position. If we do not find more petroleum as the years go by we will be faced with a huge balance of payments problem. However, by exporting uranium for power generation purposes we will be able to balance our Budget. The export of uranium will be of benefit to Australia and to all those people who have the great fortune to live here. </PARA>

The electorate of Kalgoorlie-I wish that a few Tasmanians were here to hear this-is twice the size of Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania put together. It produces for Australia most of our iron ore, lead, cobalt, mineral sands and just about every other mineral one can think of. I feel sure that it would even produce bigger and better apples. Within its boundaries are some of the best wheat land and some of the best farmers in the whole Commonwealth. It has a potential for coal and there is evidence of reserves of oil that will be improved through the continuing exploration at Dongara. </PARA>
<PARA> The resources of the electorate do not stop at the coastline however. We have the greatest per capita income from fishing. We have the reserves of the North West Shelf about which I hope I can give some facts to this House at a later date. Within this area covering approximately one-third of Australia, we have a sort of super-Queensland. The area is bigger and better than Queensland without the attendant paranoia that goes with that State. I make this last observation with some reservations for, in our State Government, we have the same irrational extremism, incompetence and bigotry that makes the government of Queensland the focus for international scorn and embarrassment that it is. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that I and not the former member stand today in this place indicates a vote of no-confidence in the policy of the Fraser Government. In the limited time available to me, I shall refer to some of these just grievances. They include: The Government's policy of virtually giving away our minerals, its blatantly dishonest approach to the reduction of air travel costs and the outrageous treatment of the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares chaired by Mr Holcroft. I will dwell, however, on three areas of concern. I refer to the action of governments, both State and Federal, on Aboriginal affairs, mining and taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> Liberal governments, both State and Federal, have a lot to answer for in their treatment of my Aboriginal constituents. They have pushed Aboriginal affairs to the bottom of their lists of priorities. How else can one explain why, although the Aboriginals in the Kimberleys have a 70 per cent unemployment rate, nothing is done about it? How else can one explain why, with record infant mortality and a high incidence of disease in Aboriginal communities, funds for Aboriginal medical services are being cut even more?</PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian Premier has shown a callous disregard for Aboriginal sensitivities over many years. The Noonkanbah confrontation last year was unusual because it was one of the few times when an Aboriginal community had resisted the forces of big government. When, with the style for which he has become noted, our fuhrer sent his panzer divisions into Noonkanbah, the $1m it cost the taxpayers was the least cost. In terms of international disapproval and future distrust on the part of the Aboriginal community, the bill for the future will be infinitely greater than that. The Western Australian Government has not granted a pastoral lease to an Aboriginal community since 1977. It has even come to arrangements with people for far less than Aboriginal communities were prepared to pay. The Western Australian Government did this in 1977 in relation to one of the stations for which there was an application and again last year at Lamboo where the applicant, Monty Gordon, was recognised as one of the most experienced cattlemen in the whole of the Kimberleys. </PARA>
<PARA> When it appeared that the Aboriginal disenchantment with Liberal policies might lead to a Liberal member losing his seat, the Western Australian Government introduced a Bill to disenfranchise the Aborigines. That was a very novel ploy. It was the first time in the Commonwealth since 1920 that it was not legal for a fellow elector to witness an electoral card claim. Responsible Ministers of this Government, if not actually abetting these practices, certainly abandoned their charges to the State hardliners. Let there be no mistake: The Aboriginal people of the Kalgoorlie electorate are under the protection of this Parliament. In 1967, the electors of Australia gave the Federal Parliament and Federal Ministers responsibility for Aboriginal affairs. Even the imperial government in London when it granted Western Australia responsible government in 1890 retained the control of Aboriginal affairs because it felt that the government in Perth could not be trusted. The government in Perth today cannot be trusted. My constituents want action from Canberra. The platitudes and the sweet talking of Fred Chaney are not enough. Fred was one of those people who believed in the maxim that there was no problem, no matter how big or how bad, one could not run away from. He met his Waterloo, however when he failed to sweet talk the thugs who now control the Liberal Party in Western Australia into giving him preselection in Curtin. In short, when the coup comes, as come it will, the Government will be able to install its own gilded bird on the peacock throne. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to mention a little about mining. Let there be no mistake that the Noonkanbah exercise was designed to show the mining and exploration companies just who was boss. It was evident that the mining companies were able to come to terms and be far more reasonable and equitable with our Aborigines than our State Government was. Sir Charles needed an example and the Noonkanbah community, emerging as one of the most successful and organised groups, made an excellent target. He knew that if he could crush this group, he was in a position to demonstrate his power to the mining companies. I was present at Noonkanbah on the day that Amax (Exploration) Australia Inc. decided to pull out. It realised that it had no chance of finding oil. Its representative quoted me odds of 400 to one. The geological expert of another major mining company said to me: 'If there is any oil at Noonkanbah, we will have to tear up all the scrapbooks and forget everything we know'. He added: 'All the text books will be no good to us at all'. </PARA>
<PARA> Amax never wanted that confrontation. There was nothing in it for the company. It knew there was nothing there. It was a victim of the Court Government's fiction that said that there was a legal and binding commitment to do the drilling. That legal and binding commitment was, of course, to the Western Australian Government which could have removed that commitment with the stroke of a pen. Instead, it chose to threaten and to intimidate the company. Although Amax is a multinational company, in Australia it is very small potatoes and has absolutely no political clout. Throughout all this Amax was on the horns of a dilemma. On the one hand was its international good name and, on the other, it was conscious of the large amounts of money and potential which it had invested in Western Australia, all vulnerable to the whims of the Court Government. </PARA>
<PARA> After all, Amax had seen Sir Charles persecute Lang Hancock and take from him several exploration areas, in some of which millions of dollars had been invested. The fruits of Lang Hancock's expertise and the years of his time and experience were stripped from this great pioneer of the iron ore industry in the most fascist fashion. Why? The reason is probably that in his own desire to be seen as a pioneer of northern development Sir Charles was prepared to falsify history and belittle the achievements of those who went before him. In my talks to senior mining men-I mean the senior men, not the middle management people who make up the converts to the Liberal Party-it has become apparent to me that they are frightened of the Court Government. They see it as irrational, myopic and increasingly as an agent for Japan. They realise that the right honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) in his capacity as Federal Minister for Trade and Resources could help them but they recognise that he is quite impotent and will do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a speech made in this debate by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume). On 3 March he said that he would like to see a tax, a surcharge, put on the export of all minerals. I think his contribution was significant. It illustrates just how few members of the Government understand how the free enterprise system really works. Export levies put an arbitrary term on the economic life of a mine, as a resource rent tax does not. Obviously, if a company is in the pursuit of a market share and selling below the opportunity price it is cheating the Australian people: In that case, an export levy is just common sense. For the honourable member to suggest that a levy or export taxes be applied to iron ore which is operating in an intensely competitive world market in an endeavour to promote the sale of fines or pellets ignores the simple facts of the free market system. </PARA>
<PARA> Pelletisation became quite uneconomic when this Liberal-National Country Party Government introduced its outrageous and regressive oil tax. With Arab-equivalent prices, every pelletisation plant in Australia was doomed. On top of that, the predominant world demand is for the lump form. Once any economic advantage was gone, so was the market for pellets and no amount of export levy could ever recover that. I point out to honourable members opposite that that is how the free enterprise market system works in this case. I admit that it is a very basic illustration, but it is obvious that very few of them understand even the basics. I doubt very much whether any of them would survive in a truly competitive free market system. But, of course, they would not have to: They would raise for themselves a cosy cartel, quota, captive market or levy. All of them are affected by the Murdoch syndrome. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the Federal record. In the last general election, when the Fraser Government was looking down the barrel of defeat, no fewer than 61 promises, either dishonestly costed or not costed at all, were made. Perhaps the daddy of them all was the promise to build a railway line from Alice Springs to Darwin. In terms of cost-benefit analysis, that is the height of absurdity. It represents a craven government prepared to spend half a billion dollars of the taxpayers money to shore up its electoral chances. In terms of defence, a line running from east to west from Mt Isa to Port Hedland makes much more sense. On the basis of return on capital, that line at least would have a chance. It would open up a deep water port in the Pilbara for west Queensland coal, bringing cheaper power to the Pilbara and expanding the market for coal. It might even do something to establish secondary industries in that part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the current taxation situation. My constituents are justly concerned with the Government's policy in that field. How could one not be concerned about the erratic course followed by our Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his Treasurer (Mr Howard), the 'Two Ronnies' of the financial world? The Australian Taxation Office is in a state of turmoil. It has trouble keeping up with the almost weekly changes in policy. If the Prime Minister is not dishonouring a promise on, say, personal income tax indexation, he is out pork-barrelling some Pitt Street farmers with another tax concession. My constituents are very concerned about the Government's attitude, especially its attitude towards the taxation of subsidised rentals. The Government's decision last year to enforce a tax on housing rental subsidies in isolated areas was ill-conceived. Such subsidies are a just compensation for the hardship and isolation endured by my constituents. Any tax on those subsidies would be inflationary. Mining companies would have to increase wages, which in turn would result in higher prices for everyone, including government employees and private contractors who would not receive any wage compensation.</PARA>
<PARA> A government policy of taxing housing subsidies would adversely affect rural industries in which low rents or free rents have been traditional. The Government backed down on that issue just prior to the last Federal election. However, it has not entirely rejected the option of a housing subsidy tax. I take this opportunity to warn the Government that I entirely reject the application of section 26E of the Income Tax Assessment Act in such a manner and let it know that Kalgoorlie will fight on the issue. That ought to frighten the Government!</PARA>
<PARA> Income tax zone allowances or remote area compensatory benefits, as they are more aptly termed, are of vital concern to my constituents. As honourable members may be aware, the whole of taxation Zone A in Western Australia falls within my electorate, as does 90 per cent of Zone B. The electors of Kalgoorlie are not impressed with the Liberal's performance in this field. Liberal government's have a long history of ignoring the needs of people in remote areas. It was a Labor government in 1945 that amended the Income Tax Assessment Act to provide tax concessions for people who reside in remote and largely undeveloped areas. In introducing the relevant legislation the then Treasurer, Ben Chifley, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Some measure of tax relief should be granted, not only to employees but to all taxpayers who live in remote parts of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>He recognised that there was a real need to compensate for uncongenial conditions, isolation and high costs of living. In 1975 the Whitlam Labor Government moved to increase substantially the value of the zone allowance by making it a tax rebate-that is, a direct refund of the specified amount rather than a deduction from taxable income. The Liberal Party has done nothing since the inception of those allowances to increase appreciably their level or ease the conditions of eligibility. The Government's big effort has been to institute an inquiry which has just received public submissions on the state of the remote area benefits. That is indeed a modest effort from a party that has been in power for 29 of the past 31 years, or since the Chifley Government which introduced zone allowances passed into history. For five years the present Government sat on the Asprey recommendation that a separate inquiry should be instituted to look into remote area zone allowances. If it took the Government five years to institute an inquiry, how much longer will it take it to act? I call on the Government to act and to act now. I call on the Government to increase the level of the benefits, to change the form of the benefits and to ease the conditions relating to eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall elaborate on those proposals. The present level of benefit is totally inadequate. Currently the taxation zone rebate is $216 plus 25 per cent of the sum of the dependant's rebate to which the taxpayer is entitled. In Zone B the amount is $36 plus 4 per cent of the sum of the rebate for each dependent child. Therefore, in Zone A a taxpayer with a spouse and two children gets a rebate of $574.50, whereas in Zone B a taxpayer in similar circumstances receives a rebate of $93.36. Expressed another way, the base component for a taxpayer without dependants is 59c a day in Zone A and less than 10c a day in Zone B. That is very small compensation indeed for the disabilities people suffer in those zones. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think I need to recount in detail why the level of monetary compensation is totally inadequate as both the State parliamentary Labor Party and the Wickham Branch of the Australian Labor Party have done this extensively in their submissions to the current inquiry. I simply propose that the zone allowance should be increased in 1981-82 to an amount of no less than $560 and that an amount equal to 75 per cent of the sum of the rebate to which the taxpayer is entitled for dependants should be paid to remote area residents. I propose further that the zone allowance be in- dexed annually in line with movements in the consumer price index for the ensuing year and that regular reviews be conducted to ascertain the appropriateness of the base component of the allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the introduction by a Labor government of a concession for people living in remote areas the benefit has taken many forms. I now propose that the remote area compensation benefit should be a direct cash payment made quarterly to the residents. That would ensure that people living on pensions and people whose incomes fall below the taxable limit-that is, the most needy members of the community-would not forgo their concessions. That might in turn mean that the new form of benefit is more appropriately administered by a government department other than the Taxation Office. I consider that such a new form of benefit not only would compensate all residents for the first time but also would do more to encourage decentralisation in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently taxpayers who live in Zone A-that is, all of Western Australia above the 26th parallel-receive one benefit while people who live in Zone B receive another benefit. When the zone allowance was introduced the zone boundaries were delineated in terms of the degree of severity of the disability. The present value of allowances suggests that the degree of disability associated with Zone A is six times as great as that associated with Zone B. Clearly, that is not true. In my electorate one has only to compare Carnarvon with, say, Wiluna or Roebourne with Rawlinna to see that that is not so. I propose that Zone A and Zone B should be amalgamated to form a new Zone A. In the final analysis, the degree of severity of the two zones overlaps and is marginal when compared with the quality of life in Perth or similar developed areas. The alternative is a multi-zone system, which I once favoured. However, it would be extremely complex and costly and an administrative nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment eligibility to receive the zone allowance is based on length of residence; that is, a person who has been a resident of a zone for at least six months of the financial year is eligible. That discriminates greatly against those people who reside in the area for most of the year but not for six months in any one financial year. I have read the submission to the inquiry from the Western Australian school teachers and I entirely sympathise with their case. I propose that the benefits should be calculated on a quarterly basis. Anyone who is resident for more than two months in any one quarter should be paid for that quarter. I think this would provide a much more equitable system. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time I have left, I indicate that I intend to adopt a bipartisan approach in this Parliament. I am very happy to give the Government the benefit of any expertise I hold on subjects on which it obviously is lacking. If Government members care to call on me at any time they will find me very willing, in any circumstances, to give them any help I can. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I compliment His Excellency, the Governor-General on his address to this nation in declaring open the Thirty-Second Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. I was particularly impressed by his remarks that discussion of the economy and economic policy has become so abstract, so specialised, so dominated by statistics and rarefied concepts that the connection between it and the lives of ordinary people is in danger of being obscured if not lost sight of all together. I particularly commend the Young Liberal Movement in Victoria for its policy statement that it puts people first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I speak tonight on behalf of the people of Victoria who for many years seem to have been unjustly subsidising other States of Australia. I believe that the Federal Government, if it fails to recognise the mood of the Victorian people in regard to this matter, can do so only at its peril. This was shown by the fact that although the Government polled well in every other State it lost seven seats in Victoria at the last election. Victorians are sick and tired of being the aunt sally of other States of Australia. In the next few months a new Federal-State agreement on tax sharing must be worked out. In a Federation such as exists in Australia income produced by one State should be used to assist the development of the less affluent States. No one would argue with that. However, any tax sharing must be based on a formula which is just and fair to all concerned and our present formula has long been due for a change to a more equitable system. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1942 the Commonwealth Government took over responsibility for income tax collections from State governments. A high uniform national tax was introduced at that time to fight the war in which Australia was engaged and also to control the economy in the wartime situation in which Australia found itself. The amount of tax which the Commonealth Government returned to the States was determined by the average amount the States had collected in the previous two years. At that time the minority Country Party Government of Premier Dunstan was in power in Victoria. It believed in minimum taxation but, by pursuing this policy, it allowed such essential services as education, hospitals, et cetera, to run down. The Victorian Government had a low level of expenditure during those years. Consequently, Victorian taxpayers were, and still are, being penalised because of the policies of that retrograde government. As a result Victoria contributes 29 per cent of the total income tax collected by the Australian Government but receives from the Commonwealth only 23 per cent of the tax collected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government has pointed out on a number of occasions that the present system wrongly assumes that it is more costly to provide government services to low density States such as Queensland and Western Australia than to higher density States such as Victoria or New South Wales. It completely fails to take into account the effects of the enormous economic growth in States such as Western Australia and Queensland due to the vast mineral boom of the past decade in those States. The Bass Strait oil fields lie off the Victorian coast and therefore the State receives only a percentage of oil royalty revenue shared with the Commonwealth. This is not the case for oil, iron, bauxite and other minerals being developed within the boundaries of some of the so-called Cinderella States of Queensland and Western Australia. What the Victorian Government and the Victorian people want is a new formula to be worked out which is in line with the economies of the States at this time and not a formula worked out some 40 years ago. Victorians require the Commonwealth to return to each State an amount equivalent to the percentage collected from that State. The Grants Commission could then make scientifically based recommendations to the Commonwealth for any additional special assistance considered necessary to be allocated to any particular State because of hardship. Regular reviews by the Grants Commission could be undertaken to determine such special assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that other States which, for the past 38 years have been heavily subsidised by the Victorian and New South Wales taxpayers and are continuing to be financed by them, will not readily agree to major changes in the present tax sharing formula. Why should they? However, we are not just Victorians, Queenslanders and Western Australians: We are all Australians, and in the interests of justice and fair play the present inequitable system must be changed. It has just got to go. The Victorian Chamber of Manufactures forcibly stated this view recently in its November journal. The Chamber said clearly that the time had come for the resource-rich States to pay their own way. For too long Victoria has been forced to curtail growth and job prospects while Victorian industry and Victorian taxpayers have been forced to pay disproportionately higher taxes to subsidise development in the resource-rich States. Victorians are being squeezed by a discriminatory tax sharing formula which, as I have said, is 40 years antiquated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have, as the honourable member for Wills has reminded me, a report of a statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) which is headed: 'Fraser lashes out at States on spending'. What the Victorian people are asking for, as the honourable member for Wills, as a Victorian, should realise, is not more spending on the States but a fairer cutting up of the cake. I would have thought that as a Victorian member the honourable member for Wills would have supported what I am saying. As I said earlier, Victoria contributes 29 per cent to the Federal income tax pool-I thought the honourable member for Wills would have known this-but receives only 23 per cent in return. In the present financial year Victoria will receive only $348 per taxpayer compared with $355 for New South Wales, $481 for Queensland, $575 for Western Australia, $533 for South Australia, and a massive $710 per head for Tasmania. Tasmanian taxpayers get back almost twice the amount received by Victorian taxpayers for what they put in. Tasmanians have been foolish enough for most of this century to elect inefficient Labor governments, but why should Victorian taxpayers or anyone else be forced to pay for the stupidity of Tasmanian voters in electing Labor governments? Let them live with the people they elect to their own parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is no wonder that the Premiers of other States laugh all the way to the Federal kitty. It is no wonder that Mr Bjelke-Petersen boasts of the growth of Queensland and of the exodus of Victorians to his northern State. The inequitable distribution means that Victoria loses out in so many ways. Vital funds are not available to the State Government for programs and incentives to stimulate growth and jobs and the State Government is forced to rely more heavily on State taxes, including payroll tax, to fill the gap. The excessive tax burden on Victorians, particularly Victorian industry, constrains growth and further inhibits job creation. Those States benefiting from this outmoded forumla of Federal handouts are able to offer incentives to attract from Victoria the skilled workers essential to long term growth within our State. No wonder Mr Bjelke-Petersen and Sir Charles Court can sell their minerals overseas at a price which many believe is inadequate. It is time these two States learned to stand on their own economic feet. </PARA>
<PARA> In Melbourne fewer homes are being built and fewer building lots are being offered for sale than at any time during the last decade. A report in November by the Victorian Planning Department signified more bad news for home builders and land developers in Victoria, already hard hit by that State's building recession. According to the report only about 9,000 new lots came on to the market in 1979. The number of subdivisions in every Melbourne growth corridor except Melton decreased. New home building declined in every growth corridor except the south-east. It is not only in taxation and home building that Victoria is being penalised. Tullamarine Airport which, unlike Mascot, has no curfew is not used efficiently or to its capacity. Figures reveal that almost 15,000 more seats are available each week on flights into Sydney than on flights into Melbourne. This is a severe handicap to the tourist industry and the tourist promotion program in Victoria. The latest Department of Transport figures showed Melbourne had only 85 international services a week compared with 141 for Sydney, yet international flights can fly into Melbourne 24 hours a day, seven days a week, unions and the honourable member for Wills permitting. The position is even worse on direct flights. Sydney has 111 direct flights a week to other countries whilst Melbourne has only 34. The time has come when Victoria can no longer act as Father Christmas to the other States. Victoria may well be the garden State of Australia but no longer is everything in the garden rosy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday at Question Time the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) returned to his favourite occupation of verbally warring with the Soviet Union, and bravely announced that relations with that country would not return to normal. The fact is that Australia cannot afford those relations, particularly as to trade, to return to normal. I wish to record one simple fact. Australia's exports to the Soviet Union have doubled since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In calendar year 1979, prior to the invasion, exports to the Soviet Union amounted to $506.1m. In calendar year 1980, the 12 months following the Soviet invasion, Australia's exports to the Soviet Union amounted to $998.3m, an increase of 100 per cent. This makes patently clear the double standards of the Prime Minister and of this Government. Young Australian athletes were hounded and branded as traitors, yet all the while Mr Fraser himself was selling wool to the Soviet Union and, as I have pointed out, Australian trade to the Soviet Union has jumped to record heights. This humbug and hypocrisy has been a mark of Liberal-National Country Party governments. Those of us who were here during the Vietnam War can remember the great attacks on Communist China, yet at the very time Australian forces were in Vietnam the Liberal and National Country parties were encouraging trade with Communist China, a country with whom we were in a state of war and a country that they themselves refused to recognise. That shows the humbug and hypocrisy of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, in his moment of glory statement of 19 February 1980, revealed that whilst the Soviet Union was a super power it was an unbalanced one in that it was defective in grain; that it needed access to Western grain. He proclaimed then that that access to Western grain would suffer. His statement was a gigantic fraud. The cold hard fact is that Australian grain sales to the Soviet Union have jumped from $217m in the year before the invasion to $748m in the 12 months following it. Only last week the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) regretfully announced that Australia could not sell more grain because the so-called restraint ceiling of 3.9 million tonnes could not be met due to the fact that the harvest had been affected by drought. An act of God was giving some purport to what the Prime Minister had maintained he would see as Australia's policy. The yawning gap between the words and actions of this Prime Minister, of this Government, deserve the condemnation not only of this House but also of the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA> However, in at least one field the broadcasts take on a nasty edge, and I refer to the promotion of the pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli line. Not only are some of such programs anti-Israeli; they are anti-Jewish as well. The thinly veiled anti-semitic tone of these broadcasts has brought into the Australian community a distressing and disturbing racial and religious element from which in the past Australia has mercifully been free. There are several such programs, of which one called Par Avion and another called Palestine Speaks are probably the worst. The following is a short extract from the Palestine Speaks broadcast of 6 October 1980:</PARA>
<PARA> Israeli soldiers played a game of cards in which they received one card if they raped one woman, two cards if they raped two, and so on.

<PARA> Station 3CR has a licence which comes up for renewal later this year. Sectional groups should, of course, have freedom to express their views over the radio and elsewhere, but station 3CR has abused this right and should not be allowed continually to poison the community with this hatred, as it is still doing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning at Question Time the Treasurer (Mr Howard) claimed that Mr Einfeld, the New South Wales Minister for Consumer Affairs, had not indicated the position of his Government on the need for legislation in relation to insurance brokers. This afternoon I received the following telegram from Mr Einfeld:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I completely support the principles inherent in the report of the Law Reform Commission regarding urgent necessity for legislation to protect customers of insurance brokers . . . it would be in the best interest of everyone if the Commonwealth would introduce such legislation and that if the Commonwealth refused to do so NSW will be forced to do it to protect customers. I have discussed with the Insurance Brokers Association of Australia and the Confederation of Insurance Brokers as well as the Insurance Council of Australia my desire to see insurance brokers clients protected by legislation . . . that Federal legislation would be preferable so that uniformity prevails . . . I hope you can convince the Federal Government to proceed as promised by the Federal Treasurer some two years ago . . . Its failure to take action will inevitably compel the NSW Government to move in this direction . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that this puts beyond question the support of the Government of New South Wales for such legislation. The need for legislation to cover insurance brokers is urgent. The Law Reform Commission reports-I have revised the figures since last night-that some $14m has been written off over the last 10 years, and $7m in the last two years. That is an appalling indictment. I can see that the legislation is not the panacea for all ills. I agree with the Treasurer that it will not solve all the problems. But, what this appalling legacy of broking house liquidations clearly shows is that there are areas where policy holders are entitled to receive legislative protections, and guarantees to this end can be embodied in law as set out in the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. Because brokerage houses handle vast amounts of premium money, their fiduciary responsibilities cannot be left to self-regulation. The $14m loss is more than ample proof that such an approach is an utter disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> The honest broker is crying out for legislation that will restore credibility to this very important sector of the insurance industry. Individuals and/or companies that pay premiums to a broker for insurance to cover a particular contingent liability have a right to expect that the coverage they seek is secure. The Treasurer knows only too well, as he indicated today, that most of the $3m lost in the Kinloch (Insurances) Pty Ltd. collapse will be honoured by insurers, but that is not always the case. Certainly thousands of policy holders are forced to pay a second lot of premiums. This was the case in three company collapses in Western Australia. The Treasurer will concede that the disaster would have been worse had it not been for the fact that insurance companies have honoured the contracts where the brokers have failed. At the moment there is now law to compel insurance companies to honour the contracts. I suggest to the Treasurer in all seriousness that, whether it be in the field of insurance brokerage or the corporate sector, laws must be enacted that deny corporate shysters or corporate incompetents the opportunity to float companies, rake off millions of dollars of policy holders' funds and then deliberately strip off the assets and dumping the company into liqidation, leaving a train of heartbreak, sacrifice and enormous financial loss for thousands of ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter has been canvassed for four years. There is identical legislation in the United Kingdom. It is long overdue here and I ask that legislation be introduced as quickly as possible. We cannot protect those who have suffered already but the insurance legislation is badly in need of overhaul and it must be carried out as quickly as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) has reminded me of two things in regard to insurance. The first is that regulation is not necessarily the answer, because in many cases regulation merely extends the problem and, secondly, that in this case the New South Wales Government has taken no action although it has had ample opportunity. I want to talk about investment because I read last week of discussions in this place about the need for having Australians invest more in our own resources. I believe it is just a matter of what we in this country believe in regard to investing more in our own country, and so owning more of our own resources. The Government and Opposition agree that we do not own enough of our own resources and we do not reap enough benefits. It is easy to talk about these things. I thought that perhaps it was appropriate to put down some of the arithmetic. If we are to own more of our own resources-this is putting it very simply-we need to invest more. If we are to invest more we have to save more and if we save more, of course, some of that can be reaped off by the Government in government borrowing through the deficit. But, given that a responsible government is in power and that it tries to keep the deficit as low as possible and also to keep the State deficits as low as possible, most of the savings that we make will go into that investment. Unless we save more we will not invest more; that is for certain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the past three or four years I have found it strange to hear the statisticians and economists lament the fact that our savings ratio has grown. I was not in a position to comment adversely on that theory but it always seemed strange. I think that my ideas have been borne out in that when the savings ratio was growing it was actually a healthy sign and not such a bad sign. People said at the time that when the savings ratio was high it meant consumption must be low and we could not have a consumption-led recovery. When the savings ratio is high there is the other possibility that investment will also be high. At present we are also lamenting that we do not own enough of our own resources. If we are to keep pace with what we believe in-that is, that we want to keep as much of our country within the hands of our own people-we must save more and probably have a low deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> On the taxation side, and this is another part of simple arithmetic, we will probably need lower personal taxes, the taxes about which people do not exercise any discretion, and higher indirect taxes, the taxes about which people do exercise discretion. There is always the problem of devising a system under which the mix between those taxes will create problems for people on low incomes. That is exactly the problem to which we would need to address ourselves first. I am not talking about the numbers of and progression in taxes; I am talking about increasing discretion and reducing the lack of discretion that one has with high personal taxes. If there is an increased amount of discretion then there is an increased possibility that the savings ratio will be increased. As I have said, as a matter of simple arithmetic, we will have more scope for owning more of our resources because we will have more to invest. I am talking about arithmetic only, not politics. We are all proud of Australia. On both sides of this House I think we all believe that we ought to collect our own heritage. Now that we are getting out of the woods why do we not fight in this Parliament and in all places to see that our people reap the harvest?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a few words tonight about my home State of South Australia. No doubt those honourable members who have visited South Australia have found it to be a very pleasant place. Adelaide is a very pleasant city. It is a nice, easy place to find one's way around. The political aspects of the State are a little different from what might be happening in some of the other States in Australia where benefits from the so-called resources boom are going to occur. In the period from 1970 to 1979, which was the period of the Dunstan and Corcoran Labor governments, the conservative element in South Australia continually talked down the opportunities that might occur there. They continued to give a jaundiced view of what the future of South Australia may be. In some ways I believe they persuaded people to keep out of South Australia. It has even reached the heights now where in the newsapers we see advertisements by the Avis Rent a Car System which tell people how Avis can help them to enjoy their business stay in Adelaide. It is really not Los Vegas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most of us find South Australia a very pleasant place, but the conservatives played a very big role in telling everybody in Australia and elsewhere that South Australia really did not have much going for it. Of course, now they cannot stop it. People have the view that perhaps South Australia is not as well off as some of the other States. To a very large extent it is true. In some of the traditional industries of South Australia, particularly the car industry, which has not experienced a growth in sales, the employment opportunities and the number of employees have dropped rather dramatically in the past two or three years. That is one indicator of how the States may be going. Of course, South Australia has the highest unemployment rate on the mainland. Almost 9 per cent of the total work force in South Australia is registered as unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I raise these points tonight is to put forward the view that South Australia has some specific problems that ought to be looked at by the Federal Government. One of the reasons that I believe South Australia has not been looked at seriously by the Federal Government is that South Australia is grossly under-represented in the Fraser Ministry. South Australia has one ministerial representative. He is a very junior member of the Liberal Party from South Australia. I refer to Senator Messner. He was not widely known when he was appointed a Minister. I am not critical of his appointment but it does mean that South Australia has only one very junior person in the whole Fraser Ministry. Through the resignation of the former Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, now Mr Justice Ellicott, there is an opportunity for the appointment of another South Australian. That may cause some difficulty. When one looks at those people who are being suggested in the Press as possible Ministers-people such as 'Curly' Carlton and 'Mumbles' Connolly-it would not hurt if another South Australian were given the opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not expect the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to elevate the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) straight into the Ministry because over the years the honourable member for Boothby had great difficulty in his clash of loyalties. I think the Prime Minister is well aware of what he may have to put up with if he promotes the honourable member for Boothby into the Ministry. He did elevate the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) to the position of a Parliamentary Secretary which gives one the view that perhaps the honourable member for Sturt was in line for a ministerial stake when the opportunity arose. It seems to me far more important at the moment that South Australia be given another voice in the Ministry and that another New South Welshman not be selected. If some of the States are worried about missing out on the benefits of the so-called resources boom, some of the smaller States like Tasmania and South Australia ought to have representation in the Ministry so that they can raise their voices. Tasmania does have that influence. Western Australia, New South Wales and Victoria all have representation over and above that given to South Australia. It seems to me that the Prime Minister must have some special reason for excluding South Australian representation if, with the opportunity he has now been given from the Ellicott resignation, he does not appoint another South Australian to the Ministry as quickly as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Wills for his support also. I wish to comment on speeches which were made by honourable members on both sides of the House tonight. I refer to the speech made by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Jarman) who is concerned about the situation in Victoria relating to the tax reimbursement formula. I refer also to the speech made by the honourable member for Port Adelaide who is concerned about the industrial and investment situation in South Australia. I relate the comments made by those two honourable members to the remarks made by my colleague, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury), who quite correctly pointed out that, if Australia is to own more of Australia, there has to be a rise in savings and a rise in investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should like to go further to express some concern about the direction of that investment. I think that over the next few years we will have a very good opportunity to ensure that the money that we save is directed towards activities which will create more Australian ownership and more Australian employment. Certain industries in Australia are getting themselves into greater and greater difficulties-some of these are located in South Australia and some in Victoria-because they are unable to face up to the kinds of changes that have to be made so that investments in those industries are more productive. In a gentle fashion, I ask this question: If certain policies which help to direct investment by way of providing protection or providing subsidies are leading to further difficulties in certain industries, is it sensible to add to that protection or to increase the effect of those policies which are creating unemployment problems or depression in certain regional areas? I merely say that that question has to be asked, and asked sincerely. I regret very much--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Howe" NAMEID="EH4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr CARLTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am prepared to look at removing subsidies from all sorts of areas, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I say that over the next couple of years many decisions will be made which will have an effect on the direction of investment. I expressed some concern last year over the fact that people were proudly pointing to an investment in Australia of approximately $35m in the case of one company in the textile industry. If one were advising any set of investors about where to invest $35m to the best effect as far as jobs and future profits are concerned one would hardly direct those people to the Australian textile industry. Yet that $35m was proudly invested by that company. That was a decision taken by the directors of that company, and they will spend a lot of time over the next few years in Canberra rather than in their management offices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter to which I wish to draw attention is the forthcoming report by Mr Campbell on the financial system. This report will affect the direction of investment. If Australians are to face up to owning more of their own country, then they have to question whether they should, for example, be putting so much of their discretionary income-I am thinking here perhaps of the better off people who have this discretionary capacity-into adding an extra room to a house or into buying a much more expensive house in an expensive area, and whether that will continue to be possible at effectively subsidised rates of interest when that money might be put into owning more of our natural resources and not having them owned so much by foreign interests. It is very comfortable indeed to sit in a very good residence in a comfortable part of a capital city and to be on a very high income and to deplore the lack of Australian ownership and at the same time to drive in one's Volvo to an even more expensive suburb to look at a house with six bedrooms for a family with three children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, much publicity has been given to aspects of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares that have related to Western Australia. This discussion has obscured one of the major weaknesses of the inquiry, a weakness wholly induced by the early closure of its investigation; that is, that of the four main areas of interest to Western Australians only one was dealt with in any detail. These areas were: Cross-subsidisation of jet flights, intrastate air fares in Western Australia, the availability of Qantas Airways Ltd seats for cross-country travel and, finally, the problems that the Western Australian tourist industry suffers because of the international gateway status of some eastern States airports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Only one of these matters was dealt with by the inquiry in any detail at all, and that was the one that gained publicity-the question of jet routes cross-subsidisation. This is what the inquiry was compelled to confess of its curtailed investigation. The task of identifying the degree of cross-subsidisation is immensely complicated. In this instance the problem was aggravated by a lamentable lack of studies of price and income elasticities of demand on the various routes and their implications for the management of the national network. Because of the limited time available to it, the inquiry had no option but to accept this important shortcoming, and this, of course, constitutes a qualification to its findings. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry, of course, revealed a $23m per annum rip-off of the Western Australian traveller. Yet the committee had to hurry its investigation of this matter and was unhappy about the amount of detail it could gather. Earlier this week I spoke on the question of intrastate fares in Western Australia. Here again the inquiry was compelled to say that whilst the matter was in its terms of reference it did not have the time to investigate it. On the vitally important question to Western Australians of the use of Qantas cross country seats which could provide discounts of up to 50 per cent, which has been the subject of persistent representations by the member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) and the fair air fares campaign, the inquiry was reduced to dealing with it in a couple of short paragraphs. While it raised some difficulties with the question, the inquiry stated:</PARA>
<PARA>What can be said is that the reduction in costs associated with the introduction of larger aircraft . . . would be significant. </PARA>
<PARA>This desirable step would, of course, be precluded by the new agreement. Finally, on the question of points of entry, the Holcroft committee was obliged to concede that here again Western Australia suffered but nothing could be done about it in the time available. This is the report which the Government said would clarify the Western Australian position. This is the report whose early unwilling conclusion Western Australian Liberal members have supported. This is the inquiry that was set up, according to the Government, to enable those of us from Western Australia to have the benefit of its advice before we debated the airlines agreement. I grieve for the members of the inquiry in their embarrassment at their inability to report on these key areas of their reference, and I worry about Western Australian air travellers who have been denied valuable evidence to promote the case they have established prima facie. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to reply very briefly to the contribution of the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) whose interest in insurance matters is respected and appreciated on both sides of the House. I simply wish to make it quite plain that the concern that I expressed earlier today about the New South Wales Government was that the New South Wales Government had not responded to a request made by the Federal Government in accordance with the arrangements worked out between the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Premier of New South Wales for a view on the report of the Law Reform Commission insofar as that report related to insurance brokers. It may well be that Mr Einfeld believes in legislation of a particular kind. I am sure he does; he has told me that on earlier occasions. I am quite sure that he would not personally misrepresent the situation. The Government naturally wants a response from the New South Wales Government, and his view may or may not necessarily carry the day. I am sure that the honourable member for Hawker appreciates that fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government intends when it has received all the responses to the Law Reform Commission report to analyse them promptly. We received responses from the principal industry bodies only yesterday. We will then give early consideration to the matter. That is the advice I have received. I note the crease in the brow of the honourable member for Hawker, but I can assure him that that is the information I have been given. It is our intention to give very prompt consideration to the issue. I do not believe I have as high a threshold of expectation about what regulation can do in this area as the honourable member for Hawker has. I share the view of my colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) that simply adding to the bulk of regulation does not necessarily produce a more efficient, or indeed, a more honest industry. I suggest, with respect, that it puts into context some of the remarks made by other speakers tonight to the effect that another sector of the economy, namely, the money market, has benefited in recent months from a degree of deregulation that was undertaken by the Government early in December. I think anybody who understands the operation of the Australian financial system would recognise that that decision has made a significant contribution towards a more realistic and more stable situation in the money market. </PARA>
<PARA> So the balance is by no means in favour of regulation. In my view the onus is always on those who assert that there should be more regulation, as the insurance brokers do, to establish the public benefit. It is easy for an industry to argue for more regulation. It is often an example of that truism in politics that people are in favour of things in general but are opposed to them in particular. </PARA>

<PARA> I make it plain to the honourable member for Hawker in recognition of his intelligent contribution to debate in this Parliament on the insurance industry that we will reach a conclusion as speedily as possible. The matter has been under consideration for a while. He is correct in saying that. We did retreat from the more extensive regulation that was first mooted in 1976 but for good and proper reasons. There has been a further extension of time, waiting for the Law Reform Commission report. I think the matter ought to be brought to a speedy conclusion, but I would again counsel him not to expect my views about the degree of regulation that is required to correspond with his. </PARA>
