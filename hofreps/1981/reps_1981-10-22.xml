<TITLE>Diabetics: Insulin</TITLE>
<PARA> Sir William McMahon-Before petitions are read may I draw attention to the lack of people on the Opposition benches. I think they should be given an opportunity to come into the chamber and listen to the business of the House.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Lionel Bowen-What about the Government's attendance? It is about one-fifth.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr SPEAKER-I take it that the right honourable gentleman was not drawing attention to the state of the House. I take it that he was seeking an indulgence from me, as distinct from calling for a quorum.</PARA>
<PARA> Sir William McMahon-That is so.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr SPEAKER-I should point out that hitherto on the opening of proceedings of the House, at the ceasing of the ringing of the bells there was invariably a full attendance in the House. What has led to the paucity of attendance at the end of the ringing of the bells is the fact that petitions are read out at that time, a procedure that invariably takes anything from 8 to 12 minutes. That has led to members arriving later in the expectation of petitions taking that time. I think it is for the House to consider whether petitions should be read at the opening of the sitting. In fact, the Standing Orders Committee has recommended to the House that petitions be read after questions. I will have discussions with the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) to see whether that matter can be brought on for discussion. I am indebted to the right honourable gentleman for drawing attention to the position. The point made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was a natural response from him, but it has been overtaken by the whole course of events now that I have set out the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> The Clerk-Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. That the Budget imposition of additional sales tax to both existing sales taxed items and to previously exempt goods:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) will add to the regressivity of the tax structure by imposing a similar burden on all sections of the community-regardless of the capacity to pay tax;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) will be highly inflationary and a disincentive to economic performance in key sectors of manufacturing industry, e.g. car manufacturing; textiles and footwear; boat-building;</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned by the threats to women's health and lives posed by Toxic Shock Syndrome, and urge the following steps to be taken as a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under ''Cosmetics'' as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to: (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed. This campaign of public education would necessitate multilingual distribution of the information where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take immediate and positive action to avert possible threats posed to women's health by implementation of the above measures.</PARA>

<TITLE>Subsidy Payments for Nursing Home Patients</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The majority of pensioners in nursing homes are currently not receiving any significant rebate after all fees and laundry expenses are paid. This situation does not allow for a basically acceptable quality of life and undermines the dignity of people who are unable to fend for themselves. We call upon the Federal Government to investigate the plight of these people and guarantee them at least the opportunity to financially support their own basic needs.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. When residents of nursing homes go to stay with friends or relatives for short periods (e.g. weekends) they are compelled to pay the Commonwealth subsidy for the period of their absence. This expense is obviously not able to be met by the majority of nursing home residents or their friends and relatives. The result is that people who would benefit from short periods away from the nursing home are restricted to its confines because they are not in the position to pay for their release. This situation causes emotional trauma on festive occasions such as Christmas and birthdays.</PARA>
<PARA> We feel this is a hardship that should not be borne by nursing home residents and call on the Federal Government to relax its policy regarding subsidy payments for nursing home residents on short leave.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Government policy on subsidy payments for nursing home residents on short leave, be relaxed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Communications in his capacity as Leader of the House. I refer to the announcement made outside the Parliament yesterday that this House will go into recess next Thursday for about four months. Is it a fact that the Government is introducing some 10 new pieces of legislation today? Is it further a fact that the Senate has indicated that it will not pass at least 10 of the Bills which will be before the Parliament? Is it also not a fact that some of these Bills are very important, relating to defence, social welfare and other such matters? What is the Government's position in respect of legislation that is not passed by the Senate and referred back to this House when this House will not be able to deal with it? What is the reason for the Government not continuing to sit to allow this House to complete all of the business and deal with many other matters which are on the Notice Paper? Is this because directions have been given by the Prime Minister that the House is not to sit? If so, why do we have to take note of the right honourable gentleman's directions? Why cannot this House determine the business that it ought to be dealing with? Should the House sit until the business is completed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is, obviously, always an interest by honourable members in when the House will sit. It is quite apparent that Government members need to plan their programs forward. I know of some of the uncertainty of honourable members of the Opposition. Perhaps they are not in quite the same position. But in order to project where we were going in our legislative program, early in the session it was indicated that we would be seeking to pass through the Parliament before the House rose all those Bills that related to the Budget. There is, in addition, a program which embraces quite a number of other Bills, many of which we believe would be better left on the table of the House for honourable members to peruse. Some relate to matters that are non-party political in character-for example, the amendments that have been recommended to the family law legislation. Others relate to matters of very real public interest. It is felt that there is no necessity for them to be rushed through the Parliament before the House rises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the Government's intention to finish dealing with those Bills related to the Budget which have been introduced and which have been designated for passage. I can, at this stage, give nothing more other than an indication that the House may well have finished those Bills by Thursday of next week. Of course, if it has not done so and if the other place decides that there should be amendments, it will be necessary for the House to meet to consider those amendments. I did no more than give an indicative trend, and that is what I do now. If the Budget legislation, which the Government feels it is necessary to pass, has been dealt with and concluded in the House of Representatives, the House of Representatives may be in a position to rise by next Thursday night. If it has not done so or if measures need to be returned from the Senate, of course it will be necessary for it to sit subsequently.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister for Defence to the fact that the United States Navy has been advised by the Government that the main contract for our purchase of the F18 would not be placed until a clearance was obtained from the United States Department of Defense in respect of weapons still being tested for the F18's air to surface attack role. A decision is anticipated about this time next year. What additional barriers have been placed upon the purchase of all or part of the anticipated procurement? In particular, are there any barriers entailing restrictions on an escalation of the cost of the basic aircraft or its electronics or weapons systems?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman is quite correct that limitations are placed on the FA18 in an air-to-surface role. Those limitations relate to the carriage of particular stores in some configurations. I am advised by the Chief Defence Scientist, Professor Fink, who is pre-eminent in the field of aeronautical engineering, that this represents no substantial problem. It is merely a matter of obtaining final clearance in the sense that the aircraft measures up completely to all specifications. I am not aware of any other limitations relating to the aircraft. With respect to the last part of the question of my honourable friend, namely, that relating to the waiver of research and development, I will seek precise information on that. The matter is not free of considerable complexity. Because of their relationship with the United States of America, as I am presently advised, I think the Canadians were granted a concession. I do not know whether there would be any scope for Australian participation. If my honourable friend will be patient, I will attend to the matter immediately Question Time finishes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of those reports. Honourable members will be aware that the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs did recommend, amongst other things, that in order to enhance the police powers against drug traffickers operating in this country, consideration should be given to allowing the police powers to intercept mail and to have access to tax records. In making that recommendation, Mr Justice Williams went to great length to say that if that was considered to be something the Government should introduce, it should be introduced under very strict controls-controls no less than now operate in respect of the intercept powers of the police in such things as telephone calls. Having the recommendations from Mr Justice Williams in front of us, the Government is considering the powers regarding the interception of postal matters as well as access to tax records. As the Government considers those recommendations it will have to keep two things very much in mind: Firstly, that there is a need to protect the citizens of this country from the people who are at the centre of drug trafficking and other organised crime activities-we will be looking at that very carefully-and, secondly, that it is absolutely essential to protect the honest citizen and his rights when we are looking at the controls that would have to operate if those powers were introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Premier has been in contact with me on a number of occasions about this matter and a response has been delayed because of a need and a wish to establish an overall strategy for celebrations throughout Australia in 1988. Whilst I think most honourable members would want some focal point for that year, there are a number of other matters to be determined, because I would have hoped and believed that we would want 1988 to be a year in which Australians, wherever they may live, will be able to participate in celebrations throughout that year. That will involve very much more than having an Expo in one particular place, whether that happens to be Sydney, Brisbane or somewhere else. It is a question of establishing that overall strategy which has been before the Government's mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Bicentennial Authority has given a great deal of attention to it. The Minister responsible has placed submissions before the Government and as a result of our discussions of the matter the Minister and I will have discussions as soon as they can be arranged with the Chairman of the Authority. That might well lead to further Cabinet consideration about our overall strategy. But I hope when that does unfold it will be one which State governments, local governments and, as broadly based as possible, the whole Australian community can participate in and feel that they are very much a part of. So it is not just the grand projects that we are interested in; we are interested in grassroots involvement in something which will be very important for all Australians, old or new.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Curtin on his intelligent interest in all matters of housing and for his positive contribution to the Government back bench committee. In answer to his very precisely expressed question, I advise him on the first part that the Government is reviewing its total housing policy. In answer to the second part, of course if it were possible to do as he asked those very desirable consequences mentioned would follow. But I point out that the need for the waiting period was occasioned because of the disastrous economic climate we inherited and the fact that the expenditure to catch up would have placed very serious pressures on the Budget at that time. At the present time, on account of the initiatives developed by the Government with particular reference to a family commitment of help, we find that the number of applications this year has increased by 50 per cent over last year. They are running at the rate of about 1,000 a week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Consequently, to do as the honourable member requested would require an injection of funds this year of $60m to $70m. Quite obviously that would be contrary to the Government's policy and one could not countenance that. However, one must remember that in the overall Federal Government commitment to housing in the Budget last year we allowed $555m; this year there has been a substantial increase to $660m-an increase of 18.9 per cent. I think that indicates that this Government is concerned for Australian home ownership. It is concerned about housing and accommodating all Australians and gives the lie to those who, for cheap political purpose, seek to downgrade our contribution in the area of shelter and accommodation.</PARA>

I also remind the Minister that I am now in a position to understand his refusal. I ask the Minister: Does the letter from Mr Searby of 13 May disclose a desire on the part of the Minister to bring in legislation in three policy areas before the end of May?

Very strong winds were prevailing and there were icy conditions.

It was essentially that sort of projection that was behind the McKinsey comments. The decision by the Government not to grant approval to Telecom to proceed with Prestel was predicated on the fact that the capital required to meet that projected increase in demand for Telecom's services was such that it would be better if capital were diverted into Telecom's line services, its network operations and its area of prime responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The general projection of capital requirement has certainly been reduced as a result of discussions between me and Telecom, but it needs to be remembered that there was still a negative cash flow for at least the first two years of Prestel's operation. The experience of British Prestel is not without some relevance, for British Prestel has not attracted the support that the earlier expectations of the service had led the investors in the system to expect. Our concern has been that Telecom, as a monopoly corporation, needs to relate funds, which are essentially public funds, to those areas in which a monopoly is required. The Government does not believe that viewdata is one of those areas. It is with that in mind that the Government believes that the private sector should be given the opportunity to invest in that new technology.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The basis for developing the Burdekin Dam and the irrigation area has been agreed upon with the Queensland Government. The Commonwealth has agreed to provide all the funds required for the construction of the dam which will be approximately $85m in mid-1980 terms. The Queensland Government has the responsibility of providing the infrastructure and the preliminary work necessary for the construction of the dam, such as the access roads. That work is taking place. The Queensland Government also has the responsibility of providing the development of the irrigation area. I am told that the infrastructure work will cost about $15m and the irrigation area about $109m. Of course, the Queensland Government will have the advantage of returns from the sale of this land and also from the sale of the water. There is no reason for anybody to believe that the program will be delayed. It is on course and I hope it will be constructed within the time period.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Robertson very kindly drew my attention to an article which appeared in one of the Sydney newspapers a few days ago. I notice that there is an article in today's Sydney Morning Herald along the same lines. I will carry out the investigation he has asked me to make and have a word with the Attorney-General in the immediate sense. Judging from recent comments of the Leader of the Opposition, this House would be unanimous in condemning that sort of literature and in condemning the sentiments behind it. I notice in the article the honourable member gave me that a State member, Mr Aquilina, has said that the literature is rubbish. Referring to Mr Thompson, the organiser, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I don't think he will get any support at all. The public reaction will be very adverse I should think . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I also believe that that would be the case. I will certainly investigate the matter and see whether we can eliminate some of the really pernicious, blatantly racist and unfounded statements that are made. Many of them, I might say, are made against me, including still, I regret to say, by the Victorian President of the Returned Services League, who continues to repeat what he knows to be lies. Despite that, I believe this country is now mature enough to be able to ride out those vocal minorities. Democracy is so well entrenched and our compassion and tolerance are now so widely demonstrated that this kind of lunatic fringe will remain a fringe. I do believe that.</PARA>
<PARA> Travelling the country, one sees a lot of examples of both sides of the coin. For example, in Perth it was fashionable to paint on bus sheds a lot of anti-Asian sentiments. It was also a fact, though, that at midnight many people who would never ever speak out on issues such as this would go down and paint out those slogans. I remember that a Vietnamese barber was sacked in Queensland last year because he was Vietnamese and one customer complained. Within an hour my Department had had 80 phone calls offering him a job, and as a result of that many other Vietnamese were employed. Indeed, that went on for days. The Courier-Mail got the same sort of response.</PARA>
<PARA> For every example of racism and matters about which the honourable member has complained there are examples of basic human decency and compassion many times over. I am informed that the gentleman about whom the honourable member is complaining, Mr Thompson, is in fact part Aboriginal. Certainly, judging by appearances on colour television he would appear to be so. It certainly is curious that he is standing for a white Australia party.

But as it happens, I will be taking before Cabinet very shortly proposals arising out of the review of NUMAS which I believe, if accepted-I have no reason to think they will not be-will reflect a very considered approach by the Government to meet the aspirations of the Australian community regarding family reunion and to meet also the labour market facts of life. One of the most important facts for this House to understand is that the general trend of family reunion applications is in the semi-skilled to unskilled area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The new two airlines agreement will come into operation very shortly. The air services over the trunk route will be operated in accordance with the provisions of that agreement. There is a provision for other operators to provide specialist services or to offer to provide specialist services over sections of the trunk route but both airlines in the first instance are offered the opportunity to provide those services. If they do not provide those services it is up to the Minister of the day to decide whether another operator should be approved to operate a specialist service. It needs to be remembered that the trunk route generally is basically the province of the two airlines. While ever the two airlines agreement remains in force, that will remain the case. I think it is very important to recognise that fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, when East-West Airlines Ltd made its application to fly a specialist service between Sydney and Canberra it was warned that either Trans Australia Airlines or Ansett Airlines of Australia, or both, could exercise a right to fly a similar service.

In the event, Ansett chose to exercise its right under the licence to make an application for approval of a fare structure that actually mirrored the East-West service. East-West then took a commercial decision not to fly the service at present. But the opportunity will remain for East-West to get into the market should it so wish.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the debate this morning to raise the question of our relations with other countries and particularly how those relations may be affected by our trade with them. I refer firstly to the statement by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) on Tuesday of this week, which is recorded on page 2184 of Hansard. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Chile now has a sensible regime under which the economy is moving and working well. The present regime has the respect of the people. It has the confidence of investors. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that the Deputy Prime Minister is influenced by the fact that we export almost $8m worth of goods to Chile and import almost $7m worth of goods from that country. His whole mentality is guided by the fact that we have some trade with Chile. He is prepared to submerge all the things we think are important in Australia, such as the right to vote, the right to assemble, the right to protest and the right to worship. All those things are sunk by the Deputy Prime Minister because of a certain amount of trade we have with that country. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important for us to put the record straight. Firstly, in September 1980 the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) asked the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), a question about Chile. He asked:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to the International Commission of Enquiry into the Crimes of the Military Junta in Chile Report, published following the Enlarged Secretariat Meeting at Elsinor, Denmark, 7-9 December 1979; if so, has he instructed his Department to make any investigation . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (2) If an investigation has been carried out, does the result confirm or deny that statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The then Minister for Foreign Affairs answered the question as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is actively involved in following developments in Chile both through the Australian Embassy in Santiago and in such international forums as the United Nations. Most recently Australia supported a draft resolution at the 36th Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in March 1980, calling on the Chilean Government to respect human rights. However, the Government has been made aware of a deterioration in the situation in Chile in recent times following an increase in terrorism and agitation and allegations of the use of torture. Australia condemns the use of torture and the practices of arbitrary arrest, detention incommunicado and 'disappearance', wherever they occur. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government regrets that the new constitutional arrangements in Chile adopted in the plebiscite on 11 September do not represent a meaningful step towards the return of democratic rule in Chile. The new constitution institutionalises the present regime's rule until elections in 1989 when the government retains the right to nominate the presidential candidate. The recent plebiscite was conducted in an atmosphere of government intimidation and opponents were not able to express their views freely and publicly. We regret that the Chilean people were not given the opportunity to vote on a plan for the genuine restoration of democracy in Chile. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important for members of the Government back benches to understand the way in which the Deputy Prime Minister has committed this country with his off the cuff statement on Tuesday this week about that country. Let me add to that an article written by Jean-Pierre Clerc in Le Monde on 5 April 1981. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The regime's sympathisers-</PARA>
<PARA>Like our Deputy Prime Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>never let go about the modernisation of old Santiago and its new air of opulence and American-style bustle which they talk about to visitors. </PARA>
<PARA> But downtown streets are more than ever overrun with beggars cadging a few centavos in exchange for a tune on the accordion or flute, with pathetic old men obviously at the end of the line, with children in rags. Buses are ambushed by women who stretch out their hands after a rendition of some popular song, or by adolescents hawking caramels and fruit. In this dignified land, such changes are particularly noticeable. </PARA>
<PARA> In a little over seven years, Pinochet has not only turned the ''England of Latin America'' into a state where human rights are a mockery, but he has also in record time converted a rather ''Victorian'' country, where dignified paternalism tempered social inequality and wealth was never ostentatious, into a museum of man's exploitation by man and a temple to tawdry consumerism. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the explanation given by Le Monde for what is happening in Chile today. Chile has become notorious for its abuse of civil and human rights. Violence in Chile is neither arbitrary nor accidental. It is an important part of Government practice and it has been in use since 1973 to serve the interests of the ruling clique under President Pinochet. Over the past eight months leading up to the middle of this year the Pinochet regime has curtailed civil liberties even further. The power of the judiciary to release prisoners has been suspended and the Government now has the right to hold citizens without explanation and without the right to legal representation for up to 20 days. Formerly this power was for five days only. The universities have been brought under the most stringent controls and over the past 18 months over 300 academic staff members have been dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA> Amnesty International reports of 1978, 1979 and 1980 reported on the high incidence of the use of torture in the country whereby any person who is even suspected of opposing the Government is arrested and subject to the most brutal kinds of torture. Amnesty International's report for 1980 states that as many as 2,000 people have been arrested and tortured over the preceding 12 months. Amnesty reports that in the town of Talca 30 people were seized. All were subjected to water torture and electric shocks. The bodies of 15 of the victims of the Pinochet coup turned up last winter in a mineshaft west of the capital, Santiago. The soldiers who were found guilty of the murders were subsequently granted amnesty. In October of the same year, 1980, another grave containing 18 bodies was found also. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who dare to challenge the Government in Chile are subject to exile under the decree which prohibits public criticism of the Government or which may create tension and division within the ruling armed forces. Former Christian Democratic Party Leader, Andres Zaldivar, was banished from the country in October 1980 for attacking the Pinochet regime. Chile, under Pinochet, has employed a rigid economic program, which might be attractive to the Deputy Prime Minister of this country, loosely based upon the work of Milton Freidman. This has entailed balancing the budget, liberating interest rates and lowering tariff barriers. The immediate result of this was that during 1976 and 1977, there was a sudden rush of bankruptcies, a dramatic rise in unemployment and a sharp drop in the purchasing power of the working and middle classes. </PARA>
<PARA> The costs of Pinochet's social surgery were borne by the poor and by sections of the middle class. Thousands of civil servants and Government office workers were dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA> Officially, over 10 per cent of Santiago's work force is unemployed. The real figure is probably twice that. Unemployment in the rural areas runs as high as 40 per cent while almost 4 per cent of the total work force-that is, over 130,000-have been reduced to what is euphemistically referred to as the 'schedule of minimum employment'. These are the workers who earn the lowest wage of $30 a month. One survey estimated that as many as 70,000 people lost their jobs as a direct result of the removal of import barriers and the opening up of the country to foreign imports and foreign investment. During the squeeze of 1975-76 real wages slumped by one-third. Today, Chileans are estimated to have roughly the same purchasing power that they had in 1970. A little over 20 per cent of the population live in conditions of dire poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the coup United States investment has indeed flowed back into Chile. The reason is that the terms governing foreign investment are extraordinarily favourable. From the outset firms can repatriate all profits and after as little as three years they can repatriate all invested funds without restriction. Since the coup, approximately 77 per cent of all funds have come from the United States of America and 15 per cent have come from Canada. Since 1977, 14 mining projects worth a total of $3.7 billion accounted for 90 per cent of all foreign investment. These figures indicate that the United States investors have been the real beneficiaries of the coup while local manufacturing industries, farmers and small businesses have all suffered severely from the free inflow of foreign capital. So it is for the great change in the economy which has attracted the support of the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take the matter and refer to the civil liberties question. An article which is headed 'Chile's bishops to Excommunicate torturers-Santiago, January 15, 1981' states:</PARA>
<PARA> At least six of Chile's Catholic bishops have issued excommunication decrees for any official or person working at the official's behest who tortures political prisoners. </PARA>
<PARA> The excommunication decrees have been promulgated as Chilean human rights groups have asked General Augusto Pinochet's military Government for an investigation into allegations of torture by the National Information Centre . . . Chile's secret police intelligence organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> One could go on and on about what has happened in Chile over the past eight years. It does not do any justice to Australia at all to have one of its leading politicians, or any politician for that matter, singing the praises of Chile because we have a little trade with that country. Unfortunately I did not obtain the permission of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) to incorporate this document as he was not here but I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the 1980 report of Amnesty International on Chile which I do not have time to read to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> There was a marked deterioration in the human rights situation during the year. The major concerns of Amnesty International were political killings, political imprisonment and torture. There were many arbitrary detentions, allegations of torture and harassment of trade unionists, members of youth organisations, human rights activists, members of church organizations, political opponents and the poor. Amnesty International issued numerous appeals concerning such cases, prepared and distributed information about its concerns in Chile and submitted information to appropriate inter-governmental and non-govermental organizations. </PARA>
<PARA> The government has stated several times that its new constitution, currently being drafted without participation of or consultation with independent lawyers, will have no place for political parties. A group of independent lawyers, known as the Group of 24, which prepared alternative texts for the constitution has been harassed and forbidden to hold public meetings. The new labour code has been enforced amid strong criticism from the few remaining independent trade union federations. Several trade union leaders have been arrested and charged with involving themselves in politics because they signed a petition concerning the ''disappeared'' prisoners whose bodies were found in Lonquen. </PARA>
<PARA> On 7 February 1980 the state of emergency was again renewed-this has taken place as a matter of routine every six months since 1973, when President Pinochet came to power as a result of a coup. All political parties remain banned and, according to Decree 3177 of 9 February 1980, all political activity connected with the banned political parties is to be considered an offence under the jurisdiction of ordinary courts. Before this decree was promulgated, this type of offence was dealt with by the Court of Appeal. Independent lawyers consider ordinary courts to be even less independent from the executive than the Court of Appeal, and delays are longer. </PARA>
<PARA> During the year two other decree laws were promulgated which further restrict the right to defence and fair trial of political detainees. Decree Law 2621 of 28 April 1979, the so-called Anti-Terrorist Law amends articles of the Law of Internal State Security, the Penal Code and the Code of Penal Procedure. The law has been widely criticised by members of the legal profession on legal and political grounds because it assumes an organization is illegal if one or more of its members-even if they were not acting in their capacity as members of that organization-commits an offence under the law. The Minister of Justice stated that ''organizations of all kinds will, therefore, have to take care not to admit to membership people performing such acts, since all members will be brought to trial as constituting an illegal organization, an offence which exists by the mere fact of having formed such an organization, and will be required to prove whether or not they are innocent''. This directly contravenes Article 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that a person shall be assumed innocent until proved guilty. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Chile, in his report on the protection of human rights in Chile published on 21 November 1979, concluded his examination of the law as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>''Decree Law 2621, which was apparently promulgated in order to combat terrorism, contains elements which may transform it into an instrument for violating human rights. In particular, it affects the right of persons to be presumed innocent until they are proved guilty, the right of association, and the right of a person not to be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, or to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. The possible social implications of this legislation for community life in Chile are particularly serious in view of the intimidating nature of its provisions as they were explained to the population by the Minister of Justice.''</PARA>
<PARA> On 6 February 1980 Decree Law 3168 was promulgated which gave the Minister of the Interior power to order the detention of people for up to five days and to assign them to residence in remote areas for disturbing public order or for attempting to disturb public order, without any rights to defence, trial or appeal. This decree gives the government powers under the present state of emergency that it formerly had only under the state of siege. To avoid the possibility that the Supreme Court might deem this decree law unconstitutional, the junta invoked legislative powers which it had assumed after the coup of 1973. Furthermore, arrests under Decree Law 3168 are not under the control of the Contraloria General de la Republica, the public body that oversees state administrative procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> Decree Law 3168 was applied to people who demonstrated peacefully on 8 March 1980, International Women's Day. Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets for a rally organized by the women's section of the Coordinadora Nacional Sindical (CNS), the National trade Union Coordinating Body. The CNS had requested permission for the march from the government but had been refused because of the ''political intention'' of the rally. Peaceful demonstrations took place in Chile's main cities, Santiago, Concepcion and Valparaiso. The police detained more than a hundred people in Santiago and 26 in Valparaiso. Detainees were reportedly subjected to interrogation by the Central Nacional de Informaciones (CNI), the National Centre of Information, as the secret police are now called, and kept incommunicado for five days. </PARA>
<PARA> On 13 March the Minister of the Interior announced that 12 of the detainees were to be banished by order of President Pinochet, each for a period of three months, to remote villages in the far north or south of Chile. The other detainees were released ''under observation''. They, too, may be banished if they are detained again as a result of participating in any sort of protest; the people who were banished were referred to as ''repeated offenders''. </PARA>
<PARA> Towards the end of March 1980 the Minister of the Interior stated that a further five people who had been arrested on 8 March were to be banished. The five people concerned had been freed ''under observation'' but ''new evidence'' made it necessary to banish them. </PARA>
<PARA> Amnesty International believed that those restricted under Decree Law 3168 were prisoners of conscience and appealed to the government for their immediate and unconditional release. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1979 the magazine Hoy was banned for two months after having published a statement made by the Special Investigating Judge appointed to look into the case of bodies found at Lonquen. The government stated that the reason for the banning was the planned publication of interviews with exiled leaders of the Socialist Party. The measure was taken by the military commander of the Santiago area under the state of emergency. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1979 the Comite Pro Retorno was formed by relatives of those exiled with the purpose of campaigning for their return in accordance with various international agreements to which Chile is a signatory, for example, the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Individuals applying to return to Chile have been refused re-entry, often without any apparent motive, since many of them left voluntarily and were not involved in any political activity abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1,500 and 2,000 people were arrested for political reasons during 1979 and at the beginning of 1980, mostly for participating in public and peaceful demonstrations, still systematically forbidden by the government. Several hundreds were arrested in their homes, at their places of work or in public places by members of the security forces who commonly took them to secret detention centres where they were interrogated and tortured or suffered other forms of ill-treatment, and then released a few days later. </PARA>
<PARA> An Amnesty International survey of some 1,500 detentions during 1979 reveals that most of those arrested by the CNI or by armed civilians (who probably belong to the CNI) were taken to secret places of detention and tortured by, among other methods, electric shock, suspension and severe beatings. </PARA>
<PARA> The government attempted to prevent a large turnout on Labour Day 1979, by means of short-term arrests in the preceding weeks and many arrests on the day. However, more than 10,000 people took to the streets. Many of those arrested were severely ill-treated and some tortured, by methods including electric shock. Most were released after a few days, although 57 were detained for several weeks. Twelve who had been arrested in or near the San Francisco church in Santiago were accused of agresion contra carabineros, aggression against police officers, and after torture and interrogation were sent to the Carcel Publica, Public Prison. After internal and international pressure, including a hunger-strike by relatives in Santiago, they were released on bail and finally acquitted. </PARA>
<PARA> On 28 May 1979 Jose Nazario Reyes Valenzuela was arrested, put into the boot of a taxi and taken to a secret place where he was held in a windowless room only 1.6 metres square. There he was stripped, suspended and constantly given electric shocks. He was interrogated about his alleged connection with the Vicaria de la Solidaridad, a human rights organization of the Chilean Roman Catholic Church. He was released without charge on 4 June. </PARA>
<PARA> Another victim (whose name is withheld by Amnesty International) was arrested in April 1979. He testifies:</PARA>
<PARA>''During my interrogation they applied electricity to me through the parrilla, metal bed frame. They applied electricity to my tongue, ears, genitals, hands, head and feet . . . later . . . they took me to another room where once again they stripped me completely and sat me down in a chair the arms of which were made of metal. This time they applied electricity to my hands and pounded me on the face.''</PARA>
<PARA>He stated that a doctor was present to observe his reactions and to assess his level of physical resistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Amnesty International has received dozens of detailed testimonies of torture during the past year. In January 1980 a submission was made on this subject to the Rapporteur on the state of human rights in Chile of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Despite the fact that many recursos de amparo, a procedure similar to habeas corpus, containing allegations of torture are filed with the Court of Appeal in Santiago and other Chilean cities, no action has yet been taken by the government to remedy this serious violation of the right of Chilean people to be protected against cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment by law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> This inaction on the part of the government and the courts resulted in the death of a teacher, Federico Alvarez Santibanez, who was detained and tortured by the CNI. Federico Alvarez died while the granting of a recurso de amparo was delayed in the courts. He was detained on 15 August 1979 by a police officer while distributing pamphlets. After being treated for lesions of a minor nature he was taken by members of the CNI to one of their units and held until 20 August. He was then placed at the disposition of the Primera Fiscalia Militar de Santiago, Santiago First Military Court. After interrogation the court ordered him to be detained incommunicado in the Santiago Penitentiary's infirmary because of his condition. When that deteriorated, the duty doctor ordered him to be taken to the central emergency hospital, where he died at 6.50 am on 21 August. The post-mortem examination found the cause of death to be a complex fracture of the skull and that complications included aspiration of blood, final incipient bilateral bronchopneumonia and final aspiration of vomit. The fracture of the skull was produced by a direct blow and there was no evidence of self-wounding. Ministro en Visita, Special Investigating Judge, Alberto Chaigneau, submitted a report which concluded that ''at this stage of the process, it can be presumed that the investigated facts constitute a crime of homicide in which it is necessary to accuse as co-authors the functionary of the carabineros, uniformed police, who carried out the arrest and the functionaries of the CNI who submitted him to interrogations, and, as an accessory after the fact, the doctor who provided a certificate stating that Alvarez Santibanez was in a good state of health when he left the said CNI institution''. </PARA>
<PARA> Although it is not the policy of Amnesty International to request specific forms of punishment, it believes that individual responsibility for serious violations of human rights should be established under the law of the country. The medical groups of Amnesty International were also particularly concerned that a physician failed to follow the code of professional ethics in making a false statement on the health of Alvarez Santibanez and asked its medical groups to express their concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The unlawful activities of the CNI are also responsible for several unexplained deaths of political opponents of the government. Police allege that Alberto Salazar Briceno and Iris Yolanda Vega were killed when a bomb they were carrying exploded accidentally. Reports suggest, however, that the couple had been arrested two days before and were in police custody at the time when they were killed. </PARA>
<PARA> Further confirmation of the methods used by the CNI to eliminate potential opponents was provided by the death of Daniel Acuna who, according to the police, committed suicide by exploding a bomb while they were attempting to arrest him. The official explanation of the death of this venerable socialist leader was sufficiently incredible, and the material evidence so overwhelmingly against it, that a Special Investigating Judge was appointed. Because there was the evidence of unlawful killing by the military the judge soon declared herself incompetent. A military judge is now dealing with the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Short-term detentions and harassment of political leaders and trade unionists were common during the year. At the end of November 1979, 46 members of the banned Christian Democrat Party were detained, a seminar on the rights of youth was forbidden and invited foreign delegates were expelled or prevented from entering the country. In November 1979 alone Amnesty International estimates that more than 600 people were detained, mostly from shanty towns in Santiago, while police were allegedly looking for members of the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria (MIR), the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, banned since 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> In April 1980, 12 peasant leaders were detained on the grounds that they were planning agitation for 1 May. Juan Jara, the leader of the taxi-drivers' union, was also detained and held for several days for criticizing the government's economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> On 16 April 1980 it was announced that the Supreme Court had upheld the acquittal of eight carabineros who murdered 14 peasants shortly after the 1973 coup-bodies had been discovered at the end of 1978 in a mine in Lonquen. The court ratified the ruling of a military tribunal which in 1979 declared that the eight carabineros were protected by the Amnesty Law of April 1978-a law benefiting those who committed crimes between September 1973 and March 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1973 the government has disregarded the interests and feelings of the relatives of disappeared prisoners. In September 1979 the Military Court announced that the bodies found in Lonquen would be returned to their families. The relatives then received the news that their dead had been buried secretly. The Cardinal of Santiago immediately issued a condemnation stating ''human dignity has been violated in the most extreme manner''. </PARA>
<PARA> In October 1979, 18 bodies were found in a secret grave in the cemetery at Yumbel near Concepci'on. It has now been established that they were workers from a paper factory, teachers and railway workers from Laja and San Rosendo, who had been detained by the police in September 1973 or had gone voluntarily to the police station accompanied by priests. The explanation of the government that ''disappearances'' were the result of civil war was again offered, but all the evidence shows that the victims were ''unarmed, handcuffed and adequately guarded''. They were taken from the police station to be transferred, it was stated, to the Los Angeles Regiment's political prisoners' camp. They never arrived there, but were killed and secretly buried, remaining ''disappeared'' until the discovery and identification of their bodies at the end of 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> Other secret graves have been discovered in Mulch'en in the Eighth Region of Chile and other places; unmarked graves in site 29 of Santiago Cemetery are believed to contain more than 300 bodies, many of which may be those of ''disappeared'' prisoners. </PARA>
<PARA> During the year threats were made on several occasions against members of the Agrupacion de Familiares de Presos Desaparecidos, Association of Relatives of Disappeared Prisoners, by a group calling itself the Comando Carevic, named after a police officer who died while allegedly dismantling a bomb left in Santiago by ''terrorists''. This appears to be a right-wing group, and has so far done no more than make threats. Other reports of harassment of relatives of ''disappeared'' prisoners are common. In August 1979 Amnesty International appealed for the protection of the safety of the wife of a ''disappeared'' prisoner, Pedro Silva Bustos, after she had received a death threat signed by Comando Carevic. Amnesty International requested the Chilean Government to take steps to end the illegal activities of the Comando Carevic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today is one that I have long held and often expressed. It relates to the appalling road conditions that apply generally in Queensland in comparison with those in other States and, more particularly, it relates to the roads of north Queensland. There are many expressions that adequately indicate the position. For instance, some say that the further north one travels the better the fishing but the worse the roads. When one travels from Perth to Townsville one puts one's watch forward by two hours, but when one arrives on Queensland roads one sets one's clock back 10 years. I think that is a fair reflection of the problem that I am trying to explain. I am convinced that southern politicians, and Ministers in particular, have no real concern for the situation whatsoever. They have no regard for equality between the States, their road systems or the people as the Constitution was intended to guarantee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the national highway system is a Federal responsibility, I target my remarks particularly on that subject. I do so in the knowledge that national highways became a Federal responsibility in 1974. At that time Queensland's road construction was substandard, having taken a back seat in that State's priorities to other services such as free hospitalisation. Road funding has never held a high priority in the expenditure of that State or this Commonwealth's Government. For instance, the Commonwealth's rate of expenditure on welfare, defence, payment to local governments and many other services has been increasing in real terms over recent years. Roads expenditure is one of the few expenditures by the Commonwealth that has actually decreased in real terms, particularly if the yearly increase in the road construction costs index is applied. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the Commonwealth, by way of indirect taxes through the oil levy, has considerably increased its revenue to the extent that in 1980-81 the combined income from levies and excise from fuel based products amounted to $3,944m or 11.22 per cent of revenue. While I know the argument that this is an allocation to Consolidated Revenue, in view of the diminishing real terms expenditure on roads, there must be a reassessment of priorities so that a larger portion of this road tax can go back to road construction, to the people who pay those taxes. There must be a realisation by Commonwealth Government Ministers that expenditure on roads is just as vital-for expanding and developing our industries, for decentralisation, defence, trade and tourism-as is expenditure on welfare and other Government commitments. In fact only by encouraging trade, industries, tourism and decentralisation will sufficient funds be generated in the future to feed the ever-increasing welfare burden that this Commonwealth has experienced. I wish that I also had time to raise a grievance on the problem of increasing age pensions and a national pension scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I have requested figures from the Department of Transport to emphasise Queensland's particular problem. I know that other States may have similar problems, but today I intend to emphasise my own State's case. On the basis of the lesser standards adopted and agreed to in 1980 between the Commonwealth and Queensland, it would require, on 1980 prices, $1,094m to upgrade Queensland's national highway system to its proper standard. On the basis of the 1980 Commonwealth national highway grant to Queensland, this would take 30 years to complete; that is, it would be completed by the year 2010. On that rate of expenditure the position is impossible because a new road has a normal life expectancy of only 15 to 20 years. So we are quickly going out the back door into the billy goat cart tracks situation. Honourable members should bear in mind that this expenditure is of a level inferior to that of Victoria and New South Wales where Rolls Royce conditions are enjoyed, compared with Model T Ford conditions in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an injustice in the split up of the national roads funds allocation. For instance the length of national highways in 1977 in three States was as follows: Victoria had 690 kilometres, New South Wales 1,335 kilometres and Queensland 3,922 kilometres. In 1981-82 the national road allocation was divided as follows: Victoria $53m, New South Wales $104m and Queensland $60m. Aggregating the road lengths and the funds for the three States that I have mentioned, Victoria, with 12 per cent of the highway system, gets 24 per cent of the cake; New South Wales, with 22 per cent of the national system, gets 48 per cent; and Queensland, with 66 per cent of the national highway system, gets a meagre 28 per cent of the funds. There is no justice in the allocation or the formula from which it had its base. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the original formula in 1974 was based on population, registrations and other factors. It was dropped at a later date. The yearly allocations to each State since then have been distributed simply by escalating from the defunct base. So the system is still inequitable. Any population factor in this defunct formula does not take into account the tremendous transfer in population to Queensland over more recent years and the consequent loss of that population to southern States. But a formula should be on the basis of needs, not only population. Under the present appropriations Victoria getting double the funds in comparison with its road length, can afford four-lane highways, while Queensland, which gets only 42 per cent of its entitlement, has to suffer a national highway system that has gravel surfaces in some places, very narrow bitumen, broken edges to that bitumen and one-lane bridges. The southern States would never tolerate this situation, nor would their politicians. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that last weekend 10 people died on Queensland's roads. One can only speculate on the extent to which this Government may have contributed towards those deaths through an inadequate apportionment of available funds. If the cake cannot be equitably divided it is imperative that the Commonwealth make an extra injection of funds to increase substantially the present allocation of $303m for 1981-82. There are particular difficulties in a State that is well endowed with many days of summer heat and a very high rainfall. Also, Queensland is decentralised to a greater extent than any other State in the Commonwealth. The climate and the spread of population mean extra costs in road construction. Those who hold the purse strings should go out and see for themselves the actual condition of the highways. As I mentioned earlier, the road deaths and the often forgotten statistics of accidents, the cost of hospitalisation and the resulting permanent disability and drain on the pension system, must be evidence enough of the need for urgent and immediate action. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also necessary for the State Ministers responsible for roads, who meet as the Australian Transport Advisory Council, to look carefully at the formula and come to a useful decision. I recommend to the Queensland Minister for Local Government, Main Roads and Police that that Council should prepare a case for consideration. He should use his considerable debating skills, as the most senior Minister on that Council, to persuade his State colleagues that Queensland is not getting a fair share. His energies would be better directed to this cause than to continual criticism of the Federal Government, through the Press, without any really substantial argument. I do not overlook certain initiatives taken by this Government in recent times, such as adopting the tender procedure for works to enable private contractors to compete. I feel this will allow more and better constructions to be built at the same price. </PARA>
<PARA> If I were asked to nominate the matter which generates the most argument and which is the most politically sensitive at this time to most northerners, it would be roads in all their forms. There are other matters that are of concern to the State for which I can offer advice. However, the responsibility for such problems does not rest wholly in the Federal area. One is licensing and regulating the weight of transport vehicles that use the roads. Too often they are the last on the roads in floods and the first back on them when the floods recede. No roads are constructed to withstand this abuse. In a State where the railway offers active competition, I wonder whether these heavy transport vehicles pay their fair share towards road maintenance for the damage they cause. These trucks take over the roads such as they are, in Queensland, a developing State. I believe that a greater contribution should be made by the user of the roads, thus lessening the expense met by the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> Speed limits should be set at levels determined by the condition of the roads. A 90 kilometres an hour speed limit, as recently suggested, might be the level that the roads will bear. Fringe benefits would be better road manners, less fuel consumption and fewer accidents and deaths. That this occurs was shown recently in an American survey which followed a similar reduction in speed limit. Overall action needs to be taken on both State and Federal fronts to eliminate the appalling position of our northern roads, which are substandard and really a national eyesore. I issue an invitation to any Federal Minister, as I have to our Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), to come north and to see and experience the situation for themselves. I am sure that if they see the potential of north Queensland and experience the crippling handicap of its transport system it will assist them in their deliberations on road funding and result in a fairer allocation of road funds to Queensland.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Opposition it is my duty to criticise the Government. Normally I enjoy that task but today I do it with considerable reluctance because the issue I propose to raise is one that I had hoped would be free of party politics. I refer to the present crisis that has occurred because of the failure of the Federal Government to make vital decisions that need to be made immediately if the bicentennial celebrations in 1988 are not to be a total fiasco. For the better part of this year I have hesitated to say anything because it has been my wish that there be no friction that will harm the very smooth and harmonious relations and operations of the Australian Bicentennial Authority, its board and its staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The House will recall that the Authority was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in April 1979. It had the total support of all the leaders of government in this Parliament, the State parliaments and the Northern Territory. I am sure I speak for everyone on the Board when I say that when we first met in April 1980 there was an air of expectancy and excitement that we were embarking on a great adventure and that we were all honoured and privileged to participate in the planning of the Bicentenary for 1988. We saw 1988 not only as a magnificent opportunity to celebrate 200 years of European civilisation in Australia, but also as an opportunity to assess those 200 years, acclaim our successes, note the failures, and set ourselves and future generations new goals, objectives and perspectives for the next 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) acknowledged the need to plan well ahead by initiating the Authority in April 1979. Although the Bicentenary was nearly nine years away, there was an enormous amount to be done and an early start was essential if it was to be a success. Initially the Authority concentrated on setting up the structure and staff to handle adequately the challenging program ahead and working out the general directions they felt the celebrations should take. State committees were appointed, offices acquired, the theme 'Living Together' was adopted, and a bicentenary symbol was designed. At the same time, a great deal of thought was given by the staff and the Board to the format of the Bicentenary so that it could achieve its objectives. It was felt that the celebrations should take place at a number of levels so that there was total involvement of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> At the national level it was felt that there should be a major activity or activities that would attract the attention of the whole nation and bring visitors to our shores from many other countries. Two projects were suggested early on that seemed appropriate for such a celebration. These were a world expo in either Sydney or Melbourne, and, of course, the 1988 Olympics. The former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, had approached the Bureau of International Expositions which has the control of world expositions, for 1988 to be set aside for an Australian expo. It is history now that after a detailed feasibility study costing some hundreds of thousands of dollars, Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra decided not to proceed. Largely because of some irresponsible Press reporting that used 1988 costs to give an inflated price and ignored the benefit of the residuals that would still be there after the Bicentenary, the Federal and State governments got cold feet and decided not to proceed with either of the projects. That, however, is history. A similar fate befell Melbourne's attempt to gain support from the Commonwealth for its application for the 1988 Olympics. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority then decided that if a major world exposition could not be undertaken, Australia should consider a modified expo. With this in mind an approach was made to the Queensland Government, who immediately accepted the offer on the understanding that funds would be provided for a feasibility study, as it was for Sydney and Melbourne, and that the Commonwealth would agree to share the costs, estimated at approximately $200m in today's prices. Incidentally, the $200m is a total price, but as in the case of Sydney and Melbourne one must take into account the residuals that are there after the expo is over. For months now both the Authority and the Queensland Government have been attempting to get a decision from the Australian Government, without success. The situation has reached a critical stage where, unless a decision is made to proceed in the next few weeks, there will be no hope of the modified expo being granted to Brisbane for 1988. The BIE has the final say in who holds world expositions. The many countries who would normally participate in a world expo will not do so unless the expo is officially endorsed by the BIE. </PARA>
<PARA> The year 1988 is reserved for Australia, and members of the Authority have been overseas twice to present their case. We have been told we have it, provided we make our final presentation on 9 December this year. That is a few weeks away, and so far absolutely no indication has been given by the Australian Government of its attitude towards the Brisbane proposal. If Australia does not present its case on 9 December, President Mitterrand of France is ready to step into the spot vacated by Australia to celebrate, I image, both the end of his seven-year term but, more importantly, the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. France will almost certainly get the World Expo for 1988 or 1989, and Australia and Brisbane will miss out. They do not have an expo every year. This will probably be the last opportunity Australia has to have an event of world-wide significance, and the responsibility will be directly with the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one particular event. But more critical even than that is the failure of the Australian Government to give any indication of its commitment to the Bicentenary at all levels. The Authority has sketched out a program that can basically be divided into three categories. The first category, which I have just described, would be called the 'Centrepiece'. The second category, which consists mainly of activities such as festivals, reunions, parties, re-enactments, contests, sporting events, cultural performances, exhibitions and general entertainment, has been titled 'Celebrate Australia'. This is a type of activity that in the main does not require a great deal of forward planning. One, two or three years are probably more than enough for 99 per cent of these functions, with the vast majority requiring little government funding. The few suggestions that will be of a national or international character, such as the tall ships proposal, an international air race, a South Pacific festival of arts and an international military tattoo, will need some funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The third category, however, is to be called the 'Bicentennial Legacies Program'. The object of this category is that a range of capital projects be undertaken at national, State and local level which will leave a legacy on the ground for future generations of Australians. For example, at the local level it is expected that local government will undertake such projects as bicentennial libraries, historic restorations, cultural centres, sporting complexes, swimming pools and a range of other amenities. It is hoped that the State and Federal governments will similarly undertake fewer but more significant projects to leave something memorable for future generations at that level. Some ideas for the States include bicentennial parks and, for the Federal Government, national tree planting projects, science and technology exhibitions, historical publications, film and television productions, and maritime and aircraft museums. </PARA>
<PARA> Ideas like these are spilling into the Bicentennial Authority by the hundred from communities all over Australia. Committees have been set up over the past 18 months to work on such projects. But the interest of people is waning considerably because they are not being given any idea of the commitment of the Federal Government. It is envisaged that these local works of a capital nature will be funded approximately one-third local, one-third State and one-third Commonwealth. In a budget presented to the Commonwealth it was envisaged that the Commonwealth would contribute $5 per head for a total of $80m for this category over a six-year to seven-year period. Scaled-down budgets have also been suggested and presented to the Government which, in my view, would make the Bicentenary a joke. The total amount requested from the Government for all categories on the program was $420m over seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has had these proposals before it for months and it will not give the Authority the slightest indication of what seeding it proposes. The frustration of the Board and the staff is reaching a point where people are asking themselves whether they are really being taken seriously. They are asking themselves what is the point of meeting regularly, planning various projects and putting them to the Government to be rejected or ignored. If the Government does not wish to spend any money on the Bicentenary then it should say so. It should not waste the time of very busy, dedicated citizens who have more to do with their time than travel around Australia at taxpayers' expense directing an excellent staff at a very considerable cost to plan activities and projects that will never eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Board has reached the point where it does not wish to waste its time on the Government's money. I assure honourable members that it has not put me up to this. I am reflecting its views and what has been said at its meetings. Board members are just so boiling mad. If all the Government wants is fireworks and marching girls displays then it would be better to disband the Authority for the next five years, put it into mothballs and re-form it in 1985 or 1986 when it could plan a froth and bubble Bicentenary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today is for two categories of people who have specific kinds of disabilities or handicaps-people who with some very specific and practical help from government could enjoy a greatly enhanced lifestyle. Firstly, I refer to the deaf. Technology has provided deaf people with an opportunity to communicate with each other and with essential services via what is known as a portaprinter-a printout telephone for the deaf which can be run on batteries, is portable and can be carried by deaf people as they move about and linked into a nearby telephone booth to allow them to commuicate with their home, with other people or with essential services. This machine provides a massive breakthrough in the communications barrier for the deaf. Not only can the deaf then talk to each other through written words when they are physically apart, as we do on the telephone, but also it enables them to link up with essential services such as doctors, hospitals, fire brigade boards, government departments, ambulances and so forth, so long as these services have this portaprinter equipment attached to their telephones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a problem; that is, that these machines, together with necessary attachments, cost about $900 each. For that reason, and given that the profoundly deaf, because of their handicap, do not generally receive a high wage or salary, very few of these people are able to afford to purchase this equipment. Very few Government departments or agencies providing essential community services have installed these machines. The number of profoundly deaf people in Australia is not large; therefore assistance in making this equipment available would not be very costly. It is therefore most unfortunate that this great benefit, involving small cost, is not being conferred on this needy section of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of options are open to the Government. It could subsidise the purchase of this equipment through the Department of Social Security. If this is not possible, Telecom Australia could purchase these portaprinters and then lease them to the deaf at a very small rental. Whatever the method of making this equipment more readily available, something should be done. The Government already makes concessions in other ways for those who live in the country in recognition of their isolation. I simply make the point that deaf people are absolutely isolated also. Furthermore, to some extent country people choose their isolation, whereas deaf people do not. I therefore urge the Government to assist the deaf in purchasing this equipment which will do so much to reduce their isolation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point to which I wish to refer today is the need to provide some help for autistic children in Western Australia. It seems to me that autism is a handicap which is not well understood or acknowledged within the general community and which is not supported by government to the extent that it should be. Autism is a very rare behavioural condition which is extremely difficult to diagnose. It is a condition which is not clearly definable. No convincing explanation of its cause has yet been given and there is no definite, tangible medical treatment for its cure. No cure for the disorder can be sought because its origin is not known. It is not genetic. According to the Association for Autistic Children in Western Australia (Inc.) there are as many autistic children in this country as there are children born blind. The Association says that although 45 children between the ages of four and 19 years of age in Western Australia are known to have severe autistic symptoms, there could be many more than that-possibly 100. </PARA>
<PARA> Autism is a tragic problem for the child and his family. The autistic child is not blind but he cannot comprehend what he sees. He is not deaf but he cannot take in what he hears. He is isolated from his environment because he cannot make any sense of it. But he is not physically handicapped. He may be highly intelligent and yet he can divorce himself from bewildered family and live in a world of his own and, as in cases that I know of, he may not respond to his parents in any way at all for many years. This is a neglected area of welfare policy-I suspect not deliberately so, but more because of the lack of knowledge and awareness of the problem. Obviously, much needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia the Association for Autistic Children comprises a small paid staff of two full time officers and two part time clerical assistants. The Association's overall management is largely conducted by a dedicated band of volunteers and concerned parents. Regrettably, this very active group of people and their Association seem to be penalised at an official level for the degree of self-help they have exhibited in the past. They run an annual budget of approximately $250,000, almost all of which is financed by their own fund raising activities. There has been no direct Government assistance to this Association in the past, although in other States equivalent associations which do not exercise the same degree of self-help as the Western Australian Association have received official Commonwealth Government assistance. Admittedly, the Association has received some assistance from the Lotteries Commission in Western Australia, and the Mental Health Division of the State Government runs the Mildred Creek Centre which caters for the intensive care of a small number of very young autistic children. But in what is primarily a Commonwealth Government area of responsibility there has been no Commonwealth Government assistance at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Association's community integration program, which will cost some $111,000 this year and between $150,000 and $160,000 next year, is proceeding without any kind of salary subsidy for its professional and administrative staff, while its counterparts in other States are receiving some kind of assistance. This initiative provides a most important educational program for autistic children in a totally integrated setting and will help these children to move into established Education Department pre-primary and primary schools. Again, no funds have been made available for the Association's community integration program from the Government's childrens services program. The Association has provided family relief and support services without government assistance of either a capital or a salary subsidy nature. It has had plans to develop a resource centre to help co-ordinate and act as a base for many of its activities. A submission for assistance was lodged with the Department of Social Security. As yet no approval for funding has been received. </PARA>
<PARA> The Association has plans to construct a residential pre-training centre in the metropolitan area of Perth for autistic adolescents to prepare them adequately for their futures. This will involve an expenditure of some $300,000 in 1982. There is also a proposal to develop an existing country property into a semi-residential complex for adult autistics at a cost of $250,000 in 1983 and $350,000 in 1984. Submissions for official government assistance with respect to these latter programs will be forthcoming in the near future. The Association continues to be confronted with rising costs in its existing programs. These new developments, involving very substantial amounts of capital, will certainly require some form of Commonwealth Government assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply say to the Government that under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act this Government and previous governments have provided a great deal of much needed assistance to many of the more widely recognised categories of handicapped people. I say to this Parliament and to this Government-I ask the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), who is at the table, to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) -that it really is time that we gave more attention and more assistance to this very tragic area of need-autistic children and adolescents. I will certainly be using my best endeavours in the future to ensure that this happens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not grieving at all. I wish to continue my grievance for those many thousands of Australians who may find themselves confronted with a natural disaster. It is once again that period of the year when natural disasters such as cyclones, floods, storms, tornadoes, et cetera will inevitably hit some part of northern, north-eastern and north-western Australia-probably all over Australia. If we talk to people in those high risk areas, if we talk to insurers, insurance brokers and loss assessors who are experienced people who have seen and been through natural disasters in the past-be it Cyclone Tracy, the 1974 Brisbane flood, the Brighton hailstorm disaster or the Dalby flood, just to mention a few recent catastrophes-the message comes across loud and clear; that is we have learned nothing from these unfortunate experiences when it comes to budgeting for disaster relief. The Federal Government's expectation for voluntary participation by the public in disaster insurance has proved ill-founded. It has been unable to convince the public that they must have adequate insurance to protect themselves against natural disaster, and yet nature is a fickle mistress. The 1981-82 cyclone season could conceivably bring about a recurrence of the distress and disillusionment which in the past affected the vulnerable and unfortunate people who were victims of cyclones Tracy and Althea. It is even possible that we could look back on these events as minor tragedies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter of natural disaster insurance has been raised many times in this House. The attention of the Government has been drawn repeatedly to ways and means in which it could, if it were interested, give singular security and peace of mind to the Australian community. Sure, the Government has stepped in with money and support in the past on an ad hoc basis, but it has not guaranteed a secure future either for those Australians who, because of their location, cannot buy insurance or for those who cannot afford to pay for such protection. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is on record as stating that in 1980-81 the Federal Government would provide more than $71m to help the States and the Northern Territory meet the large and unpredictable cost of natural disaster relief. This, I would point out, was a year of relatively minor disasters. In fact the actual expenditure via payments to the States was not $71m but closer to $81m, while an additional $5m was expended via the defence budget on natural disasters and civil defence. Given that the States also contribute, the all-up payout must have been well in excess of $100m. Again I stress that it was a year relatively free of natural disasters. These amounts, of course, are over and above what the insurance industry would have paid to those people with insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am concerned about is the welfare of the people and how they are severely affected, both financially and mentally, by major disasters. There is only one way to provide the community at large with disaster relief at a price the Federal Budget and the taxpayer can afford. This way is through a national disaster insurance scheme. What I am also concerned about in a land which is highly vulnerable to the effects of natural disaster-after all, it is not improbable that four, five or more could occur in any one year-is the Government's failure to establish any semblance of budgetary control over natural disaster relief. Is there a bottomless pit to dip into, as the Prime Minister seemed to imply in his answer to question on notice No. 666? I ask this because he seemed to imply that the definition of a 'major' disaster was when the States exceeded their budgets for such a purpose. What he said in the answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth contributes on a $3 for $1 basis to the cost of State expenditure on approved relief and restoration measures in excess of the States' base amount where such expenditures are in respect of a major disaster. </PARA>
<PARA>When we consider the Prime Minister's statement in conjunction with the fact that it is up to the States to declare a disaster area, it is clear that we are faced with a completely open-ended budgetary situation. Given the recent rantings and ravings of the razor gang regarding imagined budgetary excesses, one would have expected the Government to make some serious economic assessment of disaster relief expenditure which, after all, is clearly a blank cheque situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Back in 1976 the late Eric Robinson made suggestions about a national disaster insurance scheme. This apparently has been shelved, as so many other important matters are shelved by this Government. Honourable members may recall that the Government at that time appointed two specialist committees-a technical committee and a mitigation committee. The proposal was that a pool of general insurers should offer natural disaster insurance against selected natural hazards, with the Commonwealth offering reinsurance facilities. The Government and the insurance industry would actively encourage maximum participation on a voluntary basis. The scheme had its flaws, but at least it was the beginning of a dialogue between the insurance industry and the Government. Unfortunately the dialogue ended abruptly when in January 1979 the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced that the Government would not proceed with the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> During a visit to Australia this year a world authority on insurance and reinsurance matters was at a complete loss to understand why Australia had not looked seriously at setting up a national disaster insurance fund, one backed by the world insurance and reinsurance markets, especially when countries such as Britain, Switzerland and New Zealand all have such schemes. The visiting British insurance broker explained that overseas schemes are cheaply and effectively administered and relieve government treasuries of huge outlays; to be more precise, they save taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine the reasons why in 1979 the Treasurer announced the abandonment of the national disaster insurance scheme which was so close to being operative. It is instructive to do so now, particularly in the wake of the budgetary vandalism wrought by the razor gang in the name of smaller government. When all is said and done, the abandonment of the national disaster insurance scheme in 1979 adds up to the same opting-out of government responsibility which has characterised every new initiative since then. In 1979 the Treasurer spoke of a reluctance to intervene in the insurance industry and in existing natural disaster insurance arrangements when in fact the proposed scheme made clear that existing underwriting responsibilities could be continued by the insurance industry. The Treasurer also spoke of a reluctance to enforce compulsory participation in the scheme when the insurance industry's feasibility study showed that it was merely necessary to extend existing fire risk policies or to impose a levy on property rates. </PARA>
<PARA> In New Zealand the Earthquake and War Damages Commission imposes a levy on all property insured against fire to cover earthquake and war damage. Premiums are at the rate of 7c per $100 of insurance cover. The so-called problem relating to compulsion on either insured or insurers is in fact a non-problem. The cost spread over the community would be minimal and a pool of money would be available to relieve suffering and distress in individual circumstances. For just a few cents per household we would have the basis of the pool to permit insurers directly to underwrite risks up to a certain level or to pick up the excess over and above the Government's inflexible budgetary commitment. The matter needs to be looked at quickly and certainly some economic assessment needs to be carried out. With the expertise that already exists in Australia this should not be too time-consuming. Certainly it should not be too difficult to define what disasters are to be protected against, what limits of liability the Government will accept and what limits insurers will bear. With national disaster insurance and reinsurance on the world-wide market all would know they were protected and, the way I see it, the Government would have established budgetary control over disaster relief expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the opportunity in this Grievance Day debate of raising a matter which is of concern to a number of people in my electorate; that is, the future of the Ringwood project under the Community Youth Support Scheme. That project is known as SLEOS, which stands for School Leavers Employment Opportunity Service. The Ringwood CYSS project is actually a long-standing project. In fact it dates from the earliest days of the Community Youth Support Scheme. Indeed, before the program was instituted a group of people in the Ringwood area had evolved a concept for a support and advisory service to the young unemployed and was seeking avenues of funding for that project. When the Community Youth Support Scheme was announced by the Government I called representatives of that group into my office to explain to them the nature of CYSS and the way in which they could qualify for funding under that program provided certain changes were made to the structure of the project that they had in mind so that it would meet CYSS guidelines. I indicate that just to point out that this is a long-standing project which has been successful in gaining approval for funding each year since its inception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The immediate problem which arises is that in July this year the premises that the group was occupying burned down. Those premises were an old house in an area that is designated to become a shopping centre car park. The group was able to obtain those premises at a very nominal rental. The grant it received under the CYSS program reflected the very nominal rental it had to pay. Even before the fire occurred the project was looking for alternative premises because it had come to the conclusion that it needed a different type of operation to get to the people in the Ringwood area who needed its services. In particular, it needed a shop-front type of operation which would, of course, involve the project in paying a higher rental to match the commercial rentals which were required in the Ringwood area. Even before the fire occurred the project officers were thinking along those lines, but the fire made its plans even more urgent. </PARA>
<PARA> The month after the fire came the Budget, with the announcement that the CYSS program was to be terminated. A month after that came the announcement that the Government had changed its mind and would enable existing CYSS projects to continue at their current levels of funding until next February, when new guidelines would be implemented for a new and improved Community Youth Support Scheme. The problem the project faces at present is that it is operating out of temporary premises which have been made available to it by the Ringwood Uniting Church. The premises are used by a great many other organisations because the church is particularly active. The facilities of the church hall and meeting rooms are used by a wide range of community groups. That use restricts the sorts of activities in which the Ringwood CYSS project can indulge and certainly restricts it in advertising its activities to unemployed youth in the area and in seeking to bring them into its programs in a vigorous way. At present the project is operating only in a part time sense. It is certainly not operating at full steam in the way that it would be able to operate if it had its own premises. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the Budget the group had reached an agreement with representatives of the State CYSS Committee that it would be able to obtain in a revised grant an extra amount for the rental it would have to pay in new premises. The agreement indicated an upper level of about $150 per week compared with the $30 a week-I think that was the amount-for its previous premises. It has now located suitable premises, not in the immediate area of the main Ringwood shopping centre but in a subsidiary shopping centre nearby in which the rentals are a little lower. In the main Ringwood area, rentals are about $200 to $300 per week for an ordinary shop front site. In the area chosen by the project the rentals are up to $150 a week. The problem is that the decision announced by the Government limits CYSS groups to their current levels of funding until February, and the present grant does not include an amount which can cope with the extra rental. </PARA>
<PARA> I want simply to appeal to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown), whom I have advised about this subject, that he consider the Ringwood project as a special case to receive a revised grant even at this stage, before the new guidelines come into operation in February, because of its special circumstances. It is not a circumstance which applies to every CYSS project. I emphasise once again that this matter was the subject of discussions between office bearers of the project and representatives of the State CYSS Committee before the Budget and before any decisions were made which affected the whole CYSS program. Certain undertakings were given and certain understandings were reached. On the basis of the understandings which were reached before the Budget, I believe there is a good case for this project to receive some special consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The fear the group has-I must say that to some extent I share its fear-is that if by February, when the new guidelines are implemented, its program is not operating full steam ahead, it will be regarded as being of less importance than other CYSS projects which are operating at 100 per cent capacity. Therefore, under the new guidelines there is a possibility that it will miss out. I do not put that forward as a serious probability, but there is a fear that, in the event of scarce funds being allocated according to priorities, the Ringwood project would slip down the priority list a little and would not receive the consideration it should receive, or would receive if it was operating in its new premises, as has been planned for some time, and was able to carry on the program it has been carrying on successfully for some years. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that the Minister has problems in granting any exceptions because he may face difficulties with a number of the CYSS projects, whose officers can argue that they need extra funds and can use them productively. I believe that in this case there is a circumstance which does not apply to other CYSS projects. This circumstance arises out of discussions which were well in hand before the Budget and before the Government's announcements about the way in which it was going to revise the CYSS project. I ask for the consideration of the Minister and the Government in dealing with this problem and assisting a very good group which is doing very good work in my area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to talk about a matter which affects very seriously some of my constituents and which would apply generally in regard to the difficulties in the housing area at the moment. During previous sessions of the Parliament I raised a number of questions about the operation of certain permanent building societies and expressed concern at the number of homes being repossessed by these societies. The monetary policies of the Government have ensured that even more Australian families will find themselves on the street. The interest rate increases encouraged by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) have placed an unbearable burden on many families, who will find their monthly house repayments simply beyond their means. Penalty rates are applied once an account falls behind, and many societies charge 60 per cent a year-an astronomical amount. Often they do not even inform the borrowers that the penalty applies but simply request payment of the normal monthly commitment. If the penalty is not paid it continues to accumulate penalty rates at the rate of 60 per cent per annum without the borrower's knowledge. The borrower will receive an account for a substantial amount. If he or she cannot meet the commitment, the repossession procedures commence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a recent case a borrower sued the Statewide Building Society over the legality of penalty rates. He based his case on an English precedent, the matter of Parker and Butcher v. the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Benefit and Building Investment Society. In that matter the judge, His Honour Lord Romilly, ruled that any contract not making its conditions fully clear to both parties was not legally binding. In the recent Statewide case in Victoria, the borrower argued, on the basis of the Lord Romilly judgment, that because the penalty rate was silent in the contract it could not be imposed. The case was to go before the Master of the Supreme Court, but at the door of the court the Society withdrew and agreed to waive the penalty as an act of good faith. If it really believes that penalty rates are legal, the waiving of a sum of more than $3,000 seems to be an expensive act of good faith. I think it can be argued that the Society withdrew because it recognised that it would lose and the question of penalty rates would be thrown into the melting pot. Indeed, if penalty rates were proven illegal, every borrower who has been charged penalty rates over the years under a contract which does not spell out the penalty rate would be liable to have that money returned. In a later statement of the client's commitment to Statewide, which was demanded by the client's legal adviser, the solicitor found a legal expenses claim for more than $700 which had been charged by Statewide for the fees of its solicitor, Allan Moore, for the very case to which I have referred. The Society claimed later that this was a mistake. Some sort of mistake! Dealings with building societies seem to be riddled with mistakes. I argue that there has to be a point where mistakes become the policy of that society. In one case involving Statewide, Allan Moore and Co., the same firm of solicitors, wrote to the borrower's solicitor-mind this-pointing out that the solicitor had a Statewide agency in his office. The company suggested that, therefore, he should not be involved in action against the Society. The solicitor retained the case. Three weeks later his agency-a lucrative asset to his business-was withdrawn by the Society. Embarrassed at users asking why he had lost it, the solicitor asked Statewide to put in writing a reason for the withdrawal. The Society refused. To this point, as I understand it, he has had no explanation. Perhaps the most damning comment made by an Allan Moore and Co. representative in front of a solicitor and his client was that if the borrower won that particular litigation then Statewide had friends in higher places who would have retrospective legislation introduced to cover the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Another serious problem occurs with building societies after repossession and eviction. As I have pointed out previously, a number of houses in these circumstances are sold below their value. The figures are 91 per cent in Victoria, 92 per cent in Western Australia, 87 per cent in South Australia, 71 per cent in Queensland and an incredible 100 per cent in Tasmania. The only State where there appears to be some reason is New South Wales, where the rate is 32 per cent. Nearly all these houses are sold privately. One can suspect two reasons for this. The first-the kindest-is that there are so many houses being repossessed and families thrown on to the streets because of rising interest rates, unemployment and the anti-worker thrust of the Government's policies that societies are too embarrassed to sell these homes by auction. The second reason is a little more sinister. I do not have time to refer to it but I will do so in some future debate. </PARA>
<PARA> After a house is sold the mortgage insurer still wants his pound of flesh. The government-owned Housing Loans Insurance Corporation is involved in this. The Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) cannot absolve himself from the responsibilities involved with the organisation which, in fact, repossesses houses. I instance a man in Frankston who bought a house for $42,900. Owing to circumstances beyond his control he fell behind in his payments at the end of a year. He owed $1,200 but the society was claiming $2,000 with ubiquitous penalty rates which, I would argue, were illegal. The man could not raise the $2,000 and his house was repossessed. The house later went up for private sale for $36,000. After the sale the society claimed its shortfall from HLIC, and now HLIC is claiming $9,000 from the borrower, who is in desperate financial difficulties and whose family is out on the street. He cannot pay. His future is very bleak. The irony is, of course, that the borrower pays an insurance premium of about one per cent of the loan to guarantee the society against default. The borrower then finds himself or herself in grave financial difficulties after the eviction. I do not have time to deal with the rest of this case in specific detail. </PARA>
<PARA> In general, if the solicitors who are involved in these sorts of dealings are honest then they should ensure that the dealings with HLIC or the building society concerned are straightened out and that people are advised of their obligations so that they can take steps to rectify the situation. The borrower must have some guarantee. The regulations must ensure also a code of ethics. Societies must ensure that borrowers are informed that the chattels in the house belong to them and guarantee that if and when the house is sold a reasonable amount of these chattels is returned to the borrower. At the moment these societies are stealing the possessions of these people by selling them as goods included in the price the house is sold for. The goods are not returned to the people who, in fact, own the property. Borrowers must be guaranteed also that when their house is repossessed resale is by public auction. Every attempt should be made to ensure that the proper price is charged to the borrower and that he has at least some reasonable time to find a way of getting out of his dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA> Since my initial revelations in this session the Minister has written to me as an apologist for the building societies. He has argued that they come under State law and are therefore outside his control. However, I argue that the HLIC is under his control. Through it he could force building societies to sell homes on the open market so that the borrower has every opportunity to have the debt excused. The present practice not only disbenefits borrowers at a time when they are in desperate financial difficulties but is open to widespread corruption. I believe that the latter is taking place. Further, I argue that the Minister, if he is genuinely concerned about families, ought to call all State Ministers together with a view to drafting a national code of ethics and regulations to govern building societies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in his letter had the audacity to suggest that homes were sold below cost because of the condition they were left in by dispossessed borrowers. This is a perfect example of the 'kick'em when they're down' attitude of this Government to the underprivileged and those who fall by the wayside in the dog-eat-dog ethics of the present society. However, I urge the Minister to show compassion for these people and to take steps to close legislative gaps that allow building societies to exploit families and other borrowers so openly. Until he does, thousands of Australians will suffer the consequences. He has the responsibility to do this. HLIC is the body by which these terrible imposts are applied to Australian home buyers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time left in this grievance debate I wish to refer to the proposed future development of Perth Airport. In doing so my concern is that such future development should benefit both airport users and should be in the interests of the nearby residents. As far back as 1972 a joint Commonwealth-State committee was established to investigate the future options for Perth Airport. In 1979 this committee produced its report, which was subsequently approved by both the Federal and State governments. The committee basically recommended that Perth Airport be retained as the sole primary airport on the present site until at least the year 2005 and that this development should be in accordance with a master plan based on a detailed analysis of development options and their effect on the environment and nearby land use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following this joint committee's report the Department of Transport is now reputed to have a nine-year plan which includes, among other things, the upgrading of the existing domestic terminal, a new air traffic services centre and control tower and a new international terminal. The upgrading of the existing domestic passenger terminal is in progress. The proposal for the traffic services centre and control tower is presently under inquiry by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Public Works, which held a hearing in Perth at the start of this month. Next February the Public Works Committee will be inquiring also into the proposed international terminal. With the two new facilities in the rundown to the construction phase I am extremely disturbed that the master plan, which I mentioned earlier, is incomplete and unavailable to the public. I argue that no building should take place until the master plan is complete and agreed upon by all the major parties concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Perth Airport is becoming extremely busy. It is estimated that by 2004 total annual aircraft movements will amount to nearly 200,000. In the light of such a forecast it is obvious that the long term development of Perth Airport must involve the construction of additional runway length. For its part, the Department of Transport has described in a public information leaflet that it has distributed taxiways in the north-west corner of the airport, where it proposes to site the new international terminal, and a 300-metre extension on the southern end of the main runway. These runway extensions at both ends would bring aircraft movements and, of course, associated noise closer to the neighbouring residential areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to what the Department of Transport proposes the two local councils most affected by Perth Airport and future developments, the cities of Belmont and Canning, have both argued in submissions to the Public Works Committee that the construction of a parallel widespaced runway, two kilometres east of the present main runway, should proceed as soon as possible and that the new international terminal should be sited appropriate to that new runway. Air traffic movements to and from such a new runway would then be moved away from the residential areas and, moreover, industrial land. I am presently not in a personal position to conclude that the immediate construction of a parallel widespaced runway is economically justified. But I am certain of one thing and that is that no development, be it the air traffic services centre and control tower or the new and international terminal, should jeopardise the possible future development of a parallel widespaced runway either now, in the medium term or in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I return to the need for an airport master plan. In the absence of such a master plan the dangers of the sort of prejudicial development that I have just outlined are very real. In my mind the solution is clear. Any proposed construction should be delayed until the master plan is completed. Such a master plan, incorporating all possible developments, could then be available to the public and open for discussion before the Public Works Committee hearings into the international terminal, scheduled, as I said earlier, for next February. If we proceed in this way we will ensure an integral and planned development of Perth Airport covering all possibilities: The traffic services centre and control tower; the international terminal; a possible parallel widespaced runway; and all the roads and services that local councils will have to supply to service those buildings. If we do proceed in this way we will ensure that there is no building in the short term which will prohibit what may be necessary and, indeed, desirable in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> In raising this issue this afternoon I follow on the detailed work which has been done by my Opposition colleague the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley). I do not believe the development of Perth Airport is a matter of Liberal Party or Australian Labor Party politics. I say publicly that I want to join with the honourable member for Swan in a bipartisan way in arguing for the need for a master plan. Both the cities of Canning and Belmont have argued most strenuously also for the need for a master plan to precede any development. They have proper concern for the residents living in their own cities. They are concerned also that the airport service the needs of Perth and Western Australia, and quite clearly the conclusion that I have reached and have argued this afternoon is the only one that should be advanced. If we are going to plan something as important and complex as an international airport in such a way that it will last and service the community in the interests of the people who live nearby right through to 2005, surely we have to know what we are going to do. We have to have our plan set out logically so that we can continue over time. It is ludricrous to proceed with constructing a building in the absence of a master plan, especially if we proceed with a building that may jeopardise the construction of a parallel widespaced runway that could well be needed in the medium, if not the longer, term. I repeat that the master plan should be completed and be available to the public for open discussion and debate so that all major parties can agree on what is to happen at Perth Airport. Only then should construction take place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's decision to prevent Telecom Australia from developing and marketing Australia's own information utility is a savage and all too predictable attack on this country's intellectual capacity. The announcement by the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) that the vital area of providing 'on line' information services via telephone and television sets will be left to private enterprise has very serious implications. It condemns Australia to an entirely passive and derivative role in the information revolution which is now sweeping the technologically advanced world. The Myer company will operate Canada's Telidon system while the Packer interests will use the British Prestel system. Australia's role in this information revolution will be merely that of a consumer. We will only take. We will have nothing to give and there will be absolutely no incentive to innovate in this area, not only for ourselves, but also for other nations. This is just one more tragic example of how Australia is missing the bus with new technologies. The latest decision by the Government is no accident but one more in a long series of actions by which the Fraser Government is winding down Australia's intellectual capacity. It will turn us into a sterile and derivative society-the world's quarry and not much else-unless the present disastrous tendency is reversed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decision to let market forces run our information systems will widen the gap between the 'information rich' and the 'information poor'. Instead of democratising information access as is technologically possible, the Government's decision will simply shore up existing power structures. The Government fails to grasp that control over information is central to the survival of democracy. Already more people are employed in information, broadly defined, in Australia than work in agriculture, mining and manufacturing combined. In the 1990s we may ask: 'However did it happen that we lacked the will to establish an information utility of our own? Why did we sell out to foreign interests without even thinking about it?'</PARA>
<PARA> The implications and capacity of an 'on line' information utility are enormous, and comparatively easy and cheap to set up. It involves the combination of three things-computers, telecommunications and television. We need to adopt some new language to describe it adequately, apart from brand names such as Viewdata, Prestel and Telidon. Some Americans use the term 'compunications' which is an ugly word. I prefer and propose the French term 'telematique', or 'telematics' in English. All that the consumer needs is a telephone line, a colour television set, and an adaptor and key pad as a single unit, to link the telephone line to the television and allow the user to key himself in to an appropriate segment of the data base that he wants to use. This means that the user so equipped is then plugged in, from home, to an international data base. By 'keying in' his requirements he can be plugged into an information network which can give him up-to-the-second data, both general and specific to his own needs, on employment, housing, education, entertainment, tourism, publications, government decisions, sporting results, currency fluctuations and weather reports anywhere in the world. A person from Sydney or Melbourne looking for a new job or new house can, simply by keying in his qualifications, experience, income needs, choice of the types of community he wants to live in, the educational facilities available to his children, seek to fulfil his needs in other countries, such as Europe, North America or elsewhere-not just in other Australian States. This immediately makes the concept of a global society, with all its challenges and risks, a reality. </PARA>
<PARA> This capacity confirms that in the decades that lie ahead information will continue to be the greatest single factor in our economy, not just in employment but in value, more than mining, manufacturing and agriculture combined. The sooner we recognise that fact the better because when we do recognise it we will have to assert that the control of information resources is too important to be confined to private ownership. Like education, public health, water supply and defence, an information resource needs a close collaborative effort between all users and all suppliers and in all segments of society. Private enterprise should certainly have some role to play-we can argue about the extent of that-but the pursuit of profit must not be allowed to squeeze out the national interest. In effect what the Minister is saying is: 'So far as the telephone lines are concerned, you can use Telecom's lines-to that extent they constitute the common carrier-but the control of what goes into the system and what comes out will be determined by private, profit seeking interest and that is all'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Shame indeed! We have passed legislation to ensure that the ownership of Australian newspapers cannot be in foreign hands, except in the case of Rupert Murdoch. The Minister is always willing to make an accommodation for Rupert Murdoch. But in this case the Minister said to private enterprise: 'Use whatever data base you like; use any information utility you like. Australia will continue once more to be simply passive users'. That is appalling and it suggests a great cutting back in Australia's intellectual capacity. The future of Telecom was canvassed in the report by McKinsey and Company, Inc. 'Capital and Policy Requirements for the 1980s: Telecom Australia' which was completed in June 1980. It stated that the efficiency of Telecom was affected because of the deliberate policy of holding back Telecom's level of capital investment. Understandably the Government failed to release this report until its hand was forced by the initiative of Senator John Button, the shadow Minister for Communications. This led to a debate in this House on 14 October. The Minister then took two quite absurd lines-each mutually contradictory. The first line was to attack the Opposition for 'bucketing' Telecom, which is the exact reverse of the actual situation in which the Minister is nailing Telecom to the cross and we are trying to prevent that crucifixion. In the second line, and maddest of all, he said that subject to priorities being worked out he was all for extending Telecom's capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then there was the decision last week to squeeze Telecom out of telematics and to hand it over to private enterprise. The Minister is taking more positions than the Karma Sutra. I will quote the Minister's words in case listeners and honourable members find it hard to believe what he said. On page 1978 of Hansard, in response to the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this Opposition wishes to bucket Telecom at almost every opportunity. The consultants did conclude . . . that there was scope for the development of new policies within Telecom to cope with the expected high growth in demand for new services. </PARA>
<PARA>What is the rational conclusion that we must draw from that? Obviously that he is going to give the green light to Telecom to move into the telematics field. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has already moved to the establishment of management practices which will enable it to react more effectively to the demands of major customers for new services. </PARA>
<PARA>Again there is no hint that Telecom is going to have this right cut away from it and that it is going to be handed over to private enterprise. He then goes on to say, in that avuncular manner in the House that we are all so familiar with:</PARA>
<PARA> For the life of me, I cannot see why those cannot be provided by subcontracting facilities by extending the services and facilities available within Telecom itself. An integral part of the McKinsey recommendation provides for capital grants from the Government for those services provided by Telecom where the returns do not meet the costs of capital. This latter proposal will require very careful consideration at a time when it is essential for the Government to contain the growth of Budget expenditure. It is clearly a matter of determining appropriate priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>There is every evidence to believe that the transformation from telecommunications to telematics is the greatest growth area in the economy, both in money terms and also in community value. If we follow what the Minister said, we could only assume that the green light would be given to Telecom. But two days later, on 16 October, the red light was given and Telecom was told: 'Nothing doing! You are not going into that area. It is being handed over to my mates'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's foolish and reckless action will cause great hardship to the very interests that he has been elected to this Parliament to represent. Rural telephone users are heavily subsidised by profits from telephone use in the big cities and the major trunk lines. By performing major surgery on Telecom, cutting off potentially the greatest growth area in telecommunications for the rest of this century, handing it to his fat cat friends in private industry as part of a corrupt bargain, the Minister is depriving rural Australia of the opportunity to share the financial rewards of the communications revolution. The Minister is so used to charges of corruption that he does not even respond when I mention it in my speech. The point was made by the Acting Chairman of Telecom, Mr T. E. May, in a letter of 9 January to the Minister, that Telecom was well placed to go into the information revolution. The letter makes the points that videotex systems other than Prestel-the system chosen by Telecom in distinction to the Telidon system which is being proposed by Myer-are relatively untested. Prestel terminals will always be less expensive than terminals associated with Telidon, the system to be introduced by Myer. For the next few years, Prestel terminals are likely to be between one-half and one-third the price. Private enterprise stood to earn $5m as information providers to Telecom in the first full year. Set suppliers would earn about $3m. Telecom proposed to leave private enterprise a number of functions. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a letter to the Minister from Mr Tom May, the Acting Chairman of Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>9 January 1981</PARA>
<PARA>Rt Hon. I. McC. Sinclair M.P. </PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Communications</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, ACT</PARA>
<PARA>My dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA> Your letter of 15th December, 1980, sought further advice on certain aspects of the proposal to introduce a public videotex system in Australia. Each of the matters you raise has been given very close attention during the development of our proposal. The following paragraphs point up the main issues and a detailed analysis of the relative merits of Prestel, Teletel and Telidon is included in Attachment 1. </PARA>
<PARA>CHOICE OF SYSTEM</PARA>
<PARA>Background Knowledge</PARA>
<PARA> On four occasions over the past three years senior experts from Telecom have visited overseas countries to investigate the major world Videotex developments. The French, Teletel, the Japanese, Captains, the Canadian, Telidon, and the British, Prestel, have all been examined at first hand. In addition Telecom Research Department has experimented with Videotex techniques for a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA>The Maturity of Prestel</PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from our investigations that systems other than Prestel have been developed only to the stage where retrieval of text can be adequately demonstrated. They are all at a similar stage of development to that of the UK Prestel system in 1975. The conversion of the UK demonstration Prestel system from a one machine trial system without billing to a public service system with billing, response frames, security, closed user group facilities, charges incurred to date, etc., with adequate software support and documentation took the BPO nearly 3 years and around thirty man years of effort using the top programming talent in the BPO. Similar development work still needs to be undertaken with the other systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The telecommunications operating authorities in West Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Hong Kong and Switzerland have selected and are introducing Prestel systems. In addition the Prestel International service linking eight countries including Australia has recently been confirmed following a trial. There are a number of other administrations in Europe and South East Asia including New Zealand and Malaysia currently investigating the introduction of a Prestel service. </PARA>
<PARA>Terminal Costs, Availability and Australian Content</PARA>
<PARA> By choosing Prestel the probability of terminal availability for the three broad classes of terminal i.e., the domestic and business user markets and the Information Provider (IP) market are maximised, the costs of each minimised and the circumstances for maximum participation of Australian manufacturers are most congenial. Prestel terminals will always be less expensive than Telidon terminals and for the next few years are likely to be between half and one-third the price. </PARA>
<PARA>Timescales Possible</PARA>
<PARA> It is our opinion that at this point in time and probably for the next few years that only the Prestel service could be purchased for a public service in Australia. The market undoubtedly wants to move quickly into Videotex. This is understandable when private enterprise will stand to earn around $5m per annum from Information Provider (IP) services even in the first full year of public service and set suppliers can expect to generate income of around $3m per annum in the same period. IP earnings will be independent of the system chosen and so delay would mean delayed profit and service opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>Public Service Requirements</PARA>
<PARA> A public service rather than a trial is required in Australia in view of the substantial investment private enterprise will be required to make to ensure the success of the service. (At least one IP and one Terminal supplier are known to be contemplating budgets of $1m). </PARA>
<PARA> In our view it is essential if private investment is to be attracted for all parties to have confidence in the long term prospects for the service and a policy that would indicate the possible transient use of private investment would not be conducive to a successful service. In particular, Australian TV manufacturers have found provision of sets for the trial broadcast teletext services to be a loss making venture and are unlikely to invest substantially again in a trial service with a possiblity of a limited life. </PARA>
<PARA>Enhanced Graphics</PARA>
<PARA> Although Telidon has an enhanced graphics capability compared with Teletel or Prestel at this point in time the commercial value of this enhancement is unproven. Experience in the market place has shown that the prime requirement of Videotex is for textual display and that the use of graphics is declining. The enhanced graphics of Telidon will not materially assist in travel illustration, real estate sales, teleshopping and signature verification, all of which are recognised important market opportunities for Videotex. These applications require a picture and in this development the BPO have already demonstrated 'Picture Prestel' a high definition colour TV standard picture capability. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard a typical example of the interest being shown in the 'Picture' capability is a request from Mr A. V. Curtis of the Real Estate Institute of Canberra in relation to the requirement by members for compulsory listing of all properties within 48 hours and the interest of agents in Sydney and Melbourne in Canberra properties. </PARA>
<PARA>Inappropriateness of Tender Procedures in this Case</PARA>
<PARA> It was the view of senior management in Telecom that if tenders were called to supply a public service Videotex system for Australia at this time so many critical areas of systems development would be undeveloped or unproven in systems other than Prestel that not only would the preparation of the schedule have been very difficult and added a significant delay to the project but a tender evaluation would be bound to select Prestel. It was on this basis that the certificate of inexpediency was granted and negotiations opened with the BPO. It is my view that this remains the correct course. </PARA>
<PARA>ROLE OF TELECOM AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE IN VIDEOTEX</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is aware of the Government desire for maximum participation of private enterprise and has formulated its policy accordingly. Telecom has decided:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Not to offer Umbrella Information Provider but to leave this to private enterprise. Telecom would limit itself to providing service type information of the type presently provided on the telephone recorded information service. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. To only demonstrate and take orders for sets on an agency basis in agreement with private enterprise leaving the responsibility for set supply to private industry. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Not to enter the terminal maintenance market. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. To encourage private in house Viewdata systems such as that developed by ICL compatible with the Prestel system. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. To purchase the Prestel software enhancement developed by the Bundespost which allows access through Prestel to private third party computer databases to encourage as wide as possible access to information. </PARA>
<PARA> Adoption of these policies means that over 80 per cent of employment and earnings from the Videotex industry will be outside Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to Telecom's proposed participation there are a number of compelling reasons for this which worldwide have led, with a couple of minor exceptions in the USA, to Videotex services with public access being virtually all organised and operated by the telephone operating authority with that body owning the equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> The more important of these reasons are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. To separate ownership of the publishing media from individual information publishers. It would not be acceptable to other publishers if one of their rivals owned and organised the service. With a projected forecast of 100-200 major publishing organisations on Videotex in the first year, it is difficult to see how an acceptable consortium could be organised. Telecom as a non-publishing organisation, does not suffer from criticisms of preference. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Telecom would provide a national service as soon as possible at a uniform price. To undertake provision on this basis to country areas would require cross-subsidisation from metropolitan areas. It is doubtful if private organisations would be willing to undertake this task with the result that country areas would not be connected to Videotex at unit fee or community rate. Other cross-subsidisation that may be necessary would be in the provision of services for disadvantaged groups including deaf, disabled and migrant groups. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Development of a national market by Telecom would maximise the benefits of the service and its penetration in the whole community including providing maximum readership audiences for publishers and the maximum potential sales for terminal suppliers, i.e., Telecom would 'make the market' and give private enterprise 80 per cent of a large unified service. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. On a practical basis with Telecom organising and developing the service it can place the equipment in its premises at locations which minimise network cost and can readily organise multiplex links and short code access for progressive national coverage in a more efficient and timely manner than would be possible if a third party or parties were involved. In addition, as an operating body experienced in system evaluation, Telecom would not be committed to one particular equipment supplier and would select future systems to maximise customer benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Telecom, as an operator of world standard telecommunication services has the proven skills, resources and experience and organisation required to run a high quality public service on a 24 hour, 7 days a week basis. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Telecom, as the public telecommunication authority has an established relationship with other telecommunication authorities and would participate in the international co-operation in Prestel enhancements and the marketing of Videotex services in other countries to Australian customers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my view that private enterprise, in its role of user, publisher and terminal supplier as well as private individuals as a whole, whether living in the country or the cities would be best served by Telecom supplying the network and data storage capability and arranging the service. </PARA>
<PARA> The ongoing development and marking of the Videotex service would be a joint activity bringing together in a consultative committee the information providers, the terminal suppliers and Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA>VIDEOTEX AND BROADCAST TELETEXT</PARA>
<PARA> Broadcast teletext with its limited page capacity (around 500 pages) and its one way, in delay, mode of operation does not match the utility of the Videotex service with its interactive capability, its virtually unlimited page capacity and high speed page retrieval. Experience shows that whilst the market for teletext may be domestic, the applications for Videotex are for business, commercial and government services, with a widespread use of specialised terminals at least in the initial phase. </PARA>
<PARA> Already Channel 9 have opted out of teletext and its prospects of commercial success are uncertain. Those stations that have so far implemented a trial broadcast teletext service ATN-7, NBM-3 and BTQ-7 have done so with a Prestel compatible system. It is extremely doubtful whether a Telidon receiver or adaptor compatible with Australian Broadcast TV will be available in quantity in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA> With the two services being largely complementary the prospects for broadcast teletext would be best served by a rapidly expanding Videotex service. This is what potential users and publishers require and would be best achieved by implementing the system as proposed as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that the further information included above has clarified to your satisfaction the reasons for the course of action we are proposing. </PARA>

Recently the matter was referred to Mr Malcolm King of the Bank of New Zealand in Sydney to get his opinion on whether Telecom should be allowed to go into this system following the statements that Telecom wanted to go into prestel. The head of the Department received a telex from Mr Malcolm King dated 10 September 1981, which stated in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> D. Private sector will have major and substantial role with Telecom as management co-ordinator, thus providing useful, beneficial interface between Telecom and private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> E. No capital investment appears needed from Telecom. Their contribution is use of existing network, billing system and staff as co-ordinator. </PARA>

<PARA> From: Bank of New Zealand Sydney</PARA>
<PARA>10 September 1981</PARA>
<PARA> The case for Telecom proposed participation in videotex prestel system is supported for following reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> A. Without Telecom as convenor it is difficult to see how there can be an effective national network system. </PARA>
<PARA> B. A national system which does not preclude independent private systems linked to it seems to optimise public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> C. Telecom appears to have absolute minimum role, contributing services which it already controls, manages and runs well. Increased use of existing telecommunication network and billing system helps optimise use of public asset. </PARA>
<PARA> D. Private sector will have major and substantial role with Telecom as management co-ordinator, thus providing useful, beneficial interface between Telecom and private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> E. No capital investment appears needed from Telecom. Their contribution is use of existing network, billing system and staff as co-ordinator. </PARA>
<PARA> F. If the concept of a uniform charge for access by users is adopted (and I support this concept) then a valuable information service becomes available at reasonable price on an equitable basis to the whole Australian community. This appears of special benefit to dispersed rural centres helping to achieve government objective of minimising disability of rural living. </PARA>
<PARA> G. The technology for the system is available, proven, can be adapted to accept new and further technology as it becomes available and can provide international access from national system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. This is one of the most appalling decisions that this Government has made. It is essential that the House recognise the full significance of what is happening. It is very significant particularly that, so far as the rural area is concerned, we are starting to dismantle the potential profit areas, that $7,000m asset that is Telcom. It is a national outrage that Telecom should be destroyed in this way. If we find in future years that Telecom is essentially confined to the provision of rural telephone systems, that more and more people are moving away from the traditional use of the telephone and more towards the use of data bases, that we are hearing information relayed through our television system with the only thing in between being the telephone line, this could be very good for society-providing that Australia exercises and maintains the right to keep control of its own system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The estimated cost of conversion by Telecom, which was confirmed this morning-the cost of the key pad and adaptor that I have referred to before-is $200, in 12 months' time. Currently the cost is between $A200 and $A300, but if the Prestel system is adopted it could operate in Australia within seven months. The Canadian Telidon system, which is comparatively untried compared with Prestel, would take two or three years before it could be adopted in Australia. So it means that for the price of $200-less than a Space Invaders game-one could turn his home into a data base and have access to information all over the world. Yet this foolish, reckless and short-sighted Government is not prepared to trust the Australian people, to trust that great Australian instrumentality, Telecom, to run the system effectively. Instead it says: 'If you have got a worthwhile growth area, something that could be a major asset, let us hand it over completely to foreign ownership and let the fat cats of private enterprise take the profit'. I think the decision is appalling. I think we will all live to regret it. I hope that the Minister-even this Minister-will reverse the decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In spite of the rhetoric of the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), nobody in his right mind could be convinced that the honourable gentleman has anything to support his argument other than an emotional commitment to a philosophy which certainly most honourable members do not espouse. It is a philosophy which states that only the Government and a Government enterprise can run anything in this country. That is demonstrably not so. I will go into the background to the introduction of this Prestel system and the reasons for the Government's decision, but first I will go through a few of the things that the honourable member said. He claimed that on successive occasions I refused to respond in this place to allegations of corruption. I say to him that at no stage have I refused to acknowledge the allegations. However, those who make such allegations would do well to look at themselves first. I completely reject every one of the allegations. I say to the honourable member that it does him little credit that in that respect he follows in the paths of some of his colleagues on that side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the Prestel system, there is no doubt that there are tremendous advantages for social contact and for the business community in the introduction of telematics into Australia. The argument is not about whether it should be introduced or whether it is technically practical; the argument is about whether the Australian Telecommunications Commission, a statutory monopoly not created for this purpose but designed to function to provide telecommunications services throughout the length and breadth of this country, should be given a prior opportunity to move into this highly sophisticated new field. It is quite true that a series of arguments has been advanced by Telecom and by others in support of Telecom's participation. It is also true that in the early stages of the approach from Telecom it envisaged a much greater capital investment than that which was involved in the last proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member's argument seemed to revolve around two areas and I would like to identify them. I believe it is essential that the people of Australia realise that, while the geographic extent and the population paucity of this country require a monopoly in the cable system that stretches throughout this country and in the network that provides our telecommunications links, that monopoly is not necessary when we are moving into a new area of technology which demonstrably can involve private enterprise. That it can do so is indicated by the fact that private sector people are involved. The honourable gentleman referred to correspondence from one of the companies interested in the Telidon system to demonstrate that that private enterprise company was very interested in introducing the system. There is no question that there is interest. There is a question of the extent to which such a company can provide a dispassionate, valid and broad-based telematics-type system, but I will go into that in a moment. The second part, and to me the important part, of the Government's decision is the funding requirements that lie behind the Government's believing that at this stage it is not appropriate for Telecom to be involved. The capital cost for computer hardware is estimated at about $3m spread over five years with payments of about $600,000 a year. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Barry Jones" NAMEID="KH4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is chicken feed.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that it is not a large sum of money but it is $3m. I am glad to hear the honourable gentleman say it is just chicken feed. To most members of this House it is a significant sum of public money and public money is not money that can be just thrown away. It is necessary that we spend something like a quarter of a million dollars on maintenance. Again, the honourable gentleman would say it is not a large sum of money, but it is an additional quarter of a million dollars a year. Internal staffing costs and overheads would be of the order of $4m a year. The first year's loss is assessed at about $1.61m and the second year's loss at about $1.39m. It was hoped that in the third year the results might be more positive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, there is the philosophic difference-we claim that there is no need for a public monopoly to be involved in the field because demonstrably the private sector is interested and has a capacity to be involved-and, secondly, there is a cost consideration; perhaps it is not a great cost but it is nevertheless a cost that has been identified at a level which would reduce the financial ability of Telecom to be involved in those other areas that are its prime responsibility. The Government's concern is that the telecommunications services-the telephones and the line networks of this country-should have prior claim on the funds available to Telecom. The honourable gentlemen of the Opposition are not worried about how much money is spent. They are quite prepared to see taxes increase and funds borrowed by Telecom to any extent without worrying about the overall impact on the economy at large. We on this side of the House believe that it is critical that Telecom, which is the major borrower in this area, should be contained to the same degree that others are contained and that interest rates and the borrowing capacity of individuals should not be prejudiced by our expanding Telecom's intrusion into the market place by giving it the limitless right to borrow. Even on Telecom's assessment of the first couple of years, there will be a cost and there certainly will be a negative cash flow. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, a series of suggestions has come out of some of Telecom's claims as to why it should run the system. In the House this afternoon the honourable gentleman suggested that he believed that only with an independent government statutory authority would we be able to have a dispassionate presentation of information on these telematic machines. Let us see how and why that would apply. The concept involves computer access to a series of information pages. Those information pages are to be provided through the black box, which the honourable gentleman quite correctly has identified, which will be attached to a television screen and linked with a telephone. The range of information provided on those pages is dependent upon the preparedness of the person seeking to provide those pages for inclusion in that data bank to pay whoever purveys the system. There is no suggestion that anybody operating the system will have anything to gain by saying to even my friend the honourable member that any information he provides should not be there. The only basis by which a cash flow can be obtained by whoever provides the system is by ensuring that the maximum number of pages with the maximum amount of information should be included in the system. The basis of payment is to be that the providers of those pages of information will charge at a certain rate those who seek access to them. The commission for providing that information is the payment to the provider of the telematic system. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole of the commercial operation, the commercial interest, is to maximise the number of pages involved. In other words, the actions of a commercial provider of the information would have directly the reverse consequence to that which the honourable member suggests, for it is very much in the interests of the commercial provider to ensure that the maximum amount of information is available through his telematics operation. There will be more than one operator in this field. Each operator will be intensely in competition, I suspect, with the others. Without doubt the one which provides the widest base of information will be the one in most demand. It is true that there is a feeling in Telecom that in some way there will be intrusion on the sort of information that will be provided; in other words, it is suggested that if one is operating a particular brand of product, and has a financial connection with the company providing the telematic system, one will not allow a competitive brand to be shown on the screen. I do not believe that to be so. Indeed, I believe the reverse will be in the interests of the person who is to provide the telematics system. It is true that a few other arguments are advanced in the telex from Mr King that the honourable gentleman tabled a few minutes ago. It is worthwhile my running through those. Mr King suggests that, without Telecom as a convenor, it is difficult to see how there can be an effective national network system. Of course Telecom has to be involved but I do not believe it need be involved as a convenor. The telecommunications system is the telephone link, the cable network around Australia. It is in that area that Telecom has to be a party. Indeed, it is obvious that it will be involved not only in the Prestel system but also, equally, in Telidon, Antiope and any other system that might be introduced, for it provides the only cable network throughout this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, Telecom certainly has to be involved and I believe that those who involve themselves in the area should also take account of the fact that the only way in which they will be successful is for them to provide local call access to the data banks wherever they may be, in the country or in the cities. It is only on that basis that a reasonable demand will be generated for the information provided. Mr King then says that a national system which does not preclude independent private systems linked to it seems to optimise public interest. Certainly there is no preclusion of independent private systems, but why have a national system? Can we not have, through the telecommunications link, a series of national systems? That is our objective-to have not just one but a series of competitive systems, and we hope we will ensure that they are all compatible. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, he said that Telecom appeared to have an absolutely minimum role. It is true that as the project developed Telecom was not as involved as it was at an earlier stage. Telecom was prepared to the maximum to ensure private enterprise participation, but the point is that this is a statutory monopoly. Why should a government monopoly in this order be permitted to run something in which demonstrably private sector persons are interested? While the private sector would have a role in the Telecom proposal, why should the Government instrumentality have a role at all?</PARA>
<PARA> The next point made by Mr King is that the private sector will have a major and substantial role with Telecom as management co-ordinator. As I have suggested, Telecom will be involved, whatever the system, through the cable link-up. Further, he said that no capital investment appears to be needed from Telecom. I have pointed out that if we take the staff, the overhead, the computer hardware, and the software maintenance there is a significant sum of money required in order to operate the system, and those sums and personnel will be removed from what is Telecom's predominant responsibility. We all accept the technologies available. I have addressed myself to the concept of the uniform charge. I believe that whoever provides this system needs to ensure that a uniform charge is available and uniform access throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of allegations have been made about my handing this over to my friends. I can well understand nobody in the commercial sector being friends of the Australian Labor Party, but at this stage there is no identification of anybody being interested. Indeed, the Government is setting up a study to determine to what degree there should be licensing; to what degree there should be a determination of technical standards; to what degree there should be an integration and overlap between the different systems; if there are three or four telematic systems, to what degree that black box that is purchased by the individual can be used in each one of the households and for each one of the systems. The individual, of course, would then pay the charge on the system to which access could be gained. The study will determine what access should be given to the Telecom network in terms of systems comparability for private systems. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to make sure to the maximum that in the technical capability of the different systems we do not lock ourselves out of advancing technology. For example, it is said that the Telidon system has some greater capacity in graphics at this stage than Prestel. There is no doubt that Prestel certainly is more advanced in terms of its availability. The other advantage is that Prestel also provides access to an international network that is not, at the moment at least, available in other systems. There is no identification by the Government of any individual as taking over the Prestel system from Telecom. As I indicated a moment ago, we are studying the degree to which licensing, determination of technical standards, and access to the Telecom network should be prescribed. It is certainly not the decision of the Government to hand over to any one individual the access to this system simply because we do not believe Telecom itself should be involved in the provision of Prestel. It is necessary that there be access to the Telecom system. It is necessary that Telecom be a participant in whatever system introduced, and we believe that it is also necessary that there be some licensing procedure to ensure that the public interest is protected. </PARA>
<PARA> The basis of this proposal today is simply the philosophic approach of the Labor Party, its commitment to Public Service employment, and its concern that nobody in the private sector has a capacity to provide the service, which demonstrably it now does. The Government does not accept that the private sector cannot provide this service. We believe, indeed, that it is an area where the private sector has a tremendous challenge. Under the licensing procedures I have identified as being now under study, I believe the public interest will be more than adequately protected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to speak on the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill, one of the Bills to which you referred. I want to raise a matter of importance to South Australia and to agriculture generally, and I refer in particular to the Waite Agricultural Research Institute. I refer, firstly, to Volume 2, Part 2, of the report of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, starting at page 73, which deals with the University of Adelaide. At paragraph A4.143 the report refers to the Waite Agricultural Research Institute. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Universities Council, and previously the Universities Commission, have, in their funding of the University of Adelaide, recognised the special role of the Waite Agricultural Research Institute. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The University itself in 1980 examined the position of the Institute within the University structure and, following the recommendations of an internal review committee chaired by Justice Roma Mitchell, agreed to a new administrative and funding arrangement for the Institute. Nevertheless, the Council has continued to receive representations seeking to have the Institute recognised as a national research school, arguing, at the same time, for funds designated in some way as supplementary to the University's existing commitment to the Institute. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tertiary Education Commission, after explaining why it did not accede to the request of the University of Adelaide, continues at page 75 of its report:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council is aware of the contribution that the Waite Institute has made-and is making-to agricultural research; it is also conscious of the work of high quality being undertaken in this field in other institutions. It is of the view that the quality of the research carried out by any institution will be the essential basis on which the scientific community will accord it appropriate recognition. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council is confident that within the resources available to it, the University of Adelaide will be able to maintain the effectiveness of the research programs of the Waite Institute. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Universities Council-</PARA>
<PARA>has also noted the University's-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the University of Adelaide-</PARA>
<PARA>representations for special consideration to be given to the capital requirements of the Institute. However, in view of the limited funds available to the Council for building and minor works programs in 1982, the Council is unable to make any special provisions for the Waite Institute. The University should continue to assess the capital requirements of the Institute in the context of priorities for the University as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not have time to develop my arguments in this debate, but I want to bring to the Government's attention in this forum the need for continued research in agriculture and the reason why I have taken up the claims of the Waite Institute with the Government. The Minister for Education (Mr Fife) is well aware of my action in pursuing this matter, and I take this opportunity of thanking him for his assistance. He has arranged meetings between myself and many of my colleagues from South Australia who are interested in this matter and members of the Tertiary Education Commission, as well as following the matter up with subsequent meetings and correspondence. The Minister has certainly gone out of his way to ensure that our case-that is the case of the South Australian representatives in support of the Waite Institute-has been properly considered. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of background perhaps I ought to explain two things. Firstly, it is acknowledged to be of great importance for us to implement technological changes in manufacturing industries in order to maintain our efficiency and our position amongst our trading partners. So it is just as important that we adopt technological changes and undertake research in agriculture to ensure that we maintain our lead as, if not the best, one of the best farming nations in the world. Secondly, I have been in a fortunate position of seeing the astounding advances being made in agriculture. No doubt they are occurring elsewhere in Australia, but I have a diverse farming electorate where enormous changes have been made in farming techniques leading to the introduction of many new crops and a more intensive use of the land. These developments have brought home to me the need for ongoing research programs to assist in ensuring that the land reaches and maintains its full potential. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give some examples of the sorts of things that I mean in my electorate. Land in my area which was known as the 90-mile desert has now been developed into grazing and cropping land. Grazing land to the south of that area around Keith in South Australia is now the centre of a thriving seed production industry, boasting a turnover of millions of dollars and exporting lucerne seed in particular. Farther south a potato industry has been introduced and still farther south new areas of vines have been introduced and each year a substantial area is now devoted to oilseed production. The lower rainfall areas of the Malee north of Pinnaroo, which were once considered harsh and, by some, even marginal grazing and cropping country, are now being tried for irrigated vegetable production. </PARA>
<PARA> Accomplishing these giant strides forward in increasing the productivity of the country has not all been plain sailing. Shortly after I entered this Parliament a new insect pest-the lucerne aphid-found its way to Australia and caused severe damage to the grazing and lucerne industries. A large proportion of the grazing industry in the lower rainfall areas of my electorate, including the 90-mile desert, as it was called-to which I have previously referred-was seriously affected by the lucerne aphid. On that occasion the Government acceded to my request to provide just under half a million dollars to assist the South Australian Government in breeding a sufficient number of wasps to control the aphid population. Subsequently, a number of lucerne breeding programs have been undertaken in an effort to find a suitable aphid resistant variety of lucerne. At the same time, some farmers from my area went to the United States of America to see whether any of its lucerne varieties could be used here or could be used as breeding stock. That was a case when we undertook the research after the attack. </PARA>

As I was saying, in relation to the aphid problem we reacted after the attack and we are still really seeking a suitable alternative lucerne variety to the old Hunter River variety. I am concerned that we should maintain, if not increase, our research to ensure that the new and more intensive farming techniques can be sustained and, indeed, improved. We should be looking more to the future and not merely relying on our ability to solve problems as they arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Farmers are probably the most significant group of conservationists in Australia; not the ratbag type of conservationists, but the real conservationists. Farmers know that their future lies in the soil, the environment and nature. Therefore, I have been involved in seeking assistance for a number of research programs, including research into pest management programs and programs aimed at developing management techniques for bee colonies to improve crop pollination. More and more we are trying to use natural controls on pests. We are adopting measures to assist nature to help us farm. It is hoped that this will reduce our dependence on insecticides and the like which not only are expensive but also must be used with extreme care, as the farmer well knows. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an area which I believe warrants government attention. It is an area where we can further help the farmer. I appreciate that there is a limit to the amount that we can appropriate for research. I acknowledge that valuable research is being undertaken in a host of areas which I have not mentioned-by universities, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and others. There is no doubt that this is extremely beneficial to the rural sector. I make the point also that nearly all farmers levy themselves to contribute to that research. Nevertheless, I urge the Government to bear in mind the importance of the Waite Agricultural Institute to farming in southern Australia. The Waite receives funds from government through the University of Adelaide, from farmers through research grants from levies, and from generous endowments and trust funds which have been set up for research purposes. My plea is that this important research centre continue to receive a high priority in the distribution of available research funds. </PARA>

<PARA> Funds for universities and colleges of advanced education in 1982 have been reduced very marginally by only 0.4 per cent in real terms while funds for technical and further education will increase by 6 per cent in real terms, resulting in a small overall real increase in tertiary funds for 1982. Within these overall funding limits the Bill implements the Government's decisions on the recommendations of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission to reallocate resources between institutions within the higher education sectors consistent with the Government's decisions arising out of the Review of Commonwealth Functions and the Government's guidelines for the 1982-84 triennium. These institutional reallocations, including the increased funding levels for equipment, reflect the Government's decisions to adjust resources from teacher education to the technologies and business studies. Of the 30 colleges of advanced education listed by the Government for consolidation only seven are now outstanding and I will be arranging for further consultations with the State authorities on these colleges. In the meantime, as I explained in my second reading speech, the Bill provides the means for adjusting appropriations for 1982 if satisfactory arrangements can be settled. Where funds have not been provided for 1983 and 1984 in respect of seven outstanding consolidations, these will have to be the subject of further legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the House includes provision for the limited reintroduction of tuition fees. This puts into effect the Government's view that students who are not undertaking study towards first awards or those who should not be exempt on other grounds should be required to make a contribution to the cost of their academic studies. The amendments to the Australian National University Act and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Act are consistent with these provisions in the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill. Based on 1980 enrolments, my Department estimates that 13,000 students will pay fees next year as a result of these provisions. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) during his address last night attributed other estimates to Senator Carrick. The House needs to be aware that when answering a question in the Senate yesterday Senator Carrick referred to estimates published by the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations, not to the estimates of my Department. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also provision in this Bill for several new initiatives, including funding arrangements for the support of special research centres of excellence and the development of community language courses, both of which were included in the Government's 1980 election undertakings. Increased provision for certain non-government teachers' colleges is to be provided in recognition of the special role of the non-government education sector of the community. The Government has taken note of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission's comments on the falling participation rates of young people in higher education and will be asking the Commission to undertake an examination of this situation. I note that in terms of overall student numbers the Commission has reported that the planning ranges which it originally proposed for the 1982-84 triennium should be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that the legislation before the House is a clear indication of the Government's continuing commitment to tertiary education, tempered by its acceptance of its responsibility to meet priority education needs within the limits of available resources. As I indicated a moment ago the Government rejects the amendment moved by the Opposition which refers to certain of the proposed college amalgamations. Colleges of advanced education in New South Wales and Victoria, for which at present no satisfactory amalgamation proposals exist, can be funded in 1982 under the legislation before the House. The range of educational opportunities where amalgamations occur and questions relating to employment are matters for the institutions concerned. I conclude by saying that it is nonsense to suggest that academic integrity is at risk. This is protected by the Acts of the State parliaments which establish the institutions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will vote against this clause. This is the clause which gives the Minister for Education the power to determine the level at which fees will be charged up to a maximum of $1,000 and the groups of students to whom those fees will apply. The Opposition objects to the reintroduction of tertiary tuition fees in any form. While the legislation makes it clear that the fees proposed to be reintroduced will relate only to second degree students and higher degree students, we will oppose that as a matter of principle. The point is that this move is a clear abrogation of an election promise. In October of last year the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) said that the Government had no intention or proposals for the reintroduction of tertiary tuition fees. The people of Australia were entitled to take that statement at its face value; that is, that the Government did not intend to and would not reintroduce tertiary tuition fees in any form. It was only a few months later, as a result of the Lynch Committee, the razor gang, that the Government decided to reintroduce tertiary tuition fees in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question arises as to how an Opposition should act in relation to a government's election undertakings. It seems to us that if the government has a mandate for a particular proposal, there is an obligation on the Parliament not to frustrate unduly the government's putting into effect of that undertaking. When there is a question for which the government has no mandate, the Parliament is entitled to consider it on its merits. However, when the government has made a quite clear undertaking that it will not do something and then turns around and attempts to do it, the Parliament has an obligation to prevent the government's proceeding in that direction. It has an obligation to ensure that the government keeps its compact with the Australian people that it made at the time of the last election. That is why we will vote in this place and in the Senate to remove clause 6, thereby removing the Minister's power to determine fees for these classes of students. </PARA>
<PARA> If, as a result of the removal of that clause by the Senate-it is my confident prediction that the Senate will remove clause 6-there are any delays in this legislation, they will be due entirely to the caprice of this Government and to its obstinacy. The Senate has a perfect right-indeed, I would say an obligation-to amend this legislation to remove this provision. Any delays there might be in respect of the funding of universities and colleges around Australia are entirely in the Government's hands. The problem is entirely of its making. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister tries to get out of this by saying that he has said repeatedly, and given repeated assurances subsequently, that he does not intend to reintroduce fees for any other groups of students, but what the Minister has to accept is that all his subsequent assurances are debased by his proven unreliability. He could not be trusted before the last election and he cannot be trusted now. He might carry on about what he likes to call my mischievous activities in suggesting to students and staff in tertiary institutions around Australia that it is the Government's real intention to reintroduce fees for all students, but I will continue to do that because that is my firm belief. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason for my having that quite firm belief is that it is the stated intention of a noisy and influential group of back benchers on the Government side-a group of which the honourable member for Fadden may not be a member but certainly there are other identified members such as the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) and the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) and apparently 20 to 30 others-who are quite clearly of the view that the Government should proceed to reintroduce fees for undergraduate students as well as for the classes in respect of which this legislation intends to charge fees. There are other reasons for believing that that is the Government's intention in any event. The amount of money which is intended to be raised by the universities and colleges as a result of this measure is, on the Government's estimate, $8m for the whole of the next calendar year and $4m for this financial year. That to me is a highly optimistic and, I suggest, completely unrealistic estimate of the amount of money which is likely to be brought in as a result of this measure. Even if it were true, it would still be a very tiny proportion of the $1,865m involved in the total expenditure on higher education throughout this country. My guess is that in the next calendar year the Government will be extraordinarily lucky to get $4m as a result of this measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Education just today said, if I heard him correctly, that he thought that 13,000 students would be liable to pay fees next calendar year. If that is the case, it is still difficult to reconcile the estimate of the number of students with the estimated revenue unless about three-quarters of them are part time students. That may be the case, but during our questioning at the Estimates Committee the Government did not reveal the actual basis of this estimate. I repeat that, certainly in our view and in the view of people who have studied this matter, it is a highly unrealistic and optimistic estimate of the intended revenue. But the Government is not interested in the revenue, quite clearly. It is interested in re-establishing the principle of fees and a collection mechanism which can be easily extended to include other groups of students. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other reasons why this proposition ought to be opposed. To the groups of students to whom it is intended to apply it represents a very selective and severe penalty. Those students are, in many cases, the least able to pay the fees. A small proportion of post-graduate students are receiving Commonwealth or university awards of one kind or another. Stingy and inadequate as those awards are, both in level and number, students receiving them will be exempt from fees. The people who have no means of support-public support or university support-will be the ones selected for this specific penalty. They will have to pay a penalty of $1,000 a year because they want to undertake post-graduate studies. That seems to me to be incredibly unfair and unjust. It takes no account of the needs of those students, their ability to pay, or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> What has to be recognised by the Government is that this measure will have a very detrimental effect on the research effort in Australian universities and, to a lesser extent, colleges of advanced education. Post-graduate students are vital to the research effort of this country. To penalise them in this way, which will inevitably result in fewer of them being able to study post-graduate courses, is incredibly stupid. The Australian National University has made some estimates of the sorts of impacts which it thinks that fees will have on its intakes. Because I am running out of time I seek leave to have the letter of the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear John,</PARA>
<PARA> The particular issues over tuition fees about which I have pressed my concern, but unsuccessfully, are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) In view of the exemptions from tuition fees which have been agreed to, tuition fees for research students will fall upon those least able to pay for these, the relatively small minority who whilst accepted as suitable by the university are not the recipients of any exempted awards. This, I have to say, is a matter of considerable concern to us, particularly since there has been a reduction in the numbers of Commonwealth Postgraduate Awards since 1977 of 16 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) From the papers you already have from me you will see that, of those who first enrolled this year in our Faculty of Asian Studies-in which the learning of an Asian language over three years is compulsory-over 20 per cent had a previous tertiary qualification. Under the proposed arrangements their counterparts from next year will be required to pay fees. I cannot think that it is in any way in the national interest that there should be any new deterrent to the already all too small numbers in our society who are prepared to go to all the trouble entailed in the learning of a language of one or our Asian neighbours. I believe it is very important that such people should not have to pay tuition fees. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) From the papers I sent, you will also have seen that there are significant numbers of Public Servants who enrol for a second undergraduate degree here at the ANU. Under last year's decisions of the Public Service Board, lately reinforced by the Government's decisions following the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Public Service has to make deliberate decisions that any enrolments for a degree by a Public Servant is in the interests of the Public Service. The suggestion has been made that employers will need to consider paying tuition fees for second degrees when their taking was in their interest. If this idea is to be pursued as regards the Public Service, provision would need to be made for Departments or the Public Service Board to pay tuition fees on such occasions. The simplest procedure, I venture to suggest, would be for exemption to be extended to such cases too. As you will see from the figures significant numbers of Public Servants with previous tertiary qualifications enrol for a second undergraduate degree at the ANU. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) has indicated, we in the Australian Labor Party will vote against clause 6 of this Bill for a number of very good reasons. As he indicated, the principal reason is that the reintroduction of tertiary fees is a clear breaking of a pre-election undertaking given by the Minister for Education (Mr Fife). There are also other excellent reasons. I will explore the likely effect of the reintroduction of fees on the participation rates in universities. It has been estimated that this measure will cause a dropout rate of about 40 per cent. This figure has to be assessed against the background of Australia already having one of the lowest student participation rates in the industrialised world. Figures put out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1978 showed this quite clearly. Australia ranked fourteenth out of the 23 OECD countries with only 46.1 per cent of the 15 to 19-year-old age group being full time students. Honourable members should compare this participation rate with those in Japan and the United States, where over 70 per cent of that age group is engaged in full time study.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The figures from the 1976 census are also very revealing. Of our population aged 15 and over, only 1.97 per cent held bachelor's degrees. The breakdown in that figure between men and women is very interesting. Of males over 15 years of age 2.83 per cent hold bachelors degrees but only 1.14 per cent of women in that age group hold bachelors degrees. The census figures relating to those holding higher degrees indicates an even lower participation rate. Of the population aged over 15 years only 0.35 per cent hold higher degrees-0.57 per cent of males and 0.13 per cent of females. These figures hardly represent an excess of higher learning in Australia. Yet this fee proposal will cut those miserable figures to even lower levels. Apart from lowering the participation rate overall, the introduction of fees will certainly skew the pattern of participation even more away from those on low incomes, women, and the disadvantaged in our society. The report of the Tertiary Education Research Centre at the University of New South Wales issued in 1978 showed that students at that university were more likely to be from families of higher social status, more likely to be of Australian parentage, and more likely to have attended a private school. The reintroduction of fees will certainly accelerate that trend. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also be concerned about the effect of this reduced participation rate on the supply of skilled labour in Australia. It is obvious that the introduction of fees, thus lowering the participation rate, will have a severe effect on the supply of highly skilled and qualified people in this country. The fact that this is happening at a time when demand for those with advanced degrees is likely to grow is, quite frankly, appalling. An article in the Times Higher Education Supplement of 26 December 1980 described the trend in demand for people with higher educational qualifications in the United States. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Continuing the trend of the 1970s, demand is still growing fastest for technical graduates, particularly those with advanced degrees. Recruitment of engineers is expected to increase by 16 per cent over last year at the bachelor's level, 25 per cent for masters degrees and 53 per cent for doctorates. The last figure is bad news for university engineering departments, which are already finding it virtually impossible to keep new Ph.D.s in the academic profession because industry is luring them away with fatter salaries and better equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> In science and mathematics, projected job opportunities are up 5 per cent for bachelor's degrees, but 21 per cent and 29 per cent at the master's and doctoral levels respectively. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the pattern of demand that is occurring in the United States. If that trend flows through, even partly, to Australia then we are likely to witness an increasing employer demand for post-graduate degree holders. However, the imposition of fees for second and higher degrees is very likely to have a negative effect on the enrolment and thus the supply of these highly qualified people. Instead, that overseas expertise will have to be imported. We will have to compete as a nation on the world market for highly qualified people because of the measures that we are taking in the Parliament that will work against training our own people. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest fear is that this measure represents the thin edge of the wedge. We are all aware that the Minister has said repeatedly that the Government does not intend to introduce fees for undergraduates. When it is remembered that only 12 months ago the Minister promised not to introduce fees at all then I think any reasonable person must be aware that the currency of this Minister's promises and the currency of this Government's promises have been somewhat debased in recent years. There is a real fear that, unless clause 6 is knocked out of the Bill, we will be back here at this time next year debating proposals to reintroduce fees for all students at tertiary level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak in opposition to this clause. I emphasise that what I believe is at stake here is an extremely serious principle. I think that it illustrates the obnoxious educational philosophy of this Government. The principle that we have here is the view that somehow university and college education is intended to produce basically a production line of graduates who are skilled in a very narrow way and who are not people who will go on towards excellence, towards contributing to the notion of adding to the total sum of human knowledge, towards making the contribution that we need to make in the areas of research. To reduce the number of students who will go into post-graduate programs by the introduction of fees is effectively to cut out that higher aspect of education and that higher aspect of our contribution to the frontiers of human knowledge. Every country-especially Western countries-is concerned to make that kind of scholastic contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is Australia doing? It is cutting out that segment by this attempt to reduce dramatically the number of post-graduate students. Let me remind the House what post-graduate studies involve in most cases. They involve usually undertaking an original piece of work for a masters degree or a doctorate. That original piece of work is intended to be a contribution to the sum total of human knowledge. Most of the research being done in Australian universities is not done by the employed academics at the present time; it is done by the post-graduate students working for those degrees. It is a total disgrace for this Government to cut out those types of programs. This shows that this Government is not concerned with the accumulation of human knowledge. It shows that this Government has an absolutely absurd philosophy on education and an absolutely absurd philosophy on research. </PARA>
<PARA> The average post-graduate student who will have to pay these fees is a person who has decided that he or she needs to go on to do a higher degree even though he or she has not received a scholarship or an award. This person is usually making substantial sacrifices in order to go on to do this higher study. Usually this person has to work part time or to live on a pittance in order to make his or her contribution. These people usually are very dedicated people, people who have decided on a particular program that they want to investigate. It is on that basis that they have decided to go on in their studies. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that situation, I cannot understand the rationale of this Government in attempting to cut these programs by the introduction of fees. I have been told by more than 20 people whom I have come across who were planning to undertake post-graduate studies which I considered important-I have some liaison with universities on these matters-that they are now not able to go on in their studies because they will have to pay $2,000 for a masters degree and $3,000 for a doctorate at the very least. This situation, I maintain, reflects the kind of absurd priorities of this Government not only in the area of education but in other areas as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The saving that is supposed to be made is at most $8m. This is absolute peanuts in relation to the total Budget. Given the fact that we now have a Budget surplus of $1,500m, $8m will not add enormously to government funds. What is even more serious in relation to this is that the vice-chancellors of all the universities have condemned this scheme. Not only the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee but also the Federation of College Academics, the Australian Union of Students, not to mention the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations-that is, everybody involved in tertiary education-have condemned the Minister and these proposals. Yet, the Minister does not care about democracy. He does not care about the voice of the people. He does not care about the voice of those who are directly concerned with these schemes. He simply ignores all of that criticism and tries to tell us that there is some rational justification for these proposals. There is absolutely no justification. </PARA>
<PARA> We know what the Government is on about. We know that these proposals are introduced in the short term in order to introduce general undergraduate fees in the long term. We say that that will, in fact, be the final result. If undergraduate fees are introduced in the long term, or even perhaps next year-who knows with the promises of this Government; we cannot believe a word it says in relation to these matters-it is very possible that we will find undergraduate fees being introduced even in the term of this Parliament. If this is the ultimate aim of the Government then it will stand condemned by the Australian nation because this shows clearly that it is not interested in the real issues concerning education; that it is not interested in the real aims and purposes of education. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Minister that the aims and purposes of education have to do with the development of the whole person, with the development of citizens in this community who are able to contribute to the sum total of the society. Education is not concerned merely to produce an automaton which performs in a factory, in an office or for some other bureaucratic institution. The situation is that the Government has no educational philosophy at all except the attempt to cut out the availability of education to the majority of the people and at the same time to reduce standards throughout the educational establishments, particularly in post-graduate studies. I am concerned, as a former academic, that the level of our universities, which has been an excellent level in the past, will be reduced by these proposals. The Government does not seem to care about the importance of scholastic contribution in this area. It ought to reconsider this matter immediately and to drop these proposals. I say to the members opposite that they ought to vote for the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous), made reference to the excellence in the standard of education in past years. I think that, begrudgingly, he was acknowledging that it was governments of this present Government's political persuasion, going right back to the Menzies days, that put the first real shot in the arm of tertiary education and caused the growth that we witnessed in those years. This Government is not an uncaring government about education. The national education bill amounts to billions and billions of dollars. I concede that the previous speaker may have put his finger on a point when he said that a small percentage of those seeking higher education may be totally reliant on government support and that the $1,000 provided for in the Bill may, for a small number of them, present a problem. But, on the other hand, the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Free), said that many people doing graduate work and post-graduate work are people from higher income homes. He is nodding his head and acknowledging that that is so. These people will not be affected. He has said already that those sorts of people will comprise the majority in this field. His concern is that this legislation will result in the number of such people being increased as a percentage of the total.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Burke jumps up and says how lousy this Government is because it is not giving a cent towards education. The fact is that the average cost to the Government and the taxpayer of Australia for a post-graduate student is about $5,000 a year. That figure is averaged out over a number of different courses. For example, a course in medicine might cost more than an arts course, but the average is $5,000. Whilst the honourable member for Burke presents a picture of the Government not giving a cent the figure of $1,000 provided for in the Bill represents about 20 per cent of the average cost. What he did not say is that the Government is still meeting 80 per cent of the average cost but that it is requiring those people who are doing those courses to contribute 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe in and recognise the worth of higher education. I recognise the worth of the work that is done in the pursuit of a second degree. But another argument that the Australian taxpayer has the right to put is that a person is not going to spend his life in a university pursuing degree after degree supported by him. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Burke, who is a self-confessed academic, I think would subscribe to the theory that some people have the right to stay at universities for the rest of their lives never making any worthwhile contribution. The flaw in this view is that the Australian taxpayer has to contribute to this education from his pocket; he has to pay the money to keep people at universities. Even if this draconian measure, to use his words, is introduced, it will still mean that on average the Australian taxpayer is contributing 80 per cent of the total cost of higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> I was not listed to speak on this Bill and I did not intend to speak. But one thing that galled me was the continuing vilification, distortions and accusations being hurled at the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) who is sitting at the table. I am aware that the Minister will shortly be speaking on his own account. But I think it is fair to say that when Opposition members say that they are absolutely convinced that the Government will introduce fees for undergraduates, they are putting a convenient interpretation on the words that he used last year. The Minister did not say last year that fees would never be imposed in universities. He did not say that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did not. The Minister will be speaking in about two minutes; he knows the words he used. Whilst I concede that it is possible to put a convenient interpretation on his words, I think honourable members opposite are twisting the truth to their own political advantage. They are trying to place upon those words an interpretation which enables them to stand up here with conviction and strength and say: 'We do not trust the Minister because he said this once and tomorrow he will do something else'. In the name of fairness I say to them that the best they could say perhaps is that, if they put a certain interpretation on the words that came from the Minister's mouth last year and saw what happened, there is a chance, unless he gives a categorical statement here today, the same thing will happen later. But for honourable members opposite to try to put fear in the hearts not only of students but also of parents whose children are nearing the end of their secondary school education is totally unjust and unfair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I repeat what I said earlier: Even though I conceded some aspects of the comments made by previous speakers I completely reject the observations of those honourable members who portray a situation in which students pay for their higher education. The average fee charged will be about $1,000 a year and the average cost to keep a person in post-graduate studies is about $5,000. So the Government or, more importantly, the taxpayers of Australia will still contribute $4,000 on average or 80 per cent of the cost of post-graduate study. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to canvass ground that I went over yesterday in my speech during the second reading debate. I want to look at this proposal strictly from the point of view of its equity. I do not want to permit Government members to talk, as they have done so far, in terms of general principles associated with this Bill, the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill, and think that their general principles about user-pays or about lifting the burden from the taxpayers and being equitable to the poor and not to the rich actually apply to what they intend to do here with this piece of legislation. I concede to the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) the point that he sought to make, namely, that substantial Commonwealth initiatives in the area of tertiary education were carried out by previous Liberal governments. I concede that. Commonwealth responsibility in the area of tertiary education started under the post-war reconstruction Minister of the Labor Government, John Dedman. That responsibility was subsequently picked up and expanded in the period of the Menzies Government. In the area of what are now colleges of advanced education significant initiatives were undertaken when the current Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was Minister for Education and a former Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton, was Minister for Education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It saddens me that this is probably the first time that we have had a reasonably long running period of Liberal government in this country, in which, in fact, processes which Liberal governments helped set in train and which were dramatically increased in our period in government have been significantly reversed. The process has been one of retreat in the area of tertiary education since this Government came to office. This is one aspect of it; how unnecessary it is. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) pointed out yesterday that Australian taxpayers spend $20m a day on education. This legislation will present a saving of $8m at the most in a year. So, absolutely no argument can be heard in this chamber that this imposition amounts to a serious cost saving to Australian taxpayers. The relevant clause in the Bill is not a legitimate source of support for the argument which has been made in the past by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) and which seems to have been picked up today by the honourable member for Fadden. That argument is irrelevant in a consideration of the proposition which is before us now. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to go a little further, because this proposal has been hawked about as a move of great equity, and look at what its actual impact will be on the individual person undertaking second degree work. This imposition will fall hardest on the poor post-graduate student, not the wealthy post-graduate student. It will do so because of the tax deduction legislation in place under this Government. A businessman on $25,000 to $30,000 a year may decide that he will advance his bachelor of economics by doing a master of business administration degree. There are many people doing that. They will at least be able to argue before the Taxation Commissioner that this is a tax deduction. So for such a person the $1,000 will be more in the order of $500 in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> If on the other hand a woman on a supporting mother's benefit has completed a B.A. honours or B.Psych. honours and wishes to advance to Master of Psychology in order to be able to work in a clinic or whatever, in fact to be able to use the undergraduate degree for employment purposes-because a bachelor's degree is not worth a pitcher of warm spit, she will be obliged to meet the full $1,000 for this purpose. There is the possibility of a tax deduction being allowed but the simple fact of the matter is that her earnings for the year from which she must support herself are nowhere near the realm where a tax deduction would mean anything. So this legislation is an act of discrimination against the poor post-graduate student in favour of the rich post-graduate student, if honourable members look at it in that light. That is the only question of equity which is involved here. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Fadden also went on to talk about average costs of post-graduate degrees being $5,000. I think that the honourable member for Fadden will find that that is the average cost of an undergraduate degree and that the cost of post-graduate degrees is very different. Indeed it probably would be the case if charges were made across the board at the undergraduate degree level. On $1,000, on average 80 per cent would be provided from government sources and 20 per cent would be picked up from the student. But that is not the case with most post-graduate students. The honourable member for Fadden seemed to denigrate anyone with experience in tertiary education, so I had better declare my qualifications. Before I became a member of parliament I was a card-carrying academic. Anyone who has been in my situation will know that the amount of time that is devoted to looking after masters and Ph.D. students is negligible in comparison with the amount of time devoted to undergraduate students and undergraduate teaching. They are not given lectures; they are not given tutorials. All that is done is that they are seen once a month or so-for that matter we do not mark their essays-for an hour to ensure that their work is going in the right direction. So if we take an academic's time and divide it into his salary and divide the cost of his room or whatever into what a post-graduate student gains from it, we would be very lucky in very many areas of post-graduate degrees to come to a sum of more than $1,000. It may just come to that but the amount would not come to much more than $1,000. So here I suppose the Government can be proud; it has completely achieved in this area the user-pays principle to the very considerable detriment of the poor and to the negligible benefit of the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member has not listened to a word I have said. He should read tomorrow what I have had to say to see the answer to the silly point that he is attempting to make. I turn now to the type of person who will be discriminated against by this legislation. The type of person who, one would think, the Australian Government and the Liberal Party philosophy would want, in an Horatio Alger spirit, to encourage are mature age students, students who come into the education process after years in the work force, after assuming family responsibilities and the responsibility for building the community. They say: 'I have reached a point when I wish to expand my knowledge, perhaps advance my qualifications in the job, perhaps be a more useful member of the community, and I want to go outside to make an effort to do a bit of study'. Those people will be the ones who will suffer under this legislation. This is a more, rather than less, common phenomenon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, I will use examples that have come to me as a result of my having been a card-carrying academic before I came here. I found-most of my academic colleagues commented on this too-that over the last five years an increasing phenomenon in Australian universities has been the bright student first year dropout as opposed to the dull student first year dropout which was the experience of our colleagues as academics when we were younger doing our undergraduate degrees. These people include the student who has to drop out to support his parents; the student who knows that the job market is hard and that a bird in the hand is worth more than a couple in the bush. When they are offered, as they often will be when they have good leaving or matriculation qualifications, a decent job in the civil service, in business or somewhere else, they take it and say: 'Oh well, I have to do this out of necessity. I know that down the line somewhere I am going to be able to pick it up'. I have dealt here with the specifics of this proposal and I do not want to hear again from any honourable members opposite an argument on the generality of this matter, because the generalities of their arguments on the users pay principle are utterly specious when it comes to a consideration of this proposition. </PARA>

I know that the staff of Australian universities cannot fail to consider this view to be offensive. As a person who, until a year ago, had been a member of the staff of the University of Melbourne for 18 years, I find this self-interest accusation to be both offensive and completely untrue. I point out that all universities have established comprehensive administrative procedures in the approval and development of new courses. In many cases it is far more difficult for teachers in a university to satisfy their own academic boards and councils regarding the viability and academic need for a new course than it would be to meet the criteria of the Tertiary Education Commission.

<PARA> In conclusion, I come back to my original point. Education, especially tertiary education, has become a holy cow in this country. People do not attack it or criticise it and, what is much worse, they do not question it. </PARA>
<PARA>I followed that quote with remarks along these lines, when I said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a degree of self-interest in the propositions that are put forward. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, by various interest groups in education. I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not say that that is necessarily reprehensible. It is to be expected to a large extent. But we should subject it to the same sceptical criticism which we use when we examine proposals by industry groups or any other interest groups that put propositions to a government favouring their industry or their interest in some way or another. That needs to be done a little more in the education debates that we have in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>We have propositions put to us by industry groups, by groups interested in defence, by the Services and so on. We do not necessarily accept any of the propositions at face value. We examine them and look for what is legitimate in the arguments. We subject them to sceptical criticism when necessary. I suggest that we should simply do the same when we examine the propositions put to us by various interest groups in the education sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make it abundantly clear that the Government has no intention of reintroducing fees for students undertaking their first degrees. I repeat that: The Government has no intention of re-introducing fees for students undertaking their first degrees. In fact the legislation before the House specifically excludes undergraduates. That point needs to be made, not for the benefit of members on this side of the House-they are aware that this is the case-but, unfortunately, some of the comments that certain members of the Opposition have made here today and outside this chamber would lead people to believe that the Government is intent upon reintroducing fees for undergraduates. I repeat that that is not the intention of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Government has decided to do and what this legislation provides for is a limited reintroduction of fees for students undertaking their second or subsequent degrees or undertaking higher degrees. The Government's view is that, as those students have received their first degree at the cost of the taxpayer, it is fair and reasonable that they should make a contribution towards the cost of their subsequent education. The fees proposed represent a very small percentage of the actual cost. The fees to be charged are $1,000 per annum and the average cost of providing tuition in an Australian university or college of advanced education is about five times that figure. That needs to be borne in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal of emphasis has been placed on the fact that for 1982 the Government is appropriating $1.8 billion for tertiary education in Australia. The point is made by the Opposition that the fees that will be collected as a result of the introduction of this legislation will represent a very small proportion of that total figure. That of course is true. By implication, the Opposition is stating that the figure being appropriated is a very large figure indeed. On other occasions the Opposition, with a forked tongue, tries to make out and to convince the public that the Commonwealth has cut the funding of tertiary education in Australia. I repeat that the total amount being appropriated for 1982 is slightly in excess of what was appropriated for 1981. However, I concede that there has been some movement in funding within the tertiary sector and between parts of it: Some areas have benefited greatly by increases and others have suffered minor decreases. However, overall, the amount of money being appropriated by this legislation is slightly more in real terms than has been made available to universities, colleges of advanced education and technical and further education institutions during the current year. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish also to make reference to remarks that have been made by honourable members opposite concerning statements that I made towards the end of last year. I want to make it clear that I received correspondence from a large number of people and questions were put to me on various occasions. I said on all occasions that the Government had no proposals before it at that time in relation to the introduction of tertiary education fees. That was the position at the time I answered the correspondence and the various questions put to me. It is a matter of history and a matter of fact that, more recently, in the context of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, this matter did come up for re-examination. The Government made two decisions: First, that there would be no fees for undergraduates and, secondly, that fees would be charged to people undertaking their second or higher degree. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak about the implications of amalgamation for some tertiary institutions in the State of Victoria. The Australian Labor Party has not opposed amalgamations in every case, and certainly strong cases can be made for merging some institutions. Some of the institutions that have amalgamated seem to be happy with the outcome. The association of the Caulfield Institute of Technology and the State College of Victoria at Frankston seems to be working out well enough. I draw the attention of the spellbound Committee to three proposed amalgamations in Victoria which I oppose-the Institute of Early Childhood Development in Kew, the State College of Victoria, Hawthorn, and the State College of Victoria, Melbourne. I do not want to detain the Committee unduly. There is an excellent explanation of the case of the Institute of Early Childhood Development in the Australian for 9 October 1981 in an article by Brian Hill entitled 'Axe over Pre-School Training'. I seek leave to incorporate this in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> In Asia there is a proverb: when the tiger and the buffalo fight, its the grass that gets trampled. </PARA>
<PARA> This sadly, seems to be the fate of Victoria's Institute of Early Childhood Development-an independent college founded more than 60 years ago and now in danger of closing because of the competing interests of other larger colleges and the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Melbourne-based institute does more than just train kindergarten teachers for Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Its graduates are employed in hospitals, day nurseries, toy libraries, family day care centres, local government . . . in fact, in any situation which requiries a specialised knowledge of the individual development of pre-school toddlers. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, however, the Federal Education Minister, Mr Fife, advised the Victorian branch of the Australian Pre-School Association that unless he received 'acceptable proposals' in the near future for the amalgamation of the institute with some other tertiary institution Commonwealth funding for the institute would cease from the beginning of 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth, naturally enough, wants to prune government expenditure as far as possible and get what it considers the best value for money. And in the 1980s there is no shortage of carnivorous, competing tertiary colleges just itching to extend their range of courses and so attract more students, staff and federal funds. </PARA>
<PARA> But according to Mrs Agnes Farrance, honorary secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Pre-school Association, it is the institute and the quality of pre-school teacher training which will be trampled underfoot if any such 'amalgamation' takes place. </PARA>
<PARA> The State Education Minister, Mr Hunt, agrees. He has taken up the case with Mr Fife, and discussions on the institute's future are continuing. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The institute's present strength lies in the fact that it is a specialist organisation,' Mr Hunt said recently. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Because of this, it is the only advanced college in Australia which is able to offer post-graduate studies and qualifications in that field. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Its student per capita cost is comparable with that of other institutions, and no savings in this regard could be anticipated from merger with another institution.'</PARA>
<PARA> The association, meanwhile, has made a formal submission to Mr Fife, urging the Commonwealth to 'retain and maintain the institute as an autonomous, independent institution for the professional preparation of personnel for the early childhood field and the continuing developing of their work in the community'. </PARA>
<PARA> It has argued that where colleges in Australia, Britain and the United States have been forced to amalgamate with large institutions, 'experience shows how rapidly the early childhood field disintegrates'. </PARA>
<PARA> The association says there is overwhelming evidence from all three countries that, following amalgamations, early childhood courses become watered down until they can no longer provide adequate preparation for the work with young children and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> The deterioration of courses is apparently related to staff redundancy problems, which the larger institutions here and overseas have attempted to solve at the expense of the early childhood section. </PARA>
<PARA> Following amalgamations, the association claims, the early childhood departments become such a small part of the bigger institutions that they do not have a strong enough voice in administration to maintain the quality of their staffing and courses. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Farrance said: 'The pattern everywhere has been for specialist early childhood staff to be lost and to replaced by redundant tenured staff from other areas with no background of either a practical or an applied nature in the area of early childhood. </PARA>
<PARA>DIFFICULT</PARA>
<PARA> 'There is now a move in Britain and the US to re-establish or strengthen centres for early childhood studies, and it is proving to be a difficult and costly exercise to rebuild what has been lost. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Specialists with an early childhood orientation, once dispersed, are not easily brought together again.'</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Freda Briggs, dean of the De Lissa Institute of Early Childhood Studies at the Hartley College of Advanced Education, South Australa, says there are more than 500 early childhood students at Hartley but only one tenured member of staff with a child development background. </PARA>
<PARA> She said: 'The present contract staff in child development will go at the end of the year, and the child development course will be staffed from other areas where there is staff redundancy-e.g. geography.'</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hunt describes as 'spurious and appalling' the reason offered by Commonwealth authorities for their demand that the Institute of Early Childhood Development be merged. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason, Mr Hunt says, is that Victoria is the only State where early childhood education continues to be offered in a single-purpose institution. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The Victorian Government is co-operating with the Commonwealth in bringing about the merger of tertiary institutions where valid education, administrative or financial reasons are shown. </PARA>
<PARA> 'It does not, however, accept the concept of amalgamation for the sake of amalgamation, or the view that bigger is necessarily better.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The article states that the IECD:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . does more than just train kindergarten teachers for Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Its graduates are employed in hospitals, day nurseries, toy libraries, family day care centres, local government . . . in fact, in any institution which requires a specialised knowledge of the individual development of pre-school toddlers. </PARA>
<PARA>No other institution in the Victorian education system provides quite that kind of service. It is foolish to say to IECD: 'Well, you must undergo a forced amalgamation, willy nilly, with some other institution, irrespective of whether it covers your area or not'. I very rarely agree with the Victorian Minister for Education, the Honourable Alan Hunt, but he is correct when he describes as 'spurious and appalling' the reason offered by Commonwealth authorities for their demand that the IECD be merged. As he says, Victoria is the only State where early childhood education continues to be offered in a single-purpose institution. </PARA>
<PARA> The second case I want to refer to is that of SCV Hawthorn, which also has unique features. These were referred to last night by the honourable member for Casey, and I agree with every word he said. SCV Hawthorn reflects the fact that in Victoria, unlike the other States, there is a separate stream of technical education within the secondary system. Rightly or wrongly, Victoria retains that separation. The other thing that is important about SCV Hawthorn is that, unlike many of the students in SCV who go straight from school into another form of school and then go on to a third form of school for their professional lives, there has been a very heavy emphasis at SCV Hawthorn on training people who have come in from industry. A typical student at SCV Hawthorn is the person who has been a tradesman, who acquires a trade skill, then wants to go into teaching, and has to acquire certain teaching skills in a professional disciplined way at that institution. No other institution in Victoria has that kind of intake. It is difficult to say: 'You will be forced in with another institution, whether you like it or not'. I think it is quite unfair. </PARA>
<PARA> The third example I want to mention is that of SCV Melbourne. It is really a very old institution, physically located next to Melbourne University. It has a long and excellent tradition. It has been particularly strong in the humanities and in the visual arts. A lot of very distinguished people have taught there, including the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous). SCV Melbourne has been told that it simply must amalgamate with some other entity. The entities suggested are either the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology or Melbourne University, which is next door to the Footscray Institute of Technology. Contrary to the adage about not looking a gift horse in the mouth, the prospective hosts have expressed a certain lack of enthusiasm unless the Victorian Institute of Post-Secondary Education-known to all who love it as VIPSEC-agrees to keep up the numbers. Unless VIPSEC keeps up the numbers in these institutions economically it will impose some hardship on the host institution to take over SCV Melbourne. I am particularly concerned about SCV Melbourne because it is one of only two institutions which provide tertiary education places for my electorate. My electorate, and the whole of the west of Melbourne, are extraordinarily badly served so far as access to--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr Dawkins</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is superbly represented, but not very well represented in tertiary institutions. If we look at all the western suburbs of Melbourne, there is a total population of 520,000, which is 26 per cent more than the total population of Tasmania. We have an atypically high proportion of young people there because the demographic pattern in the western suburbs differs from the rest of the metropolitan area. The total number of people engaged in tertiary education is only 3 per cent of the total enrolment in the metropolitan area. Over 20 per cent of the total population of young people is in Melbourne's west but they comprise only 3 per cent of the total enrolments. The difficulty is that once we say: 'That is all right, you can always get on a bus, you can always get a car, you can always go out to Preston, you can go out to some other eastern suburbs institution, or you can drive down to Frankston', it becomes unrealistic. It becomes one more practical disincentive to people from the west undertaking tertiary education. It underlines the difficulty faced by my electorate. Frankly, I would like to see the Melbourne Institute merged, if it has to merge, with the Footscray Institute. The Footscray Institute already takes the great bulk of people from my electorate who undertake tertiary education. There are significant numbers from the west in SCV Melbourne. If SCV Melbourne is forced to move and if the intake from the west is significantly reduced, this will cause great hardship in my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to take up something that was raised earlier by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron). He has a totally unrealistic view of what post-graduate work is all about. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Mildren" NAMEID="AI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AI4">Mr Mildren</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Understandably.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, perhaps understandably. But he really seems to take the view that people undertaking post-graduate work are engaged in some wild frolic of their own; that they are merely doing it for vanity; or that they simply go on to do a Ph.D for kicks. He does not recognise that a very significant proportion of Australia's total input in research and development, not only in the areas of science and technology but in the humanities as well, comes from post-graduate students. We are concerned that in many areas the imposition of fees simply constitutes a quite significant economic disincentive to people going on with their post-graduate work. I have referred before to the case of engineers. I mention it again, I hope for the last time. It is not so much the fee itself but the alternative offers which are made to students. For example, an engineering student with a first class honours primary degree may have the alternative of going on and doing a second research degree and relying on the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme or of simply taking up a job offer from a firm. The firm would say: 'Do not be foolish. Why do your second degree now? We will offer you a job straight-out at $15,000 or $16,000 a year. Then you can get married and do your research degree later on'. That deferred opportunity may never be taken up. That is the real problem. In a highly commercial world we tend to evaluate what we do purely by looking at the money incentives offered. A company offers a young fellow $15,000 or $16,000 and he says: 'How will I survive on TEAS?' Somebody else says: 'Do not forget you will have to pay your university fees as well'. He may well say: 'I will give it up. It is just not worth persisting with. I will take the offer that is made by private industry'. That is the real difficulty. That is why I think the contribution of the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron)-whose contributions are generally well thought out and provocative, but also profound-was unfortunate. In this case he completely missed the bus.</PARA></TALK.START>

Clause 5 is the clause which, together with clause 6, gives the governing body of the Australian National University the power to collect fees in respect of certain students indicated to the institutions by the Minister for Education and at a level indicated by the Minister. For all the reasons that have been outlined during the recent debate the Opposition is opposed to the proposition that the ANU have the power to collect fees. That power was taken away from it when fees were abolished by the last Labor Government. We are opposed to the idea that the institution now have restored the power to collect fees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill and the Non-government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Amendment Bill. I indicate from the outset that the Opposition will not be opposing the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill as it is that legislation which provides for the implementation of the program of Commonwealth support for government and non-government schools throughout Australia. However, we will be moving an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill drawing attention to what the Opposition considers to be the serious shortcomings of the Government's policies as implemented by this legislation. The Opposition will be opposing clause 3 of the Non-government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Bill for reasons which I will outline later in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The policy of the Government in relation to the funding of schools is clearly in tatters. The Government had had to retreat from a number of areas, most obviously in relation to the School to Work Transition Program. The Government indicated in the guideline statement made by the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) in June of this year that it intended a certain amount of the recurrent funds available to the States for the purpose of supporting schools to be earmarked for the School to Work Transition Program. The Government intended that if the State governments were unable to demonstrate that they had made an increased contribution to the Commonwealth inspired School to Work Transition Program, the Commonwealth would use some of the earmarked money to support that program during 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government earmarked also the capital funds available for expenditure on schools and similarly indicated that unless the State governments came to the party and met the Commonwealth's wishes in terms of their contributions to the School to Work Transition Program, again the Government would insist that part of the capital available under the Schools Commission's program would be directed towards the expansion of the transition program. This met with an enormous amount of opposition from State Ministers. They unanimously opposed this new departure in terms of the funding of schools. They not only opposed the mechanism that was being used and the interference that they thought it implied for the proper undertaking of their education programs but also objected to the program which the Government was seeking to force upon them. Many of the States, if not all of them, have their own transition programs, and they welcomed the Commonwealth's extra involvement in and contribution to this educational activity. But they objected to being put in the position of having to take money away from the normal running costs and the normal capital program of their schools simply to satisfy the whims of the Commonwealth in this regard. In the event, the Commonwealth caved in in relation to the earmarking of capital a few weeks ago after a meeting between the Commonwealth Minister for Education and the State Ministers for Education. Only a few days ago when introducing this legislation the Government announced that it also had caved in in respect of recurrent funding. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to go back to a debate which we had in this House, a matter which was initiated by the Opposition. I drew attention to the folly of the Government proceeding in this particular way. We note the remarks of the minister at that time. Then, within days in relation to the capital proposition and within weeks in relation to the recurrent proposition, we saw the minister being forced to do a complete back-flip in relation to the transition program. He was forced to withdraw the earmarking propositon. He was forced to withdraw his threats to the States that unless they contributed to this program, he would in fact be expropriating money normally designed-certainly in the view of the Schools Commission- to support the ongoing activities and the ongoing capital expansion of schools simply to the Commonwealth School to Work Transition Program. </PARA>
<PARA> The important thing about this whole development is that the School to Work Transition Program has become the centrepiece of this Government's educational policy as it relates to schools. This was part of the obsession of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in relation to the problems which he saw in schools throughout Australia. He was preoccupied with the notion that schools, and schools alone apparently in his view, have been responsible for the appalling levels of youth unemployment in this country. He reckoned that the reason why so many kids, when they left school, spent such a long time on the dole unable to get work was that the schools had inadequately prepared them for work. He quite selectively and, in many cases, dishonestly drew on the earlier report of the Schools Commission relating to the schooling of 15 and 16-year-olds. Similarly he drew on the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training and that Committee's reference to the low level of school leavers' skills in reading and number work. But the Prime Minister completely omitted to take account of the other things the Schools Commission was saying in relation to 15 and 16-year-olds, and certainly failed to take account of some very important facts. As a result, however unacceptable the position is in relation to the skills of school leavers, the Prime Minister's prescription, as usual, was and still is totally counter-productive. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Prime Minister overlooked is that the innumeracy and illiteracy of school leavers is not a new phenomenon. It has been with us for as long as we have had school leavers. Of course it is unacceptable and of course something has to be done about it, but he also overlooked that the position has been greatly improving. The levels of literacy and numeracy of school leavers and, indeed, of kids still at school have been gradually improving over a long period. The most recent evidence of this comes from the report of the Australian Council for Educational Research, which the Government has quoted so fulsomely recently. That report sought to measure the improvement in reading and number skills of students of a particular age group over a number of years. Although we have to accept some of the methodological problems involved in that study and the fact that the results of that study have not been universally accepted, certainly that study reveals that there has been a very significant improvement in relation to these problems of illiteracy and innumeracy amongst kids at Australian secondary schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, because of his continual abuse of the school system and because of his continual preoccupation with pointing to what he believes to be the failings of the schools, has managed to encourage more and more kids to leave school earlier and earlier. We have seen in recent years a reversal of the long term trend of children staying at school for longer and longer periods. The dropout rate is on the increase, and that is due very largely to the fact that the Prime Minister and others have been waging a war against schools, downgrading schools and questioning their capacity to perform effectively and to deliver the sort of education which children require today. Not only are kids leaving school earlier and earlier, younger and younger, but as well as that fewer and fewer of those who go on to complete their secondary education are going into the tertiary sector. This is a matter of great alarm, and it is a matter which the Prime Minister has a great deal to answer for because there is really no evidence to support the sorts of accusations and the sort of assault he has been waging on the education system of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, having viewed what he considered to be the particular inadequacies of the school system, landed upon this terribly ill-defined and ill-considered School to Work Transition Program. Nobody really knew what was involved in it. To the extent that the scheme has been successful-I have been happy to acknowledge that in some areas the scheme has been successful-it has been because of the imagination and the initiative of teachers at the local level being able to make something out of it. One could not make anything out of the statements of the Ministers who announced this scheme because it was really so vague and so imprecise that it really required an enormous amount of work and initiative at the school level to make it work in any way decently. However, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education tried to dragoon the States into joining that scheme, but in the event the Government had no supporters in this regard. The Minister used to point time and again to the lavish praise heaped on the transition program by the State Ministers, but none of the State Ministers was prepared to put his money where his praise was-at least his praise as reported by the Commonwealth Minister for Education. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we have opposed the way in which the Government has tried to impose this scheme on the States. The State Ministers of all political parties have opposed it as well. Indeed, the minority report of the Schools Commission signed by two of the Schools Commissioners specifically drew attention to the transition program and its inadequacies, not only in itself but also in the way in which the imposition of the program on the States meant that standards in schools would decline as State governments had to withdraw funds from the normal activities of schools in order to put them into this particular transition education program. I think it is a great credit to those two School Commissioners that they had the foresight to stand up and to report to the Government on what they considered to be the inadequacies and the problems involved in this program. I am delighted to see that they have been proved correct by the subsequent action of the Government. I might say that it brings no credit to the other members of the Schools Commission who heaped enormous abuse on those two Schools Commissioners when they said they were going to produce a minority report. It points up the unnecessary timidity of the Commission these days particularly in relation to its volume 2 report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission knows what the defects are and what the problems besetting education in this country are. But the volume 2 report of the Schools Commission was simply a lame and uncritical response to the Government's guidelines. It is a pity that the Schools Commission could not have been even as adventurous as the Tertiary Education Commission, although I have had enough to say about the Tertiary Education Commission to indicate that I think it has collaborated far too enthusiastically with some of the worst aspects of the Government's tertiary education policy. The Schools Commission, to give it credit, has been very much more forceful on earlier occasions in drawing attention to the shortcomings of this sort of approach to the problems of school leavers. I will quote briefly from the March report of the Schools Commission for this triennium. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Again, it is often claimed, particularly by employers, that young school leavers lack the personal qualities and basic skills which confer employability and that if only the schools would do their part in correcting these deficiencies the problem of youth unemployment would diminish. The Commission rejects this argument and maintains that while it is true that a number of young school leavers do lack confidence, initiative and motivation and do need to improve basic skills, there are many adequately prepared young people who want jobs and are unable to get them. </PARA>
<PARA>Referring to the Williams Committee, the report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Williams . . . found that the least schooled and skilled among early school leavers experienced most unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Schools Commission in its earlier report quite clearly rejected the proposition of the Government in this regard. It is a pity that the Government took so long to take notice of what the Schools Commission said. It took notice only when it was forced to do so because of the rejection and confrontation with which the Commonwealth Minister for Education was faced when he met his State counterparts some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA> What has to be remembered is that this campaign of abuse by the Prime Minister against schools and the teachers in them has created and continues to create very great damage in our education system. It has to be remembered that teachers are involved in activity which requires their wholehearted commitment. Most teachers have a very great commitment to what they are doing. They are not interested in it simply as a job. They are deeply concerned about what they are doing and the sort of education they are providing for the children who are in their care. All that is likely as a result of the Prime Minister's continual attacks is that they will become less committed and more uninterested. Teaching for them will become just a job. It is high time everybody in this community recognised the very great contribution that teachers are making and the very great dedication of the overwhelming majority of them and supported them in their difficult task, which is not made any easier by the failure of this Government adequately to support their activities, particularly in government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to a particular problem which has been confronted by the Schools Commission over a number of years in its duties in making recommendations to the Government in relation to the funding of schools. Section 13 of the Schools Commission Act, which sets out the functions of the Commission, includes two paragraphs which make the job of the Commission extremely difficult. The Schools Commission is told that it should have regard to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the primary obligation, in relation to education, for governments to provide and maintain government school systems that are of the highest standard and are open, without fees or religious tests, to all children. </PARA>
<PARA>To make the job more difficult, the section states that the Commission should also have regard to:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the prior right of parents to choose whether their children are educated at a government school or at a non-government school. </PARA>
<PARA>The net effect of this section of the Act as it stands is to direct the Commission to consider the needs of government and non-government schools equally and to recognise that, whilst governments have a primary obligation to government schools, the Commission must do nothing to jeopardise the position of non-government schools. In short, the primary obligation to government schools has to be balanced against the Commission's duty towards non-government schools. As I have said, the section directs the Commission to have regard to the primary obligation of governments to government schools in the exercise of its functions. There is no doubt that the Commission has followed this direction since its establishment. In its first report this was expressed most obviously in its endorsement of the Karmel targets and in its concern that States maintain real expenditure on schools and not use Commonwealth grants as a substitute for State effort. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977 the Commission objected to the transfer of grants from the government to the non-government sector and urged the Commonwealth Government to reconsider the policy guidelines which led to this situation. The Commission's principal concern was that the subsidy scheme for non-government schools, coupled with a ceiling on total Commonwealth grants, would lead to continuing transfers of funds from government to non-government schools. The Commission addressed this question again in its report for the 1979-81 triennium when it referred to the 'undesirability of a future involving continued transfer of Commonwealth funds from government to non-government schools.' The Commission's answer was to recommend that the Commonwealth general recurrent grants to government schools should not fall below a fixed percentage of the standard running costs of government schools. In relation to non-government schools, the Commission pointed to the need to relate subsidies to a stable cost base rather than link them directly to government school running costs. It also considered that there was a need to set an agreed level of Commonwealth, State and private contributions to non-government schools. These measures, combined with a non-reducible Commonwealth contribution to government schools, would stabilise funding for both sectors and reduce the possibility of the transfer of funds from non-government to government schools. The government did not accept the Commission's recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report for 1980 the Commission again dealt with this matter. It pointed to the significant way in which the Commonwealth's role in school funding is changing. It showed a decline of 14 per cent in total allocations to the government schools in 1980 compared with 1976, a rise of 24 per cent in payments to non-government schools, and a fall of 12 per cent in programs shared by government and non-government schools. The Commission believed that these trends were a cause for concern. They arose from the need to accommodate rising payments to non-government schools, which was a consequence of rising State inputs into government schools to whose costs non-government school subsidies were linked, within total Commonwealth payments which had not been rising fast enough to cover the extra costs or which, in 1980, were declining. In consequence, the improvement of non-government schools shaped the allocation of funds, bringing a decline in Commonwealth funding to government schools and to special purpose programs, leaving the Commission no flexibility to respond to newly arising needs. The Commission repeated its recommendation for a minimum Commonwealth contribution to government schools, expressed either as a percentage of standard costs or in a set amount of dollars indexed for price changes per government school student. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission revived these arguments in its most recent triennial report, with some modifications. It urged that government and non-government recurrent grants be linked to a standard cost per student. The standard cost is determined by assembling a number of baskets of services. These baskets are configurations of services which might be chosen to meet the needs of particular schools. Each component of a basket is costed and a total per student amount derived. The Commission did not advocate that schools adopt any particular basket. Rather, it provided a number of examples of baskets which all have the same average cost per student. This cost is what the Commission considered to be both a desirable and realistic level of school resource standards. The Commission considered that if growth patterns in real levels of State expenditure continued and if the Commonwealth maintained its real contribution to government schools, government school systems should attain the weighted average standard cost per student in the 1982-84 triennium. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has recommended that the Commonwealth contribute a fixed percentage of the standard costs of government schools. It has applied the 1978-79 proportion of Commonwealth expenditure on government schools in the States, that is, 6.7 per cent, to its basket of services standard costs. In effect, this means an increase of $7m, or 3 per cent, in general recurrent grants for government schools in 1981. Under this proposal the total amount of recurrent grants for government schools will vary with enrolments as the standard cost is expressed in dollars per student but the real level of Commonwealth expenditure per student will be maintained. For capital grants for government schools the Commission has recommended that the Commonwealth increase its grants by 10 per cent per annum for the 1982-84 triennium. It considers this necessary to overcome the large backlog of capital works needed in government schools. It considers the shortfall in capital works that occurred during the 1979-81 triennium to be unacceptably high. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from the Commission's past and present recommendations that it has maintained its commitment to government schools. It has increasingly sought to attain and maintain higher resource standards in government schools. It has urged the Commonwealth Government to reconsider policies which have resulted in a transfer of funds from government to non-government schools. It has attempted to prevent this from occurring in the future by proposing a fixed basis for Commonealth general recurrent grants for government schools. However, it is clear that the Government has repudiated its commitment to government schools by reducing Commonwealth grants for these schools while increasing those for non-government schools. The Government has refused also to accept the Commission's recommendations which have sought to stabilise the funding of government schools. The Government has always responded to this by saying that it is no longer necessary for it to increase continually the funding for government schools because on average government schools have achieved the targets set by the Karmel Committee. The Government conveniently overlooks that the Karmel Committee considered that its targets were the 'minimum acceptable degree of improvement' necessary to overcome 'in a reasonably short period the worst schooling deficiencies'. Therefore, the achievement of the Karmel targets by government systems does not indicate that there is no room for further improvement or that such improvement is not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Commission is really concerned about is the transfer of funds from the government to the non-government sector under circumstances where there is not an increasing overall education budget for schools. The Commission's past opposition to transfers and its recommendations for a non-reducible Commonwealth recurrent contribution to government schools is evidence of its support for this view. Equally, the Government's non-acceptance of such recommendations in the past indicates that it is unwilling to rule out further transfers in the future. Since 1976 there has been a substantial shift in Commonwealth funds from the government to the non-government sector. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table which sets out this change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make it perfectly clear that the Opposition has absolutely no objection to the increase in recurrent grants for non-government schools. In most cases this can be justified on the basis of needs. What we are concerned about is the way in which the increase in non-government school funding has taken place at the expense of the government school sector. One might make the point also that in relation to the increasing support for non-government schools the greatest increase in the subsidies has been in respect of those schools which are already best off, those schools which already have the best resources. The point we are trying to make is that the Government has a bias towards non-government schools and this is working very much against the interests of government schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we are talking of non-government schools and when we are talking about Karmel targets it has to be recognised that many of the non-government schools have resources far and away in excess of those of government schools. That must be taken into account whenever the Government claims that its policies are justified by the fact that the government schools have, in its view, reached the Karmel targets. Most of the non-government schools, of course, have not reached those targets. This is very largely a deliberate decision taken by the non-government school systems. They have decided that it is more important for them to increase the number of schools-this goes particularly for the Catholic system; I do not cavil at it-than it is to increase the quality of their existing schools. That is a decision that they are entitled to make. But the Government should not use that as a justification for the transfer of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government boasts that it has maintained the recurrent funds for government schools. It says that this is particularly admirable at a time when there has been a slight fall in enrolments in respect of government schools. What one has to recognise is that a slight fall in enrolments does not lead to a reduction in the costs of those schools. Just because one or two classes lose one or two students does not mean that we can withdraw teachers from schools. After all, that is the main way in which money is expended in schools. The other point which must be emphasised is that the Government has deliberately decided to reduce by $6m the capital funding available for government schools at a time when, in the Commission's words, there is a huge backlog of capital work required in those schools. </PARA>
<PARA> I very quickly refer to the Non-government Schools (Loan Guarantee) Amendment Bill and indicate again that we will oppose clause 3 of this Bill. This Bill intends to extend the provisions of the loan guarantee not only to existing schools-we have no objection to that-but to new schools. This is the new departure which we object to. What the proposal involves is that where groups of parents or groups in the community are too small to go themselves to a lending authority for funds or where they have no assets to provide the collateral for those loans the Government now will have the power to give those schools access to these guarantees so that they can get the loans that they need to establish schools. We have no objection to the fact that the Bill intends to extend the guarantee to interest payments as well as principal payments but we object, as I said, to the way in which this change will provide a direct encouragement to small groups of people in the community to set up schools without any planning, and without any necessity to refer to any adequate registration system. This is the main point. The Commonwealth has no control over the standards of those schools. The State governments, as has been indicated quite clearly, particularly by the Victorian Minister of Education-I understand that this is being discussed, perhaps even today, at the meeting of the Australian Education Council-face the problem of determining what is an appropriate standard for new non-government schools. I will have a little more to say when we get to the Committee stage of that Bill. I now formally move the second reading amendment to the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill which has been circulated in my name. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek to confine my remarks on this package of education Bills to the States Grant (Schools Assistance) Bill. The overall value of the Schools Commission's recommendations for 1982 is $1,008.1m, which in real terms is a 4.6 per cent increase over expenditure in the previous year. These recommendations were included in the Schools Commission report tabled in this House on 27 August 1981 and are in accord with the Government's guidelines. Attention has been drawn to the two members of the Schools Commission who issued a minority report disagreeing with some recommendations. They did this for two reasons: Firstly, they were concerned at the divisive effects of the expansion of non-government schools-I note the same concern and will broaden this issue later-and secondly, they felt that there would be a reduction in services provided to students in government schools. I disagree with the latter view, believing that it does not accurately reflect or understand the Commonwealth's funding role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the major aspects of this legislation. General recurrent grants to non-government schools have been increased in accordance with movements in the government schools' standard costs and also to accord with the Government's election commitment to compress the present six subsidy levels to three funding groups. Group 1, replacing levels 1 to 3, will receive per capita rates of 20 per cent of government school standard costs; group 2, replacing levels 4 to 5, will receive 30 per cent; and group 3, replacing level 6, will receive 38 per cent. Group 3 schools will receive 40 per cent of government school standard costs in 1983. The Government has announced also several changes to the procedures for assessing non-government school subsidies. These include changes in the ranges of expenditure from private sources and the consideration of schools' disposable income. It was announced also that the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) will allow schools disadvantaged by these changes in expenditure ranges to remain at a higher subsidy level for up to two years until they adapt their resources to the new arrangements. The Government will review any cases in which this is not achieved within two years. </PARA>
<PARA> New non-systemic schools, formerly assisted during their initial years of establishment by being categorised to levels 6, 5, 4 and 3 in the first, second, third and fourth years of their existence respectively, will, under the new arrangements, receive additional subsidies at the rate of 10 per cent, 7.5 per cent, 5 per cent and 2.5 per cent of average government schools standard costs respectively in each of their first four years of operation. General recurrent grants for government schools have been retained at their existing real levels, despite the fact that government school enrolments in 1982 are expected to continue the downward trend which became evident after 1977. In continuing to maintain this program at previous levels, the Government has in effect slightly increased the real per student allocation in government schools. Expenditure per student on recurrent resources in government schools has long since exceeded the expenditure targets set by the Karmel Committee in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> There are six points, I believe, to be made in relation to the current debate on the education appropriations. Firstly, a false impression of education funding arrangements is deliberately being created by the Opposition by omitting reference to the major responsibility of the State governments. Secondly, apart from direct grants for education, the Commonwealth, through untied revenue sharing grants, provides the States with a capacity to make additional funds available from their own resources for education. Thirdly, the Commonwealth Government's policy is aimed at supporting both government and non-government education sectors. In the case of government schools the Commonwealth tops up the contribution of the States which have the primary financial and constitutional responsibility. In the case of non-government schools, the Commonealth is the major source of government financial assistance as a supplement to private effort. Fourthly, when State contributions are taken into account, government schools with 78 per cent of enrolments receive 89 per cent of government education funding while non-government schools with 22 per cent of enrolments receive 11 per cent of government education funds. </PARA>
<PARA> My fifth point is that resource levels in most non-government schools are approximately 30 per cent below those of the average government schools. The sixth point I wish to make-I believe the situation has been grossly misrepresented in this debate-is that in recent years the New South Wales Government has chosen to transfer some $30.5m of funds provided by the Commonwealth for schools building purposes to other education uses. It is of primary importance to realise the limited role of the Commonwealth Government in school education in topping up the allocation of the States which have the primary and, indeed, the constitutional responsibility for school funding. As I mentioned before, in this connection State governments currently provide some 89 per cent of total public funds available to the government school sector. The Commonwealth Government's contribution represents the remaining 11 per cent of government school funding. On the latest available figures, State governments, on a national basis, provide some $3,611m for government schools with the Commonwealth providing the remaining $445m. Most of us are aware that State governments contribute up to 50 per cent, and in one or two cases more than 50 per cent, of their annual budgets towards education. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear, therefore, that parents are being misled by education funding statistics which deliberately omit the largest contribution to government schools, that of the State governments. The allocation of total government school education funding between the government and non-government sectors does not favour the non-government sector as has been implied. Overall, an average of $1,790 is spent on each government school student each year by the Commonwealth and State governments and an average of $770 on each non-government school student. It must also be remembered in comparing funding of government and non-government schools, that the Commonwealth Government is the main source of government funding for the non-government school sector. Indeed, most non-government schools have recurrent resource levels about 30 per cent below those of the average government school. It is this gap which has been a prime factor in the decisions of successive Commonwealth governments to increase recurrent grants to non-government schools, but not at the expense of government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned at the expansion of new non-government schools, particularly in some of our smaller towns and communities where divisions do result and available education funds are not effectively deployed. However, the Commonwealth Government is committed to a policy of freedom of choice and equality of opportunity in education for all Australian children. It seeks to pursue this objective by providing resources for both government and non-government schools. Instead of criticising the Federal Government for these policies, the Opposition and some of our wider school communities would be better advised to isolate the reasons why there is, in some cases, a significant desire by parents to place their children in independent schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of Commonwealth funding in supplementing the major role of the States in the government school sector has been a demonstrable improvement in the resource standards in government schools in recent years. At this point it should be emphasised that the current extent of Commonwealth assistance at the school level is a relatively recent development, having been initiated only within the past decade. Studies by the Schools Commission indicate that all government school systems have generally reached ahead of schedule, and in many cases exceeded, the resource targets which were set in 1973. Some 80 per cent of non-government schools, on the other hand, are well below those resource targets and the level of Commonwealth Government assistance in this sector is designed to improve their lagging resource standards. The Commonwealth makes no secret of the fact that it is providing a significant contribution to assisting the non-government school sector. However, the amount of assistance to this sector in running costs is estimated as a percentage of the average cost of educating students in a government school. Therefore, as the cost to governments of educating government school students rises, so too does the amount paid to non-government schools which is limited on a percentage basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the opportunity should be taken to make a further point in relation to the grossly misleading statements made over a period of months concerning the effect of Commonwealth funding on State education capital building programs. As with recurrent funding, the Commonwealth Government makes a contribution to State capital programs which again remain substantially a State funding responsibility. To date the Commonwealth has permitted State governments to transfer between the two categories of grants-capital and recurrent-they receive from the Commonwealth. This has enabled States to vary the allocation of Commonwealth funds they receive to suit their particular needs. For several years the New South Wales Government has chosen to transfer substantial amounts of Commonwealth funds from allocations for capital works to recurrent purposes which includes general running expenses. Indeed, since 1977, the New South Wales Government has transferred some $30.5m of Commonwealth funds in this way. Yet the New South Wales Government has sought to criticise the Commonwealth for providing insufficient funds. This criticism is even less defensible when noting New South Wales Government Budget figures which indicate a decline in capital expenditure on government schools by the State Government from $143.6m in 1978-79 to $113.5m in 1980-81. I think this indicates the hypocrisy of the New South Wales Government in its criticism of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is therefore a partner with the States in education funding. Apart from direct Commonwealth funding, to which reference has been made already, it must be remembered that the capacity of the States to provide additional funds from their own resources has been increased by the Commonwealth through revenue sharing grants to the States. Through this additional form of untied grant, State governments have the capacity to determine their own priorities of expenditure and further increase expenditure on education. In November 1979, the Commonwealth introduced the School to Work Transition Program for young people aged from 15 to 19 years who were regarded as being at risk in the transition from school to work. The Commonwealth undertook to provide a total of $150m in real terms for the program over 5 years from 1980 and asked the States to match this expenditure dollar for dollar for government schools and technical and further education colleges from 1982 onwards. This was designed to provide a total effort costing $250m over a five-year period. The program commenced in 1980 and the Commonwealth agreed to continue it in 1981 without a State contribution for that year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government did indicate that because the States had not at that time indicated their readiness to make additional contributions to match the Commonwealth's expenditure in 1982 it felt compelled to take special action to increase significantly the resources devoted to transition activities. We therefore proposed to earmark up to $27m within the Commonwealth general recurrent grants to the States for government schools for expenditure on transition education. From that sum grants at the rate of $10 per pupil were to be provided to each government secondary school. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just wait for a moment. We also proposed to earmark about $19m of government schools capital funds for equipment facilities for transition education. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) has questioned the Commonwealth's right to request this of the States. I thought it was the Commonwealth's responsibility and its role in education to attempt to meet particular needs in schools in our communities and to ensure that those deficiences and inequalities in the State systems were removed. It is therefore important and significant I believe, and it justifies the Commonwealth Government's action, that following consultations with the States since 4 June they have, in general, agreed to increase their recurrent expenditure on transition programs in schools over the base year 1979-80 by amounts which approximate and in some cases exceed the amounts proposed to be earmarked. Therefore the Commonwealth no longer needs to proceed with the recurrent earmarking since its principal objective has been met. The Commonwealth Government will expect the States to continue their increased effort in transition programs and will seek the provision of information on a continuing basis to monitor progress in this effort. The Commonwealth hopes that in appropriate circumstances the States will arrange for school communities to participate in the development of transition programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are other major changes in this Bill which involve joint programs for both government and non-government schools. These include the widening of provisions relating to multicultural education to include projects involving instruction in Aboriginal language and culture which are to be eligible for funding. They also include revised provisions for programs of education for severly handicapped students to enable them to participate in educational activities outside the institution or private home in which they normally require constant care. </PARA>
<PARA> Other initiatives that I will speak briefly about are the important increase in funds for the Country Areas Program, the relaxation of the criteria by which eligible areas may be selected for funding and the discontinuance of the school level innovations element of the special projects program. As Chairman of the Victorian Country Areas Association I acknowledge the interest of the Minister for Education and the involvement of the Schools Commission in the Country Education Program. The country education project was set up by the Australian Schools Commission in 1977 to look at new ways of delivering educational experiences to isolated rural schools and communities. The major aims of the project are to develop a clearer definition of the nature of rural disadvantage and rural education; to involve local schools and communities in assessing their educational needs, determining priorities and developing and implementing programs based on these needs and priorities. The project was also developed to encourage the process of co-operation and sharing between all schools and communities in designated rural areas while looking for new ways of bringing educational experiences to isolated rural schools and communities. </PARA>
<PARA> This project has been highly successful in the five rural areas in which it has operated in Victoria. I am pleased that now eight additional areas have been declared and that the Federal Government has increased funds to the program by $1.5m for 1982. Because of proposals to restructure the administration of the Victorian education system, we are presently seeking to ensure that this program retains its original characteristics. Many of the programs have been developed through the co-operation of the State Education Department, the Catholic schools system and local governments. The benefits of working together, sharing resources between schools and communities and the use of local resources, outside the traditional school community, have been most rewarding. For example, the country education project in Victoria has produced special Higher School Certificate English television programs that have been beamed to rural high schools through the regional television networks. I particularly acknowledge the major encouragement given to us by BTV6 Ballarat. Initiatives have been developed for a Melbourne-based work experience program which provides country students with city work experience through linkages with city based relatives and/or a sponsorship for accommodation and work experience by Rotary clubs. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen also the joint funding program, I believe a first in Australia, between rural community service officers with the co-operation of CEP, community education and the Department of Youth, Sport and Recreation as well as local government. The education of children in all schools, whether government or non-government, is a shared responsibility of both the Commonwealth and State governments. The continuing substantial overall level of support will enable further real improvements in schools' resource levels. The provisions in this Bill demonstrate the Commonwealth's continuing commitment to high standards in all Australian schools. I reject the Opposition's amendments out of hand and commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In seconding the amendment moved by my colleague the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) I will base my remarks today on the Schools Commission report for the triennium 1982-84. In doing so I point out how deeply disappointed I am with the path that the Schools Commission has now taken. Before dealing with the report I will answer a couple of remarks made by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher). He spoke of independent schools. There is no such animal left any more. All schools are now in receipt of government funding, which makes them government or non-government schools. He also spoke about the transfer of funds in New South Wales from capital to recurrent. I point out to him that this was done with the blessing and the approval of the Federal Minister for Education (Mr Fife), not in some underhand manner as he perhaps pointed out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Schools Commission was first introduced by a Labor government some years ago, the emphasis put on its operation was that it should be almost totally dependent on government guidelines and that it should survey the needs of education for the future. What we have now is a supposedly independent Schools Commission which gives advice back to the Government, advice that the Government has already told it it wants. It was never envisaged that the Australian Schools Commission would be a de facto campaign committee for the government of the day. But what is happening at the moment is that this Liberal Government goes to the polls, makes promises all over the place-particularly in key marginal seats to win a few more votes-and then advises the Schools Commission what it wants it to do. How can the Schools Commission possibly be independent if the Government tells it what it wants done rather than what the Schools Commission should be looking at?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not blame the Schools Commission for this quite so much as I blame the Government. This Government seems intent on taking away from all independent and advisory bodies any independence at all. The end result, of course, is that the public education system of Australia is running down, parents are pulling their children out as the facilities get poorer while the Federal Government decides to give more of the public money to the non-government schools just to try to win a few more votes in key electorates. But I do not think it will work anyway. The Government should be reminded that 78 per cent of all children in Australia go to local state schools and that 78 per cent of all children in Australia receive only 52 per cent of the Schools Commission's allocation of funds. Some 52.2 per cent of funds go to government schools while 47.8 per cent go to non-government schools. So 22 per cent of children in Australia get 47.8 per cent of the funds, while 78 per cent get 52.2 per cent. I call that an inequitable distribution of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Commonwealth Government is giving for recurrent expenditure much more for each pupil in non-government schools than for each pupil in government schools. The argument that it is all right because State governments give more to government schools than to non-government schools for recurrent expenditure only goes to show that perhaps the States have a better idea of their responsibilities in education than has the Federal Government. If the Federal Government is perfectly happy to see the non-government school system expand at the expense of the government schools, so be it. But the Government should not try to tell us that it is an independent schools commission that is giving it such advice; it is a schools commission that is receiving direction from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to see that, for the first time, two of the commissioners of the Commonwealth Schools Commission have issued a minority report, in which they claim that the Federal Government is slowly whittling away the independence of the Commission. According to the authors of the minority report, the Government has been introducing more and more prescriptive guidelines which replace the broad and general guidelines introduced in 1975. In 1975 it was largely up to the Commission to decide how funds were distributed. I quote from the minority report:</PARA>
<PARA> Some recommendations on non-government funding arrangements have resulted from Government policies and election promises rather than from the Commission's own deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA>The minority report also states:</PARA>
<PARA> Guidelines to the Commission have become increasingly detailed and specific, over-riding its proposals on program policy and structure, and reducing its ability to exercise its own judgment on their implementation. This is a matter of concern for us. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest it should be a matter of concern to all parents, staff and students within the government system of education throughout Australia. The minority report also states:</PARA>
<PARA> The recent review of Commonwealth Functions-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the razor gang-</PARA>
<PARA>and the cumulative effects of annual guidelines have removed some discretionary powers from the Commission, endangering its ability to act as a statutory body, and suggest a view of the Commission as a department of Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite decidedly, the system of government education is starting to run down. I will cite some figures from notes given to me, referring specifically to the position in Victoria. If we look at the Schools Commission figures for 1977-78 to 1979-80, we find that Commonwealth government school expenditure fell by 16.1 per cent in that period while non-government school expenditure rose by 12.2 per cent. In 1973-72 per cent of Commonwealth school funds were allocated to the government sector. In 1980 it was 54.2 per cent. The Schools Commission, in its report for the triennium 1982-84, proposed a 3 per cent rise in Commonwealth government school recurrent expenditure and a massive 16.2 per cent rise for non-government schools. I believe it is time we halted the drift away from funding and accepting responsibility for government schools. In Victoria both the Schools Commission and the State Government admit that almost $400m is needed to meet basic building needs. We would do well to consider that if this drift away from financing government schools continues it will divide the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of us have lived through the bitterness of the pre-1972 State aid fight in regard to the allocation of money to non-government and government schools. None of us who were involved in that fight want to go through that again. Under a Labor government, the Schools Commission looked at the entire education system in Australia in an independent way, with the needs of education and the needs of the students being paramount. It distributed the available funds on the basis of need only. I believe this is fair; it is an honest way to distribute it, and it is the only way that unites the community. All of us would be quite happy to see money go to schools, within both the government and non-government system, on the basis of need. </PARA>
<PARA> I was delighted to see that the Federal Minister for Education, had taken the advice of the shadow Minister for Education, the honourable member for Fremantle, and had withdrawn his insistence that Commonwealth money be used for school to work transition programs. Under new education spending guidelines for 1982, the Government had decided to earmark up to $27m of recurrent grants for expenditure on the transition programs in secondary schools in the States. Predictably, the States reacted angrily and informed the Minister of their refusal to participate. I suggest to the Federal Minister for Education that he has been forced to back down on that one and he might now care to reconsider and to back down on the amalgamation proposal for the Institute of Early Childhood Development. It is certainly not too late for him to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that should be remembered about the government education system-the Government would do well to remember this-is that it is the system of education for which State and Federal governments have a responsibility to people thoughout Australia. An education system should be available to all Australians, wherever they live, and its quality should be first class. We could not say that is so now. Its quality should not vary from State to State or from suburb to suburb and its cost to the parent should not vary. Whilst I go along with the idea that there should be a choice or an alternative system, such as that provided within the non-government system, I also suggest to the Government and to the Schools Commission that there is a possibility for choice and diversity within the government school system. It should be possible for us to have experimental schools, alternative style schools and multicultural schools, as well as the traditional types of primary and secondary schools to which we are accustomed. Australia is a changing society and our education system needs to keep up with the changes, stresses and tensions that today's living brings. Australia's education system should be thought through with care and planned for the future-for the needs of the children of the future, for the citizens of the future-not for the needs or the political expediency of the Government that happens to be in Canberra when the report comes through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill appears, on the face of it, to be a reasonable attempt by the Government to provide financial support for government and non-government schools at existing levels, and even to increase the number of educational programs. However, when this Bill is considered in conjunction with the recommendations of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, commonly known as the razor gang, it can be readily seen that it is a base confidence trick by the Government. The intention of the Government is clear: It is to ensure that both the funding and the delivery aspects of education services will be undertaken by the States. On the user pays principle, non-government schools will flourish and prosper at the expense of the government school system. But how will the three million Australians who are disadvantaged and in genuine need fare with an education system under which the user pays? The Government is trying to create two classes of people in Australia-the privileged users who can pay for the best in health, education, welfare, housing and transport, and the underprivileged who rely on government facilities to provide them with welfare, health and education services because the inequalities of our society deny them the ability to pay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Schools Commission was established in 1973 in order to advise the Commonwealth Government on acceptable standards and the needs of government and non-government schools. The Commission, in its report, gives an assessment of the needs of schools and the way in which these needs may be met. Guidelines are issued by the Government which indicate the financial limits and the framework by which the recommendations of the Commission, with regard to the allocations to programs and to the States, can be carried out. For the Commission to carry out its work properly, it is essential that it can adequately gather information from the schools and education systems all over Australia. Yet this is one of the first areas of the Commission's activities which have been cut by the razor gang. I quote from the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) relating to that report:</PARA>
<PARA> There will be a reduction in the Schools Commission's direct involvement in program administration and information collection. </PARA>
<PARA>How will it be possible for the Commission to make recommendations on the needs of education if it is unable to collect information and monitor education programs? It should be clear to honourable members that the Government does not want the Commission to undertake its proper function. In fact it wants the Commission to wither on the vine. The Government would like to return to the days when standards of education varied from State to State, back to the time when the poorer States could not provide an adequate system of education. The whole aim in establishing the Schools Commission was to ensure that education facilities throughout Australia were of a high standard and quality. </PARA>
<PARA> My reference to equality makes this an appropriate time for me to refer to another of the razor gang cuts; that is, the abolition of the Curriculum Development Centre unless the States are prepared to provide financial support. Coupled with this threatened closure is the termination of support for education research in general and the Education Research and Development Committee in particular. What a short-sighted action this is for a government which claims that it aims to improve the quality of life for all Australians. In fact these cuts means that eventually it will not be possible to produce the excellent education booklets which have been published over the years. Bearing in mind what I have already said, it came as no surprise to me to find, when the Schools Commission report for the triennium 1982-84 was tabled, that two of the 11 members of the Commission had found it necessary to issue a minority report. I take this opportunity to commend Mrs Joan Brown and Mr Allan Marriage on their integrity in taking a courageous stand against the retrograde education philosophy on education of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Schools Commission makes it clear that the majority of the commissioners who signed that report have failed to exercise their powers and fulfil the responsibilities given to them under the Schools Commission Act. The minority statement points out that it is the responsibility of the Commission to advise the Government of any detrimental effect its policies are having on public education. This the commissioners have failed to do. It must also be pointed out that the practice of the Government in issuing guidelines to the Schools Commission which are incompatible with its functions and responsibilities as set out in the Act represents a criminal interference with the independence of the Commission. An abject failure of the majority report is the lack of any reference to the resurgence of the bitter State aid debates of past years, as a result of the bias of the current funding policy which favours non-government schools. Reference has been made to this fact in the minority report, which points to the indication in the 1982 guidelines of a further reduction in the Commonwealth's commitment to government schools following the 13.3 per cent reduction for the five-year period preceding 1979. These reductions are being made at a time when the recurrent grants to non-government schools are increasing, with an 11 per cent increase planned for 1982. The inequity of the Government's education funding policies is causing the resurgence of the bitter State aid debates. With 77.7 per cent of children attending government schools and only 22.3 per cent attending non-government schools, the allocation of the funds represents a deliberate transfer of funds from public to private education. The practical realities of the education policies of the Federal Government are indicated in the minority report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is already evident that the quality of service provided to students in government schools in Australia is beginning to deteriorate. Pressures to increase class sizes are increasing, and support services for schools are being reduced. Disruptions to schools are occurring as teachers, usually with the support of their local communities, are resisting by whatever means are available to them, staff shortages, forced reorganisations, and the loss of specialist personnel. </PARA>
<PARA>I can vouch for the fact that the deterioration in the education facilities for government schools referred to in the statement is occurring in my electorate. As an example, many small primary schools are unable to offer adequate classes in art, physical education, music and library because specialised staff are not available. Cutbacks have been made in the numbers of emergency teachers, and this has meant that many school camps and excursions have been cancelled, with even a cancellation of classes in some cases. Many of the schools in my electorate are operating classes in portable and other sub-standard classrooms. It is conceded that many school buildings are comparatively new, but the lack of cyclical maintenance funds means that the essential repairs are not being carried out, to the general detriment of the life of the buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> During term one of this year an intensive survey was conducted into the educational, staffing and curriculum needs of more than 130 secondary, technical and primary schools in the Knox region of my electorate. Some of the schools surveyed expressed satisfaction with their staffing entitlements and the programs they were able to offer, but the vast majority expressed dissatisfaction at large class sizes, forced cutbacks in education programs, and staff shortages, particularly in the areas of mathematics, English and physical education. </PARA>
<PARA> A brief summary of the results shows that, in relation to class sizes, 22 per cent of primary schools have one or more grades containing more than 35 students and more than 40 per cent of all primary school classes in Knox exceed 30 students. With regard to special needs, the summary indicates that more than 500 students requiring additional tuition in mathematics and more than 900 students requiring additional tuition in English are not receiving the additional tuition they require. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the survey summary indicated that in relation to discontinued and cutback programs almost half of the 130 schools surveyed reported forced cutbacks in education programs, particularly in the areas of English, mathematics, library and physical education, which I have mentioned previously. It should be borne in mind when considering these results that 30 students is the maximum class size recommended by the Schools Commission and that English and mathematics are considered by the community to be priority areas of education. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I express my strong support for the views contained in the Commonwealth Schools Commission minority statement and call on the Government to withdraw this Bill and reconsider its decisions in relation to the level of funding for the capital and recurrent programs of government schools. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to conclude the debate by reiterating that the Government has accepted all of the recommendations of the Commonwealth Schools Commission for the detailed allocation of funds for schools in 1982, which have been set at $1,008.1m and represent an increase of 4.6 per cent in real terms over expenditure in 1981. As well as this quite substantial increase, the Government has taken some decisions on the reallocation of resources, which are implemented in the Bill. These will enable the Government's educational election commitments to be met and will give greater priority to such areas as migrant and multicultural education, country areas education, and educational programs for handicapped children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the remarks made by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) concerning the Government's decision to earmark certain funds for transition education, let me remind the House that in my guidelines statement I said that the Government proposed to earmark funds for this purpose within the general recurrent and capital programs. On 22 September 1981 I announced that we did not propose to proceed with the capital earmarking or insist on the allocation of a cash component to each government secondary school. In the light of advice now received from most State governments that they have increased, or propose to increase, their own recurrent spending on transition programs in schools and technical and further education colleges, over the base year 1979-80, by amounts which approximate, and in some cases exceed, the amounts proposed to be earmarked, the Government no longer needs to proceed with the proposed earmarking of general recurrent funds. The Government has not backed down, as suggested by the honourable member for Fremantle. Its principal policy objective has been met. The Commonwealth expects the States to maintain their increased transition effort and hopes that the States will arrange for school communities to participate in the development of transition projects. The Government rejects the amendment moved by the Opposition in the House this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth policy on schools funding has, as its central objective, the provision of educational services of the highest standard for all Australians, whether they be in government or non-government schools. In addressing this objective, it is necessary therefore to take into account the total resources available to schools from both Commonwealth and State sources. In this context, persistent and grossly misleading claims have been made by Opposition members since my guidelines statement in June of this year, the most recent occasion being this afternoon, in relation to the Commonwealth's role in school education funding. I take this opportunity to state the true position clearly and concisely. Non-government schools are not being financed at the expense of government schools. State governments have the constitutional and primary responsibility for government schools. The House should note that, in addition to direct Commonwealth expenditure on government schools, the Commonwealth provides untied revenue-sharing grants to the States, to spend according to their own priorities. These revenue-sharing grants, along with funds from other Commonwealth and State sources, represent about 89 per cent of total public funds for government schools. Direct Commonwealth funding of government schools merely supplements the States' efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> State Governments direct less than 5 per cent of their total schools' budgets to non-government schools. Commonwealth funding, in redressing this imbalance to some extent, must therefore provide relatively greater assistance to non-government schools. This simple fact of basic justice seems to have been overlooked, perhaps deliberately, by the Opposition. At present, non-government schools, with 22 per cent of all enrolments, receive only 11 per cent of total public funds for all schools. Despite the continuing decline in enrolments, the Government has continued to maintain in real terms the level of general recurrent grants for government schools in 1982, resulting in a small increase in their per student allocation to those schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Schools Commission has reported that, on average, government school systems have exceeded the expenditure targets set by the Karmel Committee in 1973, reflecting the substantial and continuing contributions of Commonwealth and State governments to those schools. Evidence of these contributions can be seen in the substantial improvements in student-teacher ratios in recent years; although staffing standards in the great majority of non-government schools are also improving, they are still well below the levels that have been achieved by government schools. Indeed, the average resource levels of government schools have reached the stage where they would be classified under the Commonwealth's subsidy system for non-government schools as being in group 1; schools with the highest resource standards. Despite this, on the latest available figures, each student at a government school effectively receives from taxpayers, that is, from all government sources, more than twice the amount-about $1,790-received by a student at a non-government school, who receives about $770. </PARA>
<PARA> General recurrent grants to non-government schools in 1982 have been increased in accordance with movements in standard costs at government schools and with the Government's election commitment to compress the present six subsidy levels for non-government schools to three. The Commission has reported that the great majority of non-government schools have resources, on average, some 30 per cent below those of government schools. The Commonwealth's concern for these low-resource schools has led to continued improvements in their subsidies from about 30 per cent of average government school standard costs in 1977 to 38 per cent in 1982, with a further increase to 40 per cent in 1983. This represents an increase in real terms from about $364 and $580 per primary and secondary student in the most needy non-government schools in 1977 to $562 and $913 in 1982 in constant 1982 out-turn prices. It should also be noted that almost 90 per cent of Commonwealth funds for non-government schools is directed to those schools in groups 2 and 3 which are in receipt of supplementary support above the basic grant because of their greater needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth assistance to non-government schools recognises the right of the parents of all Australian school schildren to a basic level of financial support from public sources for their children's education, as well as the right to additional support for children in those non-government schools which have a relatively greater need because of lower resources. The Commonwealth is concerned to ensure that freedom of choice and equality of opportunity continue to apply to all Australian school children. In addition, the Commonwealth provides assistance to groups with special needs in both government and non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Fremantle expressed his support for the basket of services concept as recommended by the Commonwealth Schools Commission to replace the percentage link arrangements used to determine the level of financial support for non-government schools. The Government rejected this recommendation because it is the Government's policy to retain the percentage link mechanism and because non-government schools are opposed to the proposal because they believe it could lead to a reduction in Government funds for these schools. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to announce today to honourable members the Australian Government's decision on the question of Australia's participation in the proposed Sinai peacekeeping force. In doing so, I want to set that proposal against the background of the history of the Middle East over the last 30 years, for it is only against that background that the importance of the proposal can be judged and the decision relating to it understood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the last three decades the Middle East has been the most unstable region in the world. This instability has had many causes, but what has given it special character has been the conflict between Israel and the Arab states. This has generated more bitterness, more hatred, more suspicion than any other conflict in the world during this period. Four times in one generation it led to war: In 1948 immediately after the creation of Israel; in 1956 during the Suez crisis; in 1967; and again in 1973. These wars not only disrupted the region itself, but threatened the peace of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as war, the conflict caused a terrible refugee problem, fed fanaticism and terror, and distorted and warped the lives of the countries involved. By the mid-1970s, for example, Israel found it necessary to spend 36 per cent of its gross national product on defence, with crippling results for its economy. All efforts to end the conflict, and there were very many, failed in the face of accumulated suspicion and hostility. The differences appeared irreconcilable. Then, in November 1977, the nearest thing to a political miracle in our time occurred. In an extraordinary act of political courage and vision, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt flew to Jerusalem and addressed the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament. This single dramatic act created a new situation overnight. It set in train a process of negotiation between Egypt and Israel, with the United States of America closely involved. Within a year, this had culminated in the Camp David Accords of September 1978, and, in another few months, it resulted in the Egypt-Israeli peace treaty of March 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> These events were generally welcomed as an historic breakthrough. It was not a matter of believing that all problems were solved, for clearly there was a long hard road ahead and the principal actors would need not only great determination and skill, but all the support they could get from the international community, if they were to complete the journey. But the problems no longer appeared utterly intractable and a willingness to contemplate compromise replaced complete dependence on solution by the gun. </PARA>
<PARA> The Camp David Accords and the peace treaty contained two essential elements. One dealt with the procedures for implementing 'full autonomy' for the inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza after the establishment of an elected self-governing authority. The other dealt with the bilateral aspects of the peace treaty and, specifically, with the return to Egypt of the territory occupied by Israel in the Sinai Peninsula during the earlier fighting. </PARA>
<PARA> Several things need to be noted about these two parts. First, they are not separate and discrete but interconnected, two parts of a total and very carefully negotiated package. In particular, progress on the future of the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza depends on maintaining confidence at the bilateral level between Israel and Egypt, and this in turn depends on the completion of the return of the occupied territories of the Sinai to Egypt. Secondly, the future attitude of the other Arab states to the Accords is likely to depend very substantially on the successful carrying out of the Accords as they relate to the Sinai. If the current reservations and suspicion of the Arab states are to diminish, it is essential that they be carried out. Thirdly, both elements of the peace process require substantial political and strategic concessions by Israel. These were agreed to by Israel in return for an agreement on a satisfactory set of arrangements to guarantee its security. It is here that the peacekeeping force assumes prominence. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the confidence established at Camp David, Israel has already withdrawn from approximately two-thirds of the Sinai and, given the history of the relationship between the two countries, that it has done so has been remarkable. It is scheduled to have withdrawn completely from the Peninsula by the end of April 1982. But, as the text of the treaty makes clear, that complete withdrawal is conditional on the existence of a peacekeeping force which will supervise both the Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai and the implementation of the security arrangements agreed on in the treaty. The existence of an effective peacekeeping force in the Sinai, one which would by its presence secure Israel's southern flank, is therefore a necessary condition for total withdrawal. It would also help to create the kind of confidence required for progress to be made with respect to the West Bank and Gaza. The existence of such a force would not guarantee success-nothing can do that-but without it there can be little hope. The peace force that was envisaged in the treaty was a United Nations force. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to bring that into being. The Soviet Union, which has consistently opposed the Camp David Accords and which vetoed the extension of the mandate of the United Nations emergency force, stands as an insurmountable obstacle to its creation. The Soviet Union has consistently adopted an obstructionist approach to the search for a Middle East peace, has sought to encourage and take advantage of instability and to position itself to make strategic gains. </PARA>
<PARA> The question has been, therefore, whether faced with the Soviet veto there should be no force at all, with the disastrous consequences that would entail in the whole peace process, or whether there should be an international peacekeeping force outside the United Nations system. In considering that question it should be noted that the likelihood of a Soviet veto was anticipated at the time of the signing of the treaty. In letters to both President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin, President Carter undertook that:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Security Council fails to establish and maintain the arrangements called for in the treaty, the President will be prepared to take those steps necessary to ensure the establishment and maintenance of an acceptable alternative multinational force. </PARA>
<PARA>That letter and the assurance it gave were an integral component of the agreement reached by Egypt and Israel in 1979. The Australian Government believes that while it would have been preferable for the Sinai peacekeeping force to be established under a United Nations mandate-if that is ruled out by the position taken by the Soviet Union-then in terms of what is at stake, in terms of peace in this highly sensitive region, it is infinitely preferable that there should be an international peacekeeping force created outside United Nations auspices than that the whole peace process should be frustrated by the absence of any force at all. Let me add that we should be careful, in a situation where it is possible to take significant initiatives for peace, before we circumscribe them by establishing circumstances in which the Soviet Union would gain a permanent capacity to interpose a veto, for that might give to the Soviet Union a greater power than it could manage on its own account to thwart and frustrate progress towards peace. </PARA>
<PARA> Granted that the need for a peacekeeping force to support the continuation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty is accepted, the question remains as to whether Australia itself should participate in such a force. No one would pretend that this is an easy question to answer and this Government has deliberated long and hard over it. I make no apology at all for the time we have taken in coming to a decision. There are considerations which weigh for and against participation, and these were set out in the statement to this House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) on 26 May. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of major arguments point in the direction of participation. Participation by Australia would encourage the formation of a more broadly-based peacekeeping force which would enhance prospects for international acceptance of the peacekeeping force-a force which is needed to ensure that Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai can be carried out in accordance with international commitments. Australia has given strong support to the development of the peace process in the Middle East and has a responsibility to follow up with practical assistance. President Sadat took great political risks in initiating and perservering with the peace process and it is vital for his successors who have committed themselves to support that peace process that the remaining third of the Sinai still under Israeli control be regained by Egypt in April 1982. The failure of Australia and other Western countries to participate would require the United States to bear the burden itself and would be seen as a failure by the West to support United States policies in the Middle East. This would risk giving propaganda opportunities to the Soviet Union, whereas participation in peacekeeping would encourage constructive United States involvement in efforts to bring about a lasting settlement of Arab-Israeli differences. Our participation would be welcomed by Egypt and Israel, as well as the United States, and our participation would imply our continuing support for Israel's security. It would have positive impact on Israel's approach to negotiating similar arrangements for its other borders. </PARA>
<PARA> When I met President Sadat in London a month or two ago he sought to impress upon me in a very plain, very open and honest way the strength of Egypt's desire and wish to have Australian participation, but he did not try to suggest that there were no risks, that there were no problems. The nature and the honesty of his appeal impressed me very much as to the man, as to the person. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of arguments have also been used against Australian participation. It is sometimes said that our policy has been to participate only in United Nations sponsored peacekeeping operations, and that a force which was not broadly based would find little international acceptance. Some have said that the Middle East is remote from Australia and that the reactions of other states in the region might be adverse. Some have said that the extent of any Australian commitment would be uncertain and potentially too extensive, especially in view of our commitment to participate in peacekeeping in Namibia. Some have said that participation in a peacekeeping force in such a volatile area is too risky, and that it might even result in an adverse impact on support in Australia for our relationship with the United States. While there are weighty considerations on both sides a number of factors have led the Government to the view that Australia must be prepared to contribute to the multinational peacekeeping force. The starting point is that Australia has a clear and strong national interest in the progress of peace in the Middle East. It is first and foremost a matter of deciding what it is in our own national interest to do, and then acting accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Without question, the continued progress towards peace in the Middle East is of enormous significance to Australia. An outbreak of conflict would have repercussions not only for the region but also for the peace of the world which would affect us profoundly and in manifold ways. It would affect our allies and friends in ways which could not but impinge greatly on our international relationships and with risks for the strategic balance of great moment to our national security. Australia's interest is in seeing what is probably the single most serious threat to world peace removed. Further warfare in the Middle East could trigger off a much wider war. Australia has a legitimate interest in preventing this. This point is so evidently true that I believe it does not require elaboration here. There is also the economic fact that Egypt is Australia's largest single trading partner in the Middle East. As the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) said in the House yesterday, a stable Egypt is very important to the whole of our trade with the Middle East region. It is in the interests of Australia and the whole world that Egypt's stability be maintained, and this maintenance requires continued international support for the policies commenced by President Sadat, and which his successor President Mubarek is pledged to continue. That we have an interest in peace, rather than war, in the Middle East is, I believe, indisputable. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads to the second fact which has weighed in our decision-that the peace process which has been begun in the region under the Camp David Accords is the only framework for peace which has been put forward in the long history of that region which shows some prospect of achieving its immediate objectives. While other proposals have been made from time to time, none has yet achieved the degree of acceptance from Israel and Egypt the Camp David Accords have achieved. Senator Church made this point eloquently in Canberra yesterday when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been much said for and against the Camp David Accords, but remember that those Accords, though they are still only partially implemented-and far from perfect-represent the only formula that has yet achieved a peace in this part of the world . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A central part of the Camp David process is the establishment of a peacekeeping force in the Sinai. The Government is aware that many Arab governments have stated public opposition to the Camp David Accords. The Government believes, however, that there is support for the concept of returning Arab land to Arab sovereignty; in this case returning Sinai to its rightful owner, the Government of Egypt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government attaches great importance to its relations with Arab countries, and understands their wish to achieve a settlement which makes proper provision for the interests of the Palestinian people. Australia hopes that its relations with Arab countries will continue to develop. There is a growing realisation tha many countries including a major part of the Arab world are seeking the same objective-peace. Given that peace in the Middle East is in Australia's national interest, and given that the only existent basis for peace is Israeli-Egyptian accommodation, and the establishment of a multinational peacekeeping force, Australia cannot avoid the question: Do we have a capacity to make a contribution to the peace process by membership in that force? One fact is plain: There is a limit to what Australia as a middle power can do. We must avoid unrealistic views of what we can achieve. But to say that there are limits is in no way to say that we could not make a useful and a valuable contribution, in conjunction with other countries which share our interests and our concern for peace in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Egypt, Israel and the United States-the nations which signed the agreement in August this year providing for the establishment of a multinational peacekeeping force-have made it clear that they would welcome Australian participation in the force. Indeed, they have indicated that they attach great importance to our participation and that the assassination of President Sadat has made that participation even more important to them. President Sadat's successor, President Mubarak, has indicated his determination to remain on the course set by his predecessor. President Sadat's assassination has in fact created a greater need for international recognition of the conditions for peace in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> Egypt without President Sadat needs more support from other nations to continue the peace process than Egypt with President Sadat, and the Egyptian Government made clear to the Deputy Prime Minister on his recent visit that this was very much its own perspective. This consideration has weighed with the Government and has been significant in tipping the balance in favour of participation in the peacekeeping force. We have a capacity to contribute, and our contribution is sought by the countries most closely involved. These facts place the most weighty responsibility on us. This Government has never taken the view that Australia should refrain from doing what it can to create a better and more peaceful world. Within realistic limits we have consistently argued that Australia has responsiblities, and must recognise those responsiblities in its actions. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has had recent involvement in peacekeeping in the Middle East; Australian forces were part of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Sinai from 1976 to 1979 and were withdrawn only when the Soviet Union indicated that it would veto an extension of the force's United Nations mandate. In this case it would obviously be more comfortable to do nothing-to say that peace in the Middle East does not concern us, or that we cannot contribute to peace. But neither of those propositions would be true. Those attitudes widely adopted amongst nations in past times and in other conflicts have led in the end to catastrophic wars. If all nations wanting peace were to leave the active pursuit of peace to others, peace would fail by default, as it has too often in the past, and we would all bear the tragic costs, as we have too often in the past. Australia is concerned. We can contribute. And accordingly, we have decided, provided certain reasonable conditions are met, to make a contribution to the multinational force. </PARA>
<PARA> On 12 October I wrote to President Reagan informing him that the Australian Government would agree to participate in the peacekeeping force if certain conditions were met. I informed President Reagan that the Government has decided that Australia will agree to participate in the Sinai peacekeeping force subject to Britain and Canada also agreeing to participate. In the interests of obtaining the broadest-based international acceptance of the force, significant European participation is a critical factor. We are glad to see from published reports that France is reconsidering her attitude. The Australian contribution would be limited to the contribution we are initially called upon to make, and that contribution will be of limited duration to be agreed. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the membership of the peacekeeping force there are other matters which the Government believes are important to provide full protection for Australia's independence and sovereignty, and which were set out in my letter to President Reagan. As is usual practice, we would need to instruct the commander of any Australian contingent that if he received orders from the commander of the force which he believed were contrary to, or went beyond, the agreed purposes of the force, he should not comply with them until he had consulted with Australian authorities. No part of the peacekeeping force-including the United States component-should have any association with the United States Rapid Deployment Force. A solution to the Palestinian issue is clearly central to the future stability and peace of the Middle East. In participating in the Sinai peacekeeping force we would be concerned that our contribution would have the maximum positive influence in continuing and broadening the peace process in the Middle East. Australia has consistently supported the continuing peace process but we have been disappointed by the lack of progress and prospects for further movement in the autonomy negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> I stated in my letter to President Reagan that Australia will be looking to the United States to exert and sustain the strongest pressure to ensure effective progress in implementing the Camp David Accords as they relate not only to the Sinai but also to Palestinian autonomy. We recognise how much the United States has been doing in an endeavour to establish lasting peace in the Middle East. We recognise also what President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin were trying to do in their search for a peaceful solution. It is important for the Middle East and for the whole world that these efforts should be continued and should have the widest possible support. </PARA>
<PARA> Our participation in the peacekeeping force would be on the understanding that all the parties to the Accords abided by word and deed with their provisions, and press forward with a continuing peace process in the Middle East. The conditions necessary for Australia's participation have all been conveyed in the clearest terms to President Reagan. The Australian contribution under consideration at present comprises elements of an air transport unit, equipped with helicopters and fixed wing aircraft, and probably involving some 200-300 personnel. But the precise composition of our contribution will of course depend on the outcome of discussions with other participants and also on the decisions of those other governments. I want to set out step by step the timing of the decision and the discussions and consultations which led up to it, because it is important that there should be no misunderstandings about this. During the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting I would obviously have wanted to, and did, consult with leaders, and at the time President Reagan put the same suggestion to me and to certain other countries. I consulted with the Prime Ministers of Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom in Melbourne during the Conference. And then following the assassination of President Sadat, the Deputy Prime Minister consulted with Secretary of State Haig, Dr MacGuigan, Lord Carrington and Mr Colombo, who were in Cairo for President Sadat's funeral. These consultations in Cairo took place on 10 October, and I was informed of their content by cable and in telephone conversations with the Deputy Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision that Australia would participate under the conditions I have already outlined was taken on 12 October. I want to make it plain that that decision was taken after consultation with, and with the agreement of, the Deputy Prime Minister who, as honourable members know, was overseas at the time. The Government's decision about participation in the peacekeeping force and the conditions for that participation were conveyed by letter to the President of the United States and the Prime Ministers of Great Britain and Canada on 12 October, and the Prime Minister of New Zealand was subsequently advised of our position. It will be obvious to the House that whilst Australia's decision was taken on a completely independent basis, the practical commitment which will flow from it will depend upon the decision of other governments. This is why I said in the House on Tuesday that 'there is no procrastination on this issue by this Government' and also that 'I expect to be in a position to make some announcement about this decision in the relatively near future, but that is not necessarily waiting on decisions of this Government, but decisions of other governments'. </PARA>
<PARA> It was appropriate, in view of the conditional nature of Australia's decision, that the other governments should have some time to formulate their own positions in relation to that, but it is the view of the Government that events have now moved ahead and that Australia's position should be made known. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government believes that this multinational peacekeeping force is a significant step for peace. It is not a decision which is pro-Arab or pro-Israeli. It is a decision which is pro-peace. It is a decision which could never have been made had President Sadat not taken his historic initiatives. The assassination of President Sadat has stengthened, not weakened, the need for international support for the peace process. A role of the utmost importance now falls on Prime Minister Begin. Many have questioned his approach to peace and the implications of his policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has made abundantly clear on many occasions its support for the state of Israel behind secure and recognised borders as specified in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Our credentials on that matter are not exceeded by any nation. So let me from that point of support and friendship say that much will now depend on Prime Minister Begin and on the Israeli Parliament. There are many who believe that it was President Sadat who was foremost in carrying the banner for peace in the Middle East. Notwithstanding that Prime Minister Begin has fully participated in the progress to that point, with President Sadat's death there now falls to the Prime Minister of Israel the opportunity to hold aloft the banner for peace that President Sadat carried with such courage. Prime Minister Begin now has the opportunity to make sure that the autonomy talks are meaningful, and to do all that he can to bring about positive results. Let him make sure that there is a true and fitting memorial to President Sadat in a peace settlement that can endure and that leads to a wider settlement in the Middle East. There is a challenge before Prime Minister Begin, Israel, Egypt and other countries such as the United States to act with vigour and initiative so that those who celebrated President Sadat's death by firing their guns for joy are confounded, and the terrorists and promoters of discord are defeated. Let those who have used terror as an instrument recognise, with the vision of a Sadat, that the true road to peace lies in a recognition of Israel's right to exist; then discussion and negotiation can replace the sound of gunfire. </PARA>
<PARA> In making this commitment I wish to emphasise that Australia will contribute to a peacekeeping force, not to a conflict. The Sinai peacekeeping force will not be taking sides with either Egypt or Israel. It is not going to be involved in either military attack or defence in any military sense. Its role is to monitor, to observe. I consider it most understandable that when two countries, with a long and sorry history of mutual conflict, decide to put this history behind them and engage in a new era of peace, they should wish to have mutual friends in whom they can have confidence to assist them in the sensitive business of overcoming past suspicions. The Sinai peacekeeping force is to play the role of mutual friend. If the time should come when either party should wish to attack the Sinai force, then the whole peace process would have come to an end. By definition, the force's role would already also have come to an end and it would leave the region. But this situation will not come about, and it will not come about because Australia and other countries are ready to play their part, which is after all a modest part, in ensuring that Israel and Egypt pursue their mutually declared objective of developing a new and friendly relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that the moment there are differences of view on this important issue. I hope that honourable members and the Australian public will give very careful consideration to all the considerations I have mentioned and will agree that in the end the right course for Australia is the one the Government has decided to take. Australia has played a significant role over many years by its willingness to contribute to peacekeeping forces in trouble spots around the world, and while this particular decision has been more finely balanced than others, I have no doubt that in the end the easier decision would be irresponsible and wrong. The easier decision would be one we might well live to regret, for surely none of us would want the situation in which a failure on our part to help two countries in their search for a lasting peace might contribute to increasing instability in a region where it is the interest of Australia as of the whole world that there should be increasing stability. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to members of the Opposition not to seek to divide Australia on this issue. I appeal to them not to be swayed by talk of war when the proposition and possible prospect is one of peace for one of the most war torn parts of the whole world. The conditions wrapped around this particular decision are such that all parties in this Parliament and all people in Australia can accept the decision as one that in no way derogates from Australia's sovereignty, as one that recognises our responsibilities to do what we can to help achieve the objective of peace that is so close to the hearts of Australians, as one that is in Australia's widest national interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is an extraordinary one. It commits conditionally Australian military personnel and equipment to serve overseas in the most volatile region on the globe, a region which is frequently rift with sudden, unpredictable and horrendous conflict. The most extraordinary aspect of the statement is that the final decision about Australia's commitment of personnel and equipment rests in the hands of others-Britain and Canada-not Australia. It seems to me a rather unique and curious way for foreign policy decision making to proceed. All parts of the Parliament and the country are concerned to see peace achieved in the Middle East; but equally, concerned and informed people are worried that that objective will not be achieved by discredited processes or by approaches which are partial and which are capable of interpretation as serving sectional outlooks. I will come back to those matters. I declare, very early, the attitude of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party on this matter. There should be no ambiguity about its declared position. On 27 May 1981, on a motion by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), seconded by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), and carried unanimously, the following resolution was endorsed:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That it opposes Australian participation in any multinational peace-keeping force in the Sinai not under U.N. auspices. </PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to some of these matters a little later. It was quite obvious that the Prime Minister approached this issue, in the concluding comments he delivered, with a great display of hide. He appealed to the Opposition not to divide the nation on the issue. If any single decision, if any lone declaration, will divide the nation on this issue it is the statement of the Prime Minister in the Parliament tonight. The opinion polls in this country are clear. There is no equivocation about the Australian community's attitude. Those opposed to such a commitment have increased from 61 per cent in August to 72 per cent in September. Those who support this sort of proposal constitute only 25 per cent of the Australian community. I make it clear-as I will quite abundantly when I quote from a document-that there are members even in this Parliament on the Government side who have declared pursuasively their opposition to such a proposal as the Prime Minister has just announced. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I commend the firmness of the Prime Minister in the statements he has made in relation to the rights of the Palestinian people. I hope that he will persist with those declarations undeviatingly because there will be no resolution of the Middle Eastern situation until the Palestinian problem is resolved. That in turn requires a recognition of the sovereign rights of the nation of Israel according to United Nations declarations 242 and 338. We in no way underestimate the enormous difficulties of arriving at a solution to these problems. I repeat what the Prime Minister said at page 18 of the document circulated to us. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In participating in the Sinai peacekeeping force we would be concerned that our contribution would have the maximum positive influence in continuing and broadening the peace process in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that the United States Government, in spite of the enormous clout that presumably it would have with the Begin Government of Israel-I make a distinction between the Begin Government and the Israeli people-in spite of the presumption of enormous influence, has been singularly unsuccessful in achieving a more tract- able approach by the Begin Administration to all aspects of the Camp David processes. At page 19 the Prime Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Australia will be looking to the United States to exert and sustain the strongest pressure to ensure effective progress in implementing the Camp David Accords as they relate not only to the Sinai but also to Palestinian autonomy.</PARA>
<PARA>I have to confess my confidence about what will be achieved in that latter respect sags badly. Already the United States has displayed successively on particular occasions and successively through various administrations that it lacks, in the final result, the power to force the Begin Administration to take a more realistic and creative approach to the need for a peaceful settlement of the multitude of problems in the Middle East which directly impinge upon Israel, Egypt and the Palestinian people. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Camp David Accords were first announced the Opposition supported them. On the occasion when they were presented to the Parliament the proposition was that there would be a United Nations sponsored peacekeeping force. Six months later a letter from President Carter was attached to those Accords in which there was a declaration that in the event of a United Nations peacekeeping force not being capable of being established then a US sponsored multinational military force would be set up. That was never presented to this Parliament. We supported the Camp David processes with some optimism on the basis of the declaration in relation to a United Nations sponsored peacekeeping force. If there is to be any respectability, credibility and influence on the part of any peacekeeping force then its perception in the eyes of the world must be that of a force which has international sponsorship, not one which is seen as an extension of United States foreign policy-no matter how well motivated it might be argued that that extension of US foreign policy is. This is particularly true in relation to this volatile, this potentially explosive part of the world-the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me outline some of the very real difficulties which are not novel. There are difficulties which have plagued the whole process of the Camp David Accords since their inception-the attitude of the Begin Government towards the West Bank and Gaza. Since the Camp David Accords were signed and in spite of the clear intention of those Accords to arrive at a withdrawal of the military presence of Israel from those particular areas and processes aimed at establishing autonomy-however that may be defined in the upshot of debate-for the Palestinian people of the West Bank, the Begin Government has completely abused the implicit principles and commitments in that undertaking. The Begin Government has proceeded to establish further settlements on those areas. One would have expected, by implication, that there was a declared immunity for those particular regions against the establishment of further settlements once the Camp David processes had been signed. I quote the Washington Post of 28 September 1980, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Since the accords were signed nearly two years ago, the physical landscape of the West Bank has changed with the addition of 39 new Jewish civilian communities, bringing the total number of settlements operating there, under construction or approved by the government, to 72. They now have a population of about 14,000. </PARA>
<PARA>It concludes by quoting the Agricultural Minister of the Begin Government, Ariel Sharon, who said:</PARA>
<PARA> You just can't do anything about it any more. That is why it is impossible any more to talk about the Jordanian option or territorial compromise. We are going to leave an entirely different map of the country that it will be impossible to ignore. I don't see any way any government will be able to dismantle the settlements of Judea and Samaria. </PARA>
<PARA>The Begin Government has undertaken a program which is clearly designed to acquire territorially the West Bank and Gaza. It is an extension of an ideological, theological view that Mr Begin and his colleagues have of the State of Israel. I do not want it misunderstood what I am saying. It is not a view which is shared by all Israeli people. It is not a view, for instance, which is endorsed by the Israeli Labor Party. One of the great virtues of Israel is that, like an island in a great sea, it alone is the functioning democracy in that part of the world. There is a more stimulated and a better informed debate taking place there on this matter than occurs within this country. It is the cause of deep sorrow in Israel that the Begin Government proceeds in the way in which it does. The Israeli people in conflict with the objectives of the Begin Government recognise how the behaviour of that government is contributing dangerously to the instability of the area and how much more difficult it will make acheivement of peace through whatever process for that particular region. I quote the Christian Science Monitor of 7 September this year, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Israeli military officials state that only about 2 per cent of West Bank land has been taken for settlements. However, Messrs. Benvenisti--</PARA>
<PARA>A former Deputy Mayor of Jerusalum-</PARA>
<PARA>and Rubinstein--</PARA>
<PARA>a long-time Israeli West Bank correspondent for Davar-the Word-a pro-Labor Party daily newspaper-</PARA>
<PARA>say that Israel asserts rights to about 1.5 million dunams (one dunam equals one-quarter of an acre), 27 percent of the total West Bank area of 5.5 million dunams-for potential settlement, military, or other use. This does not include the area of the former Jordanian sector of Jerusalem and surrounding land, whch was formally annexed by Israel in 1967. </PARA>
<PARA>Let my go on to give further evidence of the extraordinarily difficult task which is before us and evidence of why the Camp David processes are in reverse, why they are discreditied internationally. In the Knesset on 5 August 1981 the Begin Government, among other things, carried this declaration:</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the transition period, set down in the Camp David agreements, Israel will present its claim, and act to realize its right of sovereignty over Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district. </PARA>
<PARA>How can it be proposed that Australia, by participating in the United States sponsored multinational military force in the Middle East, will be influential in changing this firmly declared attitude of the Begin Government? The Begin Government is the greatest threat that the world has to international peace. The explanation is simple. Mr Begin, in desperation to win the last election, undertook a number of military escapades which cannot be excused. He has now formed a coalition which operates on a knife edge. In those circumstances there is in Israel a sense of great alarm at the potential for Mr Begin to undertake further destabilising military types of adventures. This is the nature of the problem we are talking about and over which the Prime Minister has so glibly skidded. The settlement on the West Bank in the Gaza was developed after the Camp David processes were signed by the Israeli Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some facts about the situation in the Middle East which have to be acknowledged. Israel, as much as Egypt, needs peace and, therefore, needs to withdraw from the Sinai. The economies of neither can survive if there is continued tension and military conflict. Let us look at the case of Israel. I think the situation of Egypt is much more apparent. Already the Israeli economy is confronted by a rate of inflation of 130 per cent; it is accelerating. It has to divert a very large proportion of its total resources to military expenditure. That is inflationary; that tends to undermine the strength of the productive side of the economy. In those circumstances, Israel is confronted by a situation which I saw when I visited there last year--</PARA>

Let us have no humbug about that. Israel is unable to provide housing or the general standard of facilities that the public of that country expects. Therein lies the genesis of increasing tensions within that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Israel desperately requires on economic grounds peace with Egypt and, indeed, with other countries in the Middle East. It requires it on military grounds. If it is able to withdraw from the Sinai it is able to withdraw its military forces from deployment on its western flank. It is, therefore, with a secure peace arrangement, able to establish a more effective defensive-I hope not offensive-deployment of its military forces on its other borders. In that sense it makes good strategic sense and good tactical sense for Israel to withdraw from the Sinai. I put the proposition that in view of the fact that the arguments in favour of withdrawal from the Sinai on the part of both Egypt and Israel are such that it is curious that it should require any sort of outside military force to supervise this sort of thing. Neither side can afford the continuation of this situation. Economically and militarily it will destroy them. </PARA>
<PARA> I said before, in view of the fact the members of the Government reacted with some agitation to some of my comments, that I will quote from a Government member's document to show that within the Government ranks there is substantial agreement with the views I have been putting and the concluded attitude of the Labor Party as declared by me and as established at a Caucus meeting earlier this year on this matter. Let me tell the honourable members opposite what their colleague the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) had to say about the Middle East. The document is headed 'Sinai-In or Out'. On page 6 he asks the question:</PARA>
<PARA> With its southern flanks fully secured by the force (particularly by virtue of the US presence in the force), Israel would be more likely to engage in serious negotiations, and to make serious concessions for the purposes of solving the West Bank, Gaza, Old City of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights issues. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer to that from Mr Spender is this:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in recent history supports this view. If anything, it seems likely that the more secure Israel feels to the south, the more free it would feel to take military action against e.g. the PLO and Syria. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Liberal Party says. On page 7 the document states:</PARA>
<PARA> Even if Australia quit-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, from a commitment to this force--</PARA>
<PARA>on good and previously agreed grounds, if the US remained, it would be unlikely to look kindly on Australia's withdrawal. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, and in the considered view of Mr Spender and his colleagues, the document states:</PARA>
<PARA> By becoming part of the Force, we place ourselves hostages to fortune, in that we can be affected by events that we can neither predict nor control and we subject ourselves to risks that cannot be calculated. </PARA>
<PARA>We agree with that. We agree that by commiting ourselves to this force in the circumstances outlined by the Prime Minister we do commit ourselves to become hostages of fortune, that the future destiny of this country can be determined by events over which we have neither control nor about which we can make any prediction. That is the view of a government member who has carefully considered this matter and it is a view that has been endorsed by a great number of his colleagues. At page 12 of the Prime Minister's statement there is a surprising, if not disturbing, declaration, or confession if honourable members prefer. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Further warfare in the Middle East could trigger off a much wider war. </PARA>
<PARA>It is an extraordinarily unstable part of the world. If Egypt and Israel are genuine about their wish to have this withdrawal completed there is no need for a supervisory force. It is in their interest to do so. What is likely to happen-the Prime Minister's declaration which I have just quoted makes this clear-is that in the event of further hostilities, a fact that I want to come to in a minute in terms of the potential for grave instability in Egypt, Australia, as part of a very small peacekeeping force, could be overrun and we could be in serious trouble. What does any honourable member of this House or any seriously-minded member of this community believe to be the likely situation in the event of hostilities between two major conflicting forces and between which there are only 2,000 lightly armed members of an observer group? They would be overrun. The consequences would be cataclysmic. The Prime Minister, unaware of the contradiction of what he said, stated at page 25 of his statement:</PARA>
<PARA> If the time should come when either party should wish to attack the Sinai force, the whole process would have come to an end. </PARA>
<PARA>I doubt that anyone will argue with that, nor indeed be generous to suggest that it is a major insight. The Prime Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> By definition the force's role would also already have come to an end and it would leave the region. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, it is probably the height of his capacity for perspicacity. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA> But this situation will not come about . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If he says it will not come about why explore the prospect? His confidence is not a confidence shared by more than 70 per cent of the Australian community; it is not a confidence shared by any editorial writer who has written on this matter; it is not a confidence that is being shared outside by informed commentators on international affairs who are concerned about the part of the world we are discussing. I find it extraordinary that the Prime Minister has to declare that Australia's commitment is conditional upon the commitment of other countries in the world. He has declared principle in the course of the ouline of what he had to say. He has made a claim by implication of statesmanship. But we find in the final result that there is sort of a dallying and an uncertainty and an inconsistency. In 26 pages of dissertation from the Prime Minister on this matter we find two to three key paragraphs and they are that Australia's commitment is conditional upon Canada and Great Britain, two members of the old white Commonwealth, making a prior and unequivocal commitment to serving in this United States sponsored multination military force. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the Prime Minister says. He says that this process of commitment of Australian troops is the only way to peace. He says that there is no other alternative. He says that it is a matter of great principle. He says that our presence in the force will ensure that it becomes a more broadly representative force. He says that it will allow us to apply influence on Israel so that there will be other border settlements. I put to one side the fact that far larger, more powerful and demonstrably more influential countries have failed in all of this and ask: Why, if he believes all of these things, does he then declare conditionally that for all of the principle, for all of the influence and for all of the good we can contribute to peace, we will not go ahead with it unless Canada and Britain are behind to hold our hands? He said that Australia will make a positive impact on Israel's propensity to negotiate similar arrangements. I repeat it because it is a key proposition he puts forward to justify this undertaking. He ignores completely contemporary developments in that part of the world, the developments on the West Bank, in Gaza and the behaviour of the Begin Government in Israel in Jerusalem. He ignores the fact that in spite of the massive aid that the United States of America pours into Israel every year-some $2,000m, about $3500 per year for each inhabitant of Israel-the United States has not been able to achieve that leverage. </PARA>
<PARA> I put this proposition very simply: The two processes should in no way be separated. It is necessary to establish leverage with the Begin Government in relation to the Camp David processes connected with the West Bank and Gaza. It is nonsense for the Prime Minister to put forward these propositions to commit Australia to this multinational United States sponsored military force without first ensuring that maximum pressure is applied to the Begin Government and that there is a demonstrable, positive reaction to that pressure by the United States in relation to the Palestinian peoples in the West Bank and Gaza. He is seeking to give a gloss to a partial response to the Camp David processes and in the process he is ignoring the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people. Ignoring them in that manner will contribute greatly to further instability in that region. I note that at page 10 of his statement he uses terms such as some people having talked of our remoteness from the region and about our commitment in Namibia in some way weakening our capacity to participate in this force. He goes on to talk about some people saying that the area is volatile and too risky. I will tell honourable members the first person to go on record with that declaration-the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street), the honourable member for Corangamite. I have a copy of his cablegram stamped 'secret'. Government documents stamped 'secret' are much more easily obtainable than the ones that are just stamped 'confidential'. The cablegram, dated 27 April this year, is addressed to the United States Secretary of State Haig. The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We are also committed to the UNTAG for Namibia when the force is raised. We have an interest in seeing peace and stability in the Middle East, but it is beyond the area of direct strategic concern to Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the unequivocal declaration of the Government, not the Opposition. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In your message--</PARA>
<PARA>That is Haig's-</PARA>
<PARA>you made reference to Australia's important trading links with Middle East countries. The Government will of course need to give very careful consideration to the effect on our relations with regional Arab governments of possible participation in the force. </PARA>
<PARA>It is well known that nothing has altered since that cablegram was sent to diminish in any way the reservations of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The only thing that has changed-not the circumstances, which are what I was talking about-is that the determination and dominance, the single-minded obsessiveness, of the Prime Minister, of which we heard so much earlier this year from the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), has won out. He has bluffed and bullied a concession from his colleagues. I repeat, the provisional commitment he talks about is an extraordinarily vulnerable one. It involves 200 to 300 personnel with fixed wing aircraft and helicopters, which are highly vulnerable to guerrilla incursions in an area which is highly unstable. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that I would come to the point of potential instability between Egypt and other Arab countries. It is clear that Egypt is becoming the venue for important military establishments of the United States for the accommodation and support of its Rapid Deployment Force. In that sense there is a major injection of instability within Egypt-that is, domestically-and from outside as a consequence of the developing attitudes of Arab countries. Egypt has enormous potential for instability. There is the problem of quite evident pan-Arabism there, which is quite contrary to the spirit of this proposal. There is resentment within important sections of the military to the way in which policy under Sadat developed, and is continuing. There is opposition among the intelligentsia and resentfulness amongst the middle class. There is very hostile opposition among the Islamic fundamentalist movement which is still influential and significant. Overlying, underlying and impregnating in every conceivable way these sorts of potential forces for destructiveness are very serious economic problems-a rapid rate of inflation which is overwhelming any economic growth; a very low level of income per capita; and a serious maldistribution of wealth of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> We are opposed to the commitment of Australian troops overseas in any multinational military force unless it has United Nations sponsorship. We are opposed to the commitment of Australian troops in that region of the world because we agree with the assessment of the Minister for Foreign Affairs; that is, it is well removed from our area of strategic interest. In that respect I draw the comparison between the obvious strategic interest of all the major countries of Europe, which should be placed well ahead of us. The tardy way in which those countries have responded to this proposal is an indication of how defective they view it as being. The fact that such enormous pressure had to be applied to so many countries with so little result for the United States is an indication of the serious reservations which world leaders harbour in relation to this proposal. Australia's best interest will not be served by being committed to this sort of force. It will be highly vulnerable in a very unstable part of the world. Developments could transpire there which could quickly suck us in to a rather horrendous development of military conflict with the gravest implications for international stability. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat, there can be no settlement of the problems in the Middle East until there is a settlement of the so-called Palestinian problem. In that respect I note that the European Economic Community, specifically Great Britain among many countries of the world, has declared that it is necessary that any processes designed to bring about a peaceful settlement in that part of the world must have associated with the representatives of the PLO. When I went to the Middle East last year, at Beirut in Lebanon I was able to meet Mr Yasser Arafat. I was able to meet him because the Australian Government-the Fraser Government-arranged it. </PARA>

Equally, there can be no long-lasting peace until Israeli forces have been withdrawn from occupied territories to secure and recognised boundaries and a just settlement of the claims of the Palestinian people is achieved.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr ANTHONY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said that Australia will participate in the Sinai peacekeeping force, subject to the conditions described by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), for a number of very substantial reasons. Clearly, the most important reason of all is that the whole world, including Australia, has a very great stake in the peace of the Middle East. As is well known, the Middle East is one of the most volatile parts of the world. It is probably the most strategic part of the world because it supplies most of the oil traded around the world. It has a long and sorry history of instability and conflict. The world has welcomed the Camp David Accords, which hold out the best hope for peace in the Middle East. If Australia believes peace in the Middle East is important, it cannot turn its back on its responsibility to do whatever it can to secure that peace. It is not good enough for Australia to pay lip service to the ideal of peace in the Middle East but be unwilling to contribute to that peace process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, very substantial practical considerations are involved. A conflict that would disrupt the flow of oil to the world from the Middle East would have enormous consequences. Such a disruption would be a catalyst for great instability for all kinds of people around the world and could very well lead to a massive conflict amongst nations trying to get their energy supplies. From Australia's point of view, instability in the Middle East could seriously disrupt the very substantial trade wich Australia has with countries in that region. These are important matters and they cannot be put aside. But I emphasise again that the overwhelming consideration in the mind of the Government in making the decision announced today is its responsibility to do what it can to contribute to the peace of the Middle East. The key country is Egypt, a large country which has the largest population in the whole of the Middle East and a country which has enormous intellectual influence amongst all the countries of the Middle East. Egypt is the only major country of stability in a troubled Middle East today. If we had an unstable Egypt it could well turn the tables and bring about enormous conflict in that part of the world which I have described. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people say that the assassination of President Sadat added to the arguments against Australia's paticipation in the Sinai peacekeeping force. I believe that the reverse is true. The tragic death of President Sadat, who did so much to secure peace, should inspire many countries to make a firm commitment to peace in the Middle East and to do so by making a practical expression of commitment to the peacekeeping force. People must realise the tremendous courage that President Sadat displayed in 1977 by going direct to Israel to talk about a peace agreement. Until that point in time there has been only a disengagement arrangement between Israel, Syria and Egypt. His going straight to Israel caused tremendous resentment amongst strong-willed Arabs who so detested the Israelis that they were unforgiving about his being prepared to make such a move. It is sad that that created a strong feeling, a reservation, by many of the Arab countries, many of which are quite moderate and considerate and want peace and a solution that brings peace. </PARA>
<PARA> All honourable members will know that I attended the funeral of President Sadat in Cairo. As well as giving me the opportunity to pay Australia's tribute to a great man, my presence in Cairo allowed me to meet senior people in the Government of Egypt and senior representatives of a number of countries around the world. As I said in the House yesterday, I believe it is of utmost importance that the new Egyptian leadership continue firmly along the path laid down by the late President Sadat. In Cairo I was assured in the firmest terms that that would happen. Egypt is a key country in this matter, not only because of its commitment to peace but also because any serious instability in Egypt, or any Middle East instability or conflict in which Egypt became involved, could only cause serious problems for all the countries of the Middle East and all the countries that have associations with the Middle East. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) seems to have failed completely to understand these things. He fails completely to understand the change that President Sadat's death has brought. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now more vital than ever that we do all we can to strengthen the solidarity of Egypt in the course on which that country was set by President Sadat. It is now more important and urgent than ever that all nations consider how serious it would be to the peace of the area if Egypt were to become destablished. One of the points on which the Leader of the Opposition relies in condemning the Government's decision in his assertion that a substantial majority of the Australian people is opposed to participation in the peacekeeping force. It is not at all surprising that many Australians feel that way. It is quite a normal reaction. It is like asking people whether they want their taxes increased. No doubt none of us want to be involved in these affairs but, if the issue is important enough, if the Government sees its responsibility and understands the circumstances much better than the average Australian, it has a responsibility to its people to give leadership. The Government does not make its decisions on the basis of public opinion polls; it makes its decisions on the basis of what it believes is right for Australia and for the peace of mankind. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition complained that the Government's decision was conditional upon participation by Britain and Canada. He said that if the Government believed so strongly that Australia should be involved, its decision should be unconditional. But, as the Prime Minister said, the point is that the peacekeeping force can be fully effective only if it is broadly based, with participation from a number of significant countries. The terms and conditions of the peace Accords is that there be a multination force. What Australia wants is to be part of a force with standing, a force with credibility, a force of like-minded nations. That is why we want to see Canada and the United Kingdom-</PARA>

There is great equivocation with some members of the Opposition on where their interests seem to lie. Since the death of President Sadat there has been a reassessment by many of the major European countries of the reservations they may have had before to meet the interests of some of the Arab countries who were personally resentful of President Sadat. They are reassessing the matter because they now realise how serious the situation is and how important it is to keep this peace process going. It would be quite unrealistic to have, as the Labor Party seems to want, a United Nations force. It is unrealistic because the Soviet Union has already declared its position and said that it will not support a United Nations force. The fact that there is no United Nations sponsorship does not mean that the rest of the world should bow and accept the failure of this peacekeeping force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I deplore very much the sentiments expressed by the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon in his vitriolic attack on the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr Begin. His intemperate language contributes nothing to the cause we are all seeking to support. Everybody should be doing his utmost to bring about some sort of lasting peace within the Middle East. We should all be contributing to finding a solution to the Palestinian question. That problem must be resolved, but there is a chance, a hope, of achieving something in that direction only if the first stage of the peace accords can be achieved, that is, the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the Sinai Peninsula. Already two-thirds of that force have been withdrawn, but the Israelis are demanding that there be a peacekeeping force of the last one-third. When that withdrawal takes place there is a chance of the autonomy talks proceeding to try to resolve the Palestinian question. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe Australia has a direct and vital interest in the peace of the Middle East. That interest arises from trade but, more importantly, we have an interest in maintaining stability and peace in that area. Australia has a long history of contributing to peacekeeping activities. Australian policemen have been in Cyprus. We contributed to the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Indonesia in 1947, Kashmir in 1950, Korea in 1950, and Palestine in 1956. In 1963 we have had observers on the United Nations Yemen observation mission, and in 1962-63 we were with the United Nations group in Papua New Guinea. In 1975 Mr Peacock asked the then Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Labor Government a question about possible Australian participation in a Middle East peacekeeping operation. Mr Whitlam conveyed the answer on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The answer stated:</PARA>
<PARA> On 29 October 1973 the Australian Permanent Representative to the United Nations informed senior officers of the U.N. in New York that, if requested, Australia would be prepared then to offer a joint force of approximately 440 personnel to the UNEF being set up following the October 1973 war between Israel, and Egypt and Syria. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on:</PARA>
<PARA> On 30 September 1974 the Prime Minister, in his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, said: 'We wish Australia to be always among the first nations from which the United Nations would ask for peace-keeping forces: We shall be among the first to respond.'</PARA>

That will depend on whether two other governments approve. I can think of nothing more ridiculous. The people of Australia who are listening to this debate will say: 'Are they going to send the force or not?' The answer depends on whether Canada and the United Kingdom agree. I have spoken to Mr MacGuigan, who is the Foreign Minister for Canada, and the Canadians have no intention of joining the force. Does that leave us in the position--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says that a lot of people have changed their minds. Could I have a chance to continue the debate? The point the Canadian Foreign Minister was making was that Canada has plenty of other commitments. If we get the message that the Canadians are not going to join the peacekeeping force, all this debate will be irrelevant. We will assume that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) believes we have to have this debate this evening, although for what reason I do not know. He has had no answer to his letter. However, he has gone on record as saying that it might leak out. Of course, the Government is well known for its leaks. Let me put on record what we know to be the situation. Earlier this year the Deputy Prime Minister visited the Middle East and was interviewed on his attitude to a peacekeeping force. He made the clear statement, and it has come out in this House by way of interjection, that he did not mind, provided it was under the auspices of the United Nations. He made that statement himself. Our policy is just that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has nothing at all to do with the Russians. Let me make that very clear. I would like an opportunity to talk intelligently about the matter. On 8 August Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia put forward eight proposals for peace. We fully support the Saudi Arabian Proposals. How can there be peace in the Middle East when we ignore all the Arabs who are there? Is it not a matter of record that Saudi Arabia is the best bridge between all the Arabs? It is certainly the country from which the oil comes. It is certainly the country where the United States is anxious to preserve some credibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will come to the nub of the matter. Two-thirds of the Prime Minister's speech passed before he could identify the real issue. He spoke about everything else, but then it came to this: A solution to the Palestinian issue is clearly central to the future stability and peace of the Middle East. How is the Palestinian issue to be solved? Will it be solved by bombing Beirut and killing civilians? Will it be solved by destroying an Iraqui reactor? Will it be solved by Shamir, who is the Foreign minister for Israel, saying no, he will not abdicate from the West Bank? It is not on, from his point of view. Why is it that we are to commit our troops to this area? It is fundamentally clear that the Arab-Israeli conflict derives from the non-resolution of the Palestinian problem. The Palestinian problem has been the principal unifying factor with the Arabs. The failure to solve the Palestinian problem has resulted in a deepening of Arab political alienation from the West. The non-resolution of the Palestinian problem has been the most important factor frustrating Western attempts to co-opt the Arab countries into an overt Western aliance. Is that not important?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member makes a stupid interjection about debating the issue. Here we are discussing the Palestinian matter. Let us make it clear that the issue is an independent Palestinian state on the West Bank. Let us look at what is happening. We should be trying to give some prestige and stability to the Saudi Arabians but there is a good chance that we will destroy them. If we destroy them we will destabilise the whole of the Middle east. That being the position, should we not be discussing the concept of the Saudis being the moderating influence? What about Australia taking the initiative and suggesting that we should agree with what the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia suggested as early as the first week in August. Why was what he said not accepted? The Israeli Prime Minister Begin said he did not like it. Is that sufficient reason to reject it? Unless we give some prestige to the people who can negotiate in this area nobody can be reconciled to the proposition that there will be peace in the Middle East with the Palestinian terrorists and the Lebanon. Have honourable members opposite discussed with their Lebanese constituents the possibility that the Lebanon is about to be destroyed because war has been exported into the Lebanon. Do honourable members opposite not understand the problems of that nation? They talk about not wanting it to be divided. Can they not think of a more divisive matter in their constituencies than the fact that there is no solution for these Lebanese people? Let me make it very clear that on 21 April Begin protested vigorously to the United States of America about the proposed sale of AWACs aircraft to Saudi Arabia, claiming that it would be a threat to the security of Israel. I wish to put on record what Saudi oil Minister Yamani had to say. On the next day in New York he said that Israel, not the Soviet Union posed the primary threat to Saudi Arabia. He said that Israel is the opening through which the Russians will creep into the Arab world. Have honourable members opposite got that? That is what Yamani said. He said also that if countries planned against a Russian threat when the real threat was to the internal or regional instability of the Arab people they would miss the whole point. Pressing countries such as Saudi Arabia to accept an American military commitment only contributes to the instability of that country and threatens the very security of the United States itself. The record speaks for itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ostensibly what we are about is fulfilling the Camp David Accords. There are two elements to those Accords. The first is that the Sinai should be given back to Egypt. The second, running parallel with it, is that there should be full autonomy for the West Bank and Gaza. Nothing has happened with respect to the latter. What has happened on the West Bank bears a bit of description. The evidence is that Israel is continuing to establish settlements on the West Bank. There are 15,000 Israeli settlers in that area and they represent the most militant of all people. Arab lands on the West Bank have been expropriated. In June of this year the Begin Government established Israeli courts for the Jewish settlers there. As far as Shamir is concerned, the solution is for the Palestinians to settle in Jordan. That would be fine if it were possible to get every other Arab to agree with it. Let us put on record also what Cyrus Vance said about the Camp David Accords. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It was agreed at Camp David that there should be full autonomy for the West Bank and Gaza. It was understood by the parties that full, and I underline full, autonomy meant exactly what the words indicated. </PARA>
<PARA>What did he say about Reagan? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Reagan Administrative has sought to push this issue far to the back of the stove and has not developed a policy with respect to this critical matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that not the real problem that we are debating here? How can we commit Australian forces without a guarantee of peace in that area and when we are not looking at the real crux of the problem as it was identified by the Prime Minister. The Palestinian issue is the one that has to be solved. We will not solve the problems of Egypt by putting a force of 2,500 in the Sinai. The problems of Egypt are basic. The problem that Mubarak now faces is a resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism whose supporters are opposed to Egypt's Western style of government. We are now asked to bolster up Mubarak in these crucial days by putting 2,500 troops in the Sinai. They would not last one day if war broke out. The Prime Minister said that in his statement. He used the delightful expression that if war broke out between Egypt and Israel, of course, we would not remain there. I do not know what he means by the use of that expression. The crux of his statement was that so much depends on Prime Minister Begin. I make it very clear that we are firmly of the view that the state of Israel must exist, but it has to be on the basis that the Palestinians also are entitled to co-existence. Mr Begin does not subscribe to that view. That is the difficulty in which we find ourselves. If Begin is of that particular view-he has expressed it-and if his Government is of that view why is the Government suggesting that in any shape or form we can get stability in the Middle East? One of the parties there says: 'I will not agree to any settlement on the West Bank in accordance with the Camp David Accords'.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the two fundamental elements of the treaty was that the Sinai should go back to Egypt. The other was directed to solving the Palestinian problem. It has not been solved. What then happens to the treaty? Are we to rely on a letter that President Carter wrote to Anwar Sadat saying that he would contribute a peacekeeping force? Are we to say that that letter constitutes another treaty? It is completely contradictory to what the Camp David Accords are about. The Camp David Accords provided that there should be a peacekeeping force under the auspices of the United Nations and that it should not contain elements from any one member of the United Nations Security Council. Does the Government not see the danger to which it is subjecting our forces in the belief that the only way to solve the problem is to have a force virtually under United States control? We all know that the United States has pressured this Government into joining the Sinai peacekeeping force. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears from the statement made by the Prime Minister that he is not worried about any leaks. He is more concerned to announce quickly that he will go to the Sinai if the two other Governments will go. His announcement will not influence those other governments to make a decision that they will go. I find outrageous the suggestion that we have any clear national policy of our own. How much more constructive it would be if we passed a resolution this evening to the effect that we welcome peace in the Middle East, we recognise the right of Israel to exist, we recognise the right of the Palestinians to exist, we accord with the principles of peaceful co-existence, and urge that there be some discussion with the Saudis on the eight-point plan put forward by the Crown Prince in the first week of August. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does the Government have to be beholden to Begin in what he has said? He has lost his reputation in the eyes of the world. Nobody in the world would support the bombing of Beirut or the destruction of the Iraqi reactor-not even right-minded Israelis, certainly those in Australia. They do not accept Begin as a leader. He is somewhat irrational from the point of view in his understanding of the problems of his own people. Whilst it is his conviction that he will survive by getting the United States to come in alongside him with a peacekeeping force, that has doubtful value for the reasons that I have mentioned. How in the name of fortune can the Government say to the Australian people that everything will be all right when we know that every Arab state is against what we are about? How can we destabilise Saudi Arabia and jeopardise the Saudi's chance to do something about the situation?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is talking about oil. The Saudis have made it very clear that if war breaks out in the Middle East they will first destroy the oil wells. The Saudis have made it very clear that they want a solution to the Palestinian problem. Why does this Government run away from it and then try to hawk its principles for trade? It is worried about trade which amounts to a measly few dollars, but it is not worried about the lives of our servicemen. Are those the standards of the Government? Is that how honourable members opposite want to carry on this debate? Clearly, trade does not come into it. The issue is one of principle and peace in the Middle East-the lives of people. That is what comes into it. I ask honourable members opposite whether they heard the Lebanese tonight talking about 100,000 dead in recent years. Yet we talk about peace in that area. If the Government wants to buy oil why does it not take some notice of the Saudi's proposition? Why does the Government not take a stand and say what we are about? We will support it in any multinational peacekeeping force that is under the United Nations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this statement of the Prime Minister (Malcolm Fraser) because it indicates Australia's support, even if it is conditional, for a peace initiative of great importance to the whole world. We are talking of a small contribution to a force established for peaceful purposes at the request of two countries at peace to be located on peaceful territory, which makes any analogy with Vietnam, to which many opponents of this force in the Australian Labor Party have alluded, absolutely ludicrous. To say that the force is therefore not necessary is to ignore both the history of the Sinai and the history of relations between Egypt and Israel. These two countries were at war for decades with the Sinai as the battleground, and the Sinai itself is an area of great strategic importance to both countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given these circumstances, this history and the sacrifices made by both these nations-Egypt in its relations with the Arab world and Israel in its major territorial concession-it is only natural that they should request a matchmaker and monitor in the nature of this force while this most important part of the peace treaty is being implemented. It is only natural that they and we would want this force to be of sufficient international representation as to give their initiatives the credibility and international status and confidence required to proceed in their bid for peace in a region where so many of the countries see the only peaceful solution as being the obliteration of Israel and to visit yet another holocaust on the Jewish people. We, by this statement, are showing to the world that there has to be a peaceful settlement, recognising the right of Israel to exist in peace with secure boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not just a moral commitment to the state of Israel as the only true democracy in the area-a state a quarter of the size of Tasmania existing precariously in an area surrounded by implacable enemies committed to its ultimate destruction. There is more than that compelling moral justification. Our participation is justified and made necessary on other grounds also. This force, requested by both Egypt and Israel under United Nations sponsorship or otherwise, was the subject of an important part of the Camp David agreements which the Australian Government and the Australian Parliament fully supported. Last year, following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, this Government's diplomatic actions against the Soviet Union were defended by indicating that peace and stability in the Middle East was very much a part of Australia's security interest. That position has not changed. More than this, our regional security interests do not alter the fact that Australia is part of the Western alliance. That alliance, which includes our South East Asian trading partners, has a vital strategic interest in supporting free world interests and peace in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> I let the Labor Party ponder on what would happen if all countries adopted its position on this matter. It would enable the Arab world, particularly the hard line rejectionist states, to assert that there was no comprehensive international support for Camp David, that Sadat's death was justifiable, that Sadat was wrong and that peace cannot be achieved if we recognise the right of Israel to exist. This Labor Party approach would dangerously isolate both President Mubarak's Egypt, when he desperately needs support for continuing the peace initiative, and Israel, when it is forsaking valuable territory. I ask members of the Labor Party: Do they want to isolate the two countries who have made the only bid for peace in the Middle East and the two countries whose strength and peaceful relationship is vital to Western interests in the Middle East? If all middle power countries adopted the Labor Party's view, would they not be encouraging, by their non-participation, American and super-power unilateralism in the Middle East? That is hardly a recipe for peace in the region or in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, of course, we have the Labor Party attitude, with a few exceptions, of now reacting almost automatically against any foreign policy initiatives of the United States of America and now against Israel, ignoring many of the counterveiling forces at work. Why does the Labor Party never criticise the Soviet Union? Why does it not sometimes criticise the Palestine Liberation Organisation in debates such as this? Whether we like it or not, there happens to be two super-powers in this world-the Soviet Union, totalitarian, suppressive of human rights and militarily aggressive internationally; and the United States, militarily strong, but supportive of free world principles. In the final analysis I know where I stand and where our interests lie, but that does not mean that we support the United States blindly or lose our independence in foreign policy initiatives. We have already shown that by not responding to this issue immediately and without careful consideration and satisfaction of our own interests. We have shown it by our decision not to participate in the United States rapid deployment force and by the conditions of our participation outlined by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> But when we agree with the United States on initiatives such as Camp David, surely we should not continue to say to the United States: 'You bear the burdens; you pay all the costs'. Once again there would not be a concerted resolve and a willingness within the Western alliance to work together and share the burdens involved in maintaining peace and protecting Western interests and initiatives. Would we not, by failing to participate, jeopardise the whole Israeli-Egyptian peace bid and increase further the potential for conflict in this region and between those two countries? Would we not instead, by accepting the Labor Party line, accept the views of nations such as Syria, Iraq, Libya, Ethiopia and the Soviet Union and the PLO, most of which accept the destruction of Israel as the only peace solution. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree that United Nations sponsorship of this force would have been desirable; we all do. But let us look at the appalling logic of the Australian Labor Party on this issue. It comes to me that many of those who do not support our participation would agree to it if it were under United Nations sponsorship. In other words, the concept of the force itself is not necessarily open to question. To these people I just say that the peace treaty documents made specific provision for the United States to organise and maintain an alternative force in the absence of United Nations support. The peace treaty itself is based on United Nations Resolution 242 which we accept as the basis for a negotiated settlement to the Arab-Israeli dispute. More than that, a failure to mount a credible force, if due to an absence of United Nations sponsorship, will amount to abandoning a peace initiative at the request of the Soviet Union which has a vested interest not in peace but in tension in this area. It is the Soviet Union which has prevented this force from being a United Nations sponsored force. </PARA>
<PARA> On the autonomy question, we all agree that a lasting peaceful settlement in the Middle East requires a solution of the Palestinian problem. This Government, through United Nations Resolution 242, has always accepted that proposition. Progress must be made in this area, but it does not involve concessions coming just from Israel. The Arab world must also make some concessions, as President Sadat did. People seem to forget that the hard line Arab world opposes this force because it opposes Camp David. It opposes Camp David because Camp David recognises the right of Israel to exist. That is why the PLO has not allowed any West Bank Palestinians to be involved in the autonomy process. The Arabs are going to have to make concessions too. The Labor Party has not recognised that fact so far in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> People seem to forget also that Israel took the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt in a defensive war. The two areas had been under Arab rule for 19 years with no thought being given to establishing a Palestinian state. The Arabs rejected a Palestinian state when the United Nations proposed it in 1947. If Israel has an obligation, as it does, to negotiate about the West Bank, it is certainly with the party from which it took the West Bank-Jordan. There is no question that the autonomy talks must proceed. They are the key to a lasting peace, and Israel must make major concessions. But I think it ironic that Arabs demand that Israel do for the West Bank and Gaza what they were unwilling to do at a time when Israel had no say in the matter. Neither should we forget that although the Arab world objects to Egyptian-Israeli negotiations for Palestinian autonomy, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other moderate Arab states have consistently taken the position that Egypt has the right to negotiate for the return of its sovereign territory. Surely if this force is an internationally credible one, we and other nations and the United States are in a better position to influence both Israel and the moderate Arab world to make the necessary concessions on the autonomy issue. But the Labor Party does not allow for that in its position on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly it was a condition of the peace treaty that the autonomy talks should proceed. This acknowledges the link between the two accords. It also acknowledges that the autonomy discussions will be long, complex and difficult, with even the Arab world undecided as to the most appropriate solution to the Palestinian problem. But this peace initiative between Egypt and Israel must not be thwarted by continuing delays in the autonomy talks which deal with the more fundamental and more complex peace negotiations and which are of much more concern to the Arab world. Furthermore, Sadat was also frustrated by the delays in this autonomy process. He would not sacrifice the peace treaty on these grounds and therefore, neither should we. Everyone says that Egypt had had enough of war when it came to the negotiating table. Believe me, so has Israel. It has had enough of it too, and it will make reasonable concessions if the Arab world will. But we cannot blame Israel for being a little nervous, given the current attitudes of the rejectionist Arab states. The Labor Party does not seem to concede this, and has not done so to date in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is every indication that Israel now wants to make further progress in these negotiations. It will rightly come under increasing pressure to do so. Sharon, the Israeli Defence Minister, has been undertaking initiatives to convince Arab leaders in the administered territories to join in the negotiating process, but concessions have to be made by both sides and Israel cannot be expected to withdraw from strategic territory to make it easier for some Arab states to destroy her. It is up to countries such as Australia and all who may participate in the force to make it a condition of our participation that progress be made on the entire Camp David peace process, and the Prime Minister has clearly stated this in his statement to the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome these conditions in the statement and also the condition against any involvement in the Rapid Deployment Force. I must say that in my view there has been an exaggeration in public debate as to the way in which participants in this force could become involved in a wider conflict involving the United States. This force simply does not have the capacity to be involved in that kind of conflict. The major powers maintain their military presence in the region in other ways-by arming their allies, by access to defence facilities in friendly nations in the region and, of course, by maintaining a naval presence in the north-western Indian Ocean and in the Mediterranean. The nature of this force and the conditions of participation outlined by the Prime Minister provide the appropriate safeguards for this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary I want to say that I support this statement. It recognises that we all have a role to play in assisting the peace initiatives undertaken courageously by both Sadat and Begin. It may not be the perfect peace solution, but in the Middle East surely we do what we can when we can where we can to secure peace, to encourage further peace and to encourage the major participants to make the necessary concessions and to seek to replace attitudes of mindless violence with reason and realism, as Sadat did. I support this statement as a very small step in that direction and I deeply regret the position taken by the Labor Party in abandoning this peace process because of its ideological, unbalanced and dangerous attitude towards Israel. In all my time in this Parliament I have never heard a more disgusting, unbalanced and outrageous diatribe against the state of Israel, against the United States and, by strong implication, in favour of the PLO. It was totally unbalanced, blaming Israel and Begin for all the sins of the Middle East. But did we hear the Opposition leaders talk about Gaddafi? Did we hear them talk about Arafat? They did not rate a mention. The rejectionist states did not rate a mention. Of course, they blamed the terrible United States and the terrible Israel. I want to know where the so-called moderate members of the Australian Labor Party stand on this issue. I challenge them to stand in this Parliament and to say that they still support the state of Israel. Will the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), a friend of Israel, privately stand in this Parliament to state his position on this issue?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment and oppose this Government's decision which will regrettably lead to another needless division in the Australian community. The Middle East is the most unstable region in the world. Let me say honestly that we all seek a peaceful solution. We tend to underrate or fail to understand the enormous complexities of the problems in the Middle East. The difficulty with the proposed Sinai force is that the reasons for it and the debate about it consider only the current strategic preoccupations of the United States and much of the West. These have to do with maintaining the limited achievements of the Camp David process towards peace and, with it, the influence of the United States upon both Israel and Egypt. The United States Middle East preoccupation is not with the settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict per se, or rather what we should call the Palestinian problem, but with achieving a strategic consensus about what the United States regards as the major threat to the Middle East region, namely, the threat of Soviet influence and expansion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The United States, therefore, in its Middle East policies is, to coin a phrase, fighting the wrong war. In its global preoccupations it has lost sight of the central regional issue of the Middle East which is the Palestinian question and Arab nationalism which can be summed up as much of the region's desire to solve its own problems without the involvement of outside global powers. The Middle East conflict is, therefore, a conflict about the Palestinians first and foremost. It is not primarily an extension of superpower conflict in the region as the countries of the region have made abundantly clear. At the time of the announcement of the Carter doctrine and its Rapid Deployment Force post-Afghanistan, the Arab countries rejected the proposition that a Soviet threat to the region was the major factor threatening its security and stability. They protested that for them it was the Palestinian issue that is first and foremost. But still the Reagan Administration insists that it is external threats to the region from the Soviet Union or its proxies which are the key and it has sought a strategic consensus accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble with the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is that it accepted the United States view of the Middle East which is one which holds that the root of the problem is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union participated in the Geneva meetings which were the major agency for the search for a Middle East peace until Carter initiated the Camp David Accords. The Middle East peace process then became an American preserve, when I believe it ought to remain an international one to avoid the introduction of global conflict and to give the Soviet Union, as well as the United States, a vested interest in its success. By remaining an issue of general international concern and responsibility, the suspicion of individual and particular interests, so strongly held in some quarters, would have been removed. I believe that the Arab countries reject this priority. They believe that the United States is fighting the wrong battle in the region and has contributed to their suspicion of a United States inspired and led Sinai peace force. They fear that, first and foremost, its purpose will be to serve United States global interests, which may or may not include those of the region. The Sinai force is, in any case, a product of the Camp David Accords, which the Arab countries reject, not least because they fail to address the central issue, namely, the Palestinian question. </PARA>
<PARA> Most people associate the creation of the state of Israel with the atrocities that were perpetrated against the Jews during the Second World War. In that sense Israel and the support for it-and I support Israel-is at least in part a salve to our consciences for the recent period of history. The creation of the state of Israel dates back beyond that. Biblical Israel was settled upon primarily on account of the eventual support of the British Government for the creation of a homeland for the Jews in Palestine. It is unquestionably clear that Britain's reasons for supporting Israel were not in any way altruistic. Its motives were strategic and imperialistic. Although there were serious misgivings in the governing circles of Britain at the time, the Balfour Declaration of 1917 committed the British Government and thus the West to a course of action, the consequences of which remain with us today. The Palestinians were displaced by the eventual creation of the state of Israel, and this has led to enormous political, social and strategic problems. It was, perhaps, not until oil gave the Arabs the capacity to command some influence, more than a decade later, that we began to consider in a serious way the case of the people dispossessed in the enthusiasm to create a homeland for the Jews. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to honourable members opposite that the force of nationalism is a factor which must be taken into account in dealing with the Middle East. We failed in 1956. It is surprising that the British took so long to face this. After all, they had the benefit of their Irish, South African and Burmese experiences. In the end, they learned that economic betterment makes no appeal whatever to nationalists as an alternative to self-determination. Birthrights are not to be sold for a mess of pottage. If anything, economic betterment merely stimulates the passion for freedom. The whole train of events in Palestine since 1917 confirms this. A study by the Carnegie Foundation for International Peace on the economic consequences of Israel's occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank of the Jordan similarly concluded that 'although these territories had become much richer, the improved economic situation in no way abated or will abate nationalist demands'. The whole question went deeper than the wording of the intention of the Balfour Declaration. On the one side there was a minority determined to become a majority; on the other side, a majority determined to remain one. The political history of Palestine between 1917 and 1948 was a ruthless struggle for mastery between an indigenous population and a people whom they saw as invaders. A durable peace is secured by justice and what is seen to be justice by both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> In their fabulously long history the Jews have suffered many hideous and horrible injustices. The state of Israel will feel neither secure nor durable until the Palestinian people feel that the injustice done to them has been redressed. For them too there must be a national home. Two wrongs never make a right. The Jews were wronged and, with the creation of the state of Israel, the Palestinians were wronged. The Middle East conflict today stems essentially from that simple fact. It is a Palestinian conflict about Palestinian rights. Slowly the world is coming to accept that fact. It is reflected in the increasing international recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. That recognition has been growing among European Economic Community countries, which believe the Palestinians must be brought into the peace negotiations, as did, more recently, the participants at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has granted diplomatic recognition to the PLO. The United States Administration has been closely associated with support for Israel. Before President Sadat's death, on a visit to the United States he urged President Reagan to recognise the PLO as part of the new effort to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East. The United States has continued to insist, and I agree, that the Palestinians must recognise Israel's right to exist. While that is so, United States diplomats and others are privately conceding the necessity to bring the PLO into the peace negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> The efforts of the international community must therefore be concentrated on encouraging this development, which is as crucial as a Sinai force can ever be. The Sinai force is the product of the Camp David Accords, which most of the Arab world rejects because, regrettably, they do not take into account the Palestinian question. The credibility of the Camp David Accords is hence seriously in question. This is the first and foremost reason why Australia should not become involved in the peacekeeping force of their making. The terms of the treaty of peace require that an international force be in place by March of next year. In spite of the efforts, only the governments of Fiji, Colombia and Uruguay have announced that they will join the force. There are rumours that France will participate. There is a strong possibility that Canada and England will join the Sinai peacekeeping force. That will be well and good if it dilutes the United States component of the force. One observer has written:</PARA>
<PARA> Since the Reagan Administration came to power, there has been an impasse in the Middle East because the Americans, who have the power, are operating-like Eden 25 years ago-without any firm principle. </PARA>
<PARA> This provides an opportunity for Britain, which lacks the power (and this may be an advantage) but does have the experience and a degree of influence which could be used to good effect in support of a policy which can be seen to be clearly and firmly based on principle. </PARA>
<PARA> Britain's obligation is an inescapable one because of our past association with Palestine. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer honourable members to the time of the McMahon papers in 1915, to the Sykes-Picot Agreement, and to the statements by Wilson just after the First World War on what a disaster the British and French influence was, that it was intended merely that Britain should get control of Palestine and France control of Syria. Finally, there was a declaration by Wilson in which he referred to 'the whole disgusting scramble' for the Middle East and the mandates for former Turkish territories which were alloted at the San Remo conference in 1920-Syria and Lebanon to France, Palestine and Mesopotamia to Britain. I will quote a recent article by Naham Goldman in the Guardian this year: It is ironic to recall what he said. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> On the United Nations debate on the partition of Palestine and the creation of Israel, the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc countries voted in favour of such a move and helped to provide the necessary  2/3 majority. Shortly afterwards when the American Government was toying with the idea of reversing the United Nations decision and setting up a new mandate Gromyko threatened to use his veto in the Security Council. </PARA>
<PARA>We ought to remember that. The same man also stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I've been a Zionist politician now for more than 60 years. But there is one stand I've always taken since I was 17, and that is that there can be no future for the Jewish state unless agreement is reached with the Arabs. </PARA>
<PARA>The world is now obliged to grapple with a colonial and political legacy which will require tact, understanding, tolerance and diplomacy if we are to avoid disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by making a number of observations. Australian participation in the Sinai force would tie it to the Camp David Accords when it appears that there is less and less international support for them. More importantly, the Arabs, who must accept them if there is to be Middle East peace, do not accept them because they do not take into account the Palestinian factor. Whatever might be said about the Israeli Government's policies, the bedrock understanding amongst Jews is that Israel lives on a very narrow margin of security. It is extremely difficult, unless one is there on the front line, to make a responsible judgment about what will or will not affect the security of that country. Jewish criticism of Israel is always tempered by the conviction-we should remember it-that Jews had better not do anything that would endanger the survival of Israel. We ought to acknowledge that simple fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The British, as does the rest of the West, continue to act with ignorance of the future when the Middle East of tomorrow is being contemplated. Present actions by the West may appear to be for the best. The Koran says: 'Had I known the unknown I would have done more good'. If the West wants oil in the right quantity and at the right price and expects the Gulf to champion big production and moderate pricing; if it wants trade and development on its own terms largely dictated by the petro-dollar cycle; if it wants political stability in the region; if it, or at least the United States, wants to avoid a painful decision on Palestine; and, finally, if Washington, in particular, wants to pull together a tough regional line against the Soviet Union it must surely be accepted that, of all these interests, political stability is paramount, not that stability which freezes regimes, blocking necessary internal change and development. Single-minded peddling of reform in the Gulf is not the answer either. The West must not foist on the Gulf governments demands that they play an economic, commercial, political or military role which will undermine their chances of coming to maturity as governments and societies. I oppose the Government's initiative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member can have a go in a minute. Sir, will you cut that interruption off my time? That abominable creature will always do something stupid. I have been associated with this matter for a long time. I came into politics shortly after Israel became a state. I well remember having to participate in the Suez Canal debates when it was thought that the late R. G. Menzies would be able to get accommodation of his ideas. Regrettably, because of the actions of John Foster Dulles he was not able to do so. Equally, I remember the other problems that occurred with the attack by Israel and the corresponding attack by Egypt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have long since come to the conclusion that there are three areas of vital importance. I touch on one that has not been mentioned; that is, the Arabian Gulf. The Americans at the time of the Carter Government stated: 'The Arabian Gulf is vital to our existence. We will protect our rights to the limit'. Therefore, the Americans are very interested in it. I have mentioned Israel. My support for the Israelis is still as strong as it was before. There is also the case of Egypt. Who are the people who are inviting us as a country to come in to make our contribution to the success of the Camp David concepts? Those countries are none other than the United States, Egypt and Israel. Against that background it would be unbelievably difficult for us to resist the opportunity to go in to help, providing certain conditions were met. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to answer immediately the statement that was made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) who obviously did not know what he was talking about. He said, first of all, that there had to be a total solution to this problem. We are not looking for a total solution in one go; we think that Israel should leave the Sinai and that Egypt should move in to occupy the country that is certainly its own. We should play our part there. Then, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that we would be the ones to go in first but that others would determine what is to happen. Obviously, he did not understand what the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said when he pointed out that practical commitment will depend upon the decision of other governments. I believe it is probable that we will get Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand to come in. Of course, Monsieur Mitterand, the President of France, is a very great admirer and supporter of Israel, so we can rely on the French to come in to support if it is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> What do I think will happen immediately after the Israelis move out and the Egyptians move in? This will certainly strengthen the position of Egypt because it will not have to worry about its rear. It can pay greater attention to the problems that arise because of Libya. Exactly the same situation applies on the other side-there will be tremendous savings for Israel because it will not have to occupy territory and be continuously worried about what happens there. I come back to the simple facts. It would have been a matter of unbelievable shame for me if we had not taken some action to join in what will be the beginning, I hope, of further action to try to ensure a greater degree of peace in the Middle East, particularly the Arabian Gulf area. I do not believe for a moment that we will get a complete solution. Nobody can control Iran; nobody can do very much concerning other countries immediately to the north. The people in those countries cannot very easily be relied upon and they can change very much over the course of time. </PARA>
<PARA> We have stated our position. I think it is critically important that we give leadership to bring in other countries-and bring them in very quickly. I think particularly the United States will be pleased because we have shown leadership. Only this morning I was able to put to the Prime Minister in a question that I hoped he would provide leadership shortly. He immediately said yes but he would be making a statement later in the day. I feel proud of being an Australian. We put ourselves into that position and did exactly what the Australian people will, over the passage of time, regard as being absolutely essential. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to other things that were said. Firstly, there was criticism of Mr Begin. Obviously, the people on the other side cannot really know what Mr Begin is now doing. He clearly indicated that his attitudes have had to change since the regrettable death of Anwar Sadat, one of the great people in this world. It was a tremendous loss when he left us. We have to start all over again. To be critical of Begin against that background is something which I think is detestable and ought to be criticised bitterly. He will be playing a much better part now that his rear is secure than he was able to play before. Again I emphasise that he will give away nothing unless there is an agreement by the Palestine Liberation Organisation and a commitment by others to ensure that resolutions 242 and 337 are observed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) said that this was a very volatile area. Obviously, he does not know where the troops are going to. It is not troops who are involved anyhow but the transport section. It will be able to move quickly at any tick of the clock. The honourable gentleman should realise that there is the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the west, Israel to the east and the desert immediately south. What prospects will there be for serious danger to our troops? It is obvious that whoever drafted the Leader of the Opposition's speech really did not know what he was talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> He then went on to speak about the United Nations. Everyone knows that there is no way in which the United Nations can operate because the Soviet Union is still bent on ensuring that the greatest damage is done in the Middle East in the hope that, over time, the Soviet Union will be able to occupy areas that it regards as vitally important to it and, particularly, that it will be able to surround Iran. He then spoke about this small Australian community. I do not need to deal with that. But I do make it abundantly clear that it must be now obvious to the world, and to Australians in particular, that the Australian Labor Party has shown its contempt for and its dislike of Israel. </PARA>

I challenge the new honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) to tell us exactly where he stands so far as Israel is concerned. I challenge him to say that because we all know that his commitment to Israel is just as great as mine is and that he could not agree to anything that was said either by the leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. So that is the kind of case I wanted to put in the 10 mintues made available to me. I have taken only 10 minutes to allow other honourable members to speak. But above all I must make it abundantly clear that I believe that this is one step forward to ensuring that further actions can be taken to try to get peace in the Middle East. It will not happen in our time; that cannot be expected. But at least it will give far better opportunities for peace to be attained than we have ever had before. I believe that the memory of Sadat will be kept in mind.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I really think that the Government members who have spoken in this debate ought to modify the intensity of their rolling rhetoric and thundering hyperbole. When one looks at what is actually being proposed here, great statements of principle are made that we must not retreat from under any circumstances: but then we are told that they will be retreated from, however, if the Canadians and British do not agree to join the peacekeeping force. I think that sort of commitment deserves a slightly lower level of rhetoric and a slightly more temperate argument than we have had to this point. The second point I want to make-I do not make it in any defence of the Soviet Union, but it is necessary to correct one factual error-is that there has been no veto by the Soviet Union of this force. There was no majority on the Security Council for its creation. The veto may well have been exercised but I simply say, as a factual statement, that there was no majority on the Security Council compelling the Soviet Union to follow such a course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is much in the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) foreshadowing an Australian commitment to the Sinai peacekeeping force which is unexceptionable, and some of it is praiseworthy. In particular, he has for the first time stressed the overriding importance of a resolution of the issue of Palestinian autonomy on the West Bank. He also expressed a commitment to peace, rightly pointing out the dangers to global peace that have arisen from crises in the area. The action he has foreshadowed of committing Australian forces to the multilateral force is, however, based on an exaggerated assumption of the significance of that force and its composition to the peace process and the possibilities that involvement with it presents for Australia to play a role in concluding hostilities in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's miscalculation has probably hindered our capacity to play a role in the future peace-making process. It has done so unnecessarily within the terms of its own analysis of the situation. In the first place, the Camp David process has largely run its course. It is impossible not to admire the courage of the principal participants-Begin, Sadat and Carter-in the negotiation of the Accords. It is important to recognise that Israel took substantial risks in giving up the Sinai, denying itself defence in depth and trusting continued Egyptian non-belligerence beyond the period of the leadership of President Sadat. However, it has been very evident for some time now that the Camp David process brought no progress whatsoever toward a wider settlement of Middle East issues. If anything, coincidental with and possibly partly as a result of the Camp David process, tensions have been exacerbated on Israel's other borders. A successful resolution of the Palestinian question which is central to a final peace settlement seems even more distant. Israeli settlement in Arab territories on the West Bank has continued unabated with every settlement reducing the flexibility of and options open to the current and future Israeli prime ministers. The saliency of the moderate Arab position has been reduced by the effective deprivation of the moderate Arab bloc of Egyptian leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of these trends has been that the only moves towards a Middle East settlement, since the Camp David Accords that have had any real value, have been the efforts by some countries not party to it to broaden the base of the peace settlement. Saudi Arabia has been obliged to put forward, and be the advocate of, the moderate Arab position, though, despite its oil wealth, it is not a substantial power in the region. The Europeans have also sought to play a part. Indeed, it is significant that most assessments of whether the new Egyptian President will be successful in broadening the base of the peace settlement are based on the assumption that he is better placed than the late President Anwar Sadat to move outside the framework of the Camp David Accords to reunite moderate Arab opinion both to create the components for a complete settlement and to press Israel to accept it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an indication that the United States would not be unhappy were such a role to be played by Egypt. President Reagan fights desperately for his airborne warning and control systems deal with Saudi Arabia, at least in part, in the hope that the moderate bloc can be re-created with the United States still influential within it. Rather than this peacekeeping force being one which monitors a satisfactory settlement, it is being thrown into a cauldron of uncertainty at best to complete a process which, as a contribution to the future peace in the area, has run its course. It is in this light that the true significance of the peacekeeping force must be seen. It is not the fulcrum around which a peace settlement will revolve. It is peripheral to what will be the great issues in the Middle East in the future. It needs to be absolutely clearly understood also that Australia's participation is not vital to the success of the creation of the force and, by implication, the Government admits it when it says that it will not participate in the force if the Canadians and British do not participate. </PARA>
<PARA> Irrespective of this Government's final decision, the force will be in place and will perform its function. Unquestionably, our participation would be welcomed by the United States, Israel, Egypt and anyone else participating. Australia has some credibility as a democratic and constructive power in international affairs. In addition, all three nations have experienced intense criticism for the partial peace they have negotiated. They will greet with relief anyone else prepared to take the heat. But we are welcomed in this context: As a supporter of the actions of the major actors. We are not invited to play a major role. Even more important than that we are not vital to the creation of the force and, therefore, the success of whatever of the objectives it seeks to serve. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads to the question of whether it is in Australia's interests to participate. As we are not vital to the success of the force and as the force itself is not central to the next moves for a Middle East peace, we have to have very good reason to be there. Realistic analysis teases forth no such good reasons. We do have an overriding interest in a Middle East peace. We have very little capacity to influence nations towards that course. What little influence we have will be worthless if we are unable to influence both sides. Whatever the Government might think of the private posture of Arab governments, as opposed to their public posture of extreme hostility to the Sinai peacekeeping force, that public posture has been held remarkably strongly for some years now. It is a hostility reflected more extremely in the proliferating Islamic fundamentalist movements which are placing pressures on all Arab states in the region, including Egypt, and to which the Egyptian Government will begin, as it is now, to respond. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible for the United States, France or Britain to run a two-track Middle East policy. Geographic proximity, historical involvement, power and weight in the international community mean those states will influence Middle Eastern affairs irrespective of their decisions on the Sinai force. Australia will not. We do not have the tradition of involvement, we do not have the power or the proximity to the area of these great states. We do not have the massive markets and technical expertise to offer the Arab states. All we have is an international reputation of sympathy with Third World concerns, nurtured amongst others by our current Prime Minister. This is not enough. That reputation, which would have been of value in placing our contribution on the agenda of a broader Middle East settlement, will be squandered by the decisions announced here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Our force will be the object of the hostility of dissident elements in Egypt. It will be part of a force, significant participants in which will have their own fish to fry. It will be the hostage to the good will of a wide variety of countries and movements which feel matters in the area with an intensity, complexity, sophistication and beligerence scarcely comprehendable to the average Australian. If honourable members do not think that an American-based force, whatever the good reason for its presence in the Sinai, will not be the target of Islamic fundamentalist terrorists in Egypt or the PLO passing through to conduct operations in Israel, they are living in a fools paradise. It will achieve nothing that has not been achieved by others. It will involve us in the policies of others compelling us to unacceptable options of compromising our position or withdrawing. The independence the Prime Minister seeks for the Australian part of the force is a phantom. </PARA>
<PARA> What are we going to gain, having compromised our capacity to play any role in the next stage of a Middle East peace settlement? The odious suggestion has been put forward by some that we have made a negative gain by demonstrating again to the United States that we are a reliable ally and worthy of protection. This argument really needs to be knocked on the head. I suspect that in the months ahead, as the Government abandons the high road in explaining its policy and takes the low road, it will feature a little more prominently than it has to this point, although it was beginning to be picked up. The tom toms are out among the Government back benchers in this debate, if not their leadership. If the alliance is not guaranteed by the significant role we play in the south-western Pacific and South East Asia, if it is not guaranteed by the significance of the joint facilities in this country for the United States strategic deterrent, if it is not guaranteed by the other offers of co-operation made by the Government at Cockburn Sound and Darwin, it will not be guaranteed by a 200 to 300 man force in the Sinai. So let us get rid of that nonsense straight away. Whatever we feel about the future, the balance of advantage in the alliance to this point has been with and continues to be with the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> For this chimera, for this deprivation of a role in the next phase of a Middle East peace settlement, we jeopardise real Australian interests. The first of these is our overriding obligation to plan, structure, equip and deploy our forces for the defence of Australia and the stability of our immediate area of strategic concern. We have come a long way since the days when we chased the tails of our allies all over the globe. Under the Whitlam Government, and to an extent under this Government as well, we have sat down to plan our capacity to stand alone and contribute to the security of our immediate region. This commitment is a throwback to days left behind. Some 200 to 300 men may not sound like many. It is, however, considerable when taken out of a readily available Australian force of a few thousand. As yet we do now know the costing arrangements. Whatever they are they will at least be a moderate subtraction from the focus of what our defence expenditure should now be on our maritime strike capacity. It would be useful if for a couple of clear decades we could abandon the conservative romanticism and idealism which has so obscured our capacity to get to grips with and sustain public interest in our real, hard interests in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Middle East has been an expanding area of economic interest to Australia. This is particularly the case in my home State of Western Australia with which the Gulf states are now the third largest and most rapidly expanding trade partners. There has been much cynicism suggesting that opponents of the commitment within the Government ranks have been prepared to sacrifice peace for trade. What a terrible thing to say of the National Country Party! Our only influence with the Arab bloc is largely due to our economic links-the food and technical assistance we provide. Without question, a significant role has been played by the current Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) in expanding those links. We may or may not jeopardise the economic gains we make from our Middle East trade; we will certainly jeopardise what influence the trade process gives us with the Arab governments on Middle East peace questions that this commitment will entail. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an unnecessary commitment. It is unnecessary within the terms of the government's own analysis of the situation. It is conditional upon the involvement of the Canadians, the British and a number of other factors. If the Government is serious that it will do all the things the Government suggests it will do, we can only assume, from the Government's own logic, that whether we, the Canadians or the British participate, all those objectives which the Government sought via the Sinai Accords will be achieved. If this is not true a number of Ministers in the Government and their back benchers will have conscience-stricken sleep tonight. So I will take the Government at its word on this matter and support its analysis of the situation-the subterranean analysis that is, of the Government's position-if not its overt rhetoric. It is a debilitating commitment in terms of our reputation for independence. Its only saving grace is that the Prime Minister's qualifications still leave him with an out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I consider this to be a very solemn occasion indeed. It is rather remarkable that it comes on a day which has been set down by the United Nations as the national and international day of peace. Could a greater contribution have been made to the whole concept of peace-peace in its purest sense-than the proposition that was put before us today by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in such splendid and excellent terms? While I am on that subject, I think tribute should be paid to both our Prime Minister and our Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony). The Prime Minister has become an international figure representing humanitarianism on the African continent. The Deputy Prime Minister has become synonymous with peace and trade in the Middle East. I do not think there is a person in this chamber who does not acknowledge that the Palestinians should have land in which to settle. But I cannot agree in any way with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) who presented the proposition that suggests that if we go into the Sinai to try to fill the vacuum left by the Soviet Union, which is supposedly the great champion of peace, yet vetoed the establishment of a peace force--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member can support the Soviets, if he wishes. The facts are that the Soviets in effect vetoed any attempt by the United Nations to provide a peacekeeping force in the Sinai. Let us look at this situation. If this whole proposition falls apart, if the peacekeeping force suggested for the Middle East is not available, there has to be some peacekeeping force there. So we fill the vacuum. The world is clamouring for peace. In the hearts of each and every person throughout the length and breadth of all nations must inevitably be the desire for peace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we examine the two addresses which were made to this chamber prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner, we see that one was a plea-a plea even to the Opposition-to face up to the only proposition that has ever come forward which really establishes a peacekeeping force. I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) astounded and embarrassed many honourable members on his side of the House with his tirade against Israel. He made no suggestions and put forward no proposition concerning establishing a land for the Palestinians. All he did was to attack the Prime Minister the Begin Government and just about everybody else. At no stage did he suggest that President Sadat had made a contribution, or that the Egyptian people, the Israeli people, the Lebanese people and the people in Iran and Iraq had bled enough and yearned for peace. </PARA>
<PARA> What is Australia to do? Senator Church was out here within the last 24 hours. His visit and his lecture tour were sponsored by the Jewish community. He is no friend of President Reagan and he makes no secret of that fact. Yet he, of all people, applauded President Carter and the United States of America and those who are game enough and have the guts enough to stand with them and proclaim a genuine effort for peace. This is what it is all about. We have been asked to confine our remarks to a very limited period. One could speak on this subject for a long time and one could become understandably emotional. Does the House not think that the people in that area have bled enough-I mean bled enough? Tens of thousands of people in Lebanon have been slaughtered and will be slaughtered. Strangely, not very much mention has been made of that carnage, which is what it is. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with this remark, regrettably, because I have so much to say: I remember well a discussion I had with a very senior person at Whitehall, a Mr Tyrrell. He said: 'We support the Camp David agreement on the understanding that it is the first step towards peace in the Middle East. Once that has been established we will then turn to the autonomy of the Palestinians, the Left Bank, Gaza'. The extraordinary aspect of the speech by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) was that he talked about us supporting Israel right down the line. Good heavens, where is the land going back to? It is going back to Egypt. Israel is losing the land and it is going back to Egypt. After that has been settled, the next logical step will involve the Palestinians, the Left Bank, Gaza. I am sure the whole world was thrilled by the courage of Sadat. His name was on the lips of just about everybody throughout the world. His memory will be tarnished and Australia will stand condemned if it says to the United States: 'We want your support; we want you to protect us at a time of emergency, but you go it alone in the Sinai'. That is just not on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) informed the Australian people of his decision to have Australia participate in the Sinai peacekeeping force, subject to certain conditions. But 10 days ago, on 12 October, the Prime Minister informed the President of the United States of America, and no doubt the Governments of Egypt and Israel, of that decision. He also confessed to having had discussions with the Prime Ministers of Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting which ended on 7 October. The Australian people and this Parliament were the last to know that Australian forces were again to be committed overseas by a Liberal government. The Prime Minister has treated the Australian people and the Parliament with the contempt for which he is renowed. The only reason he came in here this afternoon, 10 days after telling President Reagan and more than a fortnight after letting everybody else in the world know of his decision, was that he was scared that news of the commitment would leak out. It is a national disgrace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The terms of the announcement are a further national disgrace. What they prove is that the Liberal Party of Australia is incapable of making a decision in Australia's national interest. For decades conservative governments have taken their cue from great and powerful friends. This occasion is no exception. The Prime Minister, obviously unsure of his capacity to make an Australian decision, has hedged his bets by making Australian participation conditional upon the agreement of Britain and Canada to participate. This preposterous condition makes a farce of the Prime Minister's assertion that:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's decision was taken on a completely independent basis. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Prime Minister really believed his rhetoric, he would have had no hesitation at all in making a commitment. He would not have had to wait for a ring-around for supportive advice. The manner of this agreement indicates in the most compelling terms both his inadequacy and the inadequacy of his arguments. Let us strip to the bare facts the histrionics of the Prime Minister's statement, accompanied as it was by constant references to spurious and irrelevant arguments about what constitutes peace in the Middle East. The bare facts are that the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt has as its objective the return to Egypt of the Egyptian territory that Israeli forces occupied during 1967 and which Israel has held ever since. In return for that, Egypt recognised the right of Israel to live in peace, with secure and recognised boundaries, free from threats or acts of force. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the Prime Minister that the two Accords that make up the Camp David Accords are 'not separate and discrete but interconnected two parts of a total and very carefully negotiated package'. Where I differ from the Prime Minister is with the jump in his argument that the Sinai peacekeeping force is directly relevant to both the treaty between Egypt and Israel and the Accords on the framework of peace in the Middle East. The two questions that we in this Parliament and the Australian people have to address are simply: What is the purpose of the peacekeeping force and is it necessary for Australia to participate? Article VI of the Annex to the peace treaty in the Camp David Accords states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parties will request the United Nations to provide forces and observers to supervise the implementation of this Annex and employ their best efforts to prevent any violation of its terms. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the terms of the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. In explanation of the procedures, the appendix to the Annex states:</PARA>
<PARA> As Israeli forces withdraw, United Nations forces will immediately enter the evacuated areas to establish interim and temporary buffer zones. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us put this into perspective. The peacekeeping force is to monitor the compliance of both parties to the peace treaty on the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces and civilians from the Sinai-no more and no less. If it is meant to be more, as the Prime Minister suggests, we are talking about another and quite separate concept of security to which I will refer later. Both parties have solemnly agreed to accept their responsibilities. Both parties have a vested and vital interest in ensuring that the treaty works. Earlier this year I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) at Question Time whether, as both Israel and Egypt had a direct and significant interest in ensuring that the peace treaty was successfully implemented, he would urge both governments to assume full responsibility for managing the withdrawal of Israeli forces, removing the necessity to create a multinational force. It seems rather strange to me that tonight neither the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the two Ministers of this Government directly involved, are on the speaker's list. To give the Minister for Foreign Affairs due credit, he did acknowledge the strength of the argument. The Minister put the argument to the United States Secretary of State in this way:</PARA>
<PARA> A continuation of these arrangements--</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the procedures for the withdrawal that had taken place already in the Sinai--</PARA>
<PARA>has the advantage that it would pre-empt any suggestion that the proposed multi-national force would have a role beyond that of peace-keeping in the Sinai. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not the Labor Party talking, this is the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a communication to United States Secretary of State Haig. He had the perspicacity to see the nub of the argument. We should realise that a major part of the withdrawal from the Sinai has already taken place under the supervision of a small group of some 200 United States civilians, known as the Sinai Field Mission. It seems to me that the mission, perhaps enlarged, could handle the final stages as effectively as, or perhaps more effectively than, a multinational force. The important point is that the main purpose of the peacekeeping force is to ensure that both sides to the treaty keep their commitments. Surely they should readily accept that responsibility and so obviate the necessity for a peacekeeping force which may add to, rather than subtract from, the problems of the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take up this question of United States involvement. This has already been alluded to by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his original concern about the peacekeeping force. I want to make it plain from the very start that we readily acknowledge and applaud the honest broker role played by the United States under President Carter in bringing Egypt and Israel to the conference table and assisting in the negotiations of the Camp David Accords. What primarily concerns me is the injection into the Middle East of the military forces of one of the super-powers. I submit that behind the requirement in the original Camp David Accords that not only should the peacekeeping force be under the United Nations but also that the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, which of course, means the United States and the Soviet Union in this context, should not contribute to the force, is a realisation that there was a danger arising from the presence in the Middle East of the forces of one of the great powers. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention has been made of a desire by the United States to put in place in the Middle East a rapid deployment force. I merely flag that possible motive. What has not been mentioned is the motive of the Begin Government in seeking a deeper and more direct involvement of the United States in the Middle East. From the Israeli point of view, of course, this is what it is all about and what it has been all about. I submit that the Camp David intention, and subsequently the Israeli intention, has been to involve the United States and its forces directly. I suspect that if I were Minister for Defence in Israel that would be my perception. But we are looking at this question, I hope, from an Australian viewpoint, what is in the best interests of Australia. Lest there be any doubt about the Begin Government's intentions to commit the United States into the security operations in the Middle East, let me quote from Mr Begin himself in his speech to the Knesset on 5 August 1981. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Of great importance is the announcement, reiterated a number of times by the President of the United States, that Israel is a strategic asset of the United States in the Middle East, that Israel is a friend and ally of America, that Israel performs an important role in blocking Soviet expansionism. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>I have been asked more than once by American statesmen whether we would wish or be prepared to sign a written defence pact with their country. I have answered them consistently: 'If you make such a proposal to us, I shall recommend to my colleagues in the Government to sign such an agreement'. </PARA>
<PARA>So we get to the nub of this whole concept. Israel had gone through the United Nations process in the Middle East before and was dissatisfied with the role of the United Nations; but the object of Israel is to bring the United States into the area of the Middle East as a guarantee of its security. As I have said, if I was an Israeli that would be my argument. That is what I would be seeking to do. But, for goodness sake, let us at least know what the facts of the situation are before we get ourselves involved in the humbug that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) went on with tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> So far, big power involvement in the Middle East, although of immeasurable significance, has not been direct. The Soviet Union-let us face up to the facts-has been circumspect in seeking to exploit the situation in Iran following the fall of the Shah and the United States discomfiture over the hostages. Both sides have shown commendable restraint in practice although, as in all things political, the rhetoric has run hot. But the deployment of the forces of one of the super-powers, in whatever form it takes, can only exacerbate what we all recognise to be an unpredictable situation and could lead to a reciprocal escalation. Therein lies the great danger of the proposal that the United States not only send in troops for the peacekeeping force but also, quite obviously, take a leading part in the instruction of those forces. If the United States forces are committed to the area the Soviet Union will doubtless seek to respond in a more direct way, and the very conflagration that we are seeking to avoid could, in fact, become the consequence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on the amendment which has been moved. In particular I reject paragraphs (b) and (c). Paragraph (b) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>its provisional decision to commit Australian forces in the Middle East without any real prospect of a lasting solution to the Palestinian issue. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Opposition-it is in full flight tonight-how in God's name it expects to solve the Palestinian issue in the long run if it does not take an initial short step? Unless we take our place and play our part in the first step in this long and tortuous process, which I suspect will go on for many years, how will we ever come to a final solution? Paragraph (c) states:</PARA>
<PARA>its failure to actively pursue diplomatic initiatives which would contribute to a Middle East settlement by provision of a United Nations sponsored peacekeeping force. </PARA>
<PARA>Again I ask: How is that possible? It is impossible. The Opposition knows very well that there is absolutely no prospect of a United Nations force going in to the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the Government's decision. It has been a difficult decision. I personally have had some difficulty in arriving at a decision myself. I freely admit that in the period before President Sadat's death I was, if not opposed, at least diffident on the subject of whether we should contribute to this peacekeeping force. It seemed to me at that time, that Israel and Egypt had come a long way together since the initiative of President Sadat in 1978. It seemed to me that there was every prospect that they could go the rest of the way down this long road without help from outsiders. Ultimately, it is the countries in that region which will find the solution. It seems to me in the short term that we are committed as friends and allies towards a world of peace, to give assistance if required. Let there be no mistake. The two protagonists in this area, Israel and Egypt, have both sought our assistance in this peacekeeping force. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the assassination of President Sadat by a bunch of murderous thugs and their cohorts, who have celebrated non-stop since his death. He was a brave man with foresight and initative who started the peace process. I am unlike a lot of other people in that Sadat's death convinced me that we should go to the Sinai. I fairly acknowledge that his death has convinced a lot of people that we should not go. But it seems to me that when there was a real prospect of peace without outside interference that prospect was shattered when Sadat was assassinated. It became our responsibility and the responsibility of other countries who so far have not declared whether or not they will be involved to play a part in an attempt to find a peaceful solution to this troubled part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a lot of loose talk tonight by the Opposition to the effect that our involvement in this part of the world is tantamount to starting war. I remind the House that what we are really talking about tonight is not war but peace. Many honourable members in this chamber have experienced war. Anyone who has would never want to see it repeated. I believe that we have a very strong responsibility to play our part at the request of our allies to try to find a solution to assist Egypt, whose late President Sadat started this process-the country of Sadat-and to assist Israel, a country that has been beleaguered for so many years. I acknowledge the argument that Israel, in its bombing of Beirut and other recent actions, may have exceeded the bounds of what we would call respectability. But it would have been very difficult to have been an Israeli in Israel in the last 30 years and being subjected to something like four major assaults on their country. It would be very difficult, for a very small country which is surrounded not to believe that there may be a chance to stop all the nonsense and remove the threat to its very existence by a pre-emptive strike. I do not excuse what has been done but I understand it. Israel is the second country that has asked us to be involved in a peacekeeping force. </PARA>
<PARA> I take great exception, as I know honourable members of the Opposition do-I hope that the Australian people will have this brought to their attention-when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) gets up in this House and condemns Israel and Begin out of hand. I think I am correct in stating that he said that Begin was the greatest threat to international peace in the world. Is that or is that not what he said? Are we to believe that Begin for all his faults is a greater threat than some madman such as Gaddafi or Castro and all the rest of those murderous thugs? I hope that the Leader of the Opposition has the decency and grace to apologise for those remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> We are going to the Sinai to assist Egypt and Israel. We are going there also at the request of the United States of America to join it in a peacekeeping effort in a vital part of the world. It must be said that we have supported the United States in other places. But honourable members should never forget that at the start of this most recent alliance the United States came to this country in 1942. If people think that we do not owe the Americans not only a debt to try to find a solution to world peace but also a debt of gratitude to keep together with old friends and allies, then I believe they are making a great mistake. We are going there on pragmatic grounds to assist Egypt, Israel and the United States. Last but not least, we are going there in an honest attempt to assist the process of world peace. That anyone can lightly put aside an attempt to assist in the process of peace in a troubled world I find very difficult to believe. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is wrong to call this force a peacekeeping force. The sooner that we get away from those particular words the better it will be. It is an observer force. It is not going there equipped to fight but to assist in the process of peace. If we can adjust to the thought that it is an observer force that we are sending in, as we have done successfully in so many other places-in the Middle East before, in Cyprus and in Zimbabwe-I think we will have the whole involvement in a much better perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken at some length-no doubt, too long for the Whip-about why we should go in the interests of assisting peace in the world. But, of course, it should not be forgotten that it is very much in our interests as well to go there. I will not dwell on the subject. I do not have to; it has been covered before. But it should not be ignored that we are also helping to secure our oil supplies and the very important trade that we carry on with Middle East countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it very strange that some honourable members of the Opposition have been gagged from speaking in this debate. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), a man who always prides himself on his honesty, who is always very critical when he feels someone else has not been completely honest, said that he will speak if he gets the time. The fact is that he will not be allowed to speak. Why have all the backbenchers had an opportunity to speak, yet a member on the front bench is gagged?</PARA>

I come back to the point that we are not going into a war; we are sending an observer force to attempt to prevent a war. There has been some talk about the risk to our troops and the risk of a wider conflict. The Leader of the Opposition dwelt on that matter tonight. No one denies that the risks are there. Of course they are there. But I ask: Has any great enterprise ever been undertaken without risk? We are seeking to help in the securing of a just and permanent peace.

It is of such importance-we see it as being of such importance-that we hope that everybody who wishes to speak on the subject will be given the opportunity to do so. As is the case with conservatives, of course, the charge against the Australian Labor Party will be that we are being unpatriotic, that we are not being as patriotic as the conservatives and are not considering what is in the best interests of our allies. We are not here to determine what is in the best interests of the United States of America, we are not here to determine what is in the best interests of Egypt and we are not here to determine what is in the best interests of Israel; we are here to determine what is in the best interests of Australia and Australians. That has to be foremost in the thinking behind the decision which is to be taken by this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) asked us not to be divisive on the issue. If all 124 members of this House were to vote in favour of sending Australian troops to the Middle East this would still be a divisive issue because the majority of people in Australia would not accept that the decision we were making was in the best interests of Australia. The majority of people in Australia have already expressed the view that a decision of this nature would not be in our best interests and have rejected it. A divisive issue is being imposed on the Australian electorate by this Government. We know that the views held by those on the Government benches are diverse, just as the views held on the Opposition benches are diverse. There are degrees to which people commit themselves on issues of this nature.</PARA>
<PARA> We have heard much about the Begin Government. I have never spoken with a member of the Begin Government but I have spoken to many colleagues in the Israeli Labor Party. Their views on many of these issues do not separate them from the views of the Begin Government. The people of Israel on many occasions cannot afford the luxury of speaking with two voices. They have to present a united front. In these talks our Israeli Labor Party colleagues have expressed the view that they think it important that Australia join the so-called peacekeeping force to go to the Middle East. I say to them as I say to the Parliament now that I do not see how under any circumstance I as a representative of the people of this country can put up my hand in favour of sending troops to the Middle East in the belief that that commitment will play any noticeable part in bringing about peace in that area.</PARA>
<PARA> We have heard tonight from some Government speakers that they expect us to believe that we can isolate the region to which this peacekeeping force is to be sent and expect that it will be cut off completely from whatever else may happen on the other borders of Israel. That cannot be done. When we are talking about the conflict in the Middle East we are not talking about just the Sinai; we are talking about all of the Middle East. There is no doubt, as the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) quite correctly pointed out to the Parliament tonight that the interests of many people will be served by disrupting this so-called peacekeeping force. Many people will be interested in disrupting it and provoking it and perhaps getting it more greatly involved than was the original intention.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not decry the Camp David Accords. If Egypt believes in them, Israel believes in them and the United States believes in them, it is for those countries to decide; I do not decry them if they want to take steps in accordance with the Camp David Accords. I am voicing my opinion on behalf of the people that I represent about what is the best for Australia. I say that what is best for Australia, based on the experiences of the 1960s and 1970s, is that we vote to keep the troops at home in Australia. The same people who have made the announcement tonight, the same people who have told us that only a few people will be involved, that the commitment we are making tonight is not all that consequential, are the people who lied to Australia about our commitment to Vietnam in the mid-1960. All the young Ministers who sit on the front bench tonight as party to the announcement, including the Prime Minister, are the people who told us that we were being requested to sent troops to Vietnam. We were never requested to send troops to Vietnam, as evidence now shows. The Australian Government wanted to send troops to Vietnam in order to keep United States forces in the region to protect us. That is the truth about Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> Some people say that it is wrong to compare the Middle East with the Vietnam experience. The situation may not be the same. Perhaps it is stretching the bow to compare Vietnam with the Middle East, but surely we should learn something from our experiences in Vietnam. We may not determine our attitudes by our experiences in Vietnam but we should learn from them and we should be influenced by what occurred there, because 510 Australians died there. Thousands of Americans died in Vietnam. Now we are being asked to send people to a far more explosive situation then was the situation in Vietnam when the late Robert Menzies made the announcement to the House of Representatives in the mid-1960s. There is no overriding evidence, as was also pointed out by the honourable member for Swan, that this commitment in some way will strengthen the alliance with the United States. This commitment is again evience of how closely we want to be attracted to that alliance. The conservatives of this country have always bent over backwards to answer the call from the great United States, but it was President Reagan himself who told the Prime Minister on the lawns of the White House that we could be a good friend if we told the United States when it was wrong. I do not want to take it even that far. I do not want to tell the United States that it is wrong. If it feels that the role that ex-President Carter played in bringing Sadat and Begin together was taking steps towards peace in the Middle East, let it continue to do so. But it is wrong, and we should say so in this Parliament, to add Australia's name to the list. France may want to send troops there; Canada may want to send troops there. But the commitment to Vietnam never depended upon France and Canada committing troops. We die not sit in Australia waiting for some other great nation to add its name to the list. We had South Korea going with us to Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> The same people have told us tonight that all is innocent and that if there is any escalation our troops will be coming home. It is too hard to believe and I expect that we owe to the Australian people the decency and the leadership to say to them that it is not in their interest for us as parliamentarians to put up our hands in favour of sending what may be an initial commitment of 200 to 300 people. I cannot promise them that those 200 to 300 people will not be engaged in some hostilities. I cannot promise them that the 200 to 300 people in 1981 may not be 5,000 or 6,000 in 1983 when a further commitment is asked from us. I cannot promise them that they will not become involved in the rapid deployment force of the United States. It is one thing to say that we are following President Reagan on the Camp David Accords because he is following what President Carter started at Camp David, but it is about the only matter in relation to which Reagan is following Carter. He is not following Carter-we have asked the Prime Minister about this-in condemning the violation of human rights in El Salvador. He is not following Carter in his condemnation of the violation of human rights in Chile. He is not following Carter in putting pressure on the South Africans to get out of Namibia. In all of these measures the Prime Minister and his Government take a different line from that of the Reagan Administration. But when it comes to the Middle East, because we have been asked by the United States to send troops, we have to commit ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA> It is ludicrous, as has been pointed out by every speaker on this side of the House, for the Prime Minister to say: 'We will maintain sovereignty over the troops we send over there. We will not allow them to become involved where we do not think it is necessary. It will be under Australian control'. But the initial statement reeks of throwing our sovereignty out the window when the Government says that it is waiting for Margaret Thatcher and Pierre Trudeau to tell us whether they will send troops there also. There is something very disconcerting about a statement which says: 'When the British and the Canadians tell us what they are going to do, we will follow suit'. If the Prime Minister was being honest with the Parliament tonight, I would think he knows what the British and the Canadians are going to do, and one can only guess at the reasons that he is trying to keep it a secret from this Parliament. What I say tonight on behalf of the people I represent is no challenge at all to my conscience.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, if all the Labor members said to the Government 'We will go along with you, we will give it a try and perhaps we can play some part in bringing about peace in that part of the world', the branches that we go home to would never accept it. They just would not allow us to put up our hands in that way. In some ways we are only reflecting the views they express and in other ways we are reflecting the attitudes which have been ingrained in us as a result of what the conservatives did to this country in the 1960s and the 1970s. The Government has imposed a very divisive issue on Australia, an issue which in the weeks ahead it will be sorry it imposed. It has done it in a manner which has thrown out the sovereignty of Australia by making it depend on other nations to make the decision for us. We hope the Australian people will support us in stopping those Australian troops from going to the Middle East in the first place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am impressed by the persuasive arguments of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) today on Australian participation in a Sinai peacekeeping force on the conditions mentioned by the Prime Minister. I am just appalled at the attitude of members of the Opposition in this place on this subject. All we have heard from them is negativism. There has been nothing positive at all. I see a positive trend towards isolationism in the Opposition's foreign policy. The Opposition has knocked the commitment to the Sinai peacekeeping force. It has knocked the Camp David Accords. It was negative about the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. It knocked CHOGM. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) was against the whole concept of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. The Opposition wants to opt Australia out of the real world. There is no positive contribution to Australian policy from the Opposition in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Time and again in relation to the Sinai peacekeeping force members of the Opposition have tried to raise the analogy of Vietnam. That is totally and utterly false. The Vietnam situation was completely different. It was a war situation. That is a question to one side. Here we have two countries at peace trying to continue that peace. Israel has given up two-thirds of the Sinai, that buffer zone that it needs for the early warning against an attack by an Arab nation. That was very courageous on the part of Israel, but no credit for that was given by the Opposition. We want to give moral force and support to the Camp David Accords which provide for an international peacekeeping force. What does the Opposition do? It is against it. The Opposition is completely hypocritical because in its amendment condemning the peacekeeping force it has tried to attack the Government for its failure actively to pursue diplomatic initiatives which would contribute to a Middle East settlement by provision of a United Nations-sponsored peacekeeping force. The Opposition in this place is trying to blame the Australian Government for the Soviets' threatened veto in the Security Council of a United Nations peacekeeping force. I have never heard so much hyprocrisy and rubbish in my life. </PARA>
<PARA> Time and again the Opposition has tried to tie this peacekeeping force in with the Rapid Deployment Force. That also is totally and utterly false. Australia has said that it will not participate in the Rapid Deployment Force. I think the Government is to be congratulated on that. But the Opposition is trying to confuse the Australian public by throwing these two things together. This is a peacekeeping force to enforce peace. After all, peace is what we are after in the Middle East. As I have said, Australia has decided not to participate in the Rapid Deployment Force, and no member on the other side should try again to confuse the issue. Why are we talking about a multinational force and not a United Nations force? We are talking about it because, as I said a minute ago, the Soviets have clearly indicated that they will veto participation by a United Nations force in the Camp David Accords. This suits the strategy of the Soviets. It maintains their strategy of instability in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) mention the Soviet Union, and I congratulate him for that. He said that the Soviet Union had been circumspect in Iraq, but he did not mention, and no other member of the Opposition mentioned, the pact between South Yemen, Ethiopia and Libya that is encircling the Gulf and threatening Egypt. We did not hear from the Opposition about the thousands of Cubans in South Yemen and about the East German advisers and security police running the security in that country. We have not heard from the Opposition about Iraq and Syria. Not one member of the Opposition-I will stand corrected if I am wrong-mentioned South Yemen, Ethiopia, Libya and Syria. There is a dull silence. We could hear the pins drop because members of the Opposition know the truth of the matter. I am looking forward to hearing some of the so-called friends of Israel. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) has been mentioned. I am looking forward to hearing the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) and the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) to see where they stand on this issue. It is clear to me that the Australian Labor Party is on the same side as the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Soviets. The Opposition has not mentioned the threat to Egypt from the Libyan-backed Chad and Sudan. Is Gaddafi in Chad? Is he threatening Sudan? Deny that. Is that the truth?</PARA>
<PARA> I like to think I have an open mind. I appeal to Australians to have an open mind on this question. As the Prime Minister said today so adequately, it was a difficult decision to make. He said that the tragic assassination of President Sadat has added greater need for international recognition of the conditions for peace in the Middle East. That consideration has weighed with the Government and has been significant in tipping the balance in favour of participation in a peacekeeping force. The balance has tipped by that tragic event because it is more imperative and urgent than ever before to support a stable regime in Egypt, the Government of President Mubarak. The Sadat legacy of the Camp David Accords and peace must be supported. We must strengthen President Mubarak in power at this time in Egypt. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of Opposition speakers in this place today also supported Crown Prince Faud's guidelines of August 1981. I take it-I challenge the Opposition to deny it-that they support item 6 of those guidelines, the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. I challenge every member of the Opposition from now on to say that he is in favour of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Perth said, that is different from resolution 242. Let us hear the so-called friends of Israel explain that one away. I was appalled by the speech of the Leader of the Opposition today because he attacked Prime Minister Begin. I give some slight credit to the Leader of the Opposition because at least he acknowledged that Israel was a democracy and the only one in the area. But he said that the Camp David Accords had been discredited internationally. He had not heard about the peace prize awarded to the late President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin. He had not heard about the support for the peacekeeping force that is now arising. The Leader of the Opposition said that Prime Minister Begin was the greatest threat to peace in the world today. I want to repeat that: The Leader of the Opposition said in this place that Prime Minister Begin was the greatest threat to peace in the world today. I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that Israel has just had an election and that that democracy re-elected Prime Minister Begin. So we have to translate and read from what the Leader of the Opposition said that Israel is the greatest threat to peace in the world today. That is what the Opposition is saying in this place. That is the truth of the matter. That is the Opposition's attitude. I totally reject it. I challenge speakers from now on to align themselves with the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) said that Israel needs peace and that, therefore, it must withdraw. He made no mention of Egypt or the other Arab states acknowledging the right of Israel to exist. He said that the peacekeeping force would be overrun. I ask: By whom and when? Obviously, I am concerned that the poll figures show a lack of support for the Sinai force, but those polls were taken before the tragic assassination of President Sadat. I believe that the courage of the Government today in making this decision and its concern for the peacekeeping process in the Middle East will be recognised by the Australian people. It is a tragedy that the Opposition has been divisive in this House tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to the United States attitude. I think there is, by and large, a bipartisan attitude in that country and in the Congress between the Democrats and the Republicans on the value of the Camp David Accords and the peacekeeping force. This Parliament in the last 12 months has had the greatest contact and the greatest opportunity to talk with members of the United States Congress it has ever had in its history. Delegations have come to Australia such as the one led by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tip O'Neill, and including prominent Democrats and Republicans such as Chairman Rostenkowski of the Ways and Means Committee. Another delegation was led by Senator Mark Hatfield, a Liberal Republican who, I think, was against the Vietnam war. He was accompanied by Senator Paula Hawkins. Chairman Clement Zablocki of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee also came. Members of the Parliament and the parliamentary committees have had wide ranging discussions across the board with members of the United States Senate and House of Representatives. I am convinced that there is bipartisan support in the United States Congress for the Camp David Accords and the Sinai peacekeeping foce. I think it is a tragedy that the Labor Party cannot adopt a bipartisan attitude on this issue and that it seeks to divide Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have often been accused of being emotional about Israel. I do not resile at all from that position. I believe it is fair to say that the major reason why I joined the Australian Labor Party was that I become emotional about many things, including poverty and suffering. I believe that being Jewish is one of the factors that influences my emotionalism. If I did not speak tonight I would find it very difficult to live with myself. However, I hope that being emotional does not make me irrational. I have tried desperately over the years to be objective about Israel because I think the future of Israel is better served by objectivity. My concern is very simple. It is the survival of the state of Israel. In my view, that can occur only if there is peace in the Middle East. Peace can occur only by two things happening-a recognition of Israel's right to exist behind secure borders, and a solution to the Palestinian problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It must not be forgotten that the same resolution that created the state of Israel included the creation of a Palestinian state. That did not happen because of the attempt of the Arab nations to destroy Israel at its birth. From 1948 to 1967 the opportunity presented itself to the border states and to many other Arab states, including those now described as the rejectionist states, to form a Palestinian state. The West Bank and Gaza were in the hands of Arab nations. They did not take that opportunity. Instead, they waged constant war from 1948 to 1973 against the state of Israel. They had a preoccupation with destroying it. That is the major reason for the failure to create a Palestinian state. </PARA>
<PARA> The first sign of change in the Middle East came with President Sadat's recognition of Israel-the Camp David Accords. Much has been said about them. I know that they are not perfect, but I reject the proposition that they are a failure. I cannot believe that anyone would seriously suggest that a treaty that brought about peace between two nations that had been at each other's throats for 30 years and had been involved in four wars, could possibly be a failure. It seems to me to be inconceivable. However, the Camp David Accords envisaged a solution to other problems. Amongst them was a homeland for the Palestinian people, a solution to the problem of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. They also included a recognition of Israel's right to exist. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is a difference between me and my colleagues it is that they, including the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), believe that the only way peace can be achieved in the Middle East is by a total package. I do not believe that the Camp David Accords ever envisaged that overnight there would be a total package solution in the Middle East. I am sure we are all aware in this House of the bitterness, hatred and distrust that has existed in that region for 30 years. Anybody who is aware of that would find it impossible to envisage one package solution. I have always seen it as a step by step process. The withdrawal so far, I believe, is part of that process. I do not believe there is any difference between the goals and objectives of me and some of my colleagues. There is a difference only in the strategy. They are seeking a package. I believe the solution has to come from a step by step process. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the question of Australia's involvement. A person would have to be dumb not to have read in the newspapers some months ago when this matter was raised within the party that I supported Australia's involvement. I did not think it was vital that we be involved. I would like to see it, but the party said no and I accept that. What I think is vital is that we support the multinational force in principle, whether or not Australia is involved. I have been to Israel many times. I know the way the Israelis feel. Israel needs an assurance from the rest of the world that it has its support. Anybody who knows the history of the Jewish people, particularly in the last hundred years, will know that throughout that history it has been the failure of the rest of the world to come to its support that has led to such monstrosities as the holocaust. Any Jew knows that that is deeply ingrained in the psyche of the Jewish people, particularly the Israelis. They are the remnants of the holocaust. They are the sweepings of the concentration camps. They are the people who were forced out of Russia and Poland in the last century. They could find a home only in Israel. They were forced to flee the Arab countries after 1948. They do not believe and have never believed that the world will come to their rescue. They have recent experience of this, such as the events of 1956 and 1967, not to mention the world turning its back on them in 1938 and 1939. I believe that trust needs to be built up in Israel that the rest of the world is really prepared to help the Israelis in a crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a fear in Israel when I was there a few weeks ago about what would happen after Sadat. No one was to know that we would soon be in that period. People wondered what would happen after 1982. They desperately want to believe that the Egyptian's intentions are honourable. I certainly do. What if there is a change of government? What happens if, after 1982, President Mubarak changes his views, takes a harder line? That is why this multinational peace force is essential. It will build up confidence in the Israelis to take the next step, which, I hope, will be the establishment of a Palestinian state on the West Bank and in Gaza. I do not want to strengthen those forces in Israel which will use any excuse not to withdraw. There are forces like that. I believe we must press for the next step by having, first of all, a multinational peacekeeping force in that region. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that Prime Minister Begin is intransigent. I must say that I did not agree with the Leader of the Opposition's statement that he was the greatest threat to peace in the world. If anybody believes the statements made by Prime Minister Begin are intransigent I suggest that he or she should read the Palestine Liberation Organisation covenant and the repeated assurances from people like Kaddoumi and Arafat that they will never renounce the PLO covenant. There is intransigence on both sides. I remind people also that it was Prime Minister Begin who said: 'I will never give up one inch of the Sinai'. Those who quote his statements that he will never give up the West Bank or Gaza must remember that this is the man who said that he would never give up one inch of Sinai. He is just about to give up the whole lot. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject, of course, the claim by Prime Minister Begin that there is a right to Judea and Samaria on biblical grounds. I think that is nonsensical. I support the Israeli Labor Party's view that its only concern on the West Bank and in Gaza is security. I think what we in Australia and the rest of the free world must do is to convince Prime Minister Begin, after we have given him the security that he wants, that he has to change his views on the West Bank and Gaza. I think that was implicit in the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true to say that the Australian people do not want Australian participation. It is not for me to go against those wishes. My party has decided one thing. Probably a few of us think differently. I accept that view. At least we should not be involved in the multinational peacekeeping force for the wrong reasons. I reject totally the suggestions that somehow or other there is an analogy with Vietnam. I opposed Vietnam from the beginning. How can one compare a situation in which both the countries seeking to gain peace are inviting a multinational force to come in with Vietnam, when clearly Vietnam did not want anybody to be involved? I point out also that Australia was involved in that region from 1976 to 1979. The only reason we really are not supporting the force is that it is not a United Nations peacekeeping force. The reason that there is not a United Nations peacekeeping force is that the Russians have made it perfectly clear that they would veto it. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the question of trade. I think that it would be very immoral of us to go to Sinai for the sake of shekels. I spoke to many officials in the Middle East recently. It was made perfectly clear to me by our Department of Foreign Affairs people that we had trailed our coat all over the Middle East asking whether, if we went in, we would lose trade. It was made perfectly clear to them that we would not. Nevertheless, I think it would be a very immoral proposition for Australia to make a judgment on this matter purely on the basis of trade. I reject also the argument that this force is part of a rapid deployment force. It is clear right from the beginning that what is envisaged is such things as helicopters, troops with side arms, communications, some transport and a few other things like that. Anyone who has read a description of what is envisaged for a rapid deployment force-divisions, aircraft carriers, squadrons of planes-could not possibly compare this monitoring observer force with a rapid deployment force. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by repeating what I said at the beginning. I cannot stress enough the need to bolster those forces in Israel which are seeking to continue the peace process. If there is no multinational force there will be no withdrawal. There is no chance then to proceed to the next step. I bow to no one in my desire to see peace in the Middle East. I bow to now one in my desire to see a homeland-a state, if you will-for the Palestinian people. Not only do I have a lifelong commitment to the survival of the state of Israel but also I have family there-I have uncles, cousins and my son is there at the moment. Whilst I support the Labor Party's position on this, I support wholeheartedly the principle of a multinational force in the Middle East. I regret that it appears that this will cause a great deal of division in the community. What strikes me throughout the whole of the Parliament is that everybody seems to be agreed on the same basic objectives; yet we are fighting over the strategy to get to those objectives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) for a very personally honest and courageous speech in this debate. The most serious and significant international commitment by this Government to a Sinai peacekeeping force was obviously neither automatic nor easy for the Government to make. It is apparent that the views of the representatives of the majorities of the countries of the world are against Camp David as a reasonable basis for peace in the Middle East. One has to look not just at the Arabs but also at the European Economic Community and Canada. The Australian decision was difficult, particularly in light of the changing situation in the volatile Middle East area, the adventures of the Begin Government in Lebanon and Iraq and finally the tragic death of President Sadat. The decision now made adds to the credibility and merit of this Government. The decision was obviously not taken because of United States pressure. If it had, it would have been made far earlier. It was obviously not taken because of the pro-Israel lobby in this country and in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has weighed our responsibility as a respected nation of the world community against the possible short term disadvantage to our commercial interests, against the views of many people in the Government who believe that the Camp David Accords by themselves are not an acceptable basis for an overall peace in the Middle East. The Government has weighed the genuine and persistent requests for involvement from the two parties in particular-Israel and Egypt. It has particularly weighed the request of Egypt since the assassination of the man who has done easily the most for peace in the Middle East. It has weighed the need to hold the fragile advance for peace that Anwar Sadat made and his efforts to support Egypt against those who are wanting to bring down that country. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that certain EEC countries and Canada which have had doubts about the value of the Camp David Accords as a basis for peace in the past are obviously thinking again. They are thinking again in spite of reservations, particularly their belief in the need to include the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Palestinians in any settlement. They now believe, as we in this Government do, that what has been achieved and what is now at risk must be supported and buttressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The conditions attached to Australian participation are most important. There are four of them in particular. They have been clearly spelt out by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). They are that Britain and Canada also agree to participate; that the Australian contribution be limited to the contribution we are initially called on to make and that the contribution be of a limited duration to be agreed on; that the Australian commander not agree to any order which he believes is contrary to the agreed purposes of the force until he has consulted the Australian authorities; and that no part of the peacekeeping force, including the United States component, have any association with a United States rapid deployment force. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two further general conditions that the Prime Minister has indicated in his letter to President Reagan: First of all, that he is looking to the United States to exert and sustain the strongest pressure to ensure that effective progress is made in implementing the Camp David Accords as they relate, not only to the Sinai, but also to Palestinian autonomy; that participation will be on the understanding that all the parties to the Accords abide by word and deed with their provisions and press forward with a continuing peace process in the Middle East. These conditions are of crucial importance to Australia for a balanced and clearly defined participation in the peacekeeping force. The two general points in the letter are of equal importance to the specific, for Australia expects the full Camp David Accords to be implemented. They are that beyond Camp David there must be a continuing peace process and that the Camp David signatories must be part of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am personally encouraged by other comments made in the Prime Minister's speech concerning the responsibility now resting on Prime Minister Begin and the Israeli Government to ensure that the autonomy talks are meaningful and that there are positive results. This is heartening because I believe that in the past the Government has not been completely fair and objective on this issue. Adequate emphasis has not been made of the fact that there cannot be a complete or lasting peace until the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the homeland rights of the Palestinians are recognised. It is the view of the majority of Western and moderate powers in the world that Israel cannot expect a guarantee of the security of its borders from the Palestinians until Israel in return is prepared to guarantee a homeland for those Palestinians; that Israel, under Prime Minister Begin, has not complied with the full intent of the Accords and as far as I am concerned, it gives no impression of doing so; that Israel, at the moment, is more of an aggressor than an injured party in the area; that Israel is attempting to influence improperly decisions of the United States Congress which affect the legitimate priorities of the United States-for example, the AWACs which are being sold to Saudi Arabia. </PARA>
<PARA> Israel exists today because of the United States shield and massive support. The United States is the only country which can make the Israeli Government accountable to its neighbours, to the homeless Palestinians, to the Camp David Accords, to the continuation of the present leadership in Saudi Arabia and to the long term peace in the area. The Prime Minister has indicated by his letter and his comments that the Australian Government intends to apply pressure to both Israel and the United States Government on some of these issues. I applaud that and acknowledge that, without our participation in the peacekeeping force, this pressure would not be possible. Britain and France-two countries that belong to the European Economic Community-are two other likely participants in the force. I hope that if we participate along with Canada, Britain, France and possibly others, the pressure can be successfully maintained for Camp David and beyond. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition opposes clause 3. The Non-government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Act is a perfectly sensible statute which gives the Government power to guarantee loans for the extensions to non-government schools; that is, existing schools. The Act was legislated to facilitate the loan raising capacity of schools involved in extra capital expenditure. This Bill proposes two changes. Firstly, it will extend the guarantee to include interest payments outstanding as well as the principal. We have no objection to that. But it also proposes that the guarantee be available to new or proposed schools. That is what clause 3 deals with and that is why we are opposed to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Education (Mr Fife) has said that some groups anxious to establish schools, cannot obtain loans because they are considered bad risks by lending institutions either because they lack the ability to meet repayments or because of their lack of collateral. A government guarantee, of course, will turn a bad risk into a good risk. New schools which are a part of a system-that is, the Catholic system or some other established system-will not be affected by this clause. Neither will new schools backed by well organised community or parent groups. They already have the ability to obtain loans with or without a government guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA> The schools which this measure will encourage will be just those schools which are causing so much alarm in the community currently. They are schools not attached to mainstream churches or not backed by established communities or parent groups but, on the other hand, seek to follow fairly offbeat curricula or educational practices. There is increasing alarm about schools, the educational inspiration of which comes directly out of the fundamentalist tradition in the United States. The curriculum of these schools is a matter of great concern as are the teaching methods and the teaching conditions. Attention has been drawn to this problem, not only by teachers' unions but also by State Ministers who have expressed serious concern about the proliferation of these schools. The problem is that the State governments are pretty powerless to do much about them, given their existing registration procedures. These schools are entitled, once established, to receive automatically recurrent funding from the Federal Government-that is, as soon as they receive State government registration. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that the existing registration procedures in most States do not exist to judge the educational performance of those schools but in some cases just deal with such matters as the public health questions which are involved in the establishment of new schools. But, as I said, as soon as they are registered those schools automatically become entitled to recurrent subsidies from the Schools Commission. It is one thing-this is perfectly acceptable-to encourage diversity in our education system. Indeed, if this proposal were not enacted, it would in no way prevent the establishment of some of these schools. After all there has been a proliferation of these schools without the existence of this guarantee. Our view is, however, that the unplanned expansion of some of these rather crackpot schools is something which should not be encouraged by this Government. State Ministers are currently meeting with the Federal Minister in Surfers Paradise. One of the questions which they are addressing themselves to is this question-the registration procedures to be adopted by State governments prior to these schools becoming eligible for Federal Government funding. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that our opposition to this proposal will not affect those schools which are part of established school systems; that is, systems which already have no difficulty in obtaining loans when they need them. Our opposition is directed towards the proliferation of these sorts of schools, the educational merits of which are highly dubious to say the least. When the Commonwealth and the State Ministers have agreed on new registration procedures and when the educational merits, educational performance and teaching methods and conditions of these schools have been worked out, when there are acceptable registration procedures-then, of course, the Opposition would reconsider its view about this matter. But in the absence of any sort of requirement for these schools to meet basic standards in relation to curriculum, teaching methods and teaching conditions, we will oppose this clause of the legislation because, I repeat, it provides quite specific encouragement to the proliferation of these schools. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I changed seats voluntarily. I went from one seat to the other, the honourable member went out. Mr Deputy Chairman, I did not mean to cause an explosion. The comments of the honourable member for Fremantle indicate that he has little appreciation of the importance of diversity of education. He said that when these schools have proved themselves the Government should look at them. I believe that the benefit of a dual education system is that the experimentation which goes on more in the non-government sector in the long term feeds the government sector and both systems improve from their dual existence. The concern of the honourable member is that the Government is going to go off-I think he used the term ratbag schools-</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9F4">Mr DONALD CAMERON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Crackpot schools, it was not much different. He was concerned that the Government would fund crackpot schools. I remind the honourable member that clause 4 of this Bill provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . continues to provide that a guarantee will not be given by the Treasurer unless the Minister certifies that, (i) the terms and conditions of the loan agreement are satisfactory, (ii) in the absence of a guarantee a school authority would not be able to obtain a loan on satisfactory terms and conditions, and (iii) a guarantee will not cover any part of the cost of a project that is or is likely to be the subject of a Commonwealth grant, including a grant under the advance approval scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>I go back to the first condition which is that:</PARA>
<PARA>The terms and conditions of the loan agreement are satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that judgments will be made. In my electorate is a school which at this very moment is being born as the result of the efforts of many individuals in the community. It is located in an area called Daisy Hill and it will be called the John Paul College. There is a screaming need for a non-government secondary school in that area. It will become the first and only non-government school in the Logan city area. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Catholic education system it was decided that the application for a school, to be known as the John Paul College, was low on priority and the Catholic education group said that the establishment of a new school shall be in Beenleigh. That was its decision, but the people in this particular area believed that they needed a school. This new school started off and it has now ceased to be of Catholic denomination. It has become Anglican, Uniting Church and Catholic. The three religions are working together in the creation of something which the honourable member described as crackpot, and I do not think he would have been aware of this when he used the word. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to this Bill allow the emergence of schools like the John Paul College. While the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fremantle made some critical comments, he should be qualified to do so to the extent that perhaps some schools that he will regard as being strange may emerge, but this Bill will also ensure the emergence of many schools based on a most solid foundation. I regret that the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) is not at the table to allow me to congratulate him for this amendment because it was very much through the problems confronted by the John Paul College that this particular amendment was made. </PARA>
<PARA> I just cannot let pass the comments of the honourable member for Fremantle that this amendment will suit only crackpot schools. Many good schools will benefit. In my electorate this new school already has students in Grade 8, which is the first year of secondary school. It is waiting at this stage on three classes. I think the list for students for the second year of secondary school is also filled. So there was a need, and that need is being met by the dedication of a handful of people who recognised that the area would be enriched by the creation of a representative school of the other system of education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education (Mr Fife), who left during the dinner break to travel to Queensland to attend the Australian Education Council, has asked me to respond to this matter. I wish to make the Government's position very clear. I remind the House that the purpose of the legislation is to amend the provisions of the Non-government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Act in two respects. Firstly, it extends the coverage of the Act to include proposed as well as existing non-government schools. Secondly, it extends the scope of the loan guarantee to cover repayment of interest moneys in addition to repayment of principal for purposes of expenditure on approved projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The effects of these amendments will be to bring the arrangements for loan guarantees more into line with those for non-government schools in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory which have been contained in the Independent Schools (Loans Guarantee) Act since 1969, to widen the definition of a non-government school to be similar to that used in the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act, to assist proposed schools which do not have access to large assets for collateral or to an extensive parent body which can support heavy loan repayments and to make the scheme more attractive to both existing and proposed non-government schools which are faced with increased enrolment pressures. The Government, therefore, does not agree with the proposed amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Depending on the season, the quantity has varied over recent months, ranging from 24 to 462 boxes per week.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Commercial consignments of cut flowers are imported under the following provisions:</PARA>
<PARA> inspection on arrival,</PARA>
<PARA> exclusion of restricted species,</PARA>
<PARA> exclusion of material which can be grown or, if appropriate, treatment of the material to prevent propagation,</PARA>
<PARA> fumigation where live insects are found,</PARA>
<PARA> treatment or destruction, as appropriate, when diseased flowers are found.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No. However some initial difficulties were encountered with increased demand for the supervision of a treatment to prevent propagation of imported carnations, chrysanthemums and roses following its development and recent adoption by Plant Quarantine. To minimise congestion, inspection for insects and diseased material is undertaken at quarantine premises in Queensbridge Street. Those consignment requiring treatment are transferred a short distance to quarantine facilities in INgles Street where treatments are carried out by private agencies or the importer under quarantine supervision.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) See (1) and (4). The situation will be carefully monitored but no significant problems are anticipated.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) A three-tier structure of health fund contributions has not been considered as it is not regarded as being consistent with the community rating principle, which is the basis of the health insurance arrangements. The application of the principle does accept that single people pay half the family rate but any acceptance of family size as a factor in setting contribution rates would be regarded as contrary to the principle. It is of significance to this question that, for the majority of couples, the community rating principle would have worked in their favour at some stage during their period of insurance coverage e.g. before their own children became independent. The principle, therefore, not only works to keep contributions within reasonable reach of all persons at any point in time but also provides, during the contributor life of an individual member, for an even spread of contributions regardless of varying potential benefit utilisation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It could generally be expected that, under a system that took family size into account as a factor in determining contribution rates, families with dependants would pay relatively higher rates than they do at present. Further, the greater number of dependants could mean further higher contribution rates; a situation which could well disadvantage large families. However, data are not available to my Department that would enable an accurate assessment to be made of the effects of such a change. It is also likely that the effects would vary between health funds, depending on the composition of their membership.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to allegations that Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd is negotiating for the De Beers organisation to gain control over the marketing of diamonds from the Argyle project; if so, is it a fact that (a) such a contract will mean that Australians will lose control over the pricing, production and marketing of these Australian minerals, and return to Australia prices substantially below world prices; (b) the extent and value of Australian diamond resources at Argyle are unknown to any Commonwealth agency and (c) the Argyle deposit is substantially foreign-owned with its value being at least $1,000 million.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Has his attention also been drawn to an article in Barrons magazine of 6-12 September 1981 intimating that Australia now represents the greatest single challenge to the De Beers stranglehold on the international diamond wholesaling business and that Australia could set up its own marketing mechanism which might some day rival De Beers.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. However, the Ashton Joint Venture management stated publicly on 28 August 1981 that no decisions had been taken about possible arrangements for the marketing of diamonds from the Argyle deposit.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Since no contract with the De Beers organisation has been negotiated or is in the process of being negotiated, any statement about the possible effects of such a contract is speculative.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The extent and value of the Argyle deposit will not be able to be estimated until the evaluation of the deposit is completed. What can be said on the basis of the evaluation to date is that Argyle is a large, high grade deposit but the average quality and size of the diamonds is low by world standards so that the return from their sale can be expected to be below the world average. A large proportion of the diamonds so far recovered is of industrial quality with a value far less than gem quality diamonds.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The major partners in the Ashton Joint Venture are substantially foreign owned but the two companies involved have been granted naturalising status. As well as having given the required undertakings to increase the level of their Australian equity to 51 per cent, the companies were also required as a pre-condition for the granting of naturalising status to have ensured that their company articles of association provide for a majority of Australian citizens on their board of directors. This is in line with the Government's intention that a naturalising company should be able to operate with a predominantly Australian board and should be controlled by that Board.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) It is not intended to conduct any such inquiry. The partners in the Ashton Joint Venture are well aware of the general Government objective that resource development should be conducted in the national interest as well as in the interest of the companies and shareholders involved. The AJV partners have been advised that the arrangements for the marketing of output from the project and the question of any effect that may have on the equity and control will be examined by the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) No. A draft environmental impact statement (EIS) covering the Airport Development Works was prepared by the Department of Transport in 1978 and released for public comment in December 1978 in accordance with the requirements of the Commonwealth's Environment Protection Administrative Procedures. This document was available to the public through the Australian Government Bookshops. The final EIS was published by the Department in February 1979 following review of public comments received.</PARA>
<PARA> Commencing in 1974, a series of studies was undertaken by Commonwealth and State government authorities and academic institutions to assess the potential environmental effects associated with proposals for the redevelopment of Brisbane Airport. Reports on those background studies were published as Volumes 1-5 of the Brisbane Airport Development Project Environmental Study in 1977. A further volume of reports on continuing studies was published as Volume 6 in June 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) No further environmental impact statement has been published since 1979. Major sand dredging and site reclamation were considered in the 1979 EIS. Current proposals for further dredging and site reclamation associated with the proposed 14/32 cross runway were the subject of a Notice of Intention submitted to the Department of Home Affairs and Environment on 30 September 1980 in accordance with the requirements of Paragraph 2.1 of the Environment Protection Administrative Procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Home Affairs and Environment advised the Department of Transport on 17 November 1980 that preparation of a further EIS would not be required.</PARA>
<PARA> No further EIS will be published on this aspect of the Brisbane Airport Redevelopment Project. However, the effects of sand dredging and site filling are being monitored as part of the environmental monitoring program associated with the airport redevelopment.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, according to news media reports.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The incidence of a wholesale sales tax as between the suppliers and the final consumers of the taxable article depends on the extent to which suppliers are able to pass the tax forward to consumers. This, in turn, depends on the degree of competition among suppliers and the level of demand among consumers. Against this background, it would be impracticable to attempt to estimate the aggregate cost to consumers of the proposed 2.5 per cent sales tax on books. At the same time, having regard both to conventional mark-up practices and to the additional administrative costs which the Association claims the new tax will impose on the book trade, I have difficulty in reconciling a 2.5 per cent increase in price at wholesale level with a 15 per cent increase at retail level. Such a movement suggests that the book trade would pass forward to the final retail purchaser up to 12 times the tax imposed at wholesale level.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) Yes, according to news media reports.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Books, magazines and newspapers are not the only goods now exempt that are to be brought under tax at 2.5 per cent and it is quite misleading to refer to them in isolation. The fact is that a major element of the 1981-82 Budget strategy was to reduce the overall deficit by almost $1,000m. As I said in my Budget Speech, this is a decisive move which symbolises the Government's determination not to endanger the gains already made with regard to containing and reducing inflation and to sustaining growth in the private sector. To ensure that reduction in the deficit, it was found necessary to raise additional revenue. This is to be done in part through increases in the existing rates of sales tax and the subjection to sales tax at 2.5 per cent of a range of currently exempt items including books, magazines and newspapers. This move also accords with the Government's view that such a change in the mix of direct and indirect taxes will increase the potential for desirable reductions in direct taxes, and particularly personal income tax as future economic and budgetary conditions permit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I understand from news media reports that claims have been made that the imposition of a 2.5 per cent wholesale sales tax on books will result in price increases at the retail level of up to 15 per cent. Given conventional mark-up practices and even allowing for the additional administrative costs which the book trade alleges it will suffer in consequence of the new tax, I have considerable difficulty in accepting such claims. If they proved correct, it would mean that a 2.5 per cent tax was magnified up to 12 times between wholesale and retail levels within the book trade. Such a magnification would reflect more on practices within that trade, I suggest, than on the Government for proposing to tax books at far more modest rates than are imposed and generally accepted as proper in many other advanced Western countries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) In September 1978 a smelter belonging to the Government-owned Iron and Steel Mills (NISM) of Singapore was contaminated by radioactive material. Contamination was thought to have resulted from the inadvertent inclusion of an industrial radioactive source in a consignment of scrap metal from the Kambalda plant of Western Mining Corporation. After decontamination of the smelter, NISM was left holding a quantity of waste material containing radioactive caesium. The bulk of this material is contained in 119 steel drums.</PARA>
<PARA> Following protracted negotations between the Australian and Singapore companies regarding disposal of the material, the Singapore Government formally sought Australian assistance in February 1981. In late March 1981 the Singapore Government was advised that the Australian Government and the Western Australian State Government had agreed in principle to provide the necessary approvals which would allow the companies involved to transfer and store the material in Western Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Clients referred to the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) by the Department of Veterans' Affairs may encounter delays of 3 to 4 months in obtaining appointments at some NAL centres throughout Australia. In the past Veterans' Affairs' clients were given a higher priority than those of the Department of Social Security (i.e. pensioners). It has now been necessry to bring the priority allocated to the former into line with that allocated to pensioners. (This has taken place in all States except New South Wales where it will be implemented as soon as possible). As a consequence, Veterans' Affairs' clients now experience waiting times longer than formerly. The need to rearrange priorities stems from the increasing demand for NAL services placed on finite staff resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Other referrals to NAL include: children (up to 21 years) with confirmed or suspected hearing loss, many of whom are fitted with hearing aids; and small groups such as Department of Transport and Commonwalth compensation clients.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In all hearing centres the delay encountered by pensioners is either equal to or exceeds the delay encountered by Veterans' Affairs' clients. In most hearing centres the delay encountered by eligible adults with NAL aids (this includes both pensioners and Veterans' Affairs' clients) is equal to or less than for new Veterans' Affairs' clients.</PARA>
<PARA> In all hearing centres children 4 years and under and children over 4 years with an aid encounter less of a delay than veterans' Affairs' clients.</PARA>
<PARA> In all hearing centres children 4 years and under and children over 4 years with an aid encounter less of a delay than Veterans' Affairs' clients.</PARA>
<PARA> The comparison of delays encountered by Veterans' Affairs' clients to those for children in this group wait an equal or lesser period of time than Veterans' Affairs' clients. However there are a few centres where this group of children is waiting longer than Veterans' Affairs' clients.</PARA>
<PARA> The other small groups of clients experience delays equal to or only slightly less than those ecnountered by Veterans' Affairs' clients.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Following a Joint Management Review of NAL activities a number of its recommendations for a more efficient service have been implemented and further recommendations will be progressively adopted. However, with the ever increasin demand on NAL services, it is inevitable that there will be some delays in providing appointments to clients.</PARA>

<PARA> Nominations may be made at any time. Awards are announced in the New Year and Queen's Birthday lists. To be eligible for an honour the nominee must be a citizen of a country of which the Queen is Head of State.

Eligibility criteria and other conditions of honours and awards are laid down in the Statutes of the various Orders and in Royal Warrants and Regulations.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2475" SPEAKER="Moore The Hon J.C." NAMEID="EI4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="HOTHAM">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The $200 ceiling was set on 1 March 1975 when the amount was increased from $100. In September 1978 a survey on use of the concession was conducted by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs; it was found that while approximately 40 per cent did not avail themselves of any part of this allowance, only approximately 2 per cent exceeded the $200 provision. The allowance was therefore regarded as quite adequate and in fact compares favourably with that available in other countries.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Airline pilots and aircrew ordinarily domiciled in in Australia receive the same concession as seamen. This is the same concession as allowed to passengers except that the concession is only available to crew members once in each year.</PARA>
