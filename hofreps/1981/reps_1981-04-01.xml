<PARA> That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 30 March 1981 of the Hon. Sir Alexander Russell Downer, Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, a member of this House for the Division of Angas from 1949 to 1964, a Minister of the Crown from 1958 to 1963, and Australian High Commissioner in London from 1964 to 1972; and that this House places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Alexander Russell Downer was born in 1910, 10 years after the birth of the Commonwealth of Australia. His father, Sir John Downer, was one of the founders of this Commonwealth as well as being a Premier of South Australia. Alexander Downer followed with conviction and total dedication the tradition of political life and service to the Australian community. I am sure that a number of honourable members will be interested to know that I visited Alec Downer only a very few weeks ago and, whilst obviously very ill, he maintained a lively interest in the members of this place and in the affairs of the nation. He wanted to know how people were doing and his mind was as sharp and active as always. </PARA>
<PARA> He was educated both in Australia and in England. He took the degrees of Master of Arts and Diploma of Economics and Political Science at Oxford University. He was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in London in 1934 and was admitted to the South Australian Bar in 1935. In 1940 he enlisted as a gunner in the Australian Imperial Force. He went to Singapore in 1941 on active service and was reported missing. He spent some three and a half years as a prisoner of war at the Changi camp until the recapture of Singapore in 1945. It is greatly to the credit of Alexander Downer and a tribute to his character that a major effect of his experience in those years was a strengthened belief in the value of closer international co-operation. He entered this House as member for the division of Angas in 1949 and was returned successively in the next five elections. He represented the electorate of Angas well and faithfully through all that time. I am sure that his whole electorate remembers him with great affection. </PARA>
<PARA> He served with distinction on a considerable number of parliamentary committees-the Library Committee, the Select Committee set up to inquire into and report upon the Hansard of the House of Representatives, the Privileges Committee, and the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review, in which he had a particular interest. He was a well known, widely respected and greatly liked member of this House. Alec Downer had friends on both sides of the Parliament. I know that in his old home in South Australia and in his new home he was visited by members of the Opposition as well as by members of the Government parties. He had close friends on both sides of the House and there was widespread appreciation of his work both on the back bench and as a Minister. In 1958 he became Minister for Immigration and he served in that portfolio until 1963. He worked devotedly and effectively as Minister for Immigration, travelling to the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States of America to discuss various issues concerning migration. It will doubtless be regarded as a particular tribute to his work in that portfolio that the late Mr Arthur Calwell, perhaps the founder of Australia's modern immigration program, took the opportunity to say how pleased he was both with Alec Downer's appointment to that post and with the way in which he handled it. Alec Downer resigned from this House on 23 April 1964 in order to take up the position of Australia's High Commissioner in London. On the occasion of his resignation Sir Robert Menzies said of him:</PARA>
<PARA> He is an extraordinarily popular member of this House and he will take to London with him a great background of tradition. He is a man of high education, of wide information, of great courtesy and with an uncommon capacity for getting on with people and presenting his views strongly without forfeiting friendship. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that paragraph very accurately describes much of the Alec Downer we remember. I echo those judgments, as I am sure other members will. Sir Robert went on to say how ideal were the qualifications and attributes of Alec Downer for the post he was shortly to take up in London. So they proved to be in the event. He was made a Knight Commander of the British Empire in 1965. His term of office in London was extended three times and he insisted that the third renewal should be the last. </PARA>
<PARA> Alec Downer was a great believer in the link between Australia and Great Britain. His period in office in London was a period in which considerable adjustments were made to some aspects of that link as the United Kingdom moved into the European Economic Community. Alec Downer had his own views on that move, which would be well known to honourable members, and on its implications for his country. Throughout that whole period he was a great ambassador for Australia and for all Australian interests. During his entire period of office in the United Kingdom he used his position and also his private resources to further as much as he could the interests of Australia. Of course, he was a great lover of England but, as one would expect, it was in Australia that he chose to live at the end of his period of office in London. Alec Downer had a fine career. Much was promised and much was given. We are grateful for his life and for his notable service to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a time of particular sadness for his family. A thought which must pass through the minds of all of us on these occasions is that, whatever we say of the history and the record of a man, we cannot say much to ease the hurt of the immediate family in these circumstances. I think we are conscious of that. But to Alec's wife, Mary, who gave him immense support and dedication, and to his children-Stella, Angela, Alexander and Una-we extend our deepest sympathy at this time. I add that Alec Downer was a very great personal friend of many people in this House, including me. He was a person who showed great fortitude in recent years as he fought off an insidious and inevitable illness. He was an admirable example to many of us in many ways. He was much loved and much admired. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Oxley-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I support the expressions of condolence by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in relation to the passing of Sir Alec Downer and I extend the deepest sympathies of the Opposition to the members of his family. Personally, I was struck with a deep sense of grief, which I still experience, at the news of Sir Alec's death. Parliament is a curious institution in many respects and probably is somewhat unfathomable for people outside the Parliament who watch the daily conflict in this sparring pit called the parliamentary chamber. For all that, in my view it is of great cathartic benefit to the community that tense views are expressed and passions are released here which otherwise, pent up, might present problems in the wider community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, that is not the matter I want to develop. I merely note in passing that the impression we probably often leave with the public is one of unremitting conflict. That is not true. There are many matters, indeed most, that go through the Parliament uncontested, with only mild reservations being expressed. The impression of conflict and perhaps unbridgable distance is very much a product of the more heated debates on the great issues of the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proper that there should be genuine, strong feeling on those great issues. There is, however, a bridge that transcends these conflicts. It is a sturdy structure built on mutual respect and often affection between two people who may be opponents in this chamber. I mention this fact because for me there was such a sturdy bridge built with the late Sir Alec Downer. He was an extraordinarily decent man. He was, in his manner, a gentleman-always considerate and, it seemed to me, preferring always to see the better side of those with whom he dealt, including his political opponents. He had a great sense of belonging to South Australia, where his family had been since 1868. His family had been in politics for almost 120 years when he completed an eight-year term as Australia's High Commissioner to London. Whilst he came from an establishment background, he did not see arrogance or indifference to the common good as the hallmark of success in our society. Rather, he saw his background as giving him the opportunity to take a less ruthless approach to politics and to pursue public life with an eye to the common good. He had a great sense of serving the community, of striving for harmony rather than seeking discord. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite his background, his down to earth toughness is shown by his endurance, along with others in this chamber, of three and a half years in Changi prison during World War II. It was one of the great joys of the late Sir Alec Downer that the late Eddie Ward, the former firebrand of East Sydney, had stayed with him at his country residence outside Adelaide on several occasions. This association showed the breadth of his friendships. He was a man of good humour always, restrained and dignified in the presentation of his views in a period when excesses and indignities in politics were the common weapon of too many. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose in a nutshell what I am saying is simply this: One of the great lessons for most of us in the Parliament who come in fiercely committed to our party, staunch protaganists of our party's views, is the discovery that not all wisdom resides on one side of the Parliament, that no single party or person has a monopoly on all of the virtue in the political arena. That was one of the great lessons that I learned from the late Sir Alec Downer. He was, I repeat, unfailingly courteous and helpful, whether in London where I met him as a distinguished High Commissioner for this country, after having been associated with him in this Parliament when he was a Minister, or subsequently when, as a Minister myself in the last Labor Government, I had occasion to greet him on several instances and in Opposition, of course, as Opposition Leader. His courtesy, his humour, his generosity and his patriotism leave us with many good memories of him. We are saddened by his death. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of sadness that I join the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in the condolence motion which has been moved in respect of Sir Alexander Downer. I served with him in this Parliament for a number of years and also saw him regularly after he retired. Sir Alec was a real gentleman-a man with great dignity and a man who had no prejudices or hatreds. One could not help liking and admiring the man. The House pays tribute today to a great Australian-a man held in deep respect and admiration in all sections of the Australian community and a man whom I and many other members will be proud to be able to claim as a friend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir Alec Downer was a great South Australian. He had a great affection for the State in which he grew up and in which his family home has been since the first half of the nineteenth century. At the end of his public career, he returned to South Australia and lived at Williamstown with his wife, Lady Mary, until his death. Sir Alec was the son of one of the founders of the Australian Constitution, Sir John Downer. Educated in Australia and England, he went to the Bar in South Australia before World War II. After the war broke out, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and was amongst many of the Australians who were captured by the Japanese forces at the fall of Singapore. He spent the remainder of the war period in a prisoner of war camp at Changi gaol. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Alec Downer married in 1947. In 1949 he entered the Federal Parliament as member for Angas-the seat he held until 1964. He served on the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review. In 1958 he became Minister for Immigration. He served in this demanding and often controversial portfolio with distinction. In 1964, following his retirement from Federal politics, he was appointed High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. On a number of occasions I had the pleasure of visiting him and was able to see the excellent job he did there. Sir Alec Downer's international outlook, his wide-ranging interests, his experience in government and the personal charm of both him and Lady Downer were outstanding qualifications for this position. These qualities and his own warm feeling towards Britain and his love for Australia combined to make him one of Australia's most successful ambassadors to Britain. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already noted, Sir Alec made many lasting friendships during this time in public life. Those friendships went across all political lines. I was very interested to hear the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition when he claimed that even Eddie Ward had gone to visit Sir Alec in South Australia. I knew Sir Alec and Lady Downer well. I valued their friendship. I had respect for both of them for the contribution they made to Australia, particularly to South Australia. Today I offer my sympathy and that of my party to Lady Downer and to all the members of Sir Alec's family. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EE4">Mr UREN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Reid)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the three party leaders in paying tribute to Alec Downer. As the House will know, Alec Downer was a prisoner of war of the Japanese during the last war. He was one of five members on the Liberal-Country Party side of politics in the House of Representatives, who were prisoners of war, the others being Charlie Anderson, Billy Kent Hughes, Reg Swartz and Winton Turnbull. Of course, the only ones now alive are Charlie Anderson and Reg Swartz. Alec Downer was a very special person. Whether one knew him in the army, in prison camp, as a back bencher, as a Minister or even as a high commissioner, he was always the same type of person; he was never different. He was a very human person. He was a gentlemen of the old school and a very gentle person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only difference of opinion I had with Alec was when he was Minister for Immigration. If one went to him to try to get naturalised somebody who was a bit to the left in politics, he would really shy away. I certainly had a blue or two with him on that issue, as I have had with other Ministers. I will never forget what happened when I went to London on one occasion and he heard that I was there. Some time before he left his postion as a Minister he thought he had offended me in some way. So, when we met, he embraced me and I embraced him because there was a very deep affection between the two of us. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I want to make about Alec Downer's contribution to public affairs concerns the period when he was a member of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review. I commend the report of the Committee to all members of the House. Persons of goodwill from both sides of politics sat down together on that Committee between 1956 and 1959 and most of their recommendations were unanimous. The characters of the members of that Committee were diverse. Its members were Pat Kennelly, Reg Wright, Alec Downer, Len Hamilton, Reg Pollard, Eddie Ward, Nick McKenna, Arthur Calwell, Dave Drummond, Percy Joske, Gough Whitlam and Neil O'Sullivan. As the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Hayden, said, affection grew between Alec Downer and Eddie Ward. I believe that Reg Pollard, who was one of the members of that Committee, was probably one of the greatest parliamentarians ever to come into this place. Honourable members should have heard the real affection with which Reg Pollard would talk about Alec Downer, because of the warmth of his regard for him and his real understanding of Alec Downer's position in politics. When one thinks of what we are trying to seek in life, it seems that Alec Downer really represented the best of the conservative forces on the other side of the chamber. I pay tribute to him and send my very deep sympathy to his wife and family. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to mention only one other matter. It has been referred to in part. Alec Downer's home was in a part of Australia which I believe is now a part of the National Estate. I refer to the house in which he lived in the Adelaide Hills. There was a time when it was doomed to destruction-not by a Labor Government in South Australia but by the Playford Government-just in order to build a freeway. Eventually it survived and it remains now as a part of the public sector, a part of the National Estate. It certainly embodies the tradition of the Downer family. I am pleased to join my colleagues in paying a tribute to the late Alec Downer. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8C7">Mr GILES</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Wakefield)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join in the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and supported by honourable members on both sides of the House. As the Prime Minister has stated, Alec Downer joined the 2/14 Field Regiment in 1940, as soon as he could after the outbreak of war. He was captured in late 1941 and incarcerated in the prisoner of war camp at Changi. He remained there until 1945 with such people as Senator John Carrick, and until a little while ago I thought perhaps the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) as well. The honourable member for Reid mentioned the sensitivity of Alec Downer and I guess that it would not be wrong of me to say that the honourable member might have got through that period of being a prisoner of war more easily than a person of Alec Downer's make up; but be that as it may. Although his experience in Changi could not have enhanced his love for his captors, it is worth noting that the stature of the man was such that his attitude in trade agreements and other actions taken by the Australian Government shortly after that period were in marked contradiction to any acknowledgment of the fact that he had been a prisoner of war. His attitude in all such matters was that of a big man and his vision on major issues of this nature was never affected by parochialism or by his personal feelings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that, apart from his appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and his advent to the Ministry and ultimately to the Cabinet, his appointment as a member of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review in 1956 gave him lasting satisfaction. I was very glad to hear the honourable member for Reid mention that fact. Alec Downer brought to bear his great intellect on a subject dear to his heart, and frequently mentioned to his friends the importance to his mind of that Committee. He was a forty-niner, and I think it is true to say that of the forty-niners only Sir William McMahon remains in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> The late Alec Downer was elected on 10 December 1949 and was re-elected at seven elections. On one of those occasions he was unopposed. As has been mentioned, he resigned in 1964 and shortly afterwards I won a by-election for the Federal seat of Angas and re-established my friendship of previous years with both Alec and Mary Downer. I remember clearly those early days as a Federal member, as I struggled to consolidate in that seat, because I was made well aware of the tremendous admiration in which he was held in his electorate. His greatest quality as a member of parliament was his sincerity, which is universally acknowledged. As a back bench member, I am told, he was ambitious but he was never short of courage in attacking his own Government's policies when necessary. His powers of oratory were great and his sense of history immense. </PARA>
<PARA> As a highly principled man he found the unprincipled hunt for funds by State governments grotesque. His own individual makeup did not allow for the tactics of personal abuse, blackmail, the improper use of statistics and, in fact, sheer bloody-minded parochialism as the main arguments to be used at Premiers Conferences and afterwards around the countryside. I believe a majority of members of parliament here today would think likewise in the absence of a more rational method of distributing funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Although he was a great South Australian, as the Prime Minister has already stated, I believe he saw himself fundamentally as an Australian at a time in our history when that attribute was not always acceptable to State colleagues, particularly he was always prepared to stand up for his viewpoint. Nevertheless, I believe he was a very honoured member of this House, with friends on both sides, principally due to his admiration for all people who he felt were true to their principles. I am sure he would not mind my mentioning both Eddie Ward, who was mentioned earlier, and Clyde Cameron, who were invited to stay with him on more than one occasion. I believe that only last year Clyde Cameron moved a congratulatory motion to him at a large party to celebrate his seventieth birthday. Not many of us will leave Parliament-indeed, this earth-with the degree of goodwill and respect that he engendered. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of his success must also be attributed to his remarkable wife, always refreshing and with a mind of her own. In many ways she was not only complementary to Sir Alexander Downer's intellectual accomplishments but also an accomplished and charming hostess possessed of great character in her own right. I believe the two of them, together, raised the stature of Australians abroad in a unique fashion when Sir Alec was High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. I remember many years ago dining at the table of the New Zealand High Commissioner in Canberra. Somebody there criticised Sir Alec Downer because he was not available when this person arrived in London. I clearly remember Sir John McEwen turning to me and asking whether I took his seat of Angas, to which I replied 'Yes'. He said: 'I want you, of all people, to know that, of all the high commissioners representing Australia, Alec Downer would certainly rank highest amongst the best in my memory for his ability to attract influential and important people to me when I visited London'. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Alexander Downer served Australia well in so many fields during an extraordinarily active life that I believe it is proper that this House, which he loved so well, pay proper tribute to this great Australian. I support the motion and add my personal sympathy to his wife, Mary, and her children-Stella, Angela, Alexander and Una. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in these tributes to the late Sir Alec Downer and extend my sympathy to his family, not only as a South Australian but also as a friend. He had already left this House by the time I was elected to this place, but his great gifts were well known to me through my parents and through Clyde Cameron, the former member for Hindmarsh who, as has already been mentioned, was a close friend. I first met Alec when I was a member of a parliamentary delegation which visited London in 1970, and that was the first of a number of meetings. The warmth of his hospitality, not only when High Commissioner but also in later years, and his keen interest in Australian public affairs were very evident to those of us who knew him. What impressed me even more was his relative lack of prejudice which contributed so much to his close friendships across this chamber. He wanted to retain those friendships after he left this place and I was delighted to benefit from that wish of his, because I enjoyed his company so much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that Clyde Cameron will not mind my telling a story which Clyde told me. I was not present on the occasion, but Sir Alec told me the same story at another time. After Clyde had proposed the toast mentioned by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles) to that large gathering of Downer friends and family in Sir Alec's home on that very special seventieth birthday occasion about a year ago, Clyde turned to Alec and said: 'Alec, would there be any socialists other than my wife and me in this company today?' Alec replied: 'My dear Clyde, I think the only person who would come remotely close to that description is me'. In spite of his conservative appearance, he did indeed have a number of reforming characteristics and a delightful sense of humour, as denoted in that story. </PARA>
<PARA> He had notable achievements in public life which have already been mentioned. He was a compassionate Minister for Immigration and administered his Department in such a way that he won bipartisan support for most of what happened during those years. He was a successful representative of our country in London. I also understand-this has not been mentioned today-that he beat the candidate who was strongly backed by his party's establishment, which included Sir Thomas Playford, when he first won Liberal pre-selection for Angas and came into this House. I mention this story only because it shows the capacity he had of impressing all who met him personally. Also I pay tribute to his work on the committee which made recommendations on constitutional reform, which has been mentioned by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) and which, of course, reported to this Parliament as long ago as 1959. I merely say that it would be a further mark of respect to him if in a bipartisan way we accepted and put into effect some more of the recommendations of that all-party committee than have been acted on to date, in particular of course those recommendations in relation to deadlocks between the Houses of this Parliament which he mentioned to me again on the last occasion on which I saw him. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I, too, take this opportunity of paying respect to Lady Downer. She is a very special person who has been a tower of strength to him. From my family-an elderly father, who is still alive, and my wife-and myself and the many of my Adelaide constituents who knew and admired him, I send warm messages of sympathy to Mary, her daughters and son on this very sad occasion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion of condolence moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). It was with great personal sorrow that I learned of the death of Sir Alexander Downer. Not only was Sir Alec a great Australian and South Australian whom I held in very great regard but also he was a close friend of my family. He and my father were elected to this House on the same day in the same year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir Alec Downer had a long and distinguished career in public life in the service of this country. He entered Parliament in 1949 and was the member for Angas from 1949 to 1964. During that time he served as Minister for Immigration from 1958 until 1963. As Minister responsible at an important time for the post-war immigration program, Sir Alec Downer had a very great and lasting influence on the shape and direction of Australia's history. It was when he was Minister for Immigration that he gave me personal encouragement as I began my political career. I shall always remember with esteem and gratitude the generous support and wise advice that he afforded me in what were for me the very early days. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1964 to 1972, Sir Alec Downer was High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, a country and a nation which he had always held very dear. In his public life, Sir Alec was guided by several abiding principles in all that he did. For example, he was a staunch supporter of the concept of constitutional monarchy and the democratic traditions inherent in the Westminister system of government. For him, that tradition, with, for example, the notion that Ministers should come from within the Parliament, was far more acceptable than other systems such as the presidential system. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Alec also had a firm and compassionate conviction that the family unit is the essential basis for a strong and vital society. He believed in the family and the need to help it in fulfilling its role. He also believed that we have a strong obligation to protect and preserve our heritage and the natural environment-a belief that bore witness to an inate love of beauty and a sensitive appreciation of the world around him. Much has been said and will be said about Sir Alex Downer, the public man. But it is as the private man, a family friend both to my father and me and my whole family, a man of wisdom and integrity, great learning and sensitivity, that I shall most remember him and, with other members, mourn his death. To his widow, Lady Downer, and to his children-especially his daughter Una, who until this year was a member of my staff-I offer my sympathy and that of my family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is obvious that an increase in wages will increase the cost of production. This will affect the profitability of any company or corporation. Quite clearly, if that company is operating under a high level of protection its ability to make a profit will be affected. The company will then have to approach the Government in some instances to see whether the levels of protection offered to it are appropriate for its continuance. The Government's policy is to refer such matters to the Industries Assistance Commission. The IAC judges the efficiency of the company. The response is judged by the Government on the basis of the company's need and whether it is performing in the best interests of Australia. The appropriate levels of assistance are determined. No government will stand back and see the taxpayers of Australia pay higher bounties to a company which is not playing the game in respect of standards of wages and hours worked. No government will stand back and allow higher levels of tariff for exactly the same reason.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YI7">Sir PHILLIP LYNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very significant reflection of the strengthening capacity of manufacturing industry that manufacturing exports at present are performing very well in export markets despite the sluggishness which exists in world trade. For example, the value of manufactured exports increased by some 6 1/2 per cent in the 7 months to January 1981, compared with the corresonding period in the previous year. That followed an increase of some 19 per cent in 1979-80. This is an obvious reflection of the overall success of the Government's economic and industry policies which have created competitive conditions for manufacturing industry and a climate in which Australian industry can show an improvement in investment patterns and, at the same time, in the provision of job opportunities. What has been laid down is the underpinning of a base for the coming boost and surge in investment projects around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The House is very much aware of the significant employment impact which the surge in manufacturing and mining investment will create-and not just in mining areas-because of its overall impact on the Australian community. If economic management is one criterion, as members of the Government have made clear today, economic management must be matched by restraint in terms of hours worked and, of course, in terms of wages paid. Unrestrained union demands by some sections of the militant trade union movement which seek higher wages and reduced hours will have the obvious impact which my colleague, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, alluded to earlier. I think both Government and Opposition members are very much aware of the wage push which is taking place. The question of the movement towards a 35-hour working week has been very much a talking point in earlier questions. So far as the Government is concerned, any move towards reduced working hours or a 35-hour working week would have a very significant and devastating impact upon Australian industry and that means upon Australian production, exports and jobs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australian Federal Police officers are posted at stations on the Gold Coast and in Brisbane, Cairns and Townsville. The officers are deployed from those stations when required for suspected offences against Commonwealth law. I should add, of couse, that we get the ready co-operation of the Queensland Police, whose members have the power to enforce Commonwealth laws when Commonwealth officers are not readily available or are not stationed at a particular spot. In talking about the deployment of the Australian Federal Police or its broad objectives I would like to make two points. First of all, the Australian Federal Police works under the normal staffing restraints which the Government imposes on all departments, all statutory authorities and so on. It therefore has to operate efficiently under those restraints. Last December I effected the redeployment of 750 members from the Protective Element of the old Commonwealth Police Force to general duties. This will enable the Australian Federal Police to deploy its members more efficiently in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second and probably most important point is that Australia faces a very grave position with regard to increased violent crime. Therefore, the Commonwealth's objective with regard to the priorities of its police force is that they should centre on these areas:</PARA>
<PARA> Increased anti-narcotic operations; better anti-terrorist capabilities, including the protection of VIPs; better crime intelligence, particularly against organised crime and drug trafficking; and co-operation with other police forces in our country to ensure that we have better unified police services, such as better forensic laboratories, better forensic ability, a better Australian police college, and perhaps better ways of researching crime activity in Australia-all those things to be done, of course, in co-operation with State police forces and other Commonwealth bodies, such as the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Bureau of Customs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that he will review the annual disaster assistance arrangements between his Government and the States at the next Premiers Conference? If so, will he undertake at that conference to promise to lower the prescribed base contributions by State governments to disaster relief, as referred to in Budget Paper No. 7? Does the prescribed base annual expenditure by a State government on disaster relief, in the case of Queensland, accurately or fairly reflect the extremely high incidence of natural disasters to which that State is susceptible? Will he ensure that Queensland is favourably considered in the review of disaster assistance arrangements?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The natural disaster arrangements will be discussed at the forthcoming Premiers Conference. I have made sure that the matter has been listed. Some aspects of the working of those arrangements, especially in relation to drought, have concerned the Commonwealth over the last 12 months or so. There are two parts to the arrangements. We need to keep them clearly separate. The first is that of getting relief to people who have been harmed, whether they are in an urban or a country area, speedily and in a just and equitable manner. Secondly, there is the impact of the arrangements on State Budgets. That part which has an impact on State Budgets is properly a matter for the Premiers Conference. If the honourable member would like to check the kind of base that the States were subject to in earlier years she would find that, relative to their then incomes, the base level that they had to meet was a larger part of the States' incomes than at present. That seems to indicate that the base level which the States need to meet before the Commonwealth subsidises all future payments, at the level of $3 for every $1 from the States, is not really an onerous one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been the practice in any natural disaster for the Commonwealth and the States immediately to apply certain core measures which have been agreed to. The States can take the application of those measures in granting relief to individuals as a matter of course. Over the last year, because of the severity of drought in a number of places, more than one State has made a special approach to the Commonwealth asking that the measures be extended in relation to some aspects of the disaster. In most circumstances that has been done.</PARA>

The Commonwealth will be guided by the most recent Bureau of Transport Economics report on roads and road funding. That report indicates that over the years some States have not had their needs addressed as well as other States have. It is quite appropriate, under the existing legislation, for State governments to submit developmental projects for consideration under the national roads program for the receipt of development grants where significant developmental projects are in operation or are planned. I would be very pleased to have discussions with the South Australian Minister for Roads on any such project that he may have in mind.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen the statistics to which the honourable member refers. The Government can be very proud of them indeed as they indicate that in Australia 3,341,000 people either own their own homes or are in the process of purchasing them. That is an increase of 106,000 since the last survey was conducted in 1978. It is interesting to note that 79.1 per cent of Australian households which have a married head are in the process of owning or purchasing their own homes; that is four out of every five. We find that 55 per cent of households with an unmarried head own their own home. Unfortunately, because of the greater distribution of these people in the population, the percentage on an Australia-wide basis has slipped from 73.4 per cent to 71.9 per cent. But these statistics are very high by world standards and indicate that Australians are secure in their planning for home ownership due to the sound economic policies of the Government. The only thing that concerns me about the future is the enormous effect on the cost of housing which would be brought about by the implementation of a 35-hour working week. That would lead to an increase in the cost of housing of 21 per cent. I only hope that those who sit opposite will support the Government in its efforts to contain costs and ensure that Australian home owners can continue to plan for their future security.</PARA></TALK.START>

I believe that it would be desirable for the Government to have before it the recommendations of the Dix Committee of Review inquiring into the Australian Broadcasting Commission before any further developments occur. Should, as a result of that report, any further considerations be judged necessary, the Government would look at the arrangements under which Radio Australia is established and conducts its operations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This inquiry was foreshadowed in last year's Budget. The committee was established shortly before Christmas and has already made extensive visits to a number of remote areas in Australia. There is a series of public hearings scheduled over the next two months. For example, there will be a hearing in Townsville on 6 April. I understand that the committee has already visited a number of areas in the honourable member's electorate of Kennedy. The Committee is asked to report to the Government in time for its investigations and views to be taken into account by the Government in putting together the Budget for 1981-82. As the honourable member knows, there have not been any adjustments to the basic zone allowance since, I think, the late 1950s, although there have been periodic adjustments to the incremental elements of the allowance whenever other rebates have been adjusted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is not an easy task for the committee because on many occasions views on the relative costs of living in different parts of Australia tend to be subjective rather than totally objective. Sometimes it is very difficult to separate facts from assertions. But the committee membership represents a broad number of interests, including people very familiar with rural areas of Australia, a very well respected member of the Australian trade union movement, a qualified and very distinguished chartered accountant from Sydney and a person who is very familiar with the development area of the north-west of Western Australia. Membership of the committee is very broad-ranging. I think the committee will bring to its findings an intelligent understanding of the various cost pressures, including, I am sure, the effect of any escalation in wages or other costs in remote areas of Australia. I look forward to seeing what the committee has to say when it reports.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I take this opportunity to advise honourable members of Government decisions on a number of matters on domestic air transport, including the Government's initial response to the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. The Government commissioned this inquiry into domestic air fares in 1980 and the inquiry reported on 16 February 1981. The report was tabled in the Parliament shortly thereafter. The inquiry's report is an extensive one and contributes a great deal of valuable work towards expanding the knowledge of airline costs and revenues. However, the inquiry recognised a considerable amount of detailed work would still be necessary to derive and verify the most appropriate fare setting formula based on current costs. The report at page 277 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Verification . . . Various matters associated with determining an air fare pricing policy, derived by way of a formula, will be an exacting task for the regulatory authority. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will arrange immediately further substantial discussions with the airlines so this task can be completed by July 1981. In undertaking this task the Government will, as necessary, draw upon independent advice. At this stage, the Government has accepted the following princples contained in the inquiry's recommendations: First, we will adopt a cost based, nationally consistent approach by use of an air fare formula comprising a flagfall and a distance rate for the national jet network. We endorse the inquiry's view on the approach to be taken to discount fares. The Government supports as wide a range of discount fares as possible without increasing the burden on the full fare paying passenger. Discounts for the aged and provision of tour basing fares are to be considered further with the airlines. The Government is concerned that special innovative discounts which are negotiated by the airlines on the basis of their commercial viability must stand the test of public scrutiny. The Government decided that an independent tribunal should be established with powers to hear and make decisions upon proposals for changes to air fares. The powers, structure and scope of the tribunal are under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated earlier, the report is extensive and further investigation is necessary because, although the broad principles contained in the recommendations are acceptable to the Government, the cost allocation methodology requires detailed analysis. I am concerned also that further consideration must be given to the pricing of the F27 services of Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines. In addition, the report's recommendations advocating the adoption of a profit target must be more fully examined. The Government has decided also in principle to establish TAA as a public company. The Government has under consideration the nature and structure of such a company. Such an arrangement should enable TAA to compete more effectively in a more commercial environment. </PARA>
<PARA> In March, the Government deferred consideration of tariff increases sought by the airlines until it completed its initial review of the inquiry's recommendations. It has now been decided to approve increases in fares using a new formula which meets the thrust of the inquiry's recommendations. The Government was concerned that the delay in this tariff approval is costing the airlines about $1.2m a week. To further delay approval of this increase in an attempt to achieve greater refinements is inappropriate as the lost revenue would ultimately lead to higher fares in order to recoup that revenue. Already the delay has meant that the level of justified increase is now at 8.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of the economy fare increase has been offset by variations in other fare types. Overall, an 8.9 per cent increase in revenue for the airlines was justified and this will be achieved by: First, an increase in the first class differential to 1.45 times the economy fares. After allowing for some diversion from first to economy class travel this adjustment will achieve a reduction of 0.4 per cent in economy fares. Secondly, it will be achieved by a withdrawal of the 20 per cent advance purchase excursion fare, the first class night coach, first class tertiary discount fares and off-peak fares, and a reduction in the level of discounts for APEX fares from 40 per cent to 35 per cent and stand-by fares from 30 per cent to 25 per cent. The adjustments to discount fares will achieve a reduction of 1.1 per cent in economy fares. </PARA>
<PARA> I must emphasise that these variations in fares are entirely consistent with the Holcroft inquiry's recommendations. They enable the level of increase in the economy jet fares to be kept to an average of 7.4 per cent. The new economy jet formula is to be $40 flagfall plus 6.848c per kilometre with a second distance rate-the long distance rate-of 5.821c per kilometre for travel over 2,200 kilometres between Perth and Melbourne or Sydney and Darwin and Adelaide or Brisbane. Recognising the major increases in fares that this formula would bring on routes operated by Ansett and TAA between Melbourne and Tasmania and that alternative land-based modes are not available, the Government has set fares on these routes at 90 per cent of the formula and, in accordance with the approach recommended by the inquiry, the loss in revenue will be met by the Government. This subsidy is expected to cost $5m per annum at the new fare levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The following are a few examples of the impact the new fare formula will have:</PARA>

<PARA>Perth-Sydney  268.10 253.70</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Fares on F27 routes will rise by the average increase which is being achieved through an increase in the flagfall component only. The flagfall will be $30.30 with a distance rate of 9.86c per kilometre-the existing distance rate.</PARA>
<PARA> If the previous practice of relating F27 fares to the economy jet formula had been applied the F27 formula would have been $40 flagfall plus 8.56c per kilometre. </PARA>
<PARA> I should emphasise that the inquiry's report was based on 1979-80 costs. Taking January 1980 as a convenient mid point of that period, the airline costs have risen by almost 30 per cent since that time. The major factors in these increases are, of course, wage rises and higher fuel prices. When that level of cost increase is taken into account, the fact that we have been able to lower fares at all on long distance routes is a major achievement. However, as I have already indicated, further refinement of the formula will be undertaken as soon as possible. The decisions I have announced in respect of the inquiry's recommendations follow the Government's initial review of the Holcroft report. Considerable further work is being pursued and I will advise Parliament further once that task is completed. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I want to register the very strong objection of the Opposition to the manner in which this statement has been prepared and placed before the Parliament. I received a copy of the statement at 2.15 p.m. About seven minutes ago the Opposition was advised that a debate would take place this afternoon with, I think, four speakers from each side of the House. That kind of arrangement shows the Government's absolute contempt of the Parliament. It indicates what little regard those who sit opposite have for the interests of air transport in this country, and particularly their contemptuous attitude towards people who use the airline services of this country. It may be all very well for the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), with 11,000 officers at his disposal, to be able to prepare some sort of ad hoc response to the report of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, but the Parliament is entitled to a better arrangement and to better consideration from this Government than the embattled Minister is giving to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are considering the latest piece of ad hockery from this embattled Minister. Again, the Minister has produced a knee jerk response to a complex and difficult issue, rather than responsibly, carefully and rationally providing for a system of safe and convenient air services at minimum cost to travellers. The changes to the air fares announced by the Minister are based on a continuation of the existing fare formula about which the Holcroft inquiry, in the report presented a few weeks ago, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The specification of the formula used and of its variants is unsound, inadequately monitored and the cause of serious inequities including marked cross-subsidisation between passengers on different routes. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the definition of the expert body set up by this Government, by this Minister, of the fare formula on which the Minister has now based his latest changes. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal item by item with some of the statements made by the Minister in his report to the Parliament. The Minister stated that the Government will be arranging further substantial discussions with the airlines in relation to the fare formula. There is no indication of when that will be. A year has elapsed since the fares inquiry was established. Today a hotchpotch, paste-up kind of report has been placed before the Parliament, but we have been given no indication of what will be the nature of the consultations, when they will be conducted, who will be participating or what will be the deadline for their presentation to this Parliament so that they can be examined in proper detail.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister says that the Government will be drawing upon independent advice. Advice from whom, when, how and where? These questions need to be answered by the Minister. Again, we have had a repetition of the feeding out of a little bit in response to public reaction, trying to quieten the Government back benchers from Western Australia and at the same time not sitting down and working out a proper response to the problems which plague the airline system and which were brought about by the policies of this Government. The Opposition is in agreement with some aspects of the Minister's statement and I will note those as I go through what the Minister had to say. The adoption of a cost-based, nationally-consistent approach by the use of an air fare formula comprising a flagfall and distance rate for the national network is something with which we agree. We agree also with the Government's endorsement of the inquiry's view on the approach to be taken to discount fares. In principle, the Opposition supports the inquiry's recommendations on discount fares. However, we make this qualification: Commercial discounts must be seen to stand on their own in economic terms and not continue to be cross-subsidised by economy fare paying passengers, as is the case at present.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that the delay in the approval of increased air fares has meant that the 'justified' increase has risen from 7.9 per cent to 8.9 per cent. I point out that 7.9 per cent was the figure released by the Department of Transport four weeks ago via its leaking system. We are told by the Minister that in four weeks the justified increase has risen by another one per cent. I suggest that the increase, if any, at most would be in the range of 0.5 per cent. Again we are not told by what means that figure of 8.9 per cent was arrived at. The Minister referred to an increase in the first class differential. Whilst the Opposition supports in principle that there should be proper equity between the first class and the economy class fare levels, no evidence is advanced in the Parliament in justification of a differential of 0.45 per cent. No evidence whatsoever in economic terms has been given to the Parliament; there is no indication of how the Minister and his Department arrived at that figure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister went on to say that the raising of the differential on first-class fares from 37.5 per cent to 45 per cent will mean in overall terms a reduction of 0.4 per cent in economy class fares. Again this figure does not appear to take into account the dilution of fare revenue that will follow a movement of first-class passengers out of that class of travel to economy class travel, with a consequential effect on overall airline revenue. The Minister referred to the withdrawal of the following discounts: The 20 per cent advance purchase excursion fare, the first class night coach fare, the first class tertiary discount fare and off-peak fares, and to reductions in the level of discounts for APEX fares from 40 per cent to 35 per cent and stand-by fares from 30 per cent to 25 per cent. It is interesting to note that again-I have to use the word 'again' over and over-that move was requested by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. No economic justification is provided and no mathematical calculation is given. Just a submission from Ansett Transport industries Ltd. We ought to recall that when those changes were brought in, it was claimed that they were innovations. Now, a matter of months later, we find that they are being withdrawn at the behest of the organisation which sponsored their introduction. The Minister's statement on that section is in stark contrast to this statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government supports as wide a range of discount fares as possible without increasing the burden on the full fare paying passenger. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Parliament to contrast those two statements made by the Minister. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned that special innovative discounts which are negotiated by the airlines on the basis of their commercial viability must stand the test of public scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>We on this side of the chamber would have preferred to hear him say that the Government is adamant, rather than that the Government is concerned. It is a milky statement which leaves an opportunity for the Minister to back out again from any firm commitment to reform which is aimed at improving the lot of air travellers in this country. He does not tell us what the form of public scrutiny will be. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government decided that an independent tribunal be established with powers to hear and make decisions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We would like to think that that independent tribunal would be in the nature of a prices justification tribunal where there would be public hearings at which sworn evidence would be given and at which the airlines would be compelled to produce evidence. But the Minister has not made that statement. If it is to be an independent tribunal with the powers to which I referred a few moments ago, that is something which we on this side of the chamber would commend and which we would regard as a victory after almost three and a half years of campaigning for a public justification process for fare increases by the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> Again in the Minister's statement there is no reference to consumer representation on such a tribunal. We are adamant that there should be representation of those who use the services, not just those who profit from the use of the services or those in the bureaucracy who decide on the price, quality and range of services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister refers to the pricing of Ansett and TAA F27 services. That again leaves considerable room for doubt. No information is given as to the nature of an inquiry or where or how that will be established; there is no reference to the fact that in the recent Holcroft inquiry Ansett was able to escape providing information with respect to F27 services, and no assurance from the Minister that there will be a public examination of the provision of F27 services, particularly the regional airline services operated by the subsidiaries of Ansett. Almost tossed in there, tucked away in a couple of sentences, the Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided in principle to establish TAA as a public company. </PARA>
<PARA> Government members-Hear, hear!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those who sit opposite and say 'Hear, hear' might consider their role as protectors of the public purse and of the the public assets. That airline has been built out of the dedication of people who have served it and the support which it has been given by the Australian community, despite all the barriers and impediments placed in its way by conservative governments. Let me say this: Changing the form of ownership of TAA will do nothing to lessen air fares for Australian air travellers. It is an exercise in accounting that might satisfy some of the free enterprise prophets on the opposite side, but we can achieve a better result by retaining full ownership of TAA by the Australian community, by retaining the existing structure and by making minor amendments to existing legislaion. There is no need to dispose of TAA, and we on this side of the chamber will use every means at our disposal to oppose any dismemberment of TAA. It belongs to the Australian people; it has served the Australian people well. The fact that air fares are not at higher levels than they presently are is because TAA has been operating and providing airline services to the people in this country. Since the 1940s, the only contribution to TAA has been something like $15m. Let me say to those honourable members opposite who guffaw at such an important issue, who posture about the role of airlines in this country, but who vote in support of legislation to preserve the status quo-the test is how one votes, and they have always voted for the preservation of the status quo-that TAA in its operations has acted as a monitor and as a brake on the level of air fares in this country. Change can be brought about to reduce the level of air fares and this can be achieved by altering the existing legislation, not by the dismembering of the airline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me move to that section of the Minister's statement where he referred to flagfalls. Here again we have an ad hoc, impromptu alteration to the flagfall charge. The flagfall charge was not a figure established upon an analysis of cost. It was not a figure established upon a dissection of overhead costs, of on-ground costs as compared with in-flight costs of airline operations. It was a figure plucked out of the air in 1974 as a beginning, and since then adjusted in subsequent fare increases. Here we have the latest piece of ad hockery. The flagfall is now up to $40. We might also ask the same question in relation to the distance limit of 2,200 kilometres. Again those opposite who posture ought to bear this in mind. I have not heard one word from them about it. The limit of 2,200 kilometres for the rate per kilometre of the distance of travel, interestingly enough, is just in excess of the 2,120 kilometres between Adelaide and Perth. They might direct their minds to the science involved in arriving at the figure of 2,200 kilometres. The point I make is that it is ad hockery. There is no analysis of the relationship of the 2,200 kilometres figure that has been set within the actual needs or costs incurred by the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> Moving to the adjustment to fares between Tasmania and the mainland, this statement by the Minister has to be regarded as a complete embarrassment for him. I could not quickly find the rip-roaring statement that he issued during the election campaign from that metropolis to the north-west Enngonia, in which he absolutely ridiculed the proposition to subsidise air travel to and from Tasmania. That is in effect what is happening here. He ridiculed the proposition put by the Australian Labor Party at the last election. I do not have the statement, but I will get a copy of it for honourable members when I can put my hands on it. They will be rather surprised to read what the Minister for Transport thinks of that proposition. Obviously he has caved in on this matter, and it is to his embarrassment that the Government is now adopting a policy put forward by the Australian Labor Party at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the fare structure and the changes that have been made, we find minor reductions in fares between Darwin and Brisane, Melbourne and Perth and Perth and Sydney, and increases in respect of all the other places mentioned. The point to make there is that these are impromptu reactions. They have not been thought through. There has not been any basis announced for their establishment, other than as a utilisation of the existing formula. There has been no study of the rate per kilometre or the existing rate being charged, and there has been no justification for the impromptu change being made to the flagfall charges in respect of the F27 aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> When referring to the rise in airline costs the Minister's statement neglects to mention the rise in airline revenues, the rise in airline productivity and the rise in airline load factors. It seems that none of those matters have been taken into consideration by the Minister in arriving at these recommendations. In effect, the changes being made between some of the fare structures really amount to robbing Peter to pay Paul. My understanding of what the Minister wanted to do was that he wanted to have the fare increases announced, but not make any reference to changes in respect of Perth and across Australia, and then at a later stage announce those as a separate reduction, so that he would get better political impact. What has happened here is that a minor change has been made to Perth-East Coast fares. Another matter which is not addressed by the Minister in his statement and which is relevant and ought to have been addressed is recommendation 13 of the Holcroft inquiry which relates to load factors. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating a very welcome statement by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt). I might say that since the tabling the report of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares the Minister has worked consistently and conscientiously to determine a government response in an effort to bring that response to public light as quickly as possible, because that is what the public has demanded. We have seen an incredible response from the Opposition this afternoon-an Opposition that had over an hour to prepare some sort of argument on this ministerial statement. The Opposition spokesman on transport matters, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), who was not in the House during Question Time today, was furiously trying to determine what to say. All I can say in response to what he had to say is that I am glad he did not have more time because his remarks could not have been any worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This afternoon a statement was made announcing important Government initiatives with respect to air fares in accordance with the Holcroft report and a further statement was made of the Government's intention with respect to the future domestic air fare setting formula and air transport policy in this country, again in accordance with the Holcroft report. For weeks the Opposition has been calling for the Government's response to the Holcroft report. When at last it gets that response the very most it can be is extremely begrudging. Circumstances have overtaken me, and I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour this day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the past couple of weeks there have been a number of developments in the corporate sphere of the Australian economy and its administration which have all added up to one result. Due to weak laws and weak administration, the Fraser Government is responsible for the interests of ordinary people being sacrificed to the worst features of company behaviour. So we have higher prices and the inadequacies of the Prices Justification Tribunal. We have monopolies resulting in mergers arising, for instance, out of the extraordinary recent episodes on the stock exchanges. The Trade Practices Commission has inadequate powers. We have takeovers running wild and the exposure of the weaknesses of existing laws in relation to the National Companies and Securities Commission. This relates particularly to the takeover battle for Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd and the proposed merger of Elders with Henry Jones (IXL) Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first of the developments to which I refer is the Government-inspired leak that, at worst, the Prices Justification Tribunal will be abolished and, at best, it will be merged with the Trade Practices Commission. This would be a retrograde step. The Opposition deplores this possibility. The Prices Justification Tribunal has been sufficiently damaged as it is. It has been dismembered. It has a staff of a mere 70, half its previous strength. Even in its present inadequate form and within the limits of its restricted capacity, it does some valuable work in protecting the interests of ordinary people against some of the excessive prices charged by some firms in the corporate sector. I would like the House to listen to this quotation:</PARA>
<PARA> Unregulated monopoly may not be tolerable and either public regulation or ownership may be the lesser evil. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether anyone in this House could guess from where that quotation comes, even if I gave the clue that it certainly is not from somebody who has tendencies to democratic socialism. The quotation comes from none other than the chief disciple of monetarism, Milton Friedman. In his book Capitalism and Freedom he conceded that public regulation-even public ownership; he is conceding public ownership-could be a lesser evil than unregulated monopoly. Of course, the Labor Party believes that regulation is better than unregulated monopoly. Where there is true competition safeguarding the people's interests, of course, that regulation is not necessary; but we want the regulation where the corporate power is unbridled, where the alternative is unregulated monopoly. </PARA>
<PARA> I return the focus of honourable members to the PJT. Even in its dismembered form it has done some valuable work. It should be doing a lot more work. We know, for instance, that in the year 1979-80 it saved Australian motorists about $160m. This amount was the difference between what the oil companies were requesting in increased prices and what the PJT granted in the way of increased prices. If this Government disbands this Tribunal, that will not be the end of regulation. That important regulation of the oil industry in particular is essential. It will be carried out by some of the States, but with much less efficiency. What does the Government think it will achieve by abolishing the PJT? It certainly will not help its friends in the oil companies. Furthermore, such a blow to the interests of the ordinary motorists in this country will come at a time when petrol discounting is dying. The oil companies will have an open go for profit taking. What about other areas to which the PJT should be directing its interests? I am referring here to the prices charged for aluminium and copper. Why are the companies involved charging import parity prices, whatever their costs, when aluminium and copper prices in the world economy are on the way up but not charging world prices when aluminium and copper prices are on the way down? Australian aluminium and copper companies ask for cost plus when the world prices are on the way down but they want world parity prices when they are on the way up. This is a scandal which needs close examination by the PJT. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar situation exists in relation to beer prices. Why does a schooner of beer in Western Australia cost more than it does in Adelaide? I believe it is because the Swan Brewery Co. Ltd is making bigger profits which it is using to buy up other breweries and other ventures. Surely this should be examined by the PJT. This would be the case if we had an active and sympathetic government watching people's interests instead of championing company interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague the honourable member for Hawker asks: 'Where is the Minister?' The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) is going to Sydney at dinner time. Originally this debate was to be brought at short notice close to dinner time. The business of the House has been arranged so that this debate will coincide with the Minister's being here, as he properly should be. He can answer the points raised in this important debate. I am looking forward to his being in the chamber, as I know he is not going to Sydney until dinner time. We have made arrangements for him to be here so that this matter is not left to people such as the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) and other Government back benchers who would be totally incapable of dealing with a debate such as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was talking about the Prices Justification Tribunal and the enormously important role that it has to play. Company profits, after tax, are at a record level. Unfortunately, at the present time a dismembered, toothless PJT can do little about them. Inflationary expectations of 13 per cent or 14 per cent are being written into prices. This is adding to inflation. What is the Fraser Government's response to this? The razor gang wants to bring to an end the activities of the PJT which acts on behalf of ordinary people, as little as those activities have been. There are rumours that the Government will go along with this recommendation this weekend. I believe that meetings are to be held on Friday and Monday. I wish to put on record that the Opposition deplores this development. We draw attention to the enormous contrast that such a decision represents to the Cabinet's other decision not to accept the recommendation of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peacock) to abolish the Industrial Relations Bureau. It is the function of the IRB to harass people and unions and to cause confrontation and alienation in this society. In spite of its vast cost to the taxpayer, it continues in existence by Cabinet decision. It is the function of the PJT to protect ordinary people against corporate power. Firstly, it has been dismembered and, secondly, we learn that it is under threat of extinction. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to turn to the activities of the stock exchanges and the ineffectiveness of the Trade Practices Commission. Over the last week Australia has witnessed again a mammoth takeover battle which has ended with the proposed merger of Elder Smith Goldsborough Mort Ltd with Henry Jones (IXL) Ltd. Perhaps, more importantly, this same battle is likely to result in Carlton and United Breweries Ltd taking a major shareholding of at least 25 per cent in the merged group. This takeover battle and merger, like the many that have gone before it-I could mention Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, Ansett Transport Industries Ltd and many others-raises a vast array of issues which the current Government has virtually ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> Our principal concern in relation to these issues is the public interest, the interests of ordinary people in our community. How is the public interest affected by the rash of takeovers which have been occurring in Australia since 1977? What damage to the public interest is there, arising from the increasing monopolisation of Australian industries? What costs are to be borne by various sections of the community as a result of corporate pricing decisions which are not subject to the restraints of effective market competition and which, equally, are not scrutinised by any public price justification requirements? What effect will takeover battles, which are subject to the uncertainties of State government action, and which leave minority shareholders out in the cold, have on the efficiency of the Australian equity capital market and its ability to generate the funds needed to meet Australia's growing investment requirements, particularly in view of the resources expansion which is taking place right now? These are issues of the utmost importance. They are being ignored by the Fraser Government. It is not good enough for the Government to talk blandly of the merits of the private sector and the need to cut the costs of supposed government regulation. It is not good enough to engage in a protracted review of regulatory functions which are aimed at undermining the little remaining effectiveness of such bodies as the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Justification Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is strongly opposed to the further watering down of the powers of these bodies. The Opposition is aware that the public interest is not served by uncontrolled private sector activities. In fact, we want more and better regulation. We do not want regulation for the sake of regulation. We want sensitive regulation. Certainly we want to see that that regulation is adequate. We want it to be effective and we want the legislation covering the regulation to be effective in these areas. We want more resources for more active administration of that improved legislation. We are not alone in this view. The minority shareholders of many of the companies, such as Elders, who have been denied proper rights by the lack of control exercised over takeovers under current and prospective legislation, would agree on the need for a workable code of conduct. The State governments, particularly in Queensland and South Australia, are concerned that some consideration of the public interest, particularly of the need for the retention of some corporate decision-making in cities other than Melbourne and Sydney, should be given in the case of takeovers of companies based in their States. At the moment we have with these takeovers more and more decision-making being transferred to Melbourne and Sydney only. I do not believe that this is in the national interest. I know it is not in the interests of the economies of the regions which are built on Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart and Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> Many business leaders are aware of the need for mechanisms which vet takeover and merger proposals to ensure that they do not seriously damage competition. Similarly, all the other major common law jurisdictions elsewhere in the world-jurisdictions with which we share not only a common heritage but also a strong belief in individual freedom-have enacted laws to regulate and, where necessary, control the activities of firms vested with monolopy power. Let me cite one of them. That so-called home of free enterprise, the United States of America, through the Sherman and Clayton Federal Acts, has anti-monopoly and anti-merger laws which put our current mish-mash of legislation to shame. The laws in the United States now have been operating successfully with a high degree of public approval for three-quarters of a century. Yet we have this Fraser Government creating this dissension in the community by getting rid of this very minimal form of regulation which we require to see that corporate behaviour is channelled in such a way that it follows the interests of ordinary people in our country. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the Trade Practices Commission and its Act. In effect the Government abolished control of mergers in 1977. Ever since then, Australia has witnessed a wave of takeovers and mergers. Fortunes, often tax free, have been amassed in this process. In some cases, State governments have intervened or threatened to the intervene in highly unsatisfactory attempts to put some restraint on these activities. As a result, the government's irresponsible abdication of its duties in this area has resulted only in greater uncertainty and inefficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's inconsistency does not stop there. Whilst it encourages the increasing monopolisation of Australian industry, including such trends as increased vertical integration of industry as achieved by the Elder Smith-Henry Jones merger, it still retains the fiction that price determination in the private economy is based on market forces alone. This will not happen. Here is Elder Smith, with all the production of primary products at its disposal, merging with Henry Jones, which then buys that. There is vertical integration there and great chances for monopoly situations to develop. I am not saying that they will. What I am saying is that we need a trade practices commission that will look at that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Monopolisation and market competition are directly contradictory. The potential for prices to be raised to higher levels or at a faster rate than should be the case inevitably arises wherever market power is concentrated. The inconsistencies and irresponsibilities of the Government are revealed by this recent merger activity. However, how anyone can gain from the recent goings-on a confident view of the operations of the private sector is beyond comprehension. How it can be seen to encourage small shareholders is also beyond belief. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not understand the words contained in the matter of public importance which has been proposed by the Opposition for discussion today. I believe they do not say anything. Similarly, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) did not add to our state of knowledge on the subject by what he told us in the House this afternoon. Let me pick up some of the points that he did make. He talked about unregulated monopoly power. He alleged that that was taking place in the corporate sector in Australia today. He did not talk about the abuse of monopoly power occurring in Australia today in the form of abuse of their power by trade union officials and trade unions. He did not talk about the effect on industry and employment of the abuse of that monopoly power by trade unions in relation to the 35-hour working week. He did not say that the trade unions had abused their power by walking away from the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. That is what is happening today in the Australian community. We have had a switch from the nineteenth century, when there were abuses of power by individual managers and owners, with a full circle being turned until today in the community the abuse of monopoly power is found in the monopoly of unions. By and large, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has been ineffective in controlling the abuse of power by monopoly unions. Let us hear more on that from the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Adelaide then went on to talk about the Prices Justification Tribunal. He said it was going to be disbanded. I do not know whether it will be disbanded. Let me make and take a point in relation to it. There is a case for saying that, if market forces are allowed to determine prices, lower prices will be achieved, in some cases, than where prices are approved by a prices justification tribunal. The history of the Prices Justification Tribunal itself is a long one. The first case it dealt with was the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd case. If BHP, all those years ago, had challenged the Tribunal's decision it would have found that it was of doubtful constitutional validity in any case. That is my personal view. The honourable member for Adelaide tried to lead the House astray by saying that the PJT was necessary to regulate the oil industry. The PJT has done a good job occasionally in looking at aspects of the oil industry referred to it for report. It has never been said by the Government-and I am not aware that it has been said by the Opposition before today-that it was meant to be a regulatory authority. It is not. It does not have permanent power to regulate the oil industry. What we are hearing from the Opposition today is a proposition that the role of the PJT ought to be expanded, that more public servants ought to be allocated to it and that there ought to be more regulation, bureaucracy and red tape, the total effect of which, I assume, would be to put up prices to the consumer. The Opposition is not concerned about the effect of costs-the costs of red tape, extra public servants and interference in the private sector-on the consumers themselves. It is the consumer who pays ultimately for all the types of bureaucracy and all the regulation of which the honourable member for Adelaide is in favour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Hawker interjects that there is no doubt about that. Let me draw the attention of the honourable member for Hawker and the honourable member for Adelaide to one or two things that have been happening in Australia in the last few days. Obviously, those honourable members have not been looking at television or reading the newspaper. If they had they might have heard of references to a company called ICI Australia Ltd and the Government's position in relation to that company. That matter was resolved to the satisfaction of the people of Australia, the corporate sector and the Government today. I do not think the honourable member for Adealide could say that the Government was championing company interests in relation to that matter, but he did not choose to mention the matter. He led us astray. He completely ignored it. I think it is unfair of him to come into this House and say, as he did, that we are championing the corporate sector. That is absolutely incorrect. All the honourable member did was to attack the corporate sector and attack the word 'profit'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Adelaide referred to the razor gang and then called for bigger and better regulation, as he called it. He is undoubtedly in favour of bigger regulation because bigger regulation means more interference in the marketplace. It means achievement of the socialist objective by stealth. If the Labor Party cannot do this in pure terms by the nationalisation or the socialisation of the means of production and exchange, as is democratically possible in terms of the platform of the Labor Party, which it is currently arguing about changing so that we might all think the platform is a little different and is not really there, the Labor Party has to do it by regulation, by interference with people, by interference with corporations, by interference in the marketplace. The Labor Party is for interference so that it can achieve that objective in a backhanded fashion, by stealth. Members of the Labor Party are in favour of larger government and that means spending more of the taxpayers' dollars on government. They want to expand government. They want to expand the growth of the public sector in this economy. They want to expand the bureaucracy and the growth of the number of public servants in Canberra. Let there be no doubt that that is what the Opposition in this place is about. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Adelaide also talked about the Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd takeover that is going on at present. He said that nothing was happening in relation to the takeover. Let me remind the honourable member for Adelaide that, in fact, the Trade Practices Commission has this matter under consideration at present. I will repeat that for the sake of the honourable member. The Trade Practices Commission has this matter under consideration at this time. The honourable member for Adelaide did not advert to that fact in his speech. In fact, he tried to lead the House astray by saying that the matter was not under consideration. Let me draw the attention of the honourable member for Adelaide and the honourable member for Hawker to the Trade Practices Act, which I have in my hand. Section 50, the merger section of the Trade Practices Act, is in place in Australian law today. The Trade Practices Commission is carrying out an investigation at this very time. The section states:</PARA>
<PARA> A corporation shall not acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares in the capital . . . if-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) as a result of the acquisition, the corporation would be, or be likely to be, in a position to control or dominate a market for goods or services . . . </PARA>

Currently, the Commonwealth, Western Australia and South Australia have passed Bills in relation to that matter. We await legislation from Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania. I think New South Wales has legislation on the matter before its Parliament at present. It is contemplated that the agreement will be in place, that all this legislation will be passed, by 30 June and that as at 1 July we will have a National Companies and Securities Commission, which this Government has legislated for as an example of co-operative federalism with the State governments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is endorsed by the honourable member for Hawker when he says that that is right. What was the Labor Party going to do? It was going to ignore the State parliaments and it was going to ignore States' rights in creating this body. That would have led to total chaos in markets, total uncertainty in the community and undoubted constitutional challenge. As the House knows, constitutional challenge is not something that can be handled quickly-it takes a lot of time. The Labor Party, by its centralist action, would have taken away powers from the States on the one hand and created enormous uncertainty in the marketplace on the other. Corporations, boards of directors, companies and individuals in fact would not have known what the current position was and people would not have been able to act. Investment would not have taken place. People would not, in fact, know in what areas they were able to plan for the future. That is what the Opposition is about. That would have been a totally unsatisfactory situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The National Companies and Securities Commission legislation has a takeover code in it. I draw that to the attention of honourable members opposite. If they read that, I would hope that they would be enlightened by it. The Government hopes that, following the legislation it has initiated, a national companies Act would be the next step and possibly would be in place by January 1982. I understand that discussions between the Commonwealth and the States are at a fairly advanced stage. One would be hopeful of an agreement on a text. If so, the Commonwealth, I hope, would go ahead in the autumn session of this Parliament and the States would follow suit. </PARA>
<PARA> In the minutes available let me just sum up where the Government stands on the administration of corporate behaviour. The Government's objectives in relation to economic management have been put clearly to the public and I believe are well understood. This Government is applying a steady, consistent approach to management of the economy which has, as its primary emphasis, a strong anti-inflationary thrust aimed at correcting the fundamental distortions which wrenched the economy so severely off course, in the mid-1970s-the years of Labor mismanagement. The Government has therefore sought to promote a satisfactory economic environment, to protect the free flow of market forces, to encourage economic development and efficiency and to safeguard, where necessary, the interests of consumers by proscribing unfair business practices. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to be identified with the Government's efforts in that regard, because it does not represent big business or support the abuse of union power by union officials. It supports the individual Australian, the person in the middle. It is a real Liberal Government, with a small '1' which protects the interests of individuals in the community. That point needs to be clearly understood. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also established a framework within which businessmen and consumers may again take decisions with confidence. As the Government controls inflation, consumers can buy goods in the market-place that are within their reach. There has been no sudden, dramatic action by the Government to reduce demand or to expose the economy to increased external competition, as there would have been under a Labor administration. Instead, we have had a steady, moderate but persistent approach towards the restoration of economic health. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the assertions of the Opposition, whilst the Government would not deny that there are individual, isolated examples of inappropriate corporate behaviour, it is absurd of the honourable member for Adelaide and the honourable member for Hawker to suggest that bad corporate behaviour is a general feature of Australian business. As I said earlier, the Government has acted to ensure that responsible corporate behaviour is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to trade practices, the Government strongly supports the concept of open competition and the development of conditions to promote this. The Government's approach to the Prices Justification Tribunal has mirrored developments in the economy since it took office. As I have said, the Government has created an economic environment which has permitted the development of competitive forces. Today the Australian consumer is much better off than he or she was under the maladministration of a Labor government. I reject totally the proposition put to the House by the honourable member for Adelaide and am pleased to speak against it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support wholeheartedly the matter of public importance which has been so ably proposed by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). This Government deserves the strongest condemnation for its failure to scrutinise the succession of takeovers and mergers which have recently plagued this country. From the outset we should understand that the motivation behind these takeovers and mergers has been a desire to lessen competition-to create monopolies, if you like-or to carry out a smash and grab raid on the stock exchange. The recent Holmes a'Court attempt to take over Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd and the merger of that company with Henry Jones (IXL) Ltd illustrated both of these features. The initial takeover attempt by Holmes a'Court netted a $16m profit, apparently tax free, after a three-day exercise on the stock exchange. That is what is referred to as 'market forces'. The merger between Elders and Henry Jones has resulted in a lessening in competition in at least one area. Henry Jones (IXL) Ltd produces processed stock feed which is sold by Elders. The vertical integration which has resulted from this and other mergers will escape any scrutiny by the Government to determine whether these changes are against the public interest. The Government, by the inadequacy of its legislation, has tolerated a situation in which the majority of shareholders in Elders have been deprived of any opportunity to assess alternative offers and to determine the future of their company. The interests of small investors have been ignored yet again by the Government which claims to be their champion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Adelaide has already described how the deliberate emasculation of the Trade Practices Act in 1977 by this Government has effectively removed limitations in the way of mergers and takeovers. I want to indicate how the absence of effective companies and securities legislation to cover the actual conduct of mergers and takeover bids has further acted against the public interest. It is a disgrace that, thanks to the laxity of the Government, the National Companies and Securities Commission is still not in operation. On previous occasions in this House I have pointed out that the important and crucial question in this whole area is: Which form of legislation and which structure will give the best security and protection to the investor, the shareholder, the employee and ultimately, and most improtantly, the community? Obviously, an effective national Act is necessary if we are to provide this protection. </PARA>
<PARA> Particularly glaring deficiencies in the Companies (Acquistion of Shares) Act, which is part of the Government's delayed co-operative companies and securities scheme, were also highlighted in the Elders case. That Act sets a 20 per cent shareholding threshold at which statutory controls are to be imposed on acquisitions. However, the wash-up of the Elders manoeuvres will result in Carlton and United Breweries becoming the largest shareholder, with at least 25 per cent of Elders' capital. It has obtained this dominant position through its 34 per cent holding in Henry Jones (IXL), plus its purchase of the BT Australia Ltd shares in Elders. Those BT Australia shares were originally purchased by a Holmes a'Court Bell Group shell company, which was in turn purchased by BT Australia on behalf of unknown clients. The point is that the manner in which the effective takeover of Elders by Carlton and United Breweries was achieved has effectively circumvented the 20 per cent threshold. In short, the Elders case reveals that no real protection for minority shareholders exists under proposed or existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of collusion in the Elders case must also be considered seriously. The tragedy of present deficiencies in the law is that no one even knows the identity of many of the key participants in these events. The so-called white knights purchased about 18 per cent of Elders to block the initial Bell Group takeover. Apart from the Advertiser, which declared its interest on passing the mandatory 5 per cent level of shareholding, we do not know who bought another 8 or 9 per cent of the Elders shares and what their interest was. This highlights beyond question at least three specific inadequacies of the takeover legislation. Firstly, the 5 per cent disclosure level is too high. Secondly, the time lag permitted, in which to report to the stock exchange on the attainment of these threshold level, is far too long. The complex Elders takeover exercise was completed in only a few days. Thirdly, the use of nominee companies allows the beneficial owners to be disguised. In the Elders case the merchant bank, BT Australia, purchased the 19.9 per cent Bell Group holding in Elders on behalf of unknown clients. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Elders case highlights serious deficiencies in the existence and application of takeover laws, the Government's failings in this area can be viewed in a wider context. In particular, it makes an utter mockery of any concern expressed by the Government that the benefits of expanded mineral and energy projects should be shared by all Australians through greater equity participation. Why should small investors keep getting their fingers burnt? Is it any wonder that participation by ordinary Australians on the stock market has continued to decline when the number of rip-offs taking place there continues? We have progressed little from the days of Poseidon and the great stock market scandals of a decade ago. The increasing monopolisation of Australian industry and its consequences for the community at large must also be examined in the absence of any effective takeover barriers. The mergers of large firms do more than just reduce competition and raise consumer prices. Fewer and fewer decision-makers now determine matters which tangibly effect all Australians, such as the television that we watch or the food that we buy. The decisions made about our mineral and energy resources are also crucially important to our future prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to note that the big mining companies in the United States are now especially tempting and vulnerable targets for takeovers because their profits have hit rock bottom. In many cases, their shares have been trading at way under book value. Low metal prices, inflationary costs and big spending on anti-pollution measures have kept the industry depressed and short of cash. On the other hand, companies awash with oil profits are seeking to diversify, and their nearest cousins are other resources companies. Conservatively, we now have in the United States a situation in which oil companies produce 35 per cent of the nation's copper, 25 per cent of its uranium and 25 per cent of its coal. The sheer size of some of the potential acquisitions that could result in the near future is enormous, although United States anti-trust provision might be invoked. The social implications of these changes would be far-reaching. We should be aware that a similar situation is occurring in Australia, but without anti-trust protection; there is none. The oil companies are swallowing up coal and other mining companies, with little resistance from Foreign Investment Review Board. Foreign corporations such as MIM Holdings Ltd and Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd have been exempted from even these controls under their artificial status as Australianising companies. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like the honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield), who is to follow me in this debate, to explain why in the national companies and securities legislation there is no provision covering nominee company or share transactions. Why has such a provision been deleted? In the case of takeovers, particularly those in which the Foreign Investment Review Board, is involved why should not nominee companies or shareholdings be disclosed? How can we assess the level of foreign equity involved if we cannot make an assessment of the level of nominee shares or company holdings? It is a farce; it is a fraud. In this climate, the absence of any effective regulation of takeovers, the omission of any scrutiny over the social effects of the increasing monopolisation of Australian industry and the lack of action by the Government to protect the interests of small investors and the community at large is nothing short of criminal negligence, and the Government stands condemned for it. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on this note when referring to market forces and private enterprise. Over the last decade, that I can recall, time after time companies in the corporate sector have collapsed. Every time there is a move to strengthen the provisions of the Companies Act to overcome that glaring anomaly, it is opposed on the ground that market forces and private enterprise should prevail. It is an utter disgrace. We have had the spectacle over the last two years of $8m being ripped off through the utter incompetence of insurance brokers. Yet, when legislation to cover this is recommended, we hear the same old argument by the Treasury-we have to leave it to market forces and private enterprise. In each one of those cases it is the consumer who suffers. The cry from the Government is: 'Never interfere with the corporate sector'. For too long the consumer has been forced to suffer, and regulation in this area, in particular, is a necessity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I first read the text of the matter of public importance presented for debate by the Opposition, I wondered what sort of tack its members would take. I have great respect for the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) and the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), but obviously there was a lot of confusion in the tack they took. The honourable member for Adelaide began by talking about the Prices Justification Tribunal. An analysis of what the honourable member said shows that he both supported it and rejected it. I presume he supported the Prices Justification Tribunal simply because there were some rumours around the place that perhaps the Tribunal will not continue. From that point of view, he supported it. Later he said that the Prices Justification Tribunal is only a tool for carrying on inflation and adding the inflation aspect to prices paid by the consumer. He said words to that effect. On the one hand he wants the Tribunal to continue but, on the other hand, from what he said, he wants to have it abolished.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The remarks of honourable members opposite indicate that this Government has done nothing to protect the consumer and nothing about some practices by corporations that certainly are not desired in the community. I and the Government have great sympathy with many of the things members of the Opposition have suggested and many of the problems they have identified. I will come to those aspects later. Honourable members should have an understanding of the responsibilities and actions of the three government bodies referred to by members of the Opposition. It is worth while noting that the Prices Justification Tribunal was formed in 1973. It came into operation in the years of a Labor Government. Certainly, it has provided some benefits to the community. It has been active in price surveillance and it has conducted public inquiries. The most notable of its activities has been determining the price levels of petroleum products throughout Australia. Certainly it can be criticised, as the honourable member for Adelaide said. Perhaps it has been a tool that has automatically allowed prices to go up, without taking into consideration improved productivity and efficiency when making some of its decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Be that as it may, the crux of the whole discussion and the government organisation that we should be looking at, which will have a great future and which clearly shows our concern for what has been happening in the stock market and in the securities business, is the National Companies and Securities Commission. It was formed by this Government, in co-operation and after discussion with all the State and Territory governments in Australia, for the sole reason of having uniform laws and regulations throughout Australia with regard to companies and securities organisations. It was formed to give us the teeth to do something about the situation. The decision to establish the Commission was finalised only in December 1978 and it commenced its operations in March of last year-just over 12 months ago. The objects and responsibilities of the Commission indicate that it will go a long way towards controlling some of the situations identified by members of the Opposition. This Government has no wish to tolerate any bad corporate behaviour. It is not beneficial to the country; it is beneficial to no one except a minority. We do not want to see people make money out of speculation. We do not want to see the type of situation that has just developed in South Australia involving Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd, where a Western Australian company made $16m on sheer speculation, punting on the stock market. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="837">Mr BRADFIELD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not want to see that. It is through the National Companies and Securities Commission that we can do something about it. The honourable member for Hawker tells me that that company will pay no tax. We are aware of that situation; we are concerned about it and do not want to see it continue. Earlier this week when the Treasurer (Mr Howard) answered a question in Parliament, he too showed concern at the method used by that Western Australian company to take the money that it supposedly made from that deal. We do not want to see that sort of situation continue. It was this Government that went ahead and formed the Commission and it is this Government that can utilise the Commission to regulate company laws throughout Australia. The Opposition well knows that those laws came under the responsibility of the various State governments-some of them Labor governments-and yet none of them appeared to do anything about the matter. In my State of New South Wales, the Labor Government has done very little to stop the adverse company situations that have developed. A few years ago companies such as Minsec, Mainline and Cambridge Credit-and the honourable member for Hawker mentioned Poseidon-during the mineral boom--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="837">Mr BRADFIELD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission did nothing about it, and the honourable member knows full well that the Federal Government had no authority to do anything about it at that time. We do have that authority now, through co-operating with the States, and we know exactly what we will do. We do not want to see the small consumer hurt; we want to have the teeth in the legislation to protect the consumer. In fact, with the co-operation of the National Companies and Securities Commission, I hope we will be taking over this kind of protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mention briefly the Trade Practices Commission, because little has been said about it in this debate, even though the Opposition clearly has listed it in the matter for discussion. That organisation came into operation in October 1974. Again, the legislation for the commission was brought into this Parliament during the era of the Labor Government. That body has done much. I recently looked at some of the Bills that have been before the Parliament in the last 12 months, amending the Trade Practices Commission legislation. An amendment in April 1980 brought in certain safeguards to Australia's shippers for their exports. Also in May 1980 legislation introduced provisions on secondary boycotts. When honourable members look at the combination of the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Justification Tribunal they will see that the Australian consumer has received some advantages from those organisations. But the organisation which is really going to show its teeth and which will go a long way towards rectifying some of the problems that the honourable member for Hawker and the honourable member for Adelaide have identified is the National Companies and Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Opposition will stop being negative in its suggestions on this matter, as it usually is on economic policies. As the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) said, the Opposition does not seem to like private enterprise or the word 'profit'. While it adopts this attitude, it is not doing very much to further free enterprise in Australia. The free enterprise system, even with its failings, is the system which will benefit the Australian people best. It is the system that over the years has given affluence to the Australian people. We must be prepared to further that system, and at the same time, through Government legislation, make sure that the consumers and the small people are protected while this free enterprise system is working and providing benefits to all Australians. I totally reject the matter proposed for discussion by the Opposition. The words which have been put down are quite meaningless. The Government totally rejects the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate on this important statement was adjourned, I was in the process of congratulating the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) for making what by any yardstick is a very speedy response to a very comprehensive report. It is a report of three volumes containing some 36 recommendations. We have had a substantive response from the Government in only six weeks. I highlighted earlier the desperation and the transparency of the comments that have been made in this debate by the Opposition. The Minister, over the past weeks, has been criticised for not making a response to the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. Now, when he does make a substantial and significant response, of course he is criticised again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last week in this Parliament I had the opportunity to make some comments about the Holcroft report, and I would like to remind the House what the three main findings were. They were, firstly, that there was evidence of gross cross-subsidisation between routes; secondly, that the present air fare setting formula and procedure were deficient; and, thirdly, that there was a lack of desirable accountability in a regulated environment which should have been enforced by the regulatory authority. In response to those three main findings, the Holcroft committee went on to put down three main recommendations. Those recommendations addressed specifically those three main findings-that is, firstly, to eliminate cross-subsidisation; secondly, to establish a new air fare setting formula and procedure; and, thirdly, to improve the regulatory authority in order that airlines and airline operations would be monitored more properly to increase the public accountability of those airline operators and more properly and more responsibly to safeguard the public interest. When we look at the ministerial statement and keep in mind the three main findings and the three main recommendations of the Holcroft report, what do we find the Government doing? We find it acting in exact accordance with the Holcroft report. I fail to see how the Government can be criticised on those grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the first matter-the elimination of gross cross-subsidisation and the establishment of a new air fare setting formula. In his statement, the Minister announced the new fare increase. It must be recognised that this increase, which is justified-it has been held over for some weeks-has caused the airlines to lose collectively, not only Ansett Airlines of Australia but also Trans-Australia Airlines, $1.2m a week. In delaying that increase for a month the Minister was concerned to make an announcement so that as much as possible of the Holcroft recommendations on the air fare setting formula could be picked up at this time. That is exactly what has been done. As far as is presently practicable, the air fare increase has been announced as being calculated on the Holcroft formula to eliminate cross-subsidisation. I say 'as far as practicable' because, as the report identified, there is much further work that needs to be done to sharpen up the exact apportionment of costs in the determination of future air fares and of future increases. Recognising that, the Government has gone as far as it is able to go at this stage, but it has done the complementary thing it needed to do. It has announced that the entire Holcroft formula will be investigated. The Government has forshadowed the establishment of this investigation, to be concluded before the end of June, which is going to draw on the best accounting advice available and which will be conducted thoroughly so that, when it is time for the next fare increase, it can be made totally in accord with the Holcroft recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government done concerning the other recommendation in the report, that is, the need for an improved regulatory authority to monitor the airlines and increase that aspect of public accountability that is necessary to safeguard the public interest? It has acted in direct accordance with that recommendation as well, by establishing a tribunal. The Minister said that the tribunal will be an independent tribunal established with powers to hear and make decisions on proposals for changes to air fares. That is the regulatory body that this regulated system needs, and that is the foreshadowed decision announced this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> To repeat that point and to belie the Opposition criticism that has been advanced in this Parliament today, the Government has as far as is practicable moved to eliminate the cross-subsidisation in air fares by announcing this increase which is overdue. We do not dispute that it is overdue, but the Government has gone as far as it can on the information available to it. Recognising that more work needs to be done, the Government is establishing an investigation into that work so that the Holcroft formula can be properly calculated once and for all and so that all future increases can be determined on that basis. Recognising the need for more public accountability and a greater monitoring role on the part of the Government, the Minister has foreshadowed the establishment of the tribunal. I fail to understand the Opposition's charge that the Government can be criticised for not acting in accordance with the Holcroft report. Again I congratulate the Government for the decisions that have been made and announced this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some of the fares that have been announced this afternoon. The major reform is that the current flagfall charge has been increased to $40, which brings about fare reductions on the long haul routes and fare increases on the short haul routes, again directly in accordance with the Holcroft report, to try to bring about more equitable relativities between the long haul and the short haul routes of our domestic air transport system. As Mr Holcroft pointed out time and time again, it was the long haul routes that were subsidising the short haul routes and, in terms of any economic argument, that is simply not justified. The Government has done what it can to date to try to bring about an equitable readjustment of the long haul fares compared to the short haul fares. I believe that we will see more of the fare reductions we have seen to date once the entire Holcroft formula is adopted after proper investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the Tasmanian subsidy I make an important comment: The Government is again acting in accordance with the Holcroft report. The Holcroft report discussed subsidies and argued that if, for all sorts of reasons, it is determined that a subsidy on any route is justified and necessary-I am not talking about the making of that decision-that subsidy should be made directly and openly; it should not be brought about because of some cross-subsidisation within the system. I congratulate the Government for picking up that point. The Minister for Transport has announced that TAA is to be put on a more commercial footing than it is on at the moment. Obviously, how that will be done is open to proper investigation so that all the possible options can be discussed and examined closely. I fail to understand how that decision can be criticised. The other government airline, Qantas Airways Ltd, is asking the Government to place it on a more commercial footing so that it is not subject to all the constraints that the bureaucracy, for example the Treasury and the Department of Transport, can exercise over it and so that it can compete openly in the market-place and offer the airline consumers the standard of service and fares that they are demanding. If we are moving to commercialise TAA and place it on a more equal footing with its major competitor, Ansett, that can only benefit TAA and members of the public who use the domestic air transport system. </PARA>
<PARA> The two matters that require further investigation-the establishment of the tribunal and the restructuring of TAA-go a long way towards fixing up a system which Holcroft identified, in colloquial terms, as being crook and rotten, and which has been that way for many years. Once the findings of those investigations are determined it will be open to the Government to introduce the airlines agreement legislation, taking into account the findings on the establishment of the tribunal and the proper commercialisation of TAA. Once that is done, it will be open to the Government to introduce the legislation establishing the two-airline agreement. I hope that the agreement will have a five-year life, as is provided for in the foreshadowed Bill and the present legislation. In that five-year life the way would be open for the Government, having sorted out the present system as Holcroft recommended, to conduct a proper investigation into the deregulation of the airline industry to see whether that is a viable option for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us reflect for a moment on the fact that the investigations into Australia's domestic air transport system to date, the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review Committee report and the Holcroft report-have had as their base the maintenance of the two-airline system. Holcroft himself was criticised for moving away from that base. He argued that if the goal were to maintain the two-airline system important things would need to be done to improve it on behalf of Australian consumers. The Government courageously has picked up those Holcroft recommendations and is moving to improve the present system. However, Holcroft made a further point. In simple terms he said: 'If you do everything I ask you to do, you will still end up with a second best system'. In Holcroft's opinion, whilst he did not have the time or the resources to investigate fully, the best system for Australia would be one that moved progressively towards deregulation. I have argued for that in the past. Now that the Government is moving to improve the present system I believe the way will be open for it, not to announce deregulation overnight-that is not what we are arguing for but to conduct a proper investigation into deregulation and to see whether it is, in fact, a viable option for this country. Such an investigation could take five years because the airlines agreement, under the present or proposed legislation, has to run for five years. If at the end of that time the investigation proves that deregulation is not a viable option for this country there is nothing to stop the Government from relegislating for a continuation of the two-airline system. That five-year period should be valuably used to investigate that option and to see whether it can or should be implemented in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Government is to be congratulated for moving in the way in which Holcroft asked it to move in order to improve the present system. I believe that it has the scope to take the further step of investigating Holcroft's best solution, deregulation, to see whether it is a viable option for this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it very difficult to believe that the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) is the same person who purports to be the leader of the pack of Liberals from Western Australia who are crusading for an end to the two-airline policy and for deregulation of the industry. He has just said that he does not see that as a possibility. He sees the weak, pathetic statement by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), which is more of a sick joke than anything else, as the payment he is prepared to receive for a continuation of the two-airline agreement. He has completely sold out the campaign which he has been conducting in Western Australia over the last few months. He has revealed himself and his colleagues as nothing more than a group of charletons. In the last few years we have had, firstly, an inquiry into domestic aviation policy which was set up by the current Minister's predecessor. It was carried out in secret. There was no opportunity for public scrutiny of it. That review suggested some very important changes. Subsequently, the Holcroft inquiry was established. It was sabotaged from the beginning because while it was investigating the whole question of airfares, including the implications of the two-airline agreement, secret deals were made between this Government and the airlines to ensure the continuation of the two-airline agreement for a further 10 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now the honourable member for Tangney wants a further five years in which to make any further changes to the two-airline agreement. He is looking much more like a rickety lean-to than a shack. After his statements see the light of day in Western Australia he, his colleagues and their argument will collapse like a pack of cards. There is nothing in the argument. They have completely sold out the interests of Western Australia. They will be laughed out of town as soon as the Minister's statement is seen and understood by the people of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> After all the months of grandstanding and all the trauma that we and the Government, the honourable member for Tangney, the honourable member for Perth (Mr McLean) and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) have been through, all that this fiercely independent group can come up with in the interests of Western Australian air travellers is a 4 per cent to 5 per cent reduction in air fares. That is all it has been able to achieve, except for a couple of meaningless, nebulous or, possibly, dangerous changes which will be brought into effect to tinker with the problems which are so deep seated and long standing. The results will be completely meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA> We are offered an independent tribunal. We know nothing of it. We do not know what its powers will be or how it will be set up. We do not even know whether it will act in public. All we know is that it is to be an independent tribunal. I ask honourable members to reflect for a minute on the fortunes of the last independent inquiry that was set up-the poor old Holcroft committee. It comprises three independent and courageous men who were prepared to act independently and give independent advice to the Government. For their trouble they were abused from one end of the country to another. They were accused by the former Minister for Transport of being liars. It will be very difficult for the Government to find anyone who is prepared to act as a so-called independent member of an independent tribunal. The Government will not get any decent people because it does not treat them properly. All it will have, if it has anything at all, will be a few puppets. If it is to be a three-man tribunal, I suggest that the three names which would be most appropriate for the task that the Government has in mind would be Murdoch, Murdoch and Murdoch. They might be the best three people to put on this tribunal to determine the civil aviation policy of this country because that is where the real power lies, that is the real vested interest that has to be protected by this Government. It is for that reason that the Government has not acted in relation to the real problems of this whole industry. </PARA>
<PARA> How is this tribunal to work? What are to be the requirements in relation to the production of information? We know that it took the Minister's department six months to provide information promised in June for the Holcroft inquiry. The information did not come to light until a month before the inquiry was truncated. What will the requirements be to insist that the Ansett organisation provides information? Ansett did not provide any information to the Holcroft inquiry even though it was promised by the Minister. Ansett said: 'We do not have to appear before you; we do not have to talk to you about air fares because the two-airline agreement stands above and beyond the activities of the Holcroft inquiry and we are not going to have you or anyone else meddling in the cosy arrangement which has kept us fat for so many years'. We really want to know what are the powers to secure information and to see that that information is dealt with publicly and in a way in which it can be analysed and scrutinised by the whole of the people of Australia. I suspect that this tribunal will just continue the cosy arrangement which has existed between the bureaucracy and the industry for so many years. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry is one of the most arrogant yet lucrative industries in Australia and it has operated behind the shield of regulation for far too long. There is nothing wrong with regulation in that sense, but, if there is to be regulation, public scrutiny and public accountability are of fundamental importance. That is what we have not had and I do not think we will get it. It would be very easy for the Minister to add the word 'public' as well as the word 'independent' when describing the tribunal to us today. So it is to be a secret tribunal which will just continue the same secretive and cosy arrangements which have operated in this industry for very many years. The Department of Transport has failed to protect effectively the public interest and I suspect that the tribunal will do the same. </PARA>
<PARA> Another sop which has been given to the Liberal members from Western Australia is the suggestion that Trans-Australia Airlines should be made a public company. What will that achieve except to provide a ready mechanism for the sale of TAA in the not too distant future? It is very much simpler gradually to divest the shares of a public company even if it starts off being owned totally by the Government than it is to start dismantling a statutory corporation, as TAA is at the moment. What we now have is the promise that TAA will be sold. If this happens we will have a monopoly of the airline industry. I ask honourable members: What on earth will be the advantage to Western Australians of having one airline instead of two? There would be no competition at all. At least there is some competition at the moment, minimal as it may be. If the Government sells TAA we would end up with a monopoly, particularly, I suspect, on the Perth to eastern states routes. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important matter of which this statement failed to take account is that no attempt was made to justify the current fare levels. All the Government says is: 'We have a current level of fares, and we know there have been certain cost increases; therefore we are going to agree, albeit on a different formula, to an increase having regard to those increased costs'. There is no attempt to justify whether the existing level of fares is proper. Holcroft said he could not do it because he could not get the information from Ansett, he could not get the information from the Department of Transport in time and he could not get the information from the Bureau of Transport Economics. So we still have no justification of the existing level of fares. Yet, on top of that, we are to have this overall increase in fares. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no attempt to justify the vast cost of the meaningless amount of advertising which both airlines indulge in at the moment. What is the point of one company taking out $2,000 advertisements all over the country to publicise the fact that it has better sandwiches than the other company? It is a totally meaningless form of advertising. It does not go to the question of price because there is no competition in respect of price. The two airlines are competing only on the basis of a few frills. What is the cost of the extravagant services that are provided? We know that it cost Ansett $3m a year to provide free booze to first class travellers. There is no attempt to justify that. There is no attempt to see whether that is a fair charge that ought to be passed on to the travelling public. We should not kid ourselves in this respect. Of course that sort of charge is passed on directly to the travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no discussion of what is the importance or the significance of the non-airline activities of both airlines. TAA can be stupid enough to pay $5m for the Hertz Rent a Car franchise; Ansett can lose $15m in relation to Associated Securities Ltd, and what is the impact of those stupid decisions on the cost of air travel? There is no attempt to look at that; no attempt to give any reasons or explanations. Airlines can come along, as they have always done in the past, and say: 'We have had this amount of cost increase; therefore we want this amount of air fare increase'. That is a totally inadequate way of doing things. What we need is a thoroughgoing inquiry to establish what are the existing levels of fares and whether they can be justified in any sense at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, there is no attempt to look at the very serious question of the use of the excess capacity of Qantas Airways Ltd on the trans-continental routes. We know that Qantas is prepared to offer a return fare between Sydney and Perth of between $200 and $250. We cannot be exact about that because some months have passed since Qantas made that offer, but at least we know the order of magnitude by which Qantas could fill those empty seats effectively. Of course, the marginal cost of carrying passengers between Perth and Sydney and return on the large aircraft operated by Qantas must be much smaller than the average cost of carrying passengers on aircraft operated by Ansett and TAA. Qantas has an attractive proposition to offer to us, yet it is prevented from offering seats to the travelling public because, in the first instance, of the existence of the two-airline policy and, in the second instance, of a reluctance by the Government to make a change based on a fear about what Ansett Transport Industries Ltd would think about it. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the cheapest economy fare between Perth and Sydney and return is about $500. Qantas is prepared to offer seats on such routes for about half that amount. That is an important question which has not been addressed in this statement; that is a question which the people of Western Australia have wanted answered for months if not years. I first raised this question publicly in 1978 and we are still waiting for some response from the Government. We know that there have been some increases in fares. There has been an increase in the advance purchase excursion fare. One will not get a 40 per cent discount any more; at the maximum one will get only a 35 per cent discount. This reduction, of course, will affect Western Australians more than it affects anyone else because the fare between Western Australia and the eastern States is much higher than the fare anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a totally inadequate statement. It does not come to grips with any of the real and deep problems which exist in this industry. We know that the statement is a sop which has been handed out to con Western Australian Liberals in return for their support for a continuation of the two-airline agreement. Next year all the Liberals from Western Australia will come trooping in here and vote for a continuation of the two-airline agreement. Not one of them will cross the floor, as they have threatened to do, as they have promised to do, as they have undertaken to do for the Western Australian people, to oppose the continuation of the two-airline agreement. They will vote for a continuation of the two-airline agreement. They will vote for a continuation of the same two-airline agreement that was negotiated in secret-the secret deal that was struck just before the last election by the Government, Ansett and TAA. So we now know how cheaply one can buy a Western Australian Liberal. One can buy a Western Australian Liberal with about five pages of meaningless drivel which offers nothing to the Western Australian people except a four per cent to five per cent reduction in air fares now and the promise of increases in the future once this policy continues on its doomed course. </PARA>

<PARA> I am pleased to take part in this debate. I think I have about ten minutes in which to say a few words. I want to say in particular how pleased I am that Tasmania has been looked after so well. I thank the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) and the Government for the decision which he has announced today. I think it is fair to say that all five members of the House from Tasmania have been very active on this issue. We have pressed our case as best we can. I do not think we have really applied political pressure so much as logic in convincing the Government of the correctness and of the sense of giving the people of Tasmania a fair deal so far as their air fares are concerned. As all honourable members of this House know, certainly the honourable members on this side, Bass Strait is a disadvantage to Tasmania. Many of us think it is also our greatest advantage. It is certainly a disadvantage, and that air link is so vital to the economy of Tasmania and the social well-being of people living in Tasmania. I think there is some sense in the point that because we are so close to the mainland-it is only 100 miles or so across the Strait-we use that airlink perhaps more often than the people from the West use theirs. So many people from my part of Tasmania, on the north-west coast, come across to Melbourne, a city of two million people plus, for medical treatment, for dental treatment and for the basic necessities of life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member says 'for high living'. They go to the football, and so on. We feel that that link is important and therefore it is good to hear that this subsidy is to be provided by the Government. As I said before, I do not generally favour subsidies. As a true liberal I do not generally favour subsidies but there are always exceptions to that general rule. I have looked carefully at this decision of the Government, I believe in a critical way, and I have decided that it is right, because it is in the interests of the people that there should be a subsidy in this case. I made the same decision as far as Mount Lyell was concerned. Again I looked at that situation carefully. I looked at the logic of it and all the human elements involved in that decision and I supported it as I support this one. The Government has really now established a principle in providing this $5m subsidy for 12 months to assist the people of Tasmania. That principle is that there should be this air bridge between Tasmania and the mainland. I trust that this subsidy, restricted as it is in its terms and amount, will continue, and I trust that it will be reviewed from time to time so that it does not lose its true value, and so that the people of Tasmania, just like the people of the West, will receive justice so far as air fares are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to comment briefly on the report of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. I can see value in that report. I believe that in many respects it was a sensible report, but I am not overimpressed by some of the conclusions reached by the three gentlemen concerned. I do not believe that cross-subsidisation is necessarily to be accepted. I believe that it is a puritanical economic approach to the whole question. In any business, in a grocery business, in selling shoes or in a legal practice, there is always cross-subsidisation. For example, in a legal practice, the people involved in conveyancing subsidise those who are involved in litigation, as the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), who is now at the table, and who is a very respected member of the legal profession in Tasmania, would acknowledge. In almost every business there is cross-subsidisation. I was therefore surprised at the theory put forward by Mr Holcroft that there should be a very direct cost determined for each route, and that that air fare should be borne exactly by those travelling that route. I believe that that theory does ignore some of the human factors involved. In making that criticism of the committee, I do commend it for its work. Time restraints were placed upon it and I think that is unfortunate. But given the time restraint, I think the committee did a fairly good job in handing down its report. But that told only part of the story, and I say that to some degree it did ignore real life and the human factors involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Minister will take particular note of the importance of the F27 services around Australia. An important part of Tasmania, the north-west coast, is serviced by F27 aircraft flying from Melbourne. Mr Holcroft said that the flagfall factor being charged on F27 services was about half of what it should be. I certainly hope that these real human factors are again taken into account so that the increases in air fares to all of the routes serviced by F27 aircraft-not just to Tasmania, but to Queensland, New South Wales and other places-are permitted to continue at a reasonable rate so that those areas can be properly serviced and people in them can have the opportunity of travelling to other places if they wish to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been announced by the Minister that there will be a fare fixing tribunal. I am in general agreement with that. But I hope it is not like some of the other tribunals which have been established by this and other governments. I hope that it just does not look at the theory and mathematics of the whole thing. I hope that it looks at the human factor. I think this is where politics are important. We can criticise the word 'politics' but politics are important. This democratic process which we have and which has been used so effectively by honourable members from the west and Tasmania is important. It allows the ordinary person to get his or her view across. I hope that some guidelines will be established by the Government to confine the tribunal, when it is established, in what it might do, and to permit it to take into account the ordinary human factors that are involved in this whole question of air transport all around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have a proposed two-airline agreement which has not yet been ratified by this Parliament. I hope that that agreement, perhaps with some amendments, will be ratified during this session of Parliament. It is important that we do have as much competition as we can have within the system but, overall, certainly along the major trunk routes we have had, as I think most peoply applying common sense would agree, a pretty good airline system in this country. I think we should commend Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines for providing the kind of service that they have provided. I have not travelled as far as some honourable members of this chamber have. I have not been to the United Kingdom, I have not been to Europe and I have not been to the United States or North America. I know that many honourable members have been to those places. When they compare the kinds of air transport services provided in those places, they have indicated to me that we compare very favourably with the service we provide, such as the quality of service and even the cost. I agree with the points that have been made by honourable members from the west, and those representing long haul routes, that as far as possible we should achieve justice for the people travelling on those routes. I am pleased to see that TAA is to become further commercialised and that it will become a public company. A number of options have to be considered in this respect. No doubt the Government will look very carefully at those options. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to commend the Minister for the very fair way in which he has approached this whole issue of air fare increases and a new air fare formula and for the other decisions that he has announced. It is a sensitive issue. I said earlier that a lot of representations have been made by all five members who have contributed to this debate. The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) who is seated at the table is nodding his head in agreement. Many other organisations and councils-this includes the Tasmanian Tourist Council-believe that it is very important for the development of the tourist industry in Tasmania to have air fares set at an appropriate level for people travelling to and from Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> At a meeting earlier today I made the point that the subsidy for Tasmania is not just a subsidy for that State. It is not to be confined to the citizens of Tasmania. I repeat that if that were the case we would need to have passports issued to us. That is not the case. Any Australian citizen travelling to and from Tasmania will be eligible to receive the benefit of this subsidy. It is not a subsidy for Tasmania but a subsidy for every Australian. I welcome it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that this debate will not be permitted to proceed to such an extent that we can hear formal submissions from the bevy of Western Australian Liberal members opposite as to their positions on this matter. In fact, we have heard once from the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), but we have not heard from his colleagues. If what they had to say was as sheepish as they look, it would provide honourable members on this side of the House with no end of entertainment for the rest of the evening. It is not surprising that they should look so sheepish. If they have worked as hard as the various Press leaks which have emanated from them have indicated, as opposed to what has actually been stated by them in this House, then they have laboured mightily to produce a pineapple-a pineapple nevertheless gutted by the vaguest possible statement made today in this House by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt). With 11,000 people in his Department, with an inquiry that has proceeded for six months, with at least a six-week period within which that Minister could review that inquiry, and-as was pointed to earlier by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins)-with another inquiry on much the same matter that proceeded for some time several years ago, all that the Minister has been able to bring forward is a statement replete with terms such as 'initial responses', 'more detailed work required', and 'matters raised will be dealt with at a later date'. What a hopeless piece of work to dump on the Opposition at fairly short notice. I am not surprised that honourable members opposite should feel so very sheepish about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares was determined by a specific local problem for the Liberal Party in Western Australia. In my home State the revolt on the size of air fares that we were paying and the subsidy that we were offering our air travelling colleagues in the eastern States was a very reasonable one. It was a political problem which cut across the normal political problem confronting the Government on air fare matters; that is, of course, keeping Ansett Airlines of Australia well and truly satisfied with the state of affairs in which it finds itself. That need to satisfy was augmented by a change of ownership of Ansett and the emergence of a media leader to head it in the run up to an election. It was a very considerable political problem for the Government. In its normal fashion, this Government acted in an absolutely cynical way. It set up this inquiry and, as it proceeded, away from public view the Minister and his colleagues attempted to subvert it. These facts were brought before this chamber when the Opposition moved to censure the Minister several weeks ago. I do not need to go into them further. I use this occasion only to express my abhorrence at the way in which I, as a member of the Western Australian public, and my 70,000 electors who live around the airport in Perth, have been so terribly misled by the way the Government has behaved in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Tangney, who has been full of praise for what he considers to be a magnificent statement and a grand step in the right direction, has said it is foreshadowed that a wide range of the Holcroft recommendations will be acted upon. He cited three recommendations but there are some 36 recommendations in the Holcroft report. Only three of those recommendations were vaguely touched upon in the statement made by the Minister. One of the things that the honourable member for Tangney loved so much was this independent tribunal. He felt that the statement that has been made in some way meets the Holcroft recommendations on public accountability. What nonsense! The Holcroft committee made quite specific recommendations on the need for public accountability on air fares charged by the airlines. None of that is guaranteed in the Minister's statement. No indication was given on consumer representation on such a tribunal; no indication was given as to its composition; no statement was made concerning public input to such a body; and no indication was given as to whether the type of evasion engaged in by that airline, so beloved of honourable members opposite but so deprecated by the Holcroft inquiry, would be permitted again or whether the independent tribunal could instruct the airlines to produce for it the information it so patently failed to produce for the Holcroft inquiry. This is what the Holcroft inquiry wanted on the question of public accountability. I wish to quote from pages 239 and 240 of the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> There should be public disclosure of balance sheets and profit and loss accounts for those activities subject to special regulation and these accounts should be shown separately from those for the company as a whole. There should be reconciliation statements for such accounts stating the results for regulated activity together with the overall accounts. This should be supported by sufficient information to show the methods used for allocating relevant items between the two sets of accounts. </PARA>
<PARA>I realise that honourable members opposite have not read the report. They should take this opportunity to do so. I will read fairly rapidly through the report for honourable members on this occasion. It states further:</PARA>
<PARA> There should be a comprehensive collection of information, for public dissemination, on the workings of the air transport industry covering passengers and freight carried by all operators, aircraft operations, air navigation charges and the costs to which they are related together with comparative data on efficiencies of financial and technical performance. An indication of the type of operational and financial data which the CAB requires to be filed with it by the domestic airlines is set out in CAB Form 41, 'Report of Financial and Operating Statistics for Certificated Air Carriers'</PARA>
<PARA>This is what the Holcroft committee was talking about when it mentioned a public inquiry. Not one word of it appears in the Minister's statement. There is not one word to the effect that detailed public accountability will be demanded of the airlines in any shape or form. It is pathetic that honourable members opposite should declare that what has emerged in the Minister's statement conforms in any shape or form to these quite specific and very detailed requirements of that body. Only very faltering steps have been taken towards some degree of air fare justice. Given the whole record of the debate on air fare matters, we can confidently expect that those very faltering steps will be the last steps taken in this regard. They have to be taken because the Holcroft inquiry pointed to the systematic ripping off of some $20m per annum from the Western Australian public over a very lengthy period. I suppose that any reduction in Western Australian air fares is some advance. However, when one looks at the dimensions of the cross-subsidisation one can see that this reduction is very paltry indeed. If the calculations of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) which appeared in the newspapers were to have been met by the Government one could have expected a reduction of at least twice that which has been suggested here today. This is in the nature of a sop. If this is all that the vaunted Western Australian back bench revolt can produce those honourable members can be compared collectively with a brace of penny bangers rattling around in a nuclear holocaust. Many other areas have been left unresolved by these statements of direct interest to Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to know what will happen on the F27 aircraft routes. It is true that eastern States F27 routes were being subsidised by jet route travellers to Western Australia. However, F27 routes in Western Australia, most emphatically, have not been subsidised. Does this mean that the internal Western Australian traveller will pay even more highly for his or her travel in Western Australia? Prima facie I would suggest that it does. There are no guarantees that widespread competition will be enforced on that airline that currently covers those routes in Western Australia. No guarantees are contained in the statement, although the Minister did devote a certain amount of attention to the question of internal F27 air fare routes. There was no indication that the injustice in this regard which was pointed to by the Holcroft committee would be taken up. That injustice was that Western Australians subsidised eastern States F27 routes but did not have their own subsidised by any similar process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Holcroft committee, in the final chapter of its report, under the heading 'Matters not examined', as it waved its hand like a drowning man being pushed under by the Government, mentioned a plethora of matters highly important to Western Australians that received no further attention by the Minister in his statement. Yet groups with a serious concern in the matter of air fares, such as that involved in the fair air fares campaign in Western Australia, had a few things to say about this aspect in their submissions including the matter on which the honourable member for Fremantle has fought very long and hard and for several years in advance of members opposite from Western Australia. I refer to the availability of seats on Qantas Airways Ltd. There is no indication that this will be dealt with by any form of inquiry. We will continue to have the situation where we are paying $500 for a trip to Sydney when all we need to pay is $250 if we use Qantas. Due to the premature termination of its inquiry the Holcroft committee was unable to consider seriously the question of the usage of Qantas seats on that route. </PARA>
<PARA> An interested Minister, a Minister attuned to the value and needs of the Australian tourist industry, might have had a few words to say also about the problems that we confront in Western Australia regarding the discrimination that we suffer as an international port of entry. That has a deleterious effect on the tourist industry. It has been spoken about by honourable members on both sides of the House. No indication was given that this matter will receive serious consideration. We were unable to get it from the Holcroft committee. Apparently we will not receive it from any further air fare review.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not surprised that the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) should be reasonably pleased with the subsidy that will apply to Tasmania. I am pleased to welcome him into the ranks of the socialists. We look forward to a regular change in his voting pattern on a variety of other matters. I do not begrudge Tasmanians that gain. It might have been rather nice, however, if a similarly sympathetic attitude had been extended towards us in Western Australia, given the burdens we have been carrying for so long. I can assure the honourable member that no matter what Bakke boats might operate between Melbourne and Tasmania, they take a heck of a lot less time to proceed from Melbourne to Tasmania than it takes to travel by rail from Perth to Melbourne or by road from Perth to Melbourne. They are perhaps relevant modes of transport with which to draw a comparison in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA> As a Western Australian member, I can only feel considerable sorrow at the way in which this whole shoddy discussion that has extended over many months has been conducted and the extent to which very real and sensible grievances raised in this House and in other forums have been treated so disparagingly by this Government. I do hope that we will hear, when the two airlines agreement comes up for consideration and when an independent tribunal is established, a much more effective response from honourable members opposite from Western Australia than we have heard here today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has a number of conflicting principles to observe when dealing with airlines and the services that they offer to Australians. Air fares, for instance, must be based on cost. Passengers travelling by main airline operators anywhere in Australia should pay approximately the same fare for travelling the same distance. Air fares should encourage efficiency also. It is no good passengers paying more than is reasonable to provide a greater profit for an organisation but, at the same time, a high standard of service must be maintained and the national interest preserved, particularly in regard to the use of fuel. The Government must keep in mind that all communities should have, as far as possible, a reasonable standard of service as far as frequency and quality of service are concerned. Some of these elements and objectives are conflicting by their nature. Therefore, any discussion of air fares or matters relating to airlines develops a lot of interest and some controversy. The Government has sought to overcome some of these problems by establishing an expert group of people to advise it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one looks at the areas which the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares had to deal with, one can understand why there is conflict of interest, conflict by communities and between regions in Australia to achieve the objectives that the Government sets out to achieve. However, there is no confusion in the Australian Labor Party. There is nothing in the Labor Party. If one refers to its policy as presented at the Labor Party conference held in Adelaide in 1979, and if one turns to the page on transport-the last page of its policy deals with transport because it receives the lowest priority-one will see an introduction which refers to organisation funding and charges, public participation, research and planning, shipping, highways, roads and facilities and international conventions. Nothing on air transport was contained in that report. I cannot find it. I challenge honourable members opposite to point it out to me. They know nothing about aviation. They do not want to know anything about air transport, as today's debate has demonstrated most clearly to the House. The Labor Party has no policy of any sort in any area relating to airlines. </PARA>
<PARA>The Holcroft report has accentuated the difficulties of establishing a reasonable and easily understood method of charging air fares in Australia. Air fares are set by a basic formula that is changed from time to time as cost pressures force airlines to apply to the Government or other instrumentalities, as proposed by Holcroft, for an increase in their fares. Some of the matters that Holcroft has considered include how the time of flight crews is charged, including whether it is charged to the travelling component, the distance component or the ground charges, the flagfall charges, the cost of flight attendants who spend some of their time on the ground and some time flying, the training of airmen and the aircraft catering services. How should one calculate what portion should go to flagfall or distance? Also included are matters relating to aircraft overhaul and maintenance, fuel excise, aircraft depreciation, the cost of fuel excluding excise, ground services and handling. All these matters were dealt with by Holcroft. The Holcroft committee said in essence that, on the one hand, this policy could be adopted and, on the other hand, that policy could be adopted. One could put a greater proportion into the flagfall, the ground services, the distance factors. That is the way Holcroft dealt with it. If one does one set of sums one will find that the best that Holcroft recommended for Western Australia was a $3 reduction. One can do another calculation and move it across to the other side of the formula where a $200 reduction would apply. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that these matters need to be carefully investigated by expert accountants. That is what the Government is proposing to do. It has offered concessions to Western Australia which comprise a 5.4 per cent reduction. In other areas of Australia, such as the area which will affect my family and me when we travel at our own expense-that is, from Canberra to Sydney-there has been an increase of almost 40 per cent. We are looking at a massive change in fare structure of over 40 per cent between different routes in Australia. This is highly significant. The Government needs to be complimented for being so courageous in adopting Holcroft's report to the extent that it has. I think that the statement made today by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) does deal with air fares and indicates the Government's intention for the future. It moves to straighten out the formula. It offers prospects for F27 aircraft routes and it also gives an opportunity to meet the criticism that the Senate has directed to us to deal with the problems faced by Trans-Australia Airlines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was bringing to the attention of the House some of the difficult problems that the Holcroft committee of inquiry faced in coming to grips with establishing a sound base for air fares in Australia, the difficulty it faced in establishing a formula which was sound, which could be tested publicly over a period and which would withstand all scrutiny. The Government has moved soundly as far as it can in the area of supporting the decisions of the Holcroft committee of inquiry into air fares. The Government's decision will, in fact, result in a decrease in air fares to Western Australia of about 5 per cent but will result in increases in air fares on some routes, particularly the Sydney-Canberra route, of 38.8 per cent. Part of the reason for the increase in fares on the Sydney to Canberra route is the problem of the time delays that are starting to appear in the Sydney region for air traffic. Whilst it is not the subject for debate this evening, I believe that this matter must be attended to by both the New South Wales Government and the Federal Government. As the House knows, it is very much a matter for the New South Wales Government to determine what it wishes to do to meet the travelling needs of the people of that State. The future looks bleak if the present situation of no decision goes on for any length of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, in looking at the Holcroft inquiry's report and making decisions for travellers in Australia, recognised that the verification of various matters associated with determining an air fare pricing policy derived by way of a formula will be an exacting task for a regulatory authority. The Government has decided that it will establish a regulatory authority-if possible an independent body-to advise the Government or to make decisions on fares. Part of the Government's decision is to look at the difficulties faced by regional operators-the operators of Fokker Friendship aircraft in country areas. Their position is a tenuous one to some extent. The large proportion of Fokker aircraft are owned by either Trans-Australia Airlines or Ansett Airlines of Australia; the others are owned by operators who are dependent on those aircraft to make profits and to supply services. The Holcroft committee identified considerable cross-subsidisation from the pure jet services that travel the main trunk routes to the Fokker services. This means, in fact, that there are lower air fares than can be justified on a pure cost base where Fokker Friendship aircraft are used. This has created a difficulty for organisations which fly only Fokker aircraft. The Government has considered that the cross-subsidisation in that area should be removed. Steps are being taken to remove that cross-subsidisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that over a period committees of this Parliament have identified serious problems with the operation of TAA. As a commission it is undercapitalised and has great difficulty in maintaining what would be considered commercial practice and commercial bookkeeping practice. That has affected the operation of TAA. It has made it sensitive to changes in aircraft types. It has made it sensitive to changes in service. It would therefore seem that if the Government were to commercialise TAA it would lift the quality of the organisation and create perhaps a greater sense of purpose. Australia is served by airlines which are among the best in the world. As such it is important for us to conduct a somewhat theoretical debate about making them even better. The principles espoused in the Holcroft inquiry's report will make our airlines even better. However, we must be careful in all of these decisions to ensure that we retain for the Australian people the high quality of service that we now have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to hear some of the supporters of the Government speculating about the detail and information which is quite clearly lacking from the statement which was made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt). Many of the claims that honourable members opposite made in their interpretation of what the Minister said and their interpretation of what they believed he possibly meant certainly cannot be substantiated or supported by the words the Minister actually used. One of the things I am most concerned about is that the statement by the Minister was quite obviously a ploy to lay the ground for some quite sinister developments. I will develop that argument shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The essential thing that the statement purports to do is to indicate the new fare structure on the routes listed. If, in fact, that was the chief purpose of the Minister's statement, why did the Minister raise the question of the restructuring of Trans-Australia Airlines? The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided also in principle to establish TAA as a public company. The Government has under consideration the nature and structure of such a company. Such an arrangement should enable TAA to compete more effectively in a more commercial environment. </PARA>
<PARA>I have been advised that a little over two hours ago the Minister was interviewed on the subject and that when he was asked to give an assurance that the Government would remain the sole shareholder in such a restructured TAA or, in fact, that the Government would remain the main shareholder in such a restructured TAA, the Minister refused to do so. The Minister failed to do so. I am not able to identify any denial on the Minister's part at this stage. I think this Parliament and the people of Australia are entitled to know exactly what are this Government's intentions. It is absolute nonsense for the Minister to come in with a statement which is simply, according to him, designed to give information about a restructured fare system for domestic airlines in Australia and at the same time conveniently slip into that statement a series of words which in themselves mean nothing but which clearly have quite sinister implications. I think we are entitled to know exactly why those words went into that statement and exactly what are the intentions of the Government and this Minister in connection with the future of TAA. </PARA>
<PARA> It has already been pointed out by honourable members on this side of the House that the restructuring of TAA as a public company will better facilitate the opportunity for this Government to start selling off parcels of it. I hope an answer will be given because all hell will break loose in this country on the part of those people who are concerned about the way in which this Government and previous conservative governments in Australia have been hell-bent on selling out the assets of the Australian people in order to make it easier for all the silvertails out in the community, all of the Government's commercial mates, all the powerful and privileged people that the Government represents in this Parliament, to participate in the lucrative areas of public ownership and to hand those areas over to them. I hope we get clarification of that matter from the Minister because it is a matter of very great, very real, very deep and continuing concern. Already notice has been given of this Government's intention in connection with Trans-Australia Airlines. In fact, councils of the Liberal Party of Australia already have adopted as their policy the proposition that assets of that kind should be sold. We want to know exactly where the Government and the Minister stand in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement presented to the Parliament by the Minister is a disgraceful document. I appreciate its pork-barrel content. I agree with parts of that pork barrelling. Earlier speakers from the Government side of the chamber referred to the need for some of the humane issues which may be involved in matters of this kind to be considered. I think it is appropriate that that should be done. But I do not think it is appropriate for attempts to be made to justify pork barrelling in the way we saw it justified tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some aspects of the statement, apart from the very sinister implication to which I have made reference already, with which the Opposition agrees. It agrees, for example, with the reference to a cost based nationally consistent approach being adopted by the use of an air fare formula comprising a flagfall and distance rate for the national jet network. We have no objection to that. Also, we have no objection to the Holcroft inquiry view on the approach to be taken towards discount fares. We appreciate the importance of that. It is important in connection with the selling of tours by tour wholesalers. It is important also to be developing tourist trade in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> We take no exception either to the reduction in the formula for domestic air fares for Tasmania. But I emphasise the fact that that was one of the policy commitments, one of the election promises, of the Australian Labor Party. We are delighted that the Minister and the Government have chosen to accept that. When the Opposition prior to the previous general election, undertook to introduce such a policy it was opposed by the Government. Now, of course, the Government has completely reversed its position and has adopted the proposition. We support that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement raised a significant number of issues which were insufficiently explained or were left unexplained. Reference to some of those issues has been made already by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) and by other speakers from this side of the chamber. The first I mention is that related to establishing an independent tribunal. These are the actual words used by the Minister in his statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned that special innovative discounts which are negotiated by the airlines on the basis of their commercial viability must stand the test of public scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>We endorse that, but it is not clear in the statement just how far the Minister proposes to go with that public scrutiny. He went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government decided that an independent tribunal should be established with powers to hear and make decisions upon proposals for changes to air fares. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's statement gives no indication of whether the hearings are to be open, public hearings and whether the independent tribunal is to have consumer representation. Those are matters of concern to Holcroft and are mentioned in the report. The Minister's statement gives no indication of whether the airlines will be required to submit claims for fare increases and to justify those claims. I mention also the need recognised by the Minister for further consideration to be given to pricing of the F27 services operated by Anset Airlines of Australia and TAA. We accept that in the future a more detailed consideration should be given to that and a more clear analysis should be made. But the Minister's speech gave no indication of how long that was likely to take. We are entitled to expect a clear indication of the direction the Government intends to take in relation to that. We should be given an indication of the means by which consideration will be given to it, who will give consideration to it and what type of evidence will be expected in the consideration which is undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed new air fare rates for services along the east coast of Australia cause me considerable concern. An increase of 38.8 per cent is envisaged for the domestic air fare for the Sydney-Canberra route and an increase of 13.7 per cent is envisaged for the Sydney-Melbourne route. I accept that previously a significant amount of evidence has been presented in support of the proposition that there has been cross-subsidisation on a lot of the domestic air routes. But a sudden jump of 38.8 per cent in the cost of a flight between Sydney and Canberra-of course, that would be duplicated along the east coast-and a jump of 13.7 per cent in the cost of a flight between Sydney and Melbourne are enormous increases for the market to bear all at once. The effect that is likely to have on the increasing number of air passengers and on the tourist industry along the east coast should be quite apparent. Recommendation 19 of the Holcroft report reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Profit before interest and tax, excluding extraordinary items, as a proportion of revenue not exceed 6 per cent, given a continuation of the present levels of interest and income taxation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>What in fact the Holcroft inquiry is suggesting there is that when we have private operators of the kind we have in the air passenger system in Australia-privately owned and privately operated but publicly protected-a maximum limit on the profit those private operators can make should be established. It is absurd that we should have public protection of private interests without establishing a ceiling on their profits. The statement made by the Minister made no references to that. Private operators are protected by this Government but no suggestion was made in the statement of any possible limitation being placed on those profits. </PARA>
<PARA> For the benefit of honourable members from Western Australia, I just say that they have been done like a dinner. The Western Australian putsch in this Parliament has been outsmarted and outdone by the Tasmanian putsch. Those people from Western Australia have been prepared to sell themselves for a minute amount as far as those air fares are concerned. On the Melbourne-Perth route it is a reduction of $9 in $230, about four per cent. Yet all the Opposition, all the strength and all the principle we saw expressed and acted upon by honourable members from Western Australia earlier this year has suddenly disappeared-for the sake of $9. Of course, what the Government is doing is placating the Western Australians, and it has done it very effectively. It is placating them not only in connection with this issue to keep them quiet but also in order to have them accept, first of all, the thousands of empty seats which exist on the Qantas Airways Ltd flights between the east coast and Perth and, then, the implications of a renegotiated and restored two-airline policy. That agreement is not very far off now because all the opposition from where it matters at the present time-that is, from the Government side-has suddenly disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the statement is disgraceful. It represents a disgraceful effort to provide information to this Parliament and to the public. There has been no detailed explanation of the reasons for the changes which have been proposed. There is a lack of clarity in what is proposed. There is no supporting evidence for the changes that have been suggested. There are serious omissions in regard to many important areas. No analysis is presented of the question of the thousands of empty Qantas seats which are available, as the honourable member for Shortland has said, at half price. There has been no attempt to tell us anything about the cost structure of the airlines or to provide a satisfactory mechanism for an investigation of those costs. The real purpose of the statement which the Minister has issued today is, firstly, to placate Western Australian members and to destroy any effective opposition that they might have shown in protecting their constituents and, secondly, to embark on stage one of the sell out of TAA. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I present Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1980-81 which, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1980-81, which I shall introduce shortly, comprises the Additional Estimates for 1980-81. In these Bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made under Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) 1980-81. The Additional Appropriations total $520.9m. Of this, $432.6m is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and $88.3m in Appropriation Bill (No. 4). </PARA>
<PARA> The Additional Appropriations sought in the Bills are offset to some extent by savings in appropriations made by Appropriations Acts (Nos 1 and 2), resulting partly from the Government's determined efforts to achieve savings in expenditure wherever possible. These savings, amounting to $147.6m, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document, 'Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations', which has been distributed to honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the Additional Appropriations now sought, current expectations are that total outlays in 1980-81, including those financed from special appropriations, will be within one per cent of the Budget estimates. This reflects the Government's continued adherence to its policy of maintaining maximum expenditure restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> I now outline some of the main areas where the Government has found it necessary to seek Additional Appropriations in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1980-81. Included in the amount that Parliament is now being asked to appropriate is $191.1m to meet increases in award rates and other wage and salary costs since the Budget, consisting of $100.7m Civil, and $90.4m Defence. Although the overall Budget figuring contained an allowance of $235m for prospective wage and salary rate increases in the Public Service, including Defence, that amount was not then appropriated. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the 'Administrative Expenses' vote, an amount of $3.6m is included for the Attorney-General's Department for payments to private legal practitioners by the Australian Legal Aid Office. This is partly offset by a reduction in the counterpart payments through State Legal Aid Commissions due to delays in the establishment of the Victorian Commission. The amount also provides for an overall escalation in payments to private legal practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Department of Defence an amount of $7.4m is sought to cover the increased cost of fares and vehicle hire, together with a general increase in program activities above that provided for in the Budget. An additional amount of $4.5m included for the Department of Housing and Construction results from a higher than anticipated rate of expenditure on the engagement of private architects, engineers and consultants. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the 'Other Services' heading, $5.8m is proposed for the Department of Communications, mainly for locally produced television programs, originally expected to be covered by revenues from advertising through the multicultural television channels. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $26.2m is required under the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs for employment training and assistance. The increased provision comprises $17.7m for new initiatives and increased activity under the National Employment and Training System and $8.5m under the scheme to encourage full-time training of apprentices. A sum of $9m is required under the Department of Industry and Commerce to meet increased costs of maintaining reserve capacity in government factories. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional significant 'Other Services' provisions include: $16.5m for the Department of Defence to cover the increased cost of stores and greater requirements than expected as a result of increased activities; $10.5m for the Department of Defence to meet the increased cost of repair and overhaul of aircraft, ships and other equipment; $5.4m for the Department of Education, mainly to cover unavoidable increases in running costs for the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority; $8.3m for the Department of Foreign Affairs, principally to cover the increased cost of wheat relating to Australia's commitment under the Food Aid Convention; and $5m under the Department of Science and Technology, mainly to meet increased running costs of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA>I present Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1980-81 in which appropriations totalling $88.3m, additional to those made by Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1980-81, are sought for capital works and services, payments to or for the States and other services. The proposed appropriations are needed to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not made in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> I now mention some of the major items in respect of which Additional Appropriations are sought in the Bill. An amount of $3m is required under the Department of the Capital Territory for the purchase of improvements on two leases surrendered to it during 1980-81-I refer to the Deakin Health Spa and YMCA Hostel at Bruce, ACT. An amount of $4.0m is sought under the Department of the Capital Territory to cover labour and material costs increases on works being undertaken by the National Capital Development Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Department of Finance $53.8m is required for natural disaster relief and restoration mainly as a result of deteriorating drought conditions in New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania.There is a requirement under the Department of Social Security of $2.5m mainly to cover increased costs and revised funding arrangements for certain services under the Children's Services Program. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $2.4m is required for the Department of the Treasury, principally resulting from the transfer of certain Aboriginal programs to the Northern Territory. A further $3.2m is sought for that Department in relation to increased debt charges assistance to the Northern Territory. This will be fully offset by an increase in debt charges payments by the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Other additional appropriations of significance include: $1m for the Department of Home Affairs and Environment for a new program of construction of international standard sports facilities with the States, on a dollar for dollar matching basis; $1.5m under the Department of Housing and Construction, for payment to Queensland to assist in re-housing of Cribb Island residents affected by extension of the Brisbane Airport; and $1m for the Department of Industry and Commerce for machinery and plant required to accelerate modernisation of the Government factories.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1981 is not particularly controversial and is not opposed by the Opposition. Its purpose is to give legislative effect to new double taxation agreements negotiated between Australia and Malaysia and Australia and Sweden. This Bill presents us with a timely opportunity to examine the international aspects of Australia's taxation system. Some of these have received quite a deal of publicity in recent times and it is patently obvious that certain sections of our tax laws which relate to international transactions are in desperate need of reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, I will deal briefly with the immediate subject of this Bill, that is, Australia's double tax agreements. Australia currently has such agreements in place with 12 countries-the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Switzerland and the Philippines. In addition, limited agreements are in force with Italy and Greece relating only to air transport profits. Such tax treaties have become an essential feature of the international income tax system and are directed towards eliminating international double taxing, preventing tax evasion and simplifying the obligations of taxpayers. Double taxation can arise when persons or companies earn income in a country of which they are not a resident. Without international tax agreements there is the possibility that such persons could be taxed on the same income in both countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Two chief methods of relieving such double taxation are used. Firstly, taxing rights over certain classes of income are reserved entirely to the country of residence of the person deriving the income. Generally, these include commercial profits if the recipient has no permanent establishment in the country of origin, and also air transport and shipping profits, pensions, civil service remuneration, remuneration for personal services if the visit does not exceed 183 days, teaching remuneration and cultural royalties. Some of these categories may vary between individual treaties. The second method used to relieve double taxation is that all other income may be taxed by the country of origin but the taxing powers for some classes of income are limited. In regard to dividends, tax is generally limited to 15 per cent to ensure that the effective tax on the dividend income-that is, the tax on company profits plus the tax on the dividends imposed by the country of origin-is less than the tax on the dividend charged by the country of residence, otherwise there would be a disincentive for continued investment in the country from which the dividend is derived. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to interest, tax is often limited to 10 per cent so that residents of the borrowing country are not at a disadvantage when seeking loans for business purposes. As to royalties, tax is again limited so that manufacturing rights and know-how can be obtained for development purposes at a reasonable cost. Most aspects of our tax treaties substantially reflect the principles of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development model double taxation convention and, in doing so, have facilitated the development of Australia's financial and trading dealings with overseas countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The two treaties before us in this Bill, those with Malaysia and Sweden, conform basically to established practice and the only item of any real note is the inclusion of a tax sparing type of arrangement to back up developmental tax incentives given by the Malaysian tax authorities. However, the benefits from such tax agreements are not without their costs. The chief disadvantage of such treaty obligations lies in the likely initial cost to tax revenue. The Taxation Office has acknowledged that Australia loses a small amount of revenue from the limit on withholding tax on dividends to 15 per cent under the treaties compared to a normal rate of 30 per cent where no treaty applies. Our interest withholding tax is normally 10 per cent, so there is little change in that area. Royalties, however, are usually subject to normal assessment, so we would stand to lose revenue when the tax is limited. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, however, the situation is not straightforward and a number of factors operate to ameliorate the likely loss to revenue. For example, where a tax treaty applies, royalties and interest payable to Australian residents are no longer exempt from tax under section 23 (q) of the Income Tax Act, about which I shall say more later, but are taxed in full subject to a credit for foreign taxes paid. This would act to increase Australian tax revenue above what it would otherwise be. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the revenue effect would be dependent upon the balance of investment flows between the countries involved. Certainly in the case of Malaysia, where the level of Australian investment would be higher than Malaysian investment in Australia, our tax revenue would be boosted by the limitation of Malaysian tax on payments to Australian residents. The reverse would probably be the case under our treaty with Sweden. However, on balance, apparently Australia does lose a small amount of revenue under its treaty commitments. This loss, however, can be said to be made up by the gains accruing from facilitating the international movement of capital, individual goods and services, and by the assistance such agreements provide in overcoming tax avoidance by transnational companies. Indeed, an element of our treaties which is assuming ever-increasing importance is the section authorising the co-operation and exchange of information between taxing authorities in each country to deal with international tax avoidance and evasion, especially through transfer pricing practices of transnational corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> Such large corporations have achieved a dominant position on the world economic scene and their intra-corporate transactions represent a very considerable proportion of world trade. The Brandt Commission on International Development Issues estimated in its report last year that between one-quarter and one-third of all world production is controlled by transnational corporations and that intra-firm international trade-that is, international trade between transnational parent companies and their subsidiaries-makes up over 30 per cent of all world trade. In such a situation, it has become an increasingly common phenomenon for related companies operating in a group with centralised management, yet with individual members operating under different national tax laws, to manipulate the prices of intra-corporate transactions in goods and services, so that profits are maximised in countries where tax rates are lower and minimised where tax rates are higher. </PARA>
<PARA> Within transnational enterprises, many transactions may take place between members of the group-for example, sales of goods, provision of services, the licensing of patents and know-how and the granting of loans. The transnational corporation has the ability to manipulate these transactions to its best advantage and, consequently, the prices charged for such transfers may differ considerably from the prices which would have been agreed upon between unrelated parties engaged in similar transactions. Such manipulation can have a drastic effect on taxable income of group members and thus pose a considerable threat to national tax revenues. Consequently, taxing authorities in most countries have attempted to deal with the transfer pricing problem in various ways to give themselves power to reconstruct transactions between affiliated resident and foreign companies in order to determine a realistic level of taxable profit. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, the major weapon of the Taxation Office has been section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act which was initially derived from the 1915 Finance (No. 2) Act of the United Kingdom. Broadly this section provides that, in the case of overseas controlled companies operating in Australia, the Commissioner of Taxation may determine a level of taxable profits which could be expected to arise if transactions between the Australian company and associated foreign companies had been conducted at arm's length. On the face of it, this section seems clearly to define the Commissioner's powers in respect of tax avoidance by foreign-controlled companies. Yet, like so many other sections of the tax Act it has been rendered virtually meaningless by various court decisions, culminating in the now infamous decision by the High Court in the Commonwealth Aluminium case last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Before proceeding to examine this decision, I must point out that the deficiencies in section 136 have not been revealed just in the past few months. Indeed, it has been known from as far back as 1942 that certain problems existed in relation to this section. In 1975 the Asprey Committee pointed out in its report precisely the defects which the High Court seized on in its recent decision. The Asprey Committee regarded the section as inadequate and detailed a number of ways in which a foreign-controlled company could avoid its operation. The Committee recommended that the section be replaced with a new section based on reconstruction provisions in relevant double taxation agreements, such as those now before the House. Yet, as with so many other worthwhile recommendations by the Committee, the Government has ignored its findings on transfer pricing and taken no action whatsoever over the past five years to meet the expected consequences of court decisions. The Opposition has repeatedly called for substantial revisions to section 136 over the last two years but, again, these warnings have fallen on deaf ears. </PARA>
<PARA> Even after the High Court confirmed our worst fears, the Treasurer has still not announced any plans to redraft the section. He seems to be placing his hopes-rather vainly in our view, given the attitudes of the courts-on the new anti-avoidance section of the Act to overcome the deficiencies in section 136. The most recent case involved the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation, a resident company which was in the business of mining and selling bauxite. Commonwealth Aluminium was wholly owned by another resident company, Comalco, which in turn was 45 per cent owned by Kaiser Aluminium of the United States and 45 per cent owned by Conzinc Riotinto of Australia. CRA, in turn, was almost wholly owned by RTZ, a British company. By any normal standards, therefore, Commonwealth Aluminimum was a foreign-owned and controlled company. Commonwealth Aluminium contracted to sell bauxite to certain Japanese buyers. The sale was, however, carried out through an interposed company in Hong Kong which was jointly owned by Commonwealth Aluminium and the Japanese buyers. This Hong Kong company's only function was to buy bauxite from Australia at, for example, 33 shillings a ton and then re-sell it to Japan at 40 shillings a ton. </PARA>
<PARA> No physical transactions took place in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong company only recorded book entries while the bauxite was delivered directly from Australia to Japan. In this way profits which would normally accrue to Commonwealth Aluminium in Australia and be taxed accordingly accrued instead in Hong Kong, where they were taxed at low rates, and the proceeds were split between the partners in the Hong Kong company. Commonwealth Aluminium claimed that its assessable income for the years 1967 to 1971 was approximately $6.7m. The Commissioner of Taxation, however, argued that the company was controlled by its overseas parents, RTZ and Kaiser, and that its business was conducted according to the wishes of these companies. The High Court, amazingly, found that despite its almost total foreign ownership, the company was not foreign controlled. Instead, it held that the taxpaying company itself, not its shareholders, controlled the company's business and thus it was not foreign controlled. The High Court also held that, because a majority of directors at the time relevant decisions were made comprised Australian residents, the company was not controlled by non-residents. </PARA>
<PARA> These decisions defy reality. It is surely absolutely absurd to argue that because of the imposition of a resident holding company controlled by Australian directors-directors who clearly act in the best interests of the foreign owners-section 136 is held not to apply and the company can escape paying its fair level of tax. In this case almost $3.5m tax revenue was involved and lost. Only one High Court judge, Mr Justice Murphy, attempted to look at the reality of the situation. He took a broad definition of control by non-residents, finding clearly that 'the taxpayer's business is part of a transnational corporation, and is controlled by transnational corporations which are non-residents of Australia'. Unfortunately, this line of reasoning was lost on his colleagues. Hot on the heels of the Commonwealth Aluminium case are new revelations of transfer pricing practices by another transnational corporation-this time by Swiss Aluminium Australia Ltd, a major partner in the Gove venture in the Northern Territory. According to reports, over a period of eight years the company recorded a total trading surplus of over $122m but paid only negligible income tax. Its minority partner in the venture, Gove Alumina, paid $5.72m in tax in 1979-80 alone on its pre-tax earnings of $11.1m. </PARA>
<PARA> These results seem extraordinary and even more so in the light of allegations by the Government of Iceland that Swiss Aluminium's parent company understated the profits from its Icelandic smelter by $US47.5m over seven years due to transfer pricing transactions involving purchases of bauxite from Australia. These transactions involved increases in the prices of bauxite at sea by over 50 per cent. Apparently Swiss Aluminium's tax record is under investigation by the Australian Taxation Office but, given the past record of the courts, there is little likelihood of successful action against the company to recover any tax avoided by transfer pricing. These examples more than ever stress the absolute necessity for effective powers to be granted to the Commissioner to prevent such abuses of transnational power. As things now stand, there is ample scope for such corporations to structure their affairs in such a way that the Commissioner of Taxation has no recourse at all to reconstruct the profits derived in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of potential solutions exist. Section 136 could be redrafted, firstly, to ensure that a company will not be excluded solely because it has a majority of Australian directors where effective control in fact rests with foreigners; secondly, to broaden the definition of a foreign controlled company to explicity include the interposing of resident holding companies, and thirdly, to give the Commissioner of Taxation explicit guidelines, such as the use of the 'arm's length' principle, to determine the actual level of taxable income. Additionally, a guide could be taken from Article 9 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Model Double Tax Agreement 1977, which is designed to overcome these problems. Australia uses such an article in this or similar form in all of its double tax agreements, including those before the House. Because of the provisions of the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act, this would prevail over the ordinary provisions of the Act. However, the use of this section would be limited to treaty countries, since it does not preclude the need for swift action to introduce a more effective alternative to section 136. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the use of such an article in double tax agreements is not satisfactory alone because it does not of itself stop transfer pricing since companies need only trade through a non-treaty country in order to avoid tax by this device. We saw this perfectly illustrated by the Commonwealth Aluminium case. The two countries involved, Australia and Japan, are parties to a double taxation agreement, including Article 9 relating to transfer pricing, but the companies involved were able to indulge in transfer pricing by interposing another company in a non-treaty country-in this case Hong Kong-so that the provisions of the double tax agreements were avoided. It is quite clear from that example that we cannot rely simply on bilateral double tax agreements to overcome the problem of transfer pricing. We must back that up by provisions in our national legislation which are effective against the operations of transfer pricing. In other words we must introduce a much more effective section 136. However, that is not to say that the double taxation agreements, including Article 9 relating to transfer pricing, are of no use at all, even in the case where resort might be had to abuse of third countries to try to avoid the provisions of that Article. The inclusion of such an article in the agreement also enables co-operation by the treaty's governments in ascertaining information relevant to the transaction. Without that information and co-operation by governments it may be difficult or impossible for the tax authorities to enforce the legislation. So they have a very substantial relevance indeed in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> To this point I have dealt primarily with problems involving the taxation of income originating in Australia which accrues to non-residents. I now propose to examine briefly the second side of the income tax laws relating to international transactions, and that is the taxing of foreign source income which accrues to Australian residents. As I have shown, our tax laws relating to the taxation of non-residents are faulty and rife for abuse, so it is also possible to show that the sections of the tax Act dealing with foreign income of residents are just as faulty and just as open to abuse by smart operators wanting to avoid their fair share of the tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA> This comes about because two specific provisions of the Act-section 23(q) and 46-between them operate to exclude a very large part of foreign income of Australian residents from any tax at all. Under section 23(q) residents are exempt from Australian tax on foreign source income provided that the income is not exempt from tax in the country in which it is derived. This is so even if the income is taxed overseas at minimal rates or if no tax is actually paid due to local concessions. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three exceptions to the operation of section 23 (q), all giving a credit for foreign tax paid. Firstly, foreign dividends are taxed in Australia. Section 46, however, allows companies a rebate of tax for any dividends received and thereby exempts local companies from tax on foreign dividends even if both the dividends and the profits out of which they are paid are not taxed in the source country. In effect, only individuals pay further tax on foreign dividends. Income from Papua New Guinea is taxed in Australia. Interest and royalties are taxed when they are received from a country where tax is limited by an international tax treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of major defects with these provisions. The first is the equity consideration. Because of these provisions, two individuals or companies with the same total income can pay markedly different amounts of tax because one gets income from overseas where it is taxed only at low rates and the other gets income from within Australia where it is taxed at full local rates. Secondly, these provisions act as an incentive for the diversion of economic activity away from Australia to countries with lower levels of taxation. At a time when unemployment exists in Australia at record levels it is scandalous that our tax system encourages the export of jobs, which would otherwise go to Australian workers, to low tax areas overseas. Already, enough incentives are offered by these countries in the form of low wages, strike prohibitions, provision of infrastructure, tax holidays et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> By far the greatest problem associated with sections 23 (q) and 46, is the encouragement which they give to tax avoidance schemes using companies set up in tax haven countries. Such countries provide favourable tax treatment by levying either no tax at all or very low rates of tax. Some notable tax havens are Bermuda, the Bahamas, the British Channel Islands, Hong Kong, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Nauru, the New Hebrides or Vanuatu, Panama and Switzerland. To make use of a tax haven it is necessary to set up some sort of business operation in the haven country and to divert income, which would otherwise have been taxable in Australia, through that operation. Once the income has been taxed in the haven at a low rate it can be brought back into Australia under the present law free of further tax. For example, a simple means of doing this would be for an importing business to set up a purchasing company in Hong Kong which sells goods to its Australian parent at a higher price. In this way the most profit is made in Hong Kong rather than in Australia. In Hong Kong the tax rate on companies is 15 per cent to 17 per cent whereas in Australia it is 46 per cent. Therefore, it pays to make profits in Hong Kong rather than in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of such devices to divert profits is rife. In the past I have referred to an article in the Australian Financial Review in July 1978 which reported that about one-quarter of a sample of 120 of Australia's top companies have subsidiaries operating in tax haven countries. For example, Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd made a $1.2m profit in Hong Kong in the year in question. Pioneer Concrete Pty Ltd made a profit of $3.2m and Thiess Holdings Ltd made a profit of $1.4m in the same country. There were many others. These are just a small sample of the amounts involved. I find it most disturbing that many of our top public companies are involved in this type of tax avoidance. Many large private companies are also reported to channel most of their big profits through tax havens although these are more difficult to confirm as private companies are less open to disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that report was published in the Australian Financial Review two and a half years ago our information has confirmed that the use of tax havens has increased markedly and that revenue losses are considerable. One source for believing that this is the case is the secretary of the Australian Taxpayers Association, Mr Eric Risstrom, who said publicly some time ago that tax losses through the use of tax havens and transfer pricing amount to some $2,000m per annum for Victoria alone. I checked that figure with Mr Risstrom recently. He assures me that he was correctly reported. He believes that figure to be based on excellent advice. If the figure is correct he says that since there is a predominance of company headquarters in Melbourne we could expect the figure for the whole of Australia to be $3 billion to $3.5 billion each year in tax losses through such devices as transfer pricing and the use of tax havens. Even if the figure were only half that amount it would still be an extraordinary tax loss to occur each year as a result of the allowing of such tax avoidance by the Government's not amending the tax laws to prevent it. There are provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act which attempt to stop these abuses but their effectivenesses is clearly dubious. These sections are section 136, to which I have already referred and sections 38 to 43. These sections give the Commissioner of Taxation power to reconstruct dealings between a local company and a foreign company which are designed to depress Australian profits. Section 31 deals with the purchase of trading stock not at arm's length. Much more serious problems for tax avoiders arise from exchange controls. The Reserve Bank of Australia cannot grant authority to certain transactions with listed tax haven countries without the production of a tax clearance certificate from the Commissioner of Taxation. The Commissioner will not grant a certificate unless he is satisfied that no tax avoidance implications are involved. These provisions, however, seem to have been generally ineffective given the continued use of tax havens. The Master Tax Guide, published by the printing firm, CCH Australia Limited, considers that some of the provisions of the exchange control regulations can be exploited if it is necessary to do so to set up and maintain a tax haven structure. The same publication points out the defects in section 136 which I have already mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Asprey Committee realised that new measures were clearly necessary to stop tax avoidance through tax haven operations. It recommended the introduction of a system of foreign tax credits so that all foreign source income of Australian residents would be subject to Australian tax with the provision of a credit for any foreign tax paid on that income. In this way, no advantages would accrue from setting up operations in tax haven countries and all taxpayers would be treated equally regardless of their source of income. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) acknowledged these facts and the tax avoidance problem when, on 8 June 1978, he announced the Government's intention to introduce a system of taxing Australian residents on their foreign source income along the lines recommended by Asprey. He described the existing mixture of exemptions and credits as a hotch potch. He said that the Government:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . considers that such outdated and inconsistent rules cannot be retained. The fact that major elements of the foreign source incomes of Australians are not taxable in Australia seriously prejudices the equity of the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>These were fine sentiments but, like so many other of the Treasurer's initiatives, they never got off the ground. On 25 October 1978 the Treasurer announced that because of a large number of submisions from a significant spectrum of the Australian business community, the Government had decided not to proceed with the measures. In a few months the Treasurer backed down completely on what he said was a necessary change to overcome the mixture of exemptions and credits which he described as a hotch potch and to overcome the tax avoidance which resulted from that hotch potch. This is yet another example of the Government's capitulation in the face of concerted lobbying by powerful vested interests, as in the case of the so-called newsboy's tax and the tax crackdown on trusts. It is no wonder that the business community lobbied hard against these proposals considering the unfair tax advantage which it stood to lose. </PARA>
<PARA> None of the arguments against the scheme mentioned the tax avoidance implications. The business community reportedly complained of the disincentive to Australian companies to invest abroad, the inability of Australian companies to compete on an equal footing with local companies in overseas markets, the difficulties in attracting Australians to take employment overseas, the worsening relations with developing nations as their development oriented tax incentives were offset by higher Australian tax and the reduced Australian employment because of a fall in exports to firms operating overseas. None of these arguments is sufficiently convincing to us to overcome the tax avoidance argument and the equity implications of not having a foreign tax credit system. Why should companies which invest abroad pay less tax than is paid by a comparable local company simply because their profits are made off-shore, and especially as is often the case when those profits are further subsidised by the use of cheap foreign labour. Far from creating jobs in local export industries, there is a distinct possibility that Australian jobs may be lost by companies taking their operations overseas purely because of tax concessions provided by the Australian Government. Generous concessions to exempt the first $10,000 of foreign income were initially proposed by the Treasurer in June 1978 but even this was not regarded as satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> Not everyone would agree that Australian tax revenue should be forgone to encourage industrialisation in Asia, especially with the problems it is posing for the local industry. If such an effect were deemed desirable, it could be had through tax sparing provisions, as is the case in the current tax agreement with Malaysia. This is preferable to a blanket exemption with its tax avoidance implications. It is imperative, in our view, that some form of foreign tax credit system be introduced as quickly as possible to stop the current abuses. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of our tax laws which have international relevance are unfortunately complex because they attempt to deal with areas such as foreign source income and the income of non-residents over which Australia does not have complete taxing authority. In some cases, this complexity may lead to double taxation of the same income, which treaties such as those currently before the House attempt to offset. Despite the complexities, however, it is urgently necessary that the international aspects of our tax laws be given a thorough overhaul. As I have shown, these provisions have been blatantly abused by the smart money men as yet another avenue for the wealthy to avoid their fair share of taxes, thus imposing a still heavier tax burden on the vast majority of taxpayers. The Government, yet again, is unwilling to take the necessary action to put an end to these abuses once and for all</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has had five years since the Asprey recommendation were published to do something in this area but, apart from a lot of hot air and wishful thinking, nothing has been forthcoming. It has been too beholden to vested interest groups to take any positive action. This Government seems content to watch tax avoidance continue its dramatic growth. The Labor Party has consistently put forward positive policies to overcome the shortcomings I have mentioned and it seems that only a Labor government would have the necessary resolve to rid our society of the cankerous growth of tax avoidance once and for all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have listened for 30 minutes-a full 30 minutes-to a harangue from the Opposition's Treasury spokesman, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). Anybody listening to the honourable member would believe that tax avoidance started on 11 November 1975. The honourable member would have the House and the public believe that in the three years in which Labor was in government there was no such thing as a tax avoidance industry. It just strikes me as being absolutely beyond the bounds of reality that he expects people to believe that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member made reference to the fact that companies such as the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, Thiess and Pioneer Concrete actually earn income in places like Hong Kong. They earn income in such places because they have operations there. But the honourable member did not tell us about that. Neither does he tell us that Australian companies are earning money and paying tax in Great Britain, the United States of America and other countries around the world. They are paying tax at the rates imposed in those countries. I think it is a bit beyond the pale for the honourable member for Gellibrand to spend 30 minutes talking about tax avoidance by companies and tax avoidance in general when the same situation existed between 1972 and 1975 and the Labor Government, if it had so desired, had a capacity to do something about this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill provides for the bringing into force of comprehensive double tax arrangements with Malaysia and Sweden. The arrangements deal with income which flows between Australia and those other two countries. In general terms, double tax agreements have two functions. They are intended to eliminate international double taxation and they are designed to prevent fiscal evasion. Each of the two agreements which the House is considering at the moment under this legislation accords in essential respects with the position that Australian governments have taken over the years in relation to double tax agreements. They provide for the country of source to limit its withholdings tax on dividends. Australia is agreeing to reduce withholding tax from 30 per cent to 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Both agreements also specify a limit on the other country's tax on interest as well as on royalties paid to residents in the other country under the agreement. In addition, both agreements contain measures for the formal relief of double taxation of income that may be taxed by both countries. The country of residence of the taxpayer is obliged to provide the necessary relief. Australian residents' income, in respect of which a limit is imposed by the agreements-that is tax, interest and royalties-will be taxed in Australia with credit being allowed for the tax of the country of source. </PARA>
<PARA> The main features of the arrangements with the two countries are as follows. Business profits, if derived by a resident of one country from a branch or other establishment in the other country, may be taxed in the latter country, otherwise they are to be taxed only in the country of residence. Dividends, interest and royalties will be subject to tax in the country of source, but there is a general limit on the tax that that country may charge on such income flowing to residents of the other country. Income from real property is taxable in full in the country in which the land is situated. Profits from international operations of ships and aircraft will be taxed only in the country of residence of the operator. Income from personal services, as far as Malaysia is concerned, will generally be taxable in the country where the services are performed. Income from independent personal services in the case of Sweden will be taxed only in the country of residence of the recipient unless the income is attributable to a fixed base of the recipient in the other country. Income from dependent personal servives as far as Sweden is concerned-for instance, employees' remuneration-would generally be taxable in the country where the services are performed. </PARA>
<PARA> Government officials such as diplomats and trade commissioners are to be taxed by their home country. Directors' fees will generally be taxed in the country of residence of the paying company. Income derived by public entertainers from their activities as such is to be taxed by the country in which the activities take place. I would just mention in passing that that means income from tours of groups such as ABBA will be taxed in Australia under this agreement. I take it that both the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peacock) and the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) have a particular interest in the activities of Mr Bjorn Borg, one for perhaps more reasons than the other. </PARA>

If Bjorn Borg had not been a resident of Monaco, his income in Australia would have been taxable and this country would have received a little more revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Pensions and annuities will generally be taxed only in the country of residence of the recipient. Remuneration derived by teachers and professors for teaching or research during visits of up to two years' duration will be exempt from tax in the country visited, provided it is subject to tax in the country of residence. A student resident will be exempt from tax in the country visited in respect of payments made from abroad for the purposes of his or her maintenance or education. Dual residents of both countries are, according to specified criteria, to be treated for the purposes of the agreement as being residents of only one country. The arrangements also provide for an exchange of information and consultation between the taxation authorities of each of the two countries. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also provision for double taxation relief which will be allowed by the country of residence in respect of income tax in the other country. In the case of Australia, double taxation relief will be effected by allowance of credit against Australian tax for the other country's tax on interest and royalties, where that tax is subject to a limit expressed in the relevant agreement, and on dividends received by individuals-dividends received by Australian companies from Malaysia and Sweden and all other categories of taxed income received by Australian residents from those countries being freed from Australian tax by Australian tax law. Australia will also, in the case of Malaysia, grant a 'tax sparing' credit for Malaysian tax forgone under incentive legislation. In Malaysia, the arrangement broadly will be carried out by allowance of credit against Malaysian tax for the Australian tax on income derived by residents of Malaysia from sources in Australia. In Sweden the arrangement will be generally by allowance of credit against Swedish tax for the Australian tax on dividends, interest and royalties and, while taking other income into account in determining the rate of Swedish tax on taxable income, by exempting that other income from Swedish tax. In the case of a Swedish company which owns shares in an Australian company, other than a company that is largely an investment company, dividends paid to the Swedish company will be exempt from Swedish tax on the same basis as if the two companies had been residents of Sweden. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government-and the National Country Party in particular-regards these Bills as being Bills which will extend, in a responsible fashion, Australia's financial and fiscal relationships with other countries in the international sphere. We welcome the entering into of these arrangements because they will provide for more definite and more specific arrangements between Australia and other countries. I support the Bill before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) suggested that perhaps the Labor Government of 1972 to 1975 might have acted on some of the matters that the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), mentioned. I think one ought to recognise-certainly the honourable member for Hume ought to recognise-that there has been an explosion in tax evasion in the past five years. According to the Commissioner of Taxation, in terms of figures released last year, the level of tax avoidance since 1975 is 20 times what it was at that time. That is one of the reasons why the Opposition has consistently tried to get the Government to take much more seriously the issue of tax avoidance which produces such terrible inequity in the tax system. It produces an unfairness in the tax system which discriminates against low income people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill before the House will provide legislative authority for the entering into force of comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and Malaysia and Australia and Sweden, respectively. Double taxation agreements have two principal functions, firstly, the elimination of international double taxation and, secondly, the prevention of fiscal evasion. This Bill concerns itself primarily with the first objective-that is, the elimination of double taxation-but particularly in terms of the exchange of information it will have some bearing on the second objective. Under the agreements set out in the Bill, Australia is to reduce withholding tax on dividends flowing to the other country from 30 per cent to 15 per cent of the amount of the dividends. Corresponding legislation has been passed in Malaysia and Sweden to set similar limits in the withholding of dividends. Secondly, both agreements specify a limit on each country's tax on interest and royalties paid to the residents of the other. It is noted in the second reading speech that Malaysia provides exemptions from tax in interest on royalties. In this legislation Australia is agreeing not to tax the revenue forgone by the Malaysian Government-that is, as a tax sparing measure-and is to tax Australian recipients of relevant interest and royalties, and allow credit against its tax, as if the Malaysian tax of 10 per cent of the interest on royalties has been paid. In the case of Sweden, the tax on the country of source is to be limited to 10 per cent for both interest and royalties. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that this Bill and the double taxation agreements entered into by Australia with Sweden and with Malaysia have little in them that is likely to prevent fiscal evasion-that is, international tax avoidance-and therefore the problem to which I wish to devote the major part of my time in this speech is that problem. It is becoming more important as a consequence of the growing internationalisation of economic activities, including the growth of transnational corporations which are increasingly important in international trade. According to the United Nations, intra-corporate transactions-that is transactions between related firms-now represent a considerable proportion of world trade. Approximately 46 per cent of imports to the United States in 1974 and 50 per cent of exports in 1970 were similarly affected. The data available indicates that 29 per cent of Swedish exports in 1975, 30 per cent of United Kingdom exports in 1973 and 50 per cent of Canadian exports in 1971 were on an intra-corporate basis. The Australian Treasury estimated that, in 1971, above one-third of total Australian imports were intra-corporate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in its 1979 report on transfer pricing and multinational enterprises emphasised some of the implications of this interconnectedness. The report reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In a multinational enterprise many transactions normally take place between members of the group and sales of goods, the provision of services, the licensing of patents and know how, the granting of loans and so on. The prices charged for such transfers do not necessarily represent a result of the free play of market fees, but may for a number of reasons and because the MNE is in a position to adopt whatever principle is convenient to it as a group, diverge considerably from the prices which would have been agreed upon between unrelated parties engaged in the same or similar transactions under the same and similar conditions in the open market. </PARA>
<PARA>The scale of these intra-corporate transactions clearly gives tremendous scope for the manipulation of prices with the resultant effect on profits and hence on both taxable income and national income. Underpricing of exports will reduce the profits of the exporting company and its taxable income, as well as reducing the foreign exchange income to the exporting country. Conversely, the over-pricing of imports will increase the import bill of the country concerned in terms of foreign exchange, and reduce the profits of the importing country and hence its taxable income. This transfer pricing can affect not only profits and taxable capacity but also the balance of payments and hence the real income of entire countries. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been several examples which have recently been given publicity of transfer pricing arrangements involving transnational corporations in the aluminium industry. The most publicised case was that involving the Commonwealth Aluminium company, a subsidiary of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd and Kaiser Aluminium and Chemical Corporation, and in turn a subsidiary of Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation Ltd of the United Kingdom which, in the period 1966 to 1971, shipped bauxite from Weipa to Japan to two Japanese companies although it was sold to a Hong Kong subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA> This subsidiary, Comalco Bauxite (HK) Ltd was intended to do and did little except by way of book entries. There was no physical delivery to it. It simply purchased the bauxite from the taxpayer, for example, at 33 shillings per ton and sold it to the Japanese companies at 40 shillings per ton. The reason for this measure was explained in an internal Comalco memorandum:</PARA>
<PARA> I explained to Mr Shimizu that we had chosen Hong Kong as the location as this would give the maximum tax advantage over the dividends they would draw from the Sales Company. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, there has also been some publicity given to the suspicions held by the Government of Iceland that the Alusuisse organisation has been diverting huge profits from Iceland through over pricing of alumina from Australia. On 16 December 1980, the Minister for Industry and Commerce in Iceland called a Press conference to announce startling findings that his ministry had compiled concerning sales of bauxite from Australian Alusuisse controlled mines to its subsidiary in Iceland. The Minister's statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has since June studied the pricing of alumina to ISAL. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the subsidiary company in Iceland:</PARA>
<PARA> The result of this study shows that the price of imported alumina is much higher than one would normally expect in view of the export price for alumina from Australia. When comparing these two prices on an equivalent basis (FOB Gove Australia) between January 1974 and June 1980 it appears that the alumina price increased at sea 54.1 per cent and in total by $47.5m of the exchange rates prevailing each year. For comparison purposes, the total payment made by ISAC for electricity generation was $31m for the same period. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, this situation would not be in the best interests of either Australia or Iceland. Whilst this is only one example of an industry in which a problem exists, it would appear that the underpayment of tax may be a characteristic of the mining industry as a whole. The Fitzgerald report of 1974 concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government did not manage to break even in the budgeting give and take with the mineral section as a whole, let alone derive a significant net return from the industry's prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA>What, then, could the Australian Government do to prevent the loss of income as a result of transfer pricing and other means used to reduce taxation? The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has emphasised the need to ensure that prices are determined on the basis of the arm's length principle. A number of methods exist for estimating arm's length prices. Firstly, there is the comparative uncontrolled price method. The best evidence of an applicable arm's length price is the price paid in transactions between the taxpayer and unrelated buyers and sellers for the same goods and services under circumstances similar to those existing between the taxpayer and its related company. However, this comparison may not be readily available due to the very high degree of vertical integration in a number of industries and perhaps the lack of comparable markets. Secondly, there is the resale price method. This method applies where goods are sold by one affiliate to another and this is followed by resale to an unrelated party. The resale price method seeks to move from the final selling price and subtract the costs and appropriate profit markup to come up with a more realistic price. The third method suggested by the OECD is a cost plus method where an appropriate mock-up, expressed as a percentage of cost, is added to the manufacturing cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever method is adopted, there appear to be two central problems: Firstly, the problem of getting access to all the information necessary to make an effective assessment of a company's income and, secondly, the problem of making any effective assessment stick in the courts. As the honourable member for Gellibrand suggested, the process of revision of legislation appears to be painfully slow. The Treasury's economic paper of May 1972 on overseas investment in Australia suggests that, whilst no information is available about the extent of profit shifting arrangements, it appears that the need for the Commissioner of Taxation to consider the application of section 136 has increased since the mid-1960s. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak briefly about the Asprey report, which was referred to by the honourable member for Gellibrand, particularly about the comments of the Asprey report on section 136, which it appears the present Government is now considering revising. Having summarised section 136, the Committee makes the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA> In the Committee's view, however, the section does not give the Commissioner adequate power. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of paragraphs then deal with the reasons for saying that. I draw the attention of members of the Government parties to paragraph 17.87 on page 268 of the report, where the precise circumstances that have arisen in the Commonwealth Aluminium case are discussed at some length by the Committee. The paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA> And here, too, section 136, which can apply to income derived by a resident, is inadequate. The resident company will be carrying on business in Australia, but in the deflated receipts situation described in paragraph 17.86 the Commissioner's power to substitute notional receipts in a non-arm's length transaction is doubtful. Both in this situation and in the inflated cost one described in paragraph 17.85, the Commissioner may have no power to reconstruct because the resident company does not come within any of the clauses of section 136 identifying the persons to whom the section may apply. Clause (b) can be avoided if a majority of the shares is vested in residents, even though those shares carry only a small fraction of rights to dividends or distribution of capital and have no voting rights. </PARA>
<PARA>Further down the paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The control contemplated by clause (a), in the case of a company, probably refers to director control. It may be inferred from judicial authorities on the meaning of central management and control in the definition of residence in relation to a company that it will be enough to prevent the operation of clause (a) if a majority of the directors are Australian residents. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, if a majority of directors are Australian residents, irrespective of where the real ownership and control of that company lies, section 136 may not apply. That view was put forward in 1975 in the Asprey report. The circumstances to which the Commonwealth Aluminium case applied relate to the late 1960s. By 1981 we still have not managed to achieve a revision of a critical section which is resulting in the loss of tens of millions of dollars and may eventually result in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in terms of revenue. It seems to me to be unconscionable that a government which claims that it is on about fair taxation and which claims that it has a record in relation to tax avoidance really has not tackled even the most fundamental principles of dealing with problems in this area of international tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gellibrand referred to a number of other reforms which were suggested in that report and which might at least have provided a basis for consideration by this Government. One can only believe that what is certainly true of the National Party in Queensland-that it is totally behoven in a very direct sense to the interests of these international companies, that it has been bought lock, stock and barrel-may well apply to the Government's operations as a whole. No one would suggest that these matters are simple ones. I certainly would not claim to have made a profound study of them. But it stands to reason that if the Australian economy is increasingly moving towards becoming a more open international economy, which many members of the Government parties would recommend, and if more and more of our wealth is dependent on foreign economic relations and, increasingly in relation to the mining industry, on transfers that will be occurring within the same companies, within related companies or within companies, as in the aluminium industry which formed together in extemely tight cartel or in terms of highly concentrated relationships, one is not in a situation in which the free market is applying and in which one can expect prices to be determined in any sense in response to a market situation. Indeed, that is an issue which is currently before the Prices Justification Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government does not permit an inquiry into aluminium prices it will be because the Government is not prepared to have exposed the pricing practices of those companies which moved some 15 years ago to suggesting that their prices ought to be determined on the basis of international producer prices and which, because that does not suit them any longer, as was suggested earlier today by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), want to move back to a domestic price situation, presumably so that they can get higher prices and higher profits. For governments to get their share of the wealth generated by these great companies it is absolutely necessary for one to be in a position to determine the basis on which prices may be set. The problem of achieving some kind of measure of the real earnings and the real income of companies is quite central to the issue of international taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the principle of arm's length pricing is a very important and good principle, but the reality of situations in which companies are dealing with one another very often in an industry which is totally controlled, to all intents and purposes, by a small number of companies or even one company makes the principle of determining prices and income extremely difficult, to say nothing of a number of other problems with which we will be confronted if we want to take seriously this question of taxation within the international context. One of the present practices of companies is to charge out for the technology which they are importing into a country, to put a value on the technology imported into a country. One can imagine that the practice will result in considerable reductions in the taxation that might be paid to taxation authorities. On what basis can one really make a fair determination of what the value of that technology which is being imported happens to be worth? The same would apply to intangibles such as research and development transfers which occur and which represent a charge. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an extremely complex area. It is an area that the Government is not into. It is an area that the Government ought to be into as a matter of great urgency. I fully support the remarks of the honourable member for Gellibrand that what we need is a comprehensive look at transfer pricing and international aspects of taxation so that we can determine a number of constructive proposals. One does not wish to be too hard on the Government in the sense that these problems are complex, but one regrets the fact that the Government suggests it has done a great deal about tax avoidance when it has not tackled this fundamental problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say at the outset on behalf of the Opposition that we do not oppose the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill 1981. Therefore, I can be very brief in my remarks. The Bill represents the implementation of discussions and a negotiated agreement between the management of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation and the union of employees in that corporation, the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association. In that respect I refer very briefly to the words of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his second reading speech where he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The nature of the proposed amendments has been discussed with the Commonwealth Banking Corporation and the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association and both parties fully accept the approach taken. </PARA>
<PARA>This represents the implementation of the policy of the Opposition, in that the way to deal properly with issues actually or potentially in dispute is that there should be negotiation between management and the union of employees concerned. I would only make the comment in passing-I do not want to be disputatious about it-that the tragedy is that this approach has not been allowed to operate in respect to the major area of Commonwealth employment dealing with the same sort of issues that are covered by this amending Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I also make the observation in support of our position on this Bill that we welcome the provisions of clause 6 which removes a discrimination between the sexes. The current position is that the minimum and maximum retiring ages are 60 and 65 years for male officers and 55 and 60 years for female officers. Under the provisions of clause 6 there will be a minimum retiring age of 55 years and a maximum retiring age of 65 years for all officers of the Corporation. I need delay the House no longer. For all the reasons I have given the Opposition does not oppose this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the Opposition's attitude to the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill 1981, I think I can be almost as brief as the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). I agree with him that clause 6 of the Bill is to be welcomed. The clause does put men and women upon an equal basis as to minimum and maximum retirement ages. I think there are one or two other clauses of the Bill which should be referred to briefly because they improve the position of officers when they are faced with action taken by the Commonwealth Banking Corporation against them which might affect their position or their emoluments. I refer to the action which has been taken in respect of section 102 of the Commonwealth Banks Act. There is now a right arbitrarily to retire an officer after he has reached retirement age; that is, the minimum retirement age as specified in the existing Act. In place of that there is to be provision for grounds and for a right of appeal by an officer. No right of appeal existed beforehand and no grounds had to be made out against an officer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Section 106 of the Act is to be amended in favour of officers. It will apply only to persons below the age of 55 years. As I read the section, it circumscribes somewhat the gounds on which action can be taken for retirement of an officer. Under proposed new section 108 of the Bill a right of appeal is to be introduced which I think is most important not only for action taken under section 102, sub-section (2), to which I have already referred, but also to action taken under section 103, sub-section (2), which is a provision that if no position is available for an officer the Corporation may retire him from the service. There is now to be a right of appeal against that kind of decision. I welcome the amendment as I am sure does the honourable member for Wills. I need detain the House no further. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

The general approach of an employer taking unto himself the right to override the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and to override the procedures which are associated with the arbitration system, does not help and cannot help industrial relations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Bill is a ratification and implementation of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources which was agreed to following an international conference held at Canberra from 7 to 20 May 1980. Honourable members will be glad to know, I am sure, that the Convention was signed for Australia by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) who I hope will be speaking later in the debate. The Convention which appears as a Schedule to the Bill has as its primary aim the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources. The contracting parties undertook to do this by:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recognising the importance of safeguarding the environment and protecting the integrity of the ecosystem of the seas surrounding Antarctica; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And, although this sounds somewhat inconsistent:</PARA>
<PARA> Considering that it is essential to increase knowledge of the Antarctic marine ecosystem and its components so as to be able to base decisions on harvesting on sound scientific information; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Convention applies not only to the marine living resources, that is, fish, birds, seals, whales and crustaceans but also to the marine ecosystem, defined as the complex of relationships of Antarctic marine living resources. Conservation, incidentally, is also defined as including 'rational use'. The term 'rational use' however is not defined. The protected area is defined as the area south of the 'Antarctic convergence'-a line drawn on the map marking the natural boundary where the colder waters of the Southern Ocean meet the warmer, temperate oceans in the north. Between the 150th meridian of longitude east, that is, the line that runs through eastern Australia from Cape Howe to a mid point between Rockhampton and Mackay, the Antarctic convergence runs along the 60th parallel of latitude to the 50th meridian west-almost half way round the globe. From the 50th meridian west the Antarctic convergence goes due north from 60 degrees south to 50 degrees south, then runs east along the 50th parallel to the 30th meridian east. This variation covers the area in the South Atlantic Ocean across to a point almost due south of Durban in the east of South Africa. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why don't you get the map incorporated in Hansard?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to suggest that. In the Victorian Parliament it was possible to have maps and charts incorporated in the Hansard report but unfortunately because of the rigours of producing a daily issue of Hansard, while it is possible to have tables of figures incorporated in our Hansard it is not possible to have maps and charts incorporated. One has to rely on language. At the 30th degree east the Antarctic divergence goes due north again up to the 45th parallel, then runs due east along the 45th parallel to the 80th meridian-the mid point of the Indian Ocean due south of Sri Lanka. This last divergence, by the way, includes Australia's Heard Island and McDonald Island in the Antarctic convergence. At the 80th meridian the line runs due south to the 55th parallel, then due east along that line including the eastern part of the Indian Ocean and the area south of Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania along to the 150th meridian where it drops down to the 60th parallel-the point at which I began my description.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, it is easy to follow on a map. It would have saved you a lot of mental anguish, Mr Deputy Speaker, if we could have a map incorporated in Hansard. One weakness of the Convention, which is incorporated in the Bill as a Schedule, is that it evades the question of whether the 200 mile or 370 kilometre exclusive economic zone-or EEZ-is applicable to the Antarctic continent. The concept of the Antarctic convergence appears to override any EEZ claim. Article IV, paragraph 2 of the Convention states:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in this Convention and no acts or activities taking place while the present Convention is in force shall:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty in the Antarctic Treaty area or create any rights of sovereignty in the Antarctic Treaty area;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) be interpreted as a renunciation or diminution by any Contracting Party of, or as prejudicing, any right or claim or basis of claim to exercise coastal state jurisdiction under international law within the area to which this Convention applies;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) be interpreted as prejudicing the position of any Contracting Party as regards its recognition or non- recognition of any such right, claim or basis of claim; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>However, to add to the problem here, Article IX paragraph 6 sub-paragraph (c) states:</PARA>
<PARA> If a member of the Commission . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is to say, the contracting parties which join the Commission to be set up under the Convention which, of course, is referred to as the Schedule to the Bill we are dealing with tonight-</PARA>
<PARA>within ninety days following the notification specified in sub-paragraph (a), notifies the Commission that it is unable to accept the conservation measure, in whole or in part, the measure shall not, to the extent stated, be binding upon that Member of the Commission; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, if we want to opt out of it we simply say: 'Look, we don't regard ourselves as being bound. To the extent that we say that we do not regard ourselves as being bound, we do not have to be part of it'. Also, in my view, if we look at Article XII there is another part of a double veto. Article XII paragraph 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Decisions of the Commission on matters of substance shall be taken by consensus. The question of whether a matter is one of substance shall be treated as a matter of substance. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Hodgman" NAMEID="BV4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BV4">Mr Hodgman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a matter of substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right, absolutely. Then, as the Minister for the Capital Territory with his quick legal brain would note-that is not to imply, of course, that the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) who is at the table is not taking any less keen interest in the legal problem-if we go on to read Article XII paragraph 2 we will see that it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Decisions on matters other than those referred to in paragraph 1 above--</PARA>
<PARA>That is to say, the non-substantive matters-</PARA>
<PARA>shall be taken by a simple majority of the Members of the Commission present and voting. </PARA>
<PARA>If we refer to a procedure of voting by a majority with regard to non-substantive matters, that is, matters of procedure, the only implication that we can draw is that that reference to consensus in Article XII paragraph 1 means that we must have a unanimous vote. Either we have that or it simply means that somebody can abstain and say: 'We don't propose to veto it but we don't particularly go along with it either'. It means that, although the terms of the Convention read very nicely, when we come to issues of substance it is difficult to get much joy out of the Convention. There is an irony in the evasion, of course, because a major reason for the increased interest in the possibility of exploiting the Antarctic waters has been the impact of the 200 mile EEZ proclaimed in European waters which has disturbed fishing rights which have been traditionally shared-for example, the German activities in the North and Baltic Seas and the Poles in the northern waters of Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> The second weakness is one of practical control. The headquarters of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources will be in Hobart. That is not something we oppose but it will be set up, I fear-I hope there is a reassurance to the contrary-with limited resources and limited personnel. The difficulty is that the major areas of contention seem certain to be on the other side of the South Pole in South Atlantic waters. If one looks at the map of the area involved and realises that the area that is likely to have the heaviest exploitation will be that area covered in the South Atlantic between the continent of South America and the continent of South Africa, it would be hard to think of a more difficult spot to be effectively supervised from than Hobart on the other side of the earth. I know that Tasmanians are amazingly gifted. It would seem to me that there are a number of technical problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly, there would need to be more than one base. I simply point out that, if it is to work properly, it will have to be very effectively manned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third point is, as I said earlier, that the double-veto provisions of the Convention make it easier for those nations which want to destroy its principles to do so. Fourthly, the potentially important issue of iceberg harvesting is excluded from the Convention. The definition in the Bill of 'living marine resource' obviously does not include the iceberg. Yet it seems clear also that icebergs will be quite fundamental to the preservation of the existing ecosystem. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Article I and paragraph 1 of Article II always use the term 'a marine living resource'. Yet it would seem quite clear that, if the pack ice is to be seriously disturbed, it is not in a technical sense a disturbance of a marine living resource but it is fundamental to the survival of the marine living resource. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth point which seems to me to be a fundamental weakness of the Treaty is that agreement on the preservation of krill has been relatively simple to achieve, although somewhat protracted in its execution, because krill plays a relatively minor role in our concept of a modern technological society and rapid economic growth. The adoption of this Convention, however desirable in itself, may create the false impression that unanimity can or will be reached about possible future resource exploitation of oil and other minerals. Since 1959, Antarctica's only export has been scientific data. The continent, far bigger than Australia or the United States of America, has been under the nearest thing to a world government that the world has ever known. As Jon Tinker wrote in the New Scientist of 13 September 1979:</PARA>
<PARA> Cynics would say . . . . that international idealism was fine so long as the typical person interested in Antarctica was a botanist studying the 'epontic' algae that grow on the underside of pack ice. The cynics would add that as soon as anything more valuable than epontic algae was discovered down there, internationalism would start to melt away like an iceberg in the Red Sea. </PARA>
<PARA>One hundred million years ago, Antarctica was linked to Australia, Africa and South America and the minerals found in those three continents will be found in abundance in Antarctica. Metallic minerals already identified in Antarctica include chromium, nickel, cobalt, copper, gold, silver, manganese, molybdenum, iron, titanium, platinum, lead, zinc, tin and uranium. It also seems overwhelmingly likely that there will be vast reserves of coal and deposits of oil and natural gas. Admittedly, for the present they are uneconomic to exploit, but what we need to consider is what will happen when those resources reach a point of development. I am apprehensive that the unanimity that has been achieved as far as this Treaty is concerned will then appear to be not particularly relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> We have only the vaguest idea of the mineral wealth of Antarctica and we are just as ignorant of the wealth of the surrounding seas. We know very little about the life cycle, breeding habits and the relative abundance of the living marine resources down there. But at the moment a number of nations are investigating these marine resources for the purpose of harvesting. Most interest has been attracted to krill. Krill are small prawn-like creatures which thrive in great abundance in the extraordinarily nutrient-rich cold waters of the Southern Ocean. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Crustacea.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, they are crustacea. But they are no gourmet's delight. They are central to maintaining the ecological balance of the Antarctic because they feed on abundant phytoplankton and in turn are fed on by many larger animals. In particular, they form the staple food of whales. They are increasingly being recognised as a potential source of protein for man; hence the need for a convention which controls man's exploitation in such a way as to be non-discriminatory between different nations and at the same time to maintain the local ecosystem. Dr John Beddington of York University has stated that he regards the spirit of the Convention on conservation as worthy but he is critical of its scientific approach. He argues that in particular it does not take into account the fact that the greatest net annual increment in a population can be achieved only by removing its predators. In the case of krill that would mean killing whales, which would be a contradiction of the Convention's aim of allowing depleted whale populations to recover.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not quite clear what the total resource of krill is in the waters around the Antarctic. Calculations to date have put the standing stock at values of between 800 million and 5,000 million tonnes of krill. The International Institute for Environment and Development in its report stated that research on ground krill showed a high concentration of fluorine in its shell which may preclude its use in human food. Unconfirmed reports suggest that West Germany, on the basis of its studies, has discounted krill as a food. We know that in Chile they are actually selling krill fingers, which would seem to me unlikely to displace even the much despised fish fingers in an Australian context. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Institute for Environment and Development market survey concluded that three products were likely to be significant, namely, krill mince, krill protein concentrate and krill meal. They show the most promise in comparison with products on the market now. Krill mince is used in soups, pie fillings, salads and to extend sausages and fish cakes. However, its use is limited by its strong flavour, which may be charitably described as revolting, and by its relatively high price compared with other protein sources, such as soya beans and fish mince. It is estimated that krill could capture 10 per cent of the world protein market by 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Krill are extremely important to a whole variety of creatures. The whale is the most written about, but krill is important to a whole range of other species as well. The most reliable calculations of the amount of krill that each predator eats has been presented by Dr R. M. Laws of the British Antarctic Survey. The main predators are whales; seals, mainly crab-eater seals; birds, mainly Adelie penguins; squid; and fish. Dr Laws estimates that whales currently consume about 43 million tonnes of krill each year, seals about 64 million tonnes and birds between 15 and 20 million tonnes. Calculating the amount eaten by squid is more difficult as the estimates can be made only from our limited knowledge of the amount of squid that sperm whales eat and then assuming the size of the squid population from that estimate. Dr Laws suggests that squid consume about 100 million tonnes of krill each year, but he considers that not enough information is available even to guess how much fish consume. Adding up the totals for whales, seals, birds and squid gives an annual consumption of more than 200 million tonnes a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Laws has also calculated that before whaling commenced the baleen whales were consuming no less than 190 million tonnes a year. Thus, as a consequence of whaling, whales have ceased to be the principal consumers of krill. Among the mammals and birds at least, the crab-eater seal, with an annual consumption of about 63 million tonnes seems to have taken over. As to the visible effect that the depletion of whales has had on other krill predators, Dr Laws found that crab-eater seals now mature sexually earlier than they used to. The numbers of fur seals, which were reduced to a mere few thousand as a result of hunting early this century, have also increased faster than would have been expected. Today there are at least 300,000 of them. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of honourable members wish to speak on this Bill, so I will bring my remarks to a close. I conclude by restating this warning. There has been a remarkable degree of international unanimity on the question of the development of the resources around the Antarctic. This has been so because the stakes have not been high enough. It is true that krill could be an enormously significant source of protein-it is also extraordinarily rich in vitamin A-but the stakes are not big enough to lead to the wholesale development and exploitation of the resources of the Antarctic. There is a very real danger that if, in the 1980s, the enormous mineral wealth of the Antarctic is developed on a large scale, or indeed any attempt to develop it is made, all of the former agreements we have reached will not be worth the paper on which they are written. There will be an international scramble which will make the scramble for Africa in the nineteenth century or the great gold rushes of Klondike and Australia, also in that century, appear absolutely miserable by comparison. So it is an area where we have to move very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> I am naturally very enthusiastic about the encouragement of research and development in Australia. This is one of the areas in which we ought to be increasing our miserably small budget for that purpose. We hope that the Convention will prove to be effective. I congratulate the officers of the Department of Science and Technology who have worked to bring it about. I hope that the Antarctic will always remain a zone of peace and that there will not be severe international competition for it, but would point out that a number of very important questions need to be answered but have not been. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to a question that the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) put to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs on 20 September 1977. That question suggests the extent to which we are in the dark. The honourable member asked:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Is the exterior limit to the Antarctic Territory at the edge of (a) the continental land mass or (b) the ice mass. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Who owns unattached icebergs within (a) the territorial sea, (b) the economic zone and (c) the high seas. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Does it make any difference whether the territorial source of the iceberg, is, or is not, known. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) What aspects of international maritime law apply to the towing of icebergs. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) What are the potential international liabilities for any ecological or other damage due to the harvesting or transportating of icebergs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister answered:</PARA>
<PARA> The questions raised by the honourable member involve complex issues of law that in many respects are unsettled. It would therefore not be appropriate for me to canvass these legal problems at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the answer of the brains trust at the Department of Foreign Affairs is: 'We do not know; there is no way of finding out; we are in the dark.' We are still in the dark. I hope that it will all work out for the best but I think that on the whole we have not been well-informed about developments in Antarctica and I hope that in the next few years we will see an enormous increase in the amount of information that is available to the Parliament so we can discuss this area, which is physically so close to us and is obviously so central to our future and probably also to that of the civilised world. </PARA>

I cast my mind back to 1971 when, as a very junior member of the Legislative Council of the Parliament of Tasmania, I dared to put forward the suggestion that Australia, and preferably Tasmania, might at some future time be the logical headquarters of an international body involved in the management of the resources of the Antarctic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today is most historic for Australia, for this Parliament and for those who see the Antarctic as an area which must be properly managed by mankind if mankind is to ensure that in the twenty-first century this unique and superb continent, and its resources, are utilised for the benefit of the world. What pride we must have as Australians that today, with the passing of this Bill in the House of Representatives, and subsequently in the Senate, Australia will become the first nation to ratify the new Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, a convention which was finally hammered out at a conference in Canberra in May of last year. It was signed by some 15 nations and, for the record, may I simply read into Hansard their names, because I do not think that they have yet been recorded therein. They are: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, the German Democratic Republic, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, the Republic of South Africa, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> It must also be a very proud night for the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) because he was one of four Australian parliamentarians, and if I may say so the longest-serving Australian parliamentarian, to take part in the conferences which brought this Convention to a conclusion. The honourable member was one of our parliamentary representatives at the 1976 conference. He was there again last year and, if I might say so, I am sure that his colleagues, Senator Sibraa, Senator Puplick and the former honourable member for La Trobe, Mr Marshall Baillieu, would acknowledge that he was in all senses the leader of that delegation. He actually signed the convention. That is a little bit of history of which I am proud, of which the Parliament should be proud and of which I believe the honourable member for Hawker is rightly proud. It was a magnificent contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am paying tribute, could I please pay tribute to, firstly, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Honourable Andrew Peacock, who took a very keen and, if I might say so, extensive interest in this proposal. Ambassador John Rowland, who is presently our Ambassador in France was, I believe, the first Australian diplomat to become directly involved and did initial work. Ambassador Keith Brennan who is currently our Ambassador to Switzerland and an acknowledged world expert on the law of the sea and Antarctic matters, really performed the task of a Goliath. Last, but by no means least, Mr John Ryan, the Deputy Head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, actually chaired the final conference last year which led to the signing of the Convention. I was fortunate to be present as an observer on the final day. The import of the Convention and what it would mean were brought home to me very forcibly during the signing ceremony, which took place here in Canberra in May of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a most historic occasion because the ratification of the Convention brings to Australia, for the very first time, the world headquarters of an international organisation. Honourable members can imagine my pride and the pride of all Tasmanians, as loyal Australians, that Article XIII (1) of the Convention provides:</PARA>
<PARA> The headquarters of the Commission shall be established at Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, and what will it do? The international commission which will be responsible for the management and the organisation relating to the observation of the Convention will comprise each of the nations which have already signed the Convention. It will also, as a matter of interest, include other nations which determine that they wish to accede to the provisions of the Convention. It will be the world headquarters of a commission which will be responsible for the management of this Convention. It is significant that whilst the Antarctic Treaty consultative nations are all members of this Convention and all have the right to ratify it, others which are not Antarctic Treaty consultative nations already have been included. I refer specifically to the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. Of course, there were representatives of the European Economic Community at the conference. I make the prediction that upon ratification by eight Treaty nations, which brings this Convention into effect under international law, we will see a number of countries-particularly Third World countries-which will wish to participate in the management and utilisation of the resources of the Antarctic. I draw particular attention to the words set out in Article II (2) of the Convention. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of this Convention, the term 'conservation' includes rational use. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst it is correct, as my colleague the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) pointed out, that the basis of the Convention is the conservation of resources, let it not be forgotten that, if it will mean the saving of mankind from starvation and deprivation, then that rational use of those resources is included in this Convention. I say here and now that in a real world the ideals to which we aspire may not always be achieveable. I know there are people in this country and in other parts of the world who would love to see the Antarctic left completely alone, almost to the stage of saying that man should keep away from this most beautiful, majestic-yet I should add resource-rich-continent. </PARA>
<PARA> To give an example of the degree of sensitivity of the Antarctic, and of those who love the Antarctic, I will tell a very short story of a friend of mine who recently visited the Antarctic. At a base-not an Australian base-he found, to his horror, two small budgerigars in a bird cage. Because of what he said, the two budgerigars were destroyed immediately. He, as an eminent scientist, pointed out to me that had those two birds, which had been taken there in a cage by one of the expeditions passing through Australia, had Newcastle disease, for example, they could have wiped out the entire bird population of the Antarctic. The eco-system of the Antarctic is so sensitive and so prone to reaction of a substantial nature from any interference, that man has even to tread carefully in that area. Without going into the details, we know that the simple movement of a foot near the wrong part of a precipice can immediately change the entire system. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's involvement in the Antarctic goes back to 1810 with the discovery of Macquarie Island. It is often forgotten that that is a part of Tasmania, although it is also a part of the sub-Antarctic. From 1810 to 1981 shows that our nation has had a substantial involvement in the area. I mention in passing that the acceptance of this Convention in no way interferes with national sovereignty or claims to territorial rights in the Antarctic. The Convention very carefully ensured that that sort of squabble did not eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA> As others wish to contribute to this debate I will bring my remarks to a conclusion. It is the first time that Australia has been the depository nation and the host nation providing the headquarters for any international organisation. The unanimous choice of all the delegates was that the most ideal and appropriate place to site the world headquarters was Hobart. This gives me great pride and it gives great pride to many people who worked very hard to ready this proposition for discussion and, it was to be hoped, for acceptance. The fact that the scientific committee will also be meeting normally in Hobart further enhances the activities of the Commission because that scientific committee will form the nucleus for forums for discussion involving the world's leading scientists on the question of the management of the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA> At this time I want to pay a tribute to a former Minister for Science, Senator Jim Webster, the present Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson), the present Acting Minister for Science and Technology, who is the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) and who is now present in the chamber, and to the Department of Science and Technology. The Department has opened my eyes and the eyes of many Australians to the calibre of people we have in this country, whose status is such that their recognition by Australians is infinitesimally low when compared to their recognition in other parts of the world. I refer, for example, to Dr Wild of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. That he has recently received a gold medal and is a member of the Royal Society is something that I do not think one out of 10,000 Australians would know. Yet, that is the eminence of that man. I think of people like Dr Farrands and the others who have been so actively involved in this matter. We can go back to people of the eminence of Dr Phillip Law and the current director, Mr Clarrie McCue. After looking at the quality of Australia's contribution to Antarctic activity, I can say without wishing anyone to draw any conclusions that the Minister for Housing and Construction is fortunate, as is the Minister for Science and Technology, to be in charge of such a dynamic and exciting department. As I have explained, Australia's Antarctic involvement has run for 171 years. I believe that we are in a position to offer a management potential for this superb continent which will place us in a situation in which the world will look to us in many instances for a lead. That will be a very great tribute to our achievements to date. That leaves me with my final comment. Ten years ago I dared to believe that this was a possibility. This Convention, and the world headquarters of the commission to manage the Convention, deals with Antarctic marine living resources. </PARA>

The question yet to be determined is where will the commission for the management of the continental Antarctic resources be established? This Convention deals with marine resources. The world has still to make a decision. The honourable member for Hawker knows that there have been discussions, and it has been suggested that Argentina could be looked at as a potential site. If nations cannot reach spontaneous agreement as to the management of the continental resources, I suggest that we follow the lead of nature and put water and land together. I am quite certain that, as Hobart can provide the world headquarters for a commission to manage the marine living resources, it can also provide the facilities for world headquarters for a commission which will manage the continental resources of the Antarctic.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address my remarks to some of the matters which relate to what you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would call foreign policy and to the problems that may or may not arise because of matters such as this. The Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Bill relates to matters of marine living resources and their conservation. The Antarctic Treaty is a unique achievement and, I am reminded, it was drafted in the midst of a cold war. It side-stepped the territorial claims of rival nations and, in what is called an extraordinary feat of international diplomacy, dedicated the Antarctic continent in the interests of all. It was dedicated as a scientific laboratory, free from armies and weapons. If honourable members look at the Treaty they will notice that there is to be a prohibition against any nuclear activity and also a clear affirmation that the Antarctic is to be a land of peace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We congratulate those who were responsible for bringing this Treaty about, not the least of whom would be my colleague the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), and also our respective Australian ambassadors who led the negotiations and brought them to a successful conclusion. We note with interest that the Commission is to be established in Tasmania, and we welcome that. I know that even the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) has no objection to the Russians going there on this basis. I make the point that we are talking about the protection of the environment, and my colleagues will be dealing with this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to comment-I think it is appropriate to all of us-on how apathetic we, as a nation, have been when we have talked about research and the amount of money that we are allocating to it. We have neglected that area and it is essential that we do something about it. We have territorial claims to 40 per cent of the Antarctic territory, but I am told that our performance in financial resource allocation is very meagre indeed-about $15m a year. I am reminded that West Germany, which is not really one of the original countries involved in claiming any territorial sovereignty, proposes to spend several hundreds of millions of dollars over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia is to talk about capacity, it is important for us to have the ability to do something about implementing that capacity. It is disturbing to realise that Australia has no distant water fishing fleet to take advantage of the permits of the Treaty. The Japanese fleet can reach Antarctic waters and fish there, so can the Soviet fleet and so, indeed, can distant water fishing fleets of other countries, particularly Poland. Not only must we protect the Antarctic environment, but also we must ensure that we have the capacity to share in those resources. This Government has done nothing to encourage the development of an adequate Australian fishing fleet. We must conduct a full scale review of our policy in Antarctica as well as of our policy towards the other members of the international community with respect to claims to exercise sovereign rights. When I say 'the international community', I mean not only those states which were the original signatories of the Antarctic Treaty; I mean the entire international community. We do not have to give up our claims, nor can we continue to say that we are only going to exercise some sort of superficial significance. The fact is that we have done comparatively little. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter that will be brought home very forcibly to us concerns the law of the sea negotiations. In those negotiations there has been recognition that those countries with the wealth and technology to exploit the resources of the high seas must, to some extent, share their portion or their good fortune with the less developed countries. That also applies whether we are talking about scientific research or resources. It is a matter of great regret at present, particularly to the Opposition, that the United States of America Administration has recently taken action which has seriously jeopardised the successful conclusion of a comprehensive law of the sea. So we have the problem that wealthy countries which have hitherto exercised exclusive competence over the protection, exploration and exploitation of the Antarctic continent, are likely to meet vigorous competition from many other countries on the basis that as they are poor and need resources, they ought to be involved. It is important that they do become involved. </PARA>
<PARA> We make great play of the question of the North-South dialogue and we are critical of the great disparity between rhetoric and the absence of any substantial move to assist developing countries. If we are really serious about looking for areas where we can in the medium and long term, as well as in the short term, produce a more equitable international economic order, then an acknowledgement of the right of the poorer countries to share in the marine and mineral resources wealth of the Antarctic would be a logical step. I believe that we should reconsider and revise our policy in this matter as a matter of urgency. We cannot continue to perpetuate the management of Antarctica by what is called a wealthy elite, particularly if we wish to ensure the continued existence of our influence in the area. I endorse entirely the objectives of the Antarctic Treaty and the convention that the Antarctic remain both a zone of peace and a zone of international co-operation. But it is short-sighted in the extreme not to realise that those objectives will be best promoted by extending the family of nations interested in the Antarctic and committed to its preservation rather than by limiting that family to the present wealthy countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make this point in relation to the law of the sea: In his second reading speech the Acting Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McVeigh) did not refer to the fact that when an international law of the sea convention is concluded, the Antarctic Treaty parties will be obliged to negotiate with the international authority established under that convention concerning that area of the high seas which lies south of 60 degrees. This problem may be only one or two years away, and it is very important. The points which I have made with respect to increased co-operation with the developing countries are important in this regard. We cannot expect a sympathetic hearing from the 140-odd countries which are not members of the Antarctic Treaty if we do not take a more forthright attitude with respect to their interests. We ought to be laying the groundwork for those negotiations now. It is essential that we actively review our policies in this regard because this Convention constitutes the first occasion on which the Antarctic Treaty parties have purported to act with effect beyond the traditional Antarctic zone delineated by the 60 degree south latitude. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to touch very briefly on what I consider to be one of the major reasons for which this Government has continually and traditionally not sought to introduce any reform into the electoral laws of this country. Last week the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) made available figures on expenditure by the various political parties on radio and television in Queensland during the 1980 election campaign. I will give the Parliament some idea of the expenditure of the various parties and a very firm indication as to why the Liberal and National parties will not entertain the idea of reform, why they will not have a public register of the people who donate to their parties and why they are afraid and not prepared to tell the people of Australia who is making massive donations to their parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will run quickly through the expenditure on television stations in Queensland at the last State election from the time of the issue of writs until the blackout of media coverage 48 hours before the election. On BTQ7, the Australian Labor Party spent $18,600; the Liberal and National parties spent $54,000. On QTQ9, the Liberal and National parties spent $115,000; the Labor Party did not spend anything. On TVQ0, the Liberal and National parties spent $100,000; the ALP spent $4,700. On RTQ7, the Liberal and National parties spent $19,000; the ALP spent $6,700. On SEQ8, the Liberal and National parties spent $35,000; the ALP spent $2,500. On DDQ10, the Liberal and National parties spent $26,000; the ALP spent nothing. On FNQ10, the Liberal and National parties spent $21,500; the ALP spent $6,000. On ITQ8, the Liberal and National parties spent $10,000; the ALP spent $3,200. On MVQ6, the Liberal and National parties spent $4,600; the ALP outspent them with a total of $5,400. On TNQ7, the Liberal and National parties spent $34,500; the ALP spent $12,500. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now compare the totals. In the Queensland election campaign, the Liberal and National parties spent on television alone-this figure does not include radio programs-approximately $419,000. The Labor Party, at the other end of the spectrum, was able to accumulate and spend $47,100. It is a fact of life that expenditure by political parties on election campaigns in this country has got completely out of hand. Recently we saw the allocation of the Winchester South coal lease. The companies involved are making massive donations to the campaign funds of the Liberal and National parties. Neither party is prepared or game to allow a list of the people who make political donations to their parties to be made available to the Australian public. They know that, if that were done, the Australian people would reject any system which allows these parties to receive the sorts of funds for which the figures have been made available to us. Those parties are then allowed to brainwash the public during the election campaign in terms of what policies are right and wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> What happens in Queensland is only the tip of the iceberg. What happened in the Federal election campaign was exactly the same. For every television commercial the Labor Party was able to purchase in Sydney where it has the most federal seats of any capital city, the Liberal Party had nine such commercials. It had nine times the expenditure of the Labor Party in Sydney. The Liberal Party and National Country Party during the last federal election campaign would have spent from their head offices alone nothing less than $5m. The people of Australia are entitled to know where that $5m came from and what the Liberal Party and the National Country Party Government have to do in return to get the same amount of money in 1983. Reform of the electoral laws and the media laws must be brought about so that all the political parties are able to present their points of view in a proper manner and so that the people of Australia know who is making the donations and who is able to manipulate and to formulate the policies of the Government. We are seeing, on the one hand, the handing out of leases for our natural resources and, at the other end of the street, we are seeing cheques handed over to the Liberal and National parties so that the leases are given to those people making the donations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My speech tonight concerns a constituent named John W.

They are: Australian Softwood Corporation Pty Ltd, Australian Softwood Forests (Overseas) Pty Ltd, Australian Softwood Forests Pty Ltd, Plantation Sixty-Five (No. 1) Pty Ltd, Plantation Sixty-Five Pty Ltd, Plantation Sixty-Six (No. 1) Pty Ltd, Plantation Sixty-Six Pty Ltd and Forestry Custodians Pty Ltd. Mr Newman has been to the address I have given. He has a supposed investment with the Australian Softwood Corporation Pty Ltd. He has been unable to obtain any satisfaction as to the current value of his investment or any other information whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Each year he receives a report on the letterhead of the company as to the development of the plantation. On 19 December 1978, he received a report from the company advising him that it had completed its final inspection of all nursery and plantation areas for the year 1978. The company was pleased to inform him that the development and maintenance of the plantation areas had been continued in accordance with good forestry practice. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We are satisfied that throughout the year all obligations of the Company under your agreement have been faithfully fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no mention whatsoever where the plantations are situated or any other particulars. On 21 December 1979 Mr Newman received a similar report. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on 28 November 1980, he received a letter from Forest Custodians Pty Ltd. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Grower, Re: You and Australian Softwood Corporation Pty Ltd Plantation No. 61. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt you will have seen the press reports of the bush fires which occurred on the South Coast during last month. </PARA>

<PARA> Unfortunately, the Plantation in which your trees are growing was in the path of the fire. The extent of the damage, which was extensive, is currently being assessed, and as soon as we are in a position to do so, we will let you have a report on the position; incorporating as well our recommendations. </PARA>

It is requested that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) investigate their activities for the benefit of people who have invested funds in what are supposedly softwood forestry companies. I commend this matter for the Minister's attention. In my opinion there is no doubt that many people will have lost the money they had invested in these companies. No particulars have been given in any of the correspondence about the location of the softwood forests. I feel that these are bogus companies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) today in a question to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) referred to a silent, generally unpublicised and certainly very bloody war which is taking place in Angola. The question drew the Prime Minister's attention to some of the terrible atrocities which are being committed in Angola by forces which are under the control of the South African Government. In particular, I refer to No. 32 Battalion of the South African Defence Force, one of 8 battalions of the South African armed forces, including a company of motorised tanks, currently inside Angola. No. 32 Battalion was formed in 1975 by the South African military intelligence. It is largely formed of mercenary white soldiers who have been recruited for the purpose of fighting this war in Angola, initially against the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-the MPLA-and now against the South West African People's Organisation, which is known as SWAPO, and the Angolan Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Manchester Guardian of 8 February 1981 includes a first-hand account of one of the mercenaries of what fighting in Angola has meant. Trevor Edwards, a soldier of fortune who previously fought in Zimbabwe, confirms the fact that the unit was formed in South Africa, that it receives official support from the authorities and that atrocities have been committed by the battalion in Angola. The general strategy of the battalion is clear, according to Edwards. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> Our main job is to take an area and clear it. We sweep through it and we kill everything in front of us, cattle, goats, people, everything. We are out to stop SWAPO and so we stop them getting into the villages for food and water. But half the time the locals don't know what's going on. We just beat them up and it gets out of hand. Some of the guys get a bit carried away. And SWAPO still get by us and cross the cut line between Angola and Namibia. It's not as if we are stopping them. </PARA>
<PARA>Edwards makes clear that in the fighting on a number of occasions the mercenaries have been involved in direct attacks on Angolan army and military installations, and the civilian population, attacks which are always denied by the South African Government. He mentions the particular example of the attack on Savate of May 1980, which was reported by the Angolan Government to the United Nations but denied by the South African Government as an attack involving South African forces. However, Edwards points out that this attack was unusual because it had a specific objective. The regular job of No. 32 Battalion was to go into Angolan bush with a couple of companies and spend four to five weeks clearing a designated area. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Some of it's pretty heavy. Sometimes we take locals for questioning. It's rough, we just beat them, cut them, burn them. As soon as we are finished with them, we kill them . . . Sometimes you have to do it with children to make the adults talk. There was a 12-year old boy. We wanted to know what was going on. We wanted his mother to talk, so we tied him up like a chicken, with his wrists behind his back, strapped to his ankles. Then we played water polo with him, put him in this kind of dam and pushed him about, let him sink. Every so often we took him out. He wouldn't cry, he just wet himself. The mother didn't tell us anything. In the end we just left him in the water to drown. </PARA>
<PARA>Of his colleagues, Edwards says:</PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to killing women, hanging them and things, there are some of them who laugh about it. They love killing. They take photographs of themselves with bodies. They don't see them as people, just as things that are there. </PARA>
<PARA>It would appear that South Africa is involved in a systematic policy of striking economic and military targets in Angola, despite official denials. It would seem that Angola's claims concerning South African military intervention are substantially correct, that is, that it is facing an undeclared war in which there are present in a proportion of the white population as many men as the United States of America committed to the Vietnam war at its height. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another reason why the Australian Government should seek to oppose publicly in the strongest terms the violation of Angolan territory. It is simply that this unofficial war is involving atrocities and violations of humanity which require the strongest possible condemnation from the international community. Why is Australia so silent? We have not hesitated to speak out on Afghanistan and more recently El Salvador, although what we have had to say about that country hardly relates to the violation of human rights. Perhaps we are not free to speak. A recent South African military mission to the United States is reported to have proposed a joint United States-South Africa force. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) claimed today that he was unaware of these facts. He should rapidly inform himself of them and speak out in the name of the fundamental human rights of the Angolan people. He should deplore the violation that has taken place of Angola's territorial integrity. He should inform himself of the United Nations resolution of 27 June 1980, which strongly condemns South Africa for its premeditated, persistent and sustained armed invasion of Angola, as well as its utilisation of Namibia as a springboard for armed intervention and destabil- isation of Angola. It demands that South Africa should withdraw forthwith all its military forces from Angola, cease all violation of its space and henceforth scrupulously respect Angola's sovereignty and territorial integrity. </PARA>

In the past 12 months, this persecution has accelerated and internal strife in Syria between the present Government and the fanatical Moslem brotherhood has progressed to a state of civil war with statements emanating from that organisation that it would massacre all Jews in Syria if it managed to seize control. It is a fact that only one Middle East government still holds Jews hostage in its land. None of the 5,000 Jews in Syria is permitted to leave and the abominable conditions under which these Jews must live constitute a permanent offence to the principle of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Jewish quarter in Damascus is not a ghetto in the nazi sense, but I am given to understand that entering it is like going back 500 years compared with the rest of the city. It consists of low houses with courtyards, is in a filthy condition and the municipality provides no cleaning services whatsoever. A number of reports coming out of Syria in the last year indicate that there has been a worsening of the situation of the Jews in Syria over and above the continuing ban on their right to emigrate. These are the Jews virtually forgotten by the free world, who live in a prison city. There are approximately 3,000 Jews marooned in Damascus living in a squalid rabbit warren of back alleys in the old part of the city. Life for them is harsh and brutal. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a dramatic worsening of the attitude of Syrian authorities to the country's 5,000 Jews. Jews are being beaten up regularly in many centres in Syria, including Damascus and Aleppo, and there has been a reimposition of restrictions on internal travel and transfer of property. In the Jewish quarter of Damascus, a policeman with a submachine gun is constantly on guard at the entrance to the area. The Jews of whom I speak are the descendants of Jewish communities which have been in Syria for centuries. Jews are closely watched by a network of informers and are not allowed to receive foreign visitors freely. The Jews would like to leave Syria but they are not allowed to emigrate and illegal emigration by any of the Jews would prompt a fierce reaction from the Government against those left behind. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall enumerate some of the restrictions which the Syrian Government imposes solely on Jews. Jews must not move more than 4 kilometres from their place of residence. Jews must carry special identity cards bearing the word 'Mussawi', which means Jew, in red letters. Jews are denied the right to vote. Jews may not be employed in the public service, in public institutions or in banks. They may not serve in the police or armed forces. Jews cannot obtain driving licences. Jews are not permitted to have telephones. Jews are subject to a 10 p.m. curfew. The possessions of deceased Jews are confiscated by the Government, and their heirs must then pay for the use of their property. In Kamishliye, all Jewish houses must bear a special distinguishing mark. Moslems are officially advised not to buy in Jewish shops, and government and military personnel are expressly forbidden to enter them. Mail of Jews is censored, and they are under constant police watch. </PARA>
<PARA> This despicable form of suppression and persecution must be condemned by all those who cherish freedom and the democratic way of life. I urge the Government to set up a committee of inquiry into the plight of Syrian Jewry along the same lines as this Parliament's inquiry into human rights in the Soviet Union. </PARA>

<PARA> This evening at a meeting of the Group we received the report on El Salvador of the Amnesty International secretariat in London dated 2 February 1981. That all-party Group expressed its wish that the two-page report be incorporated in Hansard. I will seek leave to incorporate that report at the end of my observations. </PARA>
<PARA> The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The human rights situation in El Salvador has deteriorated sharply in recent months . . . Peasants and young people appear to be particular targets. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that Red Cross clinics have been attacked by troops. It also points out that members of the Roman Catholic church and others helping refugees and victims of the civil fighting have been hampered in their work by the security forces. National police raided the legal offices of the Archbishopric of San Salvador 17 times in one week. Members of the El Salvador Human Rights Commission have been harassed, abducted and killed. The Commission had reportedly been accused by the President of El Salvador, Jose Duarte, of being anti-patriotic. The offices of the Commission were surrounded by troops on 18 January and the Commission has seen itself forced to close down. </PARA>
<PARA> Amnesty International fears that the current wave of extra judicial killings and disappearances will continue to escalate as Salvadorean security forces use the cover of civil warfare to carry out large scale killings of young people, peasants and others not shown to be involved in guerrilla activities. On this occasion I will not add my personal comments on the situation in El Salvador, but I would encourage all honourable members of the House to read the report. I seek leave to incorporate the report of Amnesty International on El Salvador. </PARA>

<PARA>AI Concerns in El Salvador</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The human rights situation in El Salvador has deteriorated sharply in recent months. Amnesty International is seriously concerned and fears a further increase in summary execution, torture and abduction by government forces as civil conflict continues between guerrillas and the government. Of some 8,000 Salvadorians estimated to have been killed during the past year, many are known to have been the victims of extrajudicial execution by the armed forces. Peasants and young people appear to be particular targets. Sources in the country say that nearly 3,300 peasants were among those killed for political reasons in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite government claims that those killed by its forces are guerrillas and guerrilla sympathisers many victims of torture and death at the hands of the security forces were not generally shown to have any direct involvement in armed guerrilla activity. </PARA>
<PARA> International attention was captured by the killing on 3 December 1980 of three nuns and a woman missionary, all United States nationals, reported to have been abducted by security forces the previous day. However, in the week after those killings, from 6 to 12 December, according to sources in El Salvador, 144 people were killed, 66 of them by uniformed members of the security forces. </PARA>
<PARA> On 17 December 1980, members of the National Guard raided the town of Cojutepeque in the department of San Salvador and killed eight leaders (names on attached list) of the Central Campesina Salvadorena (Salvadorian Peasants Organization) who were meeting to discuss plans for participation in the government's agrarian reform program. There have been similar attacks in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> There is evidence that young people are singled out because of their youth. On 10 January 1981, troops took 22 teen-agers from Mejicanos; all were later found dead, with marks showing that they had been tortured. An army spokesman said they died of bullet wounds in a confrontation with troops; but a doctor who examined 17 of the bodies said they had all been shot after dying. Five of the young women were unidentifiable because their faces had been erased. </PARA>
<PARA> AI has received reports that Salvadorian paramilitary squads regularly cross the border into Honduras to attack Salvadorian refugee camps. Inside El Salvador, church sources report that refugees have been taken from camps and killed. On 31 December 1980 soldiers from San Carlos garrison searched the Domus Mariae refugee centre in Mejicanos and took away Marcial Cruz, aged 18. He was later seen at the garrison, and on 9 January was found dead. </PARA>
<PARA> Red Cross clinics have been attacked: on 12 January, troops broke into a clinic in Chalatenango. They killed wounded people being treated there and abducted five young women aged from 14 to 22. On the same day, three men, members of the Baptist Church, were seized by security forces in San Salvador as they delivered provisions to the Red Cross. The whereabouts of all the people abducted in these two incidents are unknown. </PARA>
<PARA> Killings and 'disappearances' of foreign journalists, including journalist John Sullivan, United States citizen, who was abducted on 28 December, have been widely reported in the international media; but Salvadorian journalists have also been victims of the armed forces. On 15 January 1981, nine staff members of the newspaper El Independiente, including journalists Vida Cuadra and Francisco Ramirez Avila, were taken from the newspaper's offices by troops. The authorities deny that they are in detention. (On 25 January, the newspaper closed down and its director Jorge Pinto took refuge in the Mexican Embassy.)</PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Roman Catholic Church and others helping refugees and victims of the civil fighting have been hampered in their work by the security forces. The Archbishopric of San Salvador reported in mid-December that it had been forced to close its legal aid office (Socorro Juridico) because it had been raided 17 times in the previous week by the National Police. Even government offices have been subject to army raids. On 9 January, the publications department of the Education Ministry was raided by troops while it was printing leaflets with instructions for refugees; eight staff members, including the director of the department, were seized. Their whereabouts are unknown. Members of the El Salvador Human Rights Commission who witnessed the seizures have denied army allegations that subversive literature was found on the premises. </PARA>
<PARA> On 25 January, a leading member of the El Salvador Human Rights Commission, Victor Medrano, aged 29, was abducted from his home by plainclothes members of the National Police. Although he has been seen in the barracks of the National Police in San Salvador, authorities deny that he is in detention and there is very serious concern for his safety. Two other members of the same commission have been killed since the beginning of October last year. One was Maria Magdalena Enriquez, its press secretary who was found dead in a shallow grave about 20 miles from the capital. She was abducted on 3 October 1980 while shopping and appears to have been killed the day after her abduction. Witnesses con- firmed that two of the heavily armed men who detained Sra. Enriquez were uniformed members of the National Police. Representatives of the Junta (that headed the government of El Salvador until December 1980) however denied that police carried out the detention and stated that the government 'was not implicated' in the matter. The other member of the commission killed was Ramon Valladares Perez, who was shot dead on 26 October while driving a car in the capital. The El Salvador Human Rights Commission is an independent human rights monitoring group that provides both assistance to victims of human rights abuse and publicises their cases. The Commission's offices have been destroyed by bombings three times last year in the presence of the permanent police guard on the premises. The Commission had reportedly been accused by the president of El Salvador, Ing. Jose Napoleon Duarte, of being 'anti-patriotic' a few days before the abduction of Victor Medrano. The offices of the Commission were again surrounded by troops on 18 January and the Commission has seen itself forced to close down. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> People have been killed because of their association, or presumed association with peasant, labour or religious organizations, or with political parties or other organizations which do not actively support the present government. Although these killings took place against a background of conflict between government forces and guerrilla organizations, evidence reaching AI shows that many civilians not involved in guerrilla activity are being tortured and killed by the security forces. Most of the deaths have occurred after people were seized at their homes or places of work. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1980 the government of El Salvador repeatedly claimed that independent 'anti-communist' assassination squads beyond government control were responsible for these abductions and murders. However, evidence collated by AI from hundreds of individual cases proves the responsibility of the regular security forces for serious violations of human rights. By attributing detentions, torture and killings to groups beyond government control, the government of El Salvador seems to have sought a means of evading accountability for the extra-legal measures carried out by its own security forces. </PARA>
<PARA> AI fears that the current wave of extrajudicial killings and 'disappearances' will continue to escalate as the Salvadorian security forces use the cover of civil warfare to carry out large-scale killings of young people, peasants and others not shown to be involved in guerrilla activities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight in this debate there have been a number of contributions by various honourable members of the House on human rights matters in the broad. We heard a discussion on human rights matters in South Africa, Syria and now El Salvador. One of the most meaningful ways in which people can involve themselves in trying to do something and achieve something in this world in the area of human rights, I believe, is to belong to the organisation Amnesty International. It is for that reason that I rise to speak in this debate, also as an executive member of the Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International, to speak a little about the role of the organisation and to say something about some material on the subject of the organisation generally which was distributed recently to members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Amnesty International is a world-wide human rights movement which is independent of any government, political faction, ideology, economic interest or religious creed. It works for the release of men and women imprisoned anywhere for their beliefs, colour, ethnic origin or religion provided they have neither used nor advocated violence. These people are termed political prisoners, or prisoners of conscience. Amnesty International opposes torture and capital punishment in all cases and without reservation. It seeks observance throughout the world of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. It has groups in some 33 countries, and individual members in some 78 countries. People who belong to adoption groups-a special form of membership or collective membership-participate in trying to release three prisoners of conscience in countries other than their own, usually people who are chosen especially because they come from countries which are politically different. They usually find that they are advocating the release of prisoners who are held in countries of the Right as well as countries which may be regarded as being of the political Left, and others of the Third World. </PARA>
<PARA> Amnesty International has consultative status with the United Nations, and that is an important factor. It is financed by subscriptions and donations. It does not accept direct support from governments. In our report tonight from the Chairman of the Australian National Section, John Coombs, Q.C., we heard of the very difficult financial position of Amnesty International, relying as it does upon financial support from individuals throughout the world and not from governments and large financial bodies. It has to be acknowledged that operating in the United Kingdom is a very difficult task with exchange matters in the area of money working against it, and with the demands to pay its staff reasonable wages. It has a very large research staff of some 120 people in London collating information on prisoners of conscience. The Australian section wishes to be able to contribute significantly to those financial demands, but of course it has its own difficulties in that regard. But Australia is seen as a wealthy country and one which ought to be able to contribute significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> Members, of course, can look at the group and participate in it and supporting it as a worthwhile organisation. I draw the attention of all honourable members to the history of the Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International which I circulated this week. I will not ask for it to be incorporated in Hansard because it has been sent to all honourable members. In inviting their attention to it I invite them also to consider membership of the Group because that will enable them to participate in a worthwhile way in a genuine human rights organisation which is totally non-party political. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the adjournment debate tonight I wish to raise not the actual two-airline agreement, but some of the factors affecting both airlines. I have read with interest the Ansett Airlines of Australia position paper of 10 February 1980. Under the heading of 'Scheduling to Suit the Public', the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The system of airline scheduling by which aircraft from both airlines tend to depart at about the same time draws more criticism than any other aspect of domestic air transport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ansett Airlines decision to re-equip to an all Boeing jet fleet will lead to major improvements in an area that has irritated the public for many years.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> This fleet will give Ansett Airlines great flexibility and the ability to provide the public with frequency of service, a major requirement of Australian passengers . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Any serious study of scheduling shows that it is complex and that the reasons for parallel scheduling have been, and are, very real. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian travelling public has shown over the years that it prefers to fly at certain times. </PARA>
<PARA>These are very fine words, but I want to give a few examples of the absolute stupidity and rigidity of parallel scheduling to the disadvantage of the public, and apparently approved by the present two-airline agreement. For instance, during daylight saving times, flight times are adjusted in Queensland to retain the southern State schedules. That does not say much for the retention of preferred travelling time for Queenslanders and their convenience. Again, for the past three years, on a Friday flight, both airlines schedule a Sydney to Brisbane flight to land at the Brisbane airport at 9.15 a.m. At exactly the same time, 9.15 a.m., two flights to Mackay depart, one from each airline, thus making a Brisbane connection from the south impossible at that time. Surely 9.15 a.m. is not the preferred critical public flying time for passengers of both airlines. Why not make it 9.30 a.m. or just a little later?</PARA>
<PARA> In the 1980 winter schedules, it was possible on Friday to get an aircraft later in the morning, about 11 a.m. Again, a choice of either airline was available. All of a sudden in 1981 both airlines decided that the public preferred time was for a 1.35 p.m. Brisbane departure, and neither airline fly the late morning flight. It is not a matter of preferred time. It is a matter of the two airlines ghosting each other so that one does not take an advantage over the other, but both must suffer in viability and economics in not giving the public a choice of time. It appears to me that the two computers of the airlines have got themselves hitched together or married to get the scheduled times, and that man is not capable of programming the real human considerations into those schedules. </PARA>
<PARA> I do ask that the airlines do not treat the public so contemptuously, or as fools. Parallel scheduling is not necessary and, under the terms I have outlined above, it is not in the public interest. I understand that the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham) has suggested that the airlines alternate each week or each month or each year, so that if there is a preferred travelling time, then each airline can get that advantage equally and allow the public an additional or alternative travelling time. While I am on the subject of air travel, could I raise yet again the subject of allowing cigarette smokers on flights--</PARA>
