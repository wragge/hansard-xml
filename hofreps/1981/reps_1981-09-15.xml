<PARA> That we deplore the closure of all the Community Youth Support Schemes as they provide an essential welfare service to the young unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA> CYSS provides a tangible community support for youth suffering the emotional, social and economic effects of long-term unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the decision to abandon CYSS is a mistake demonstrating a lack of awareness on behalf of the Government. CYSS helps the unemployed to help themselves.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Victoria respectfully showeth.</PARA>
<PARA> That the serious youth unemployment problem is a direct result of the community's failure to create sufficient jobs.</PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances the decision to abolish Community Youth Support Schemes (CYSS) is a socially retrogressive step. The CYSS Projects provide valuable support services and work training for many young unemployed.</PARA>

There is the even more frightening prospect that many more young people will give up hope of obtaining a job, become idle and even contemplate suicide.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The proposal to introduce fees for higher and second degrees will mean that access to post-graduate and recurrent education will be limited to the rich; Australian research and ability to cope with technological change will suffer; this proposal must be seen as a step in the direction of the introduction of fees for all tertiary students.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The proposed introduction of a loans scheme for students will mean graduating with a heavy debt or being denied a tertiary education if loans are refused because a student is seen as a ''poor risk'' particularly affecting women and those doing non-vocational courses, only the rich will be able to get a tertiary education without course restrictions and the burden of indebtedness.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In regard to the proposal to restrict eligibility for TEAS and the foreshadowing of reviewing TEAS levels only in the light of the availability of loans, it should be noted that any further downgrading of TEAS, which is already inadequate, can only further limit access to education.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The proposed restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance to those needing qualifications for employment will severely restrict access to a full high school education and necessary bridging education to tertiary education for those who left school early.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The proposal not to fund 30 Colleges of Advanced Education if they are not rationalised is an attack on teacher education. This attack will create teacher shortages in the mid 1980s, restrict access to education now and endanger the future quality of teaching available to Australian children.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) post-secondary tuition fees not be introduced for any courses or for any category of students;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the TEAS scheme be extended so as to more fully meet the real financial needs of students.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that a comprehensive loans scheme not be introduced.</PARA>

<TITLE>Privacy and Personal Information</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: Paragraphs 107 and 108 of the Privacy and Personal Information discussion paper number 14, brought down by the Law Reform Commission in June 1980, undermines the family unit and the authority of parents, which is the Christian basis of our society, by proposing that between 12 and 16 years, a child should be entitled to object to disclosure of information to a parent.</PARA>
<PARA> It is your petitioners sincere belief that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) An adolescent between the ages of 12 and 16 is not at a mature enough stage of life to decide whether or not the disclosure of information to a parent will be in the best interests of the adolescent.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) As a record keeper has no responsibility for the child, and as his moral standards may be different to those of a parent, he should not be permitted to come between child and parent.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) A parent has a unique position which may enable him-her to perceive a situation that the record keeper does not. The parent must therefore be aware of the problem if remedial action is to be taken, and has the right to guide the child in the direction he-she feels fit.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Members of the House of Representatives will reject the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission and find some other means to protect children from the excessive abuse of some parents.</PARA>

<PARA> 3. The club industry is entirely within the private sector and makes a contribution to the government in taxes of various kinds.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The club industry has a need to sustain an appropriate level of turnover and growth, to make profit, and to sustain and improve the level of employment.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The club industry of Australia is gravely concerned at published reports that the Government intends to increase excise charges on beer in the forthcoming Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Sales of beer constitute the major source of income of most of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The very steep rises in beer excise in 1975 and 1978 severely retarded the growth of the Australian club industry.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. Any further increases in excise on beer in the 1981 Budget would further retard the industry at a time when growth is essential to maintaining economic viability and the ability to serve the constantly growing needs of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Such is its significance as a community requirement, beer occupies a place on the Consumer Price Index, and any alteration to its cost to the community would have an inflationary effect.</PARA>
<PARA> 10. Any increase in excise would result in and force the club industry to pass on such increases to the consumer by way of higher prices for beer.</PARA>
<PARA> 11. Higher excise would be only the starting point for an upward spiral in beer prices because of the presence of other factors, such as State Licence Fee taxes, which are directly linked to excise rates.</PARA>
<PARA> 12. The club industry of Australia already is gravely handicapped by heavy excise and other tax imposts, its growth is at a standstill; and, inevitably must decline if beer excise is increased.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Is it a fact that the Budget strategy hinges very much on a continuing huge capital inflow this year exceeding that of last year? Is it a fact that that huge capital inflow is necessary to cover forecast larger deficits in the balance of trade and current account which go well beyond equipment inflows associated with resource development? Is it also a fact that a sudden large contraction of that capital inflow will generate serious balance of payments problems with domestic consequences that cannot be resolved by simple domestic expansion because of the worsening balance of trade deficit and the aggravation that expansion would have on that? Does the Deputy Prime Minister therefore realise that his statements yesterday and this morning signal the very real possibility of this development? Was he warning that the Government is now preparing to jettison the strategy laid down in the Budget after only one month? What alternative means of economic management does the Government have in mind especially to avoid further deterioration of the balance of trade and on current account and at the same time avert a severe domestic contraction? If he is not prepared to discuss these matters why did he make a statement last night and this morning with such serious implications for domestic economic management?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think all Australians will be very pleased that the Government has had the strategy it has had to encourage investment in resource developments in this country. As a result of the confidence that people have, we have a very large amount of private capital inflow for these developments. At the same time it is helping to maintain a strong balance of payments situation. It is very fortunate that the Government has had this strategy by which we can maintain high economic activity and the well-being of Australians and improve employment opportunities. Last night I addressed an audience in Melbourne where I presented the export awards. That was the last occasion that these awards will be presented as the Export Now campaign is concluding. I was emphasising the point that during the Export Now campaign we endeavoured to make Australians more aware of the need for and the importance of exports. It is only by maintaining a healthy level of exports that this country can continue to progress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the figures for the last year show that we cannot be complacent. Imports have risen significantly while our exports have risen only marginally. Although the campaign is concluding it is vital that every effort be made by Australians to continue improving our export performance, particularly in the manufacturing area where there has been a very substantial improvement as a result of the Government's program. I hope that all Australians will not idly stand by and imagine that exports just happen; there needs to be encouragement and recognition. I am proud of what the Government has achieved.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to that question is no. The Federal Government, through the Reserve Bank of Australia, has power-if it seeks to use it-to control interest rates charged by trading and savings banks in Australia. The question of whether government should seek by fiat to control interest rates is, of course, a different issue. The power to control building society interest rates in Australia rests with State governments. This, therefore, invites some comparison of the rhetoric and performance of State governments-not the least, of course, the New South Wales Government-on the issue of interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the past couple of months I do not think anyone has seen a greater level of political grandstanding than the performance of the New South Wales Premier on the subject of interest rates. He has repeatedly said that his Government is leading the fight against higher interest rates in Australia. Yet every single move by the Federal Government to take pressure off interest rates in Australia has been condemned by Mr Wran. He condemned the borrowing restrictions imposed at the last Loan Council meeting; he condemned the reduction in the Budget deficit. Yet, when it suits his own political convenience, he justifies an increase in building society interest rates in New South Wales by the very same argument that the Federal Government has quite properly used to justify allowing bank interest rates to rise. The argument simply is that if one holds down interest rates in certain areas too far and too long, available funds for housing will dry up completely.</PARA>

Has the possibility of providing $200,000 both from State and Commonwealth revenues been floated with the local authorities in Rockhampton, Ipswich and Redcliffe? What was the response?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that I have had some discussion with the Queensland Minister and it is true that that discussion touched upon the subject of the Community Youth Support Scheme. I might say that, since Budget day, I have had a large number of discussions with a wide ranging number of people about this subject. The Queensland Minister has made a proposal. That proposal, for all I know, may be pursued at the appropriate place, which is the labour Ministers conference in Darwin later this week and with respect to that proposal, as with respect to other proposals, the Government of course is quite happy to listen to what people have to say and to suggest. The only problem is that some people seem to think that, simply because a suggestion is made and an undertaking is given to consider it, the suggestion has been accepted. The Government's position with respect to this matter has been made plain. The situation is that the Budget decision, being a Budget decision, will not be changed. The Government has also made it very plain that it has embarked upon a course which is presently continuing, namely, a course of explaining to CYSS project officers and participants the skills, training and work experience programs that the Government has. Young unemployed people have been encouraged to take part in those programs. We have also made it plain that if, as a result of our investigations, it appears there are some young unemployed people who are not able to be catered for by those programs, the Government, of course, consistent with the care and concern that it has shown over the years for young unemployed people, will look at what measures, if any, have to be put in place to cover those young people not covered by the programs we have.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is the Minister aware of the situation at Vickers Cockatoo Dockyard where there is not only a strike over shorter hours but also about 700 of the company's employees cannot get to work on the island because of a ban by the Firemen and Deckhands Union of New South Wales which has led to the withdrawal of ferry services? Can the Government and in particular can you, Mr Minister, do something about helping these 700 employees to get to work?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1288" SPEAKER="Viner The Hon R.I." NAMEID="EE6" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="STIRLING" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EE6">Mr VINER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the situation at Vickers Cockatoo Dockyard, and it is a deplorable one as the facts outlined by the honourable member clearly indicate. Last night my colleagues, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Administrative Services, and I met with the management of the dockyard. We were told of the deplorable situation facing that company and its employees. The House will be aware that on Cockatoo Island there are substantial Commonwealth assets and that at that place work on substantial defence contracts is carried out, notably at the moment the building of a fleet underway replenishment ship and the refitting of submarines. The House will be conscious of the vital national interest which the Commonwealth has in the future of the company and the works being carried out there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the House would also want to know of the concern of the Commonwealth that 700 employees who want to work are being prevented from getting to their place of employment by deliberate industrial action by the Firemen and Deckhands Union which has placed a ban on the ferries which ferry the men to work. We are simply not prepared to stand by and see that situation continue. The Government has considered the matter and, as a result, I was able to notify the company this morning that we are prepared to make available naval vessels to ferry those people to their employment. The planning has already been put in train by my colleague the Minister for Defence. So, within the next couple of days, the necessary arrangements will have been made to enable those 700 people to get to work.</PARA>
<PARA> I should add that work at Cockatoo Dockyard is carried out not only for the Commonwealth but also for the New South Wales Government. Power station equipment is repaired and maintained by Vickers for the New South Wales Government. Yet not one jot of help has been offered by the New South Wales Government to this company or to the 700 employees who have been left stranded by the industrial action that has taken place. So this Government is prepared to act firmly, resolutely and quickly when obviously the New South Wales Government is not so prepared.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For a long while the Government has not actively encouraged trade with South Africa but it has not sought to prevent trade with South Africa by any positive means. I think it is worth noting also that trade figures of many countries within Africa and South Africa are also of some significance, perhaps of much more significance to their economies than would be those trade figures with us. I think it ought to be understood, because of the racial policies of South Africa, that the international community has taken certain decisions. This country has applied assiduously and conscientiously certain decisions made within the Commonwealth in relation to sport and it will continue to do so. But there would be no point in Australia adopting an attitude in relation to trade, as a one-off example, even if it were an appropriate mechanism to use. It would have to be something taken as a result of international action, not just action by a country such as Australia. I hope that the honourable gentleman is not suggesting that Australia, of all nations in the world, should conduct trade embargoes against South Africa.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports of the kind referred to by the honourable gentleman. Last week, on 8 September, in Estimates Committee E some questions were asked of me on this subject. Because of these developments, since last week I have examined the file from its inception. Therefore I think it is appropriate that I place some facts on the record so as to show the circumstances surrounding preparation of the case and the state of unpreparedness when I assumed responsibility for the portfolio. The Government made its decision to take action to deregister the BLF on 17 February. No prior consultation was taken by the then Minister with employer organisations. The first meeting with employers was held on 24 February and another was held on 4 March. At the time an oral opinion had been obtained from counsel at the Melbourne Bar. His later written opinion, dated 9 February, put the possible time scale for completion of the case between April and 'well into 1981'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Officers from the Attorney-General's Department were seconded on 20 February to work with officers from my Department on the preparation of the case. On 8 April advice from my Department to the then Minister was given which showed that at that time there were no statements from private employers in a state to permit drafts of affidavits. The only statements then provided were from New South Wales. My predecessor resigned on 15 April and I was sworn in next day. On 16 April the Attorney-General obtained written advice from a senior officer of his Department seconded to my Department to work on the case. That advice was passed on to me.

<PARA>Attorney-General</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The purpose of this minute is to report on the progress of the preparation for the abovementioned proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Attorney-General's officers were seconded on 20 February 1981 to work on this matter; the relevant Cabinet decision to commence proceedings to de-register the BLF having been made on 17 February 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Progress in the preparation of the case has been very slow. The principal reason for this has been the delay in support from the private building industry. You will recall that the industry sought and obtained certain assurances from the Government to protect companies from loss due to industrial action after de-registration.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. With the exception of one witness's statement taken in Canberra on 2 April 1981, statements from private industry sources have only started coming in since last Friday, 10 April 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. As of today, 26 statements have been received. Of the 26, 17 are from private industry sources and the balance are statements from officers of the Department of Housing and Construction. The 26 statements consist of 4 from the ACT, one from Queensland, 10 from Victoria and 11 from South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. The most co-operative company to date has been Costains. Lengthy statements are currently being taken from Costains employees in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Notwithstanding the fact that there is now a flow of statements coming in, I anticipate that we are still some time away from instituting proceedings. There are several reasons for this, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The events the subject of the statements are more complex than I originally anticipated. The main area of relevant BLF conduct is the imposition of bans in support of industrial claims. In the case of Costains, at one site on one day, the BLF imposed 20 black bans on various areas of work. It will be appreciated that preparation of statements of this kind is a lengthy process because one statement might relate to as many as 50 incidents of relevant BLF conduct.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The process of settling the statements is being affected by the fact that the various State Master Builders Associations are insisting that all statements be pro- cessed through the Association. This creates delay and also it means that witnesses cannot be directly contacted except through the relevant trade association. I have asked the Department of Industrial Relations to seek agreement from the Master Builders' Association that at least in the settling stages of affidavits we be permitted to deal with witnesses direct and that the Master Builders Associations be given copies of the final affidavits before they are sworn.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) I expect that the document instituting proceedings will be supported by 80-120 affidavits. It will take a considerable amount of time for the lawyers to process and proof these affidavits.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. I consider that these proceedings are unlikely to be instituted before the end of May 1981. We may be able to institute earlier if the MBA red tape can be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. A very important step prior to the institution of proceedings will be to obtain Counsel's considered opinion on whether the evidence available gives the Minister reasonable prospects of success. We must face the possibility that Counsel may advise that there is insufficient evidence to support these proceedings. However, I must say that the statements received to date are starting to give a picture of very disruptive and costly action by the BLF in support of claims, particularly by means of black bans.</PARA>
<PARA> 10. Once the proceedings have been instituted, I expect there will be a delay of some 4 to 6 weeks before the date of trial. The Court will give the BLF a reasonable amount of time to prepare its defence. I anticipate that the trial would last of the order of 40 hearing days. In these circumstances, allowing for a period of time for the Court to consider and make its decision, I think it is unlikely that the BLF would be de-registered before November 1981.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government has not re-examined in recent times the commitment to the peacekeeping force in Namibia. But there is no reason to assume that that commitment would not stand if those troops were still welcome to both the parties concerned. That, obviously, is a prerequisite of the components of a peacekeeping force. I know that there has been some discussion and talk about linkage of Cubans in Angola. I hope the honourable gentleman would object to Cubans just as much as he would object to other people being in Angola. I know that there has been some suggestion of linking that problem to the question of progress in relation to Namibia. But the information available to me leads me to believe that the contact group would not see it as being a practical step to achieve any kind of linkage. I do not think that is real life; I doubt whether the other members of the contact group see that as being real life. I doubt very much whether the United States is pursuing it with any great vigour. It is a question that was raised some time ago, as I understand it, in the exploration and development of the policy under this administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It ought to be stated, I think, that Australia's policy in relation to Namibia has been a consistent one over a long time. We believe there ought to be independence under the appropriate United Nations resolutions. If anything can be done in a diplomatic way or through the United Nations to support the appropriate United Nations resolutions which are supported by the contact group, which includes not only the United States but also Canada, Britain, France and West Germany, which have in a sense the responsibility for applying the decisions of the United Nations, I do not see any real difference between the view taken by Australia and that taken by those other major countries which have that responsibility. Quite obviously, when the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting takes place in two or three weeks time, heads of government will be interested not only in the progress of whatever has happened in the special session of the United Nations but also in whatever reports the two members of the contact group which will be present, Britain and Canada, can give. Whatever reactions the heads of government, as a whole, might want to make no doubt will be significantly influenced by those reports, by what occurs and by whether there is evidence of progress in achieving independence in Namibia, which is something that many countries, including the contact group, take very seriously. They believe too long a time has passed without progress being made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One thing that one has to say about the Australian Council of Trade Unions is that it is certainly stubborn about its point of view on uranium. Indeed, I think it is displaying a great deal of ignorance. With its head in the sand attitude it is not facing up to the realities of the situation. It does not reflect the opinion of many sections of the trade union movement which are involved in the development of uranium. Certainly, those involved in the construction, operation, transport and servicing side of the industry all see the virtues of more employment opportunities, increasing wealth for Australia and providing the needy world with energy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The facts of the matter are that there are 478 nuclear power stations either operating or under construction around the world. A recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report stated that, by the year 2000, 29 per cent of the OECD countries' electric power generation will come from nuclear sources, and that the world will become more and more dependent on nuclear energy to meet the well being of mankind. To say that that development is not taking place is nonsense. The Australian uranium companies have firm contracts to supply 55,000 tonnes of uranium worth approximately $4,000m. More contracts are being entered into progressively. I hope that, as time goes by, we will see more developments taking place in this country. Knowing that there is a substantial program for nuclear development around the world, the requirements for uranium during the 1980s decade will double. I hope that Australia will play a major role in fulfilling the world's requirement of this vital sort of energy.</PARA>

I ask the Deputy Prime Minister: Is it a fact that Australia's deteriorating export competitiveness leading to a very large balance of trade deficit of which he expressed so much concern last night and again today is substantially due to a 10 per cent revaluation last year? Is it a fact that a revaluation of that order is equal to an across the board cut in tariffs in excess of 40 per cent? Is it a fact that huge capital inflows of the order forecast in this year's Budget Papers would imply further revaluations at least of the order of last year's 10 per cent revaluation?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is an element of sour grapes in the Leader of the Opposition's question. The fact is that we have economic progress. We have capital inflow developing resources. It is because of this that we have a very strong balance of payments situation. If that has led to a slight increase in the value of Australian currency, I think Australians ought to be very proud that we have a strong and stable currency which is helping to ease the inflationary pressures. No doubt this is one of the reasons why there is a high rate of imports coming into the country. If the Leader of the Opposition is so concerned about helping our export industries he might lend a hand to trying to resolve some of the industrial disputes-particularly those on the waterfront, which are disrupting exports from this country. I could not think of a more valuable contribution that the Leader of the Opposition could make than getting into this area and seeing that that situation is overcome. One of the big cost areas for the Australian economy is the loss of working hours through industrial trouble. We know that the Australian Labor Party is really the trade unions' party. It is muzzled by them. It cannot do anything about it. If it did more in this area, of course, we would be able to help our export industries.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Are we to have a continuing motor vehicle manufacturing industry under this coalition Government or not? That is the question raised by the Labor Opposition in this debate today because there is enormous uncertainty about it. If we had a Labor national government-and the sooner we do the better, let me state-the answer to that question would be a resounding yes. We definitely will and must have a continuing motor vehicle manufacturing industry in this country. Under the Liberal and National Country Party coalition, the future is uncertain. The Government is fighting between its dries and its wets-between its free traders and its protectionists. The future for hundreds of thousands of workers is uncertain. Investment plans are halted. Jobs are being lost at a time of tragically high unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not just the future of the big five manufacturers which is at stake during this time of grave uncertainty. I am not referring just to the worries of GMH, Ford, Nissan, Toyota and Mitsubishi. It is the future of scores of component parts manufacturers and the tens of thousands of workers they employ whose livelihoods are in jeopardy. It goes beyond this. There is the steel industry, the glass industry, the tyre rubber industry, the forging industry-the list is endless. The ramifications of hurting this motor vehicle manufacturing industry are enormous. The industry is truly the engine of our manufacturing sector in general. Damage to this industry has a multiplier effect. Thousands of others indirectly involved are damaged also. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, there are the regional implications. Adelaide is the Detroit of Australia. It is immensely dependent on this industry. At the 1976 census 8.9 per cent of its work force was involved in motor manufacturing. Geelong is also dependant on it, with 8.5 per cent of its population dependent on the industry, as are Albury-Wodonga and Melbourne. Indeed, the people of Sydney, Brisbane, Ballarat and Launceston, to mention just a few other places, would be sorely affected if they lost the jobs directly and indirectly dependent on the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me state the Australian Labor Party's attitude on this sensitive, highly labour-intensive industry. I have already stated that we are firmly committed to a continuing motor vehicle manufacturing industry. Our starting point is the need for jobs in this country-about 2 1/2 million of them at least in the 1980s. Let me just tell the House how I arrive at that figure. With the hidden unemployed, there are about 500,000 people wanting jobs right now. The demographic work done shows that if the rate of immigration remains at present levels-there are plenty of pressures for that rate to be increased-there will be a net increase of 1.3 million in the work force in the 1980s. So already we see the need for 1,800,000 new jobs in Australia in the 1980s. We can add to that the conservative figure of 700,000 new jobs to replace those phased out because of technological change in the 1980s, changes which must happen, which must be adopted, so that we can remain competitive and secure. Phasing out those extra jobs means creating new jobs; and 700,000 new jobs at least will be required. That brings us to a figure of 2 1/2 million new jobs required in this country in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> We of the Australian Labor Party are certain that only by stimulating the manufacturing sector will we create the conditions for the establishment of those 2 1/2 million new jobs. Of course, not all the jobs will come from manufacturing. Most of them will come from the services sector. But the services sector is very dependent on people being employed in more basic pursuits like manufacturing. We cannot rely on mining or agriculture for all the necessary basic pursuits, so we have to get the stimulus from elsewhere. We must, I repeat, rely heavily on manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> Why can we not rely on mining and our resource-based industries? The reason is that they are not labour-intensive. This is not to say that they are not important. Of course, we must encourage them. But from the projects that we know are coming on line in the 1980s, from those published documents of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Trade and Resources and from other works that have fallen off the backs of trucks, we can be certain that these resource-based ventures will be responsible for creating about 10 per cent to 15 per cent at the most of the 2 1/2 million jobs we need. So we return to manufacturing. In particular, we return to the engine of our manufacturing sector-the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We of the Labor Party are committed to its survival. Our challenge is to answer the questions: What can we do to make it more competitive and more secure? What can we do to decrease relatively the prices of cars so that any buyer resistance that exists today will be ended? That is our aim. One thing is certain: We must not behave like our conservative political opponents have behaved. We must give the industry an assured future. We must end the uncertainty that they have created. A starting point is to repudiate straight away that recommendation of the Industries Assistance Commission's draft report which implies that this sector can survive, in the early years anyway before it has been restructured, without quotas. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us learn from Europe and the United States with their vastly greater populations and scale economies. The motor vehicle manufacturing industries in the United States and the European Economic Community cannot survive without direct government intervention. In their cases, voluntary restraints on imports are used, preserving for their home products a far larger share of their home markets than applies under our 80-20 quota system in our small country of 14 million people. In other words, in spite of the big differences in size between us and them, with all the scale economy benefits in their favour-not ours-the United States of America and the European Economic Community preserve for their home products a greater percentage than the 80 per cent that we in Australia preserve for our home products. We must not close our eyes to the fact that these quotas have hidden tariff equivalent. But that equivalent is closer to 120 per cent than the 60 per cent recommended in the draft report of the IAC. If we accepted the IAC draft report recommendations to adopt initially a 60 per cent tariff rate-admittedly the report says that it will drop even further later-our shores would be swamped with Japanese cars. We must give that nation credit for the fact that it is enourmously efficient-with its three shifts, its robots, and its better industrial relations. By one means or another Japan can export cars into this country under any tariff barrier. All five of our motor manufacturing companies would be swamped and together they would subside. In our view Australian's motor manufacturing industry would be damaged enormously and quickly. We in the Australia Labor Party believe that the 80-20 quota arrangement for the foreseeable future is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> Before leaving that subject let me state that any abandonment of this quota policy which led to greater imports of motor cars would bring benefits to the Australian consumer of only a temporary nature. As our motor industry became devastated from reduced tariffs the imported cars would be relatively cheaper for only a short period. Importers do not administer a perfect free market. Imported car prices would increase to such a level that we would wonder where are the benefits of eliminating our motor vehicle manufacturing industry. I am informed that this happened in Sweden in relation to its textiles and clothing industry. That country is now busily re-establishing a home-based textile and clothing sector at enormous cost after wastefully allowing its previous industry to be eliminated in the name of a non-existent, free trade, perfect competition system. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to a continuation of the quota system in the foreseeable future, until restructuring takes place, we believe that the local content plan must continue. We will not commit ourselves to particular ingredients of this plan until we have seen the IAC final report. There is not a lot of room for change. Some changes must be made to the export complementation scheme to make sure, for instance, that only locally added value is included in the credits allowed. That local content plan is vital for the continuing activity of our component parts manufacturing industry. The Australian Labor Party is committed to its healthy survival. </PARA>
<PARA> Incidentally, we should not get too carried away with the idea that our industry is unduly inefficient and uncompetitive. It takes an average Australian worker 22.3 weeks of earnings to pay for an Australian car. Figures for other comparable countries are as follows: Sweden 29.9 weeks; France 30.7; Britain 42; Japan 17.2; and the United States 17.6. In that comprehensive list Australia is shown to be more efficient than all but Japan and the United States. But we are not resting on our laurels and we do not intend to do that. We seek the greatest possible economies of scale in order to achieve the greatest efficiency, productivity and competitiveness. That is what Labor's policies lead to. We would have preferred to achieve this by encouraging standardisation of parts manufacture; in other words, the five assemblers using common parts. But the Government and the majority of the industry now have gone in another direction for scale economies, namely, the use of export complementation. So much water has gone under the bridge and so much investment has been based on the complementation scheme that it is very difficult now responsibly to reject it without creating enormous uncertainty and loss of jobs. But we, on this side of the House, will monitor the scheme very carefully, making sure that transfer pricing is rejected, and that only a discounted value of imports is allowed in return for the exports we generate. </PARA>
<PARA> A major area of difference between us and our conservative opponents is in the government machinery that we believe is vital for achieving the continued managed change needed in this sector. It requires close government-business partnership. That is why we have advocated the establishment of an automotive industry authority to examine constantly the tariff quota situation, to eliminate transfer pricing, to monitor and regulate any change from local to overseas component sourcing, to seek to achieve more standard parts manufacturing between the five big companies, and so on. We hope that our automotive industry authority could go further and, by one means or another, achieve such mergers to reduce, to all intents and purposes, our five present companies to at least three when it comes to the manufacturing of the various types and models of cars in Australia. Preferably it would be better to get down to two companies in order to get those scale economies for competitiveness. Ours is not a status quo approach; it is a definite approach with definite objectives, an unashamedly managed change interventionist approach. We want to achieve those objectives in that way. Above all, we want a more expansionary budgetary and monetary policy so that consumers have funds in their pockets to buy cars and other products. All of this contrasts with the uncertainty of our political opponents as they continue their fights between the dries and the wets. The Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Wage pressure and threatened inflation will be countered by tariff and quota cuts in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a quote from the Australian of 21 August 1981. The Australian of 31 July 1981 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Liberal (Senator John Watson) hits Party free trade lobby. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde): 'Is that a good quote?'</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Hyde" NAMEID="9W4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AV4">Mr HURFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a bad one, he says. This just shows the differences among government members which cause the enormous uncertainties and this is the subject of this matter of public importance today. Another quotation states: 'New references to the IAC on industry protection and assistance'. We have had two new references in the last month or so which have created enormously greater uncertainty. Business Review of 18 July 1981 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 'Treasury Chief John Stone believes his PM, Malcolm Fraser, has made a fundamental and dangerous mistake in international economic policy . . . If Stone is right, industry could be considerably changed.'</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>For manufacturers who depend on protection assistance, the fulfilment of Stone's predictions that Malcolm Fraser is going to be pressured by our neighbours into tariff reform, would carry vast consequences. This is why Fraser's push on the North-South issue, which to many Australians appears esoteric, should be taken seriously by business. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) was reported in Hansard of 26 August as having said:</PARA>
<PARA> The car industry, like some other industries, receives favours from the Australian people far in excess of what it produces. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish I had time for more quotes from the honourable member for Moore. To cap it all off, on 25 August the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) whether he was prepared to give an assurance that there would be no reduction in protection over the next few weeks. The Minister merely answered 'no', without giving the industry some assurance to end the uncertainty. Apparently the car owners association has a copy of these IAC reports but anybody else interested in this industry does not have them. I call on the Government to end the wasteful speculation, to end the era of confusing statements and to take note of this matter of public importance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), like myself, represents a South Australian electorate. Therefore one can understand why he makes some professions of concern about the future prosperity of the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. That is a concern that I share with him. It is important, especially for South Australia, that the motor vehicle industry has a future of prosperity. That industry has important regional considerations for South Australia, both in terms of investment and employment. A significant proportion of employment in manufacturing industry in South Australia is contained in the motor vehicle industry, more specifically the plants of Mitsubishi Australia Ltd, General Motors-Holden's Ltd and various component manufacturers. Therefore it is important that any decisions taken with regard to the future of that industry are taken with great care and adequate consultation and consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is exactly what the present Government has been doing. That is, of course, in marked contrast to the approach of the Australian Labor Party. Unfortunately, in this matter of public importance, which the honourable member for Adelaide has raised on behalf of the Labor Party, the Party has again revealed its notorious trait of sacrificing national and regional interests in the pursuit of political expediency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party well knows the established and appropriate procedures which this Government has for dealing with the reports of the Industries Assistance Commission. The Government has consistently pursued that process in dealing with the IAC report on post-1984 protection arrangements for motor vehicle manufacturing. In contrast, the Labor Party and its spokesmen such as the honourable member for Adelaide, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) and others, through their public statements and questions which they have asked of Ministers in this Parliament, have implied that a decision ought to be made immediately. Hasty ill-considered decisions were the hallmark of the Labor Party when it was in government during the Whitlam era from 1972 to 1975. In contrast, the Fraser Government is determined to give adequate consideration to all the issues involved in this important matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, when we listened to the speech of the honourable member for Adelaide today, we did not hear much that was of relevance to the words contained in the matter of public importance. It is timely to remind the House that those words are:</PARA>
<PARA> The damaging uncertainty created in the motor vehicle manufacturing industry by the confusing statements of Government spokespersons. </PARA>
<PARA>It was only in the last minute and a half of his remarks that the honourable member for Adelaide referred to any statements of any Government spokespersons at all. For the rest of his speech he completely ignored the substance of the matter of public importance that he has put to this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not unusual as my colleague the honourable member for Barker remarks. The honourable member for Adelaide talked about anything but statements made by government spokespersons. The statements that he did pull out in that last minute and a half did not reveal any conflict in statements made by government spokesmen at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me return to the subject of the motor vehicle industry and try to get some relevance into the debate. The present motor vehicle manufacturing plan applies until the end of 1984. Beyond that the Government has to take decisions as to what is an appropriate level of protection to be applied to the industry. In accord with that, in early 1979, it asked the IAC to conduct an inquiry and to provide recommendations as to appropriate government policy after 1984. The IAC, in its usual procedure, took evidence and produced a draft report which was then open to public consideration and public comment. The IAC then took comments from various interested parties such as manufacturers, consumers, importers and anyone else with an interest in the industry who had a mind to give evidence to the IAC and to comment on that draft report. Following that, as is the procedure, it produced its final report, which was recently given to the Government. It is now for the Government to give consideration to that final report in the light of representations and inputs that are provided, once again, by those with interests in the industry and, indeed, by its own back bench members of this Parliament who have also been giving serious and detailed consideration to the future of this industry. Later this year, when all that material is taken into account, analysed by the Government and discussed within Cabinet, the Government will announce its decision on post-1984 arrangements for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not appropriate for the Government to rush in and make an early decision, as the Labor Party would have it do on the basis of the remarks of the honourable member for Adelaide today. It must consider all the issues involved. I will enumerate some of those important issues. The Government must take into account the effects of its decision on the economy, the consumer price index and rate of inflation. It must look also at the effects of its decision on the future of the Australian dollar exchange rate and the impact of that on exporters. It must look also at the needs of consumers, who are a very important component of an industry such as the motor industry. If the needs of consumers are not considered, then certainly the motor industry does not have any future in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other side of the coin, the Government must look at the need for stability in the industry and the employment effects of any decision which it might take. It must look also at the regional problems which its decision might affect. I have already mentioned the impact that certain courses of action would have on South Australia. Anyone with any nous at all, of course, knows the relationship between all those issues and factors is very complex and needs careful deliberation. That is what the Government is doing and what it has been doing over recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, as I have said, the Labor Party, through its contribution to this debate and statements that have been made recently, indicates that a hasty decision ought to be taken, even although it might not necessarily be in the interests of the industry or the Australian economy. In contrast to what the honourable member for Adelaide has inferred in this motion today it is the Labor Party that is hopelessly divided on this issue. On the one hand we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), the honourable member for Adelaide and some of his colleagues who are old fashioned mercantilists and on the other hand we have Senator Walsh leading the anti-protection lobby within the Labor Party. The industry, of course, does not know which of these factions is dominant, which will remain dominant or which might be dominant if the Labor Party-God forbid-ever came to office again in this country. Let us look at the way in which the Labor Party has taken decisions in the past on issues such as this. Overnight in 1973 it implemented a 25 per cent tariff cut. </PARA>

Leaving aside whether that 25 per cent tariff cut was justified, the major criticism that can be launched at the Labor Party is the way in which it took that decision. It was, as I said, a decision taken overnight without any adequate consultation or consideration. Once again that is what the Labor Party is advocating today in relation to the matters being considered at present. We have to remember also that the most recent closure of a motor industry plant, the GMH plant at Pagewood was in a State governed by the Labor Party-New South Wales. Clearly, the industry does not trust its prospects under a Labor Government. Of course, we ought to remember also that the Leyland plant in New South Wales was closed when the Federal Labor Party was in office. The party, cannot be trusted to give adequate consideration to its decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Mr CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an awful reputation. We need to recognise also that investment generally collapsed under the Labor government between 1973 and 1975. It is the policies of the Fraser Government that have been effective in restoring a favourable economic climate for investment. The statistics show the record levels of investment that are occurring at present in Australia. Perhaps the approach of the Labor Party could be summed up in a quotation from that old sage, Petronius, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We trained hard, but is seemed that every time we were beginning to form into teams, we would be reorganized. I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing; and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency and demoralization. </PARA>
<PARA>That really sums up the approach of the Labor Party to this issue. The policies that it has advocated are very general. It completely ignores the need for specific detail and the specifics of policy. The Labor Party's attitude clearly has not been thought through. As I have said, there is conflict between the statements of spokesmen on the Labor Party's side of politics, and the Labor Party has not demonstrated in this debate any conflicting statements from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to a recent statement by the Labor Party's former leader, the former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam. He said. </PARA>

The honourable member for Adelaide claimed in a recent speech that there had been a depressed demand for motor vehicles this year. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the statistics show that there has been a significant increase in the demand for motor vehicles this year. So much for the Labor Party's knowledge of the industry. What has it suggested? It has suggested the establishment of an Automotive Industry Authority. The Labor Party is, of course, suggesting more government bureaucracy. The Labor Party seems to be very confused about the way in which it would operate. It says such an authority would be under the umbrella of the Industries Assistance Commission. That demonstrates confusion about the role of the IAC which, in fact, is an independent body established to give independent advice to the Government on the requirements of industry. Its recommendations can be accepted or rejected by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that the Labor Party would set up an Automotive Industry Authority whose decisions would be taken as final. The Labor Party is suggesting, of course, that some bureaucracy would have better wisdom about the way in which the motor industry should operate, its future demands, and the future prospects for it, than the marketplace with or without certain levels of protection. Surely, it is the marketplace for automotive vehicles that should best determine that industry's future. That can operate on a free market basis without any protection or it can operate in a modified market form with certain levels of protection. That is what the Goverment has to determine in giving consideration to IAC recommendations. But that situation must be regarded as a better option than some massive bureaucracy determining each and every decision that is to be taken with respect to the motor vehicle industry. In what way would that Authority take account of technological changes and of changes in consumer demand in regard to the size and style of vehicles? It would be very difficult for such an authority to have the wisdom which market forces would have in determining those requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's view that the recommendations of the IAC should be given adequate consideration, together with the input of all those other interested parties, including the manufacturers, consumers and back bench members of parliament. That is why the Government will not be hastened into ill-advised decisions; it will ensure that adequate time is given to consider all of those points of view and to consider the effects on the economy, the effects on consumers and the effects on the industry itself. When it has given consideration to those points of view it will make a decision which will be in the interests not only of the industry but also of the Australian economy and the Australian community. I am confident that the decision that the Government takes will ensure the survival of the industry and its long term prosperity. Until that decision is taken it is not appropriate for Ministers in particular to comment on likely decisions. Once again, we see in the approach of the Labor Party a lack of consideration for the industry. This has been demonstrated by its members asking questions of Ministers in that context, expecting them to make some comment on the industry, on the IAC report, before that adequate consideration has been given. Either the Labor Party is naive or, as I said, it is seeking political expediency at the expense of the industry and the Australian economy. The Government will not accept that approach; it has never accepted that approach. It will continue the consistent approach it has adopted in reaching decisions on the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I were an employee dependent for my future livelihood on the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman), who has just spoken, I would be petrified. Not only did he indicate that he does not believe that anyone should embarrass the Government or Ministers by debating this matter but also he is an attender, I understand, at the free trade lobby called the modest members' club. Government members do not seem to see any conflict at all in the fact that among their number are people who wish to see dissipated major sections of the Australian manufacturing industry involved in the production and manufacture of motor vehicles and the parts and supply areas of that industry. Those members who want those sections dissipated or thrown out are apparently free to express their opinions as they wish. But apparently they find objection when someone supports the continued employment of substantial sections of the Australian community and opposes the opening up of Australian markets to unrestricted and, in many cases, subsidised industries which are non-competitive with Australian manufactured products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is all right for the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) to talk in the House about the costs in the motor vehicle industry. There are costs associated also with a number of the other aspects of protection that exist in Australia. I do not see many members of the rural lobby standing up in this Parliament and offering to allow free imports of New Zealand dairy, meat and other products, which would be available to be sold in Australia if there were not varying forms of restrictions. I do not see members of the National Country Party, which is very good on downing protection in some areas, getting up and making statements that they are prepared to give up large sections of tax concessions. </PARA>
<PARA> I will get back to the subject at hand because it is critical not only to Adelaide but to the people in my electorate. Geelong is a city which literally is dependent on the motor vehicle industry. It has a major manufacturing plant which is involved in the higher end of the technology of the motor vehicle industry. Up until the current models, the substantial design and drafting and the higher levels of technology for motor vehicles have been undertaken in that area. Uncertainty was created when two years ago this particular motor vehicle plan period was interrupted by the present Government with a change in the plan to suit a manufacturer. The plan was foreshortened. That may seem to be a reasonable objective, especially if it satisfies one of the manufacturers who happens to be politically influential; but the facts of life are that if a company invests $1m in the design and production of an Australian-based vehicle it is entitled to expect that the undertakings given by government at that time for the period during which the plan will operate, and therefore for the recovery of the invested funds, will be met. In this instance they will not be met. The Government has tinkered with the last set of decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kingston suggested that we are not entitled to debate this matter, nor are we entitled to know what the decisions or recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission are or what discussions are taking place at a government level. He suggested that that is normal. It is not normal. During the last series of hearings on the car plan, the IAC recommendations were made public before the Government made its decision, and manufacturers, employees and other interested parties were invited to give evidence or to make submissions on the proposed changes. Recommendations were then arrived at in respect of that plan, which is the plan that is substantially, with some changes, in operation at the moment. Unfortunately, there have been other changes in the plan which have acted to the disadvantage of the longer established manufacturers in Australia. One of those changes is that they do not have access to import licensing for vehicles outside the manufacturing plans, access which the two Japanese manufacturers who have most recently come into the plan do have. I do not include in that the Mitsubishi company because it replaced Chrysler Australia Ltd. We have now a situation where two manufacturers have a distinct advantage over the other three manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that the Parliament could not have a proper and full debate on this matter. Certainly the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) has great concern about parts manufacturers in her electorate. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) are equally concerned about the effects on the people they represent, as are other honourable members on our side of the Parliament. Apparently honourable members on the other side are not so concerned. The motor vehicle industry is a substantial part of employment in Australia. Prior to the last election this Government brought in a proposal whereby it guaranteed textile and footwear industries substantial protection over the next seven years. It introduced legislation in respect of a narrower section of the industry which in fact will provide bounties equivalent to $12,500 per employee-in excess of $70m a year. It now suggests that those employees-I speak specifically of those in my electorate because the industry is almost the sole source of economy in the Geelong area-are expendable to some whim of the Government, some ideological belief that there can be a magical creation of additional jobs. If that magical creation of additional jobs really is possible, why is it that we still have 350,000 unemployed after six years of this Government in office? Where are the jobs which were to be created in other areas of industry? What is the mobility of labour?</PARA>
<PARA> We talk of uncertainties. If a person has a house to sell in Geelong, while the motor car industry is in doubt he can forget about it. If he has to move somewhere else, or wishes to move somewhere else to escape the continuing unemployment in that area created by economic policies which do not in any way meet the requirements of those people in Australia who wish to work, he has no prospect whatsoever of disposing of his property, of the investment that has been made in the house, which has been encouraged for many years by governments in this place and in other places. He is tied into a situation where he is economically limited in his opportunities to move. Certainly the losses involved in moving from an area where there is concern about the future of employment and about the economy of that area, are significant and have a destabilising effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd may or may not be the best manufacturer in Australia. It is probably the oldest, and it is now the only vehicle firm which in recent times has provided vehicles with the higher technology rather than that at the low end of the technology scale. We are now hearing suggestions from Government members and from the IAC which appear to have some sort of a Hans Christian Andersen approach, suggestions that if we do the things that they believe we should, all the other things will come good. Over the weekend I saw that two people who are being paid in our universities, clearly under false pretences, suggest that if we import vehicles instead of manufacturing them in Australia the servicing and maintenance of those vehicles will create jobs to take up the slack from the manufacturing industries. If the imported vehicles are so bad that they require those sorts of numbers, I suggest that we would not be doing ourselves or anyone else a favour by importing them. The ordinary consumer does not have taxation write-off provisions for his motor vehicle, as do some other more favoured people in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to deal in some detail with my own electorate, but in a 10-minute debate that is not possible. In a city of 170,000 people, the motor industry pumps $189m a year into the city's economy. I ask any honourable member in this House: What would happen to Canberra if a comparable situation arose and the Public Service was moved somewhere else? The example I am talking about is fairly obvious. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a submission which was made on behalf of my electorate to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, (Mr N. A. Brown). It is impossible to read it at this time. </PARA>

<PARA>EMPLOYMENTANDMANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN GEELONG</PARA>
<PARA>Passenger Motor Vehicle and Components Industry-Post 1984 Assistance Policy</PARA>
<PARA>Submission and Deputation by Representatives of the Geelong Community</PARA>
<PARA>August 1981</PARA>
<PARA>Introduction</PARA>
<PARA> The action and decisions to be taken by the Federal Government on assistance measures for passenger motor vehicles and components after 1984 are of absolutely vital importance to the Geelong community. </PARA>
<PARA> This submission requests that the Federal Government:</PARA>
<PARA> recognises the extent of economic dependence of the Geelong Region on manufacturing industry especially the motor vehicle and components industry. </PARA>
<PARA> consider fully the impact of any proposed measures on the Geelong economy and community. </PARA>
<PARA> consults with the Geelong community on the specific impact on Geelong of any proposed measures. Where these are adverse it would be expected that the Government would also report on region specific adjustment assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>In making these requests the Geelong community wishes to point out that:</PARA>
<PARA> the IAC has stated in its draft report that Geelong has the highest employment concentration in motor vehicle and components manufacture of any region in the Nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Geelong's concentration is almost totally in manufacture and design not in overseas sourced assembly or design. </PARA>
<PARA>It is therefore suggested that the requests made above are entirely reasonable and that the Geelong community does have a special claim to recognition, consideration and consultation by Government in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN GEELONG</PARA>
<PARA> The Geelong Region has 19,200 people in manufacturing employment i.e., approximately 2 per cent of the manufacturing employment of the Nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Value added by manufacturing in Geelong is $414m (1978-79). Approximately 41 per cent of manufacturing employment in Geelong is within three enterprises-the Ford Motor Company, International Harvester and Alcoa. The future Geelong operations of both Ford and International Harvester are now both endangered by uncertainty in government policy. The Ford plant employs 4,400 persons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Geelong Region's economic development is almost entirely linked to the growth of expertise and investment in its manufacturing base. It is a region without substantial natural resources. Until 1973 this course of economic development was positively encouraged by government as a means of maintaining an alternative industrial centre outside of Melbourne as well as providing wider employment opportunities for Western Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The Geelong economy has never fully recovered from the 1973 tariff and quota changes in the textile and clothing industry. The direct impact was almost instantaneous with a number of major manufacturers ceasing or severely winding back production. About 800 people lost jobs in the textile and clothing industry in 1974 and during 1974 and 1975 unemployment rose by 2,700 indicating that about another 1,500 employees lost jobs in the service sector indirectly as a result of the tarriff/quota changes and economic disruption of that time. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1975 and since the motor vehicle manufacturing policy has been the subject of numerous proposals and policy shifts Government would appear to be unaware of the very damaging affects this uncertainty has on business and community confidence in regions with a high investment in motor vehicle manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally during 1980 the negative impact has developed in Australia of virtually unrestrained tractor and agricultural machinery importation, leading to a large number of importers without servicing/parts networks or long-term commitment to the Australian market. Retrenchments and early retirements at International Harvester's Geelong plant totalled in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA>IMPACT OF PROPOSED CHANGES</PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the particular options which are finally adopted by Government virtually all known proposals would be likely to adversely affect total employment in the motor vehicle and components industry in Geelong. This is because all known options dilute in one form or another integrated manufacture and Australian design. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, the major point that is suggested the Government note in relation to Geelong is that it has had sustained high unemployment since 1973 and that any loss of jobs in motor vehicle and components manufacture in the next few years will bring on a deeper recession in the Region's economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Geelong community and Victorian Government have been successful in attracting some new investment since 1973 and new industrial development should be high in the 1980's. But, the projects are capital intensive and will not immediately, at least that is until the late 1980's, offer a substantial employment alternative to the motor vehicle and components industry. While the current IAC reference and Government consideration are for post 1984 it is highly likely that any adopted measures will be adjusted to by companies before 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in recognition of the above that the following summary of the current economic importance and future decline of the industry in Geelong is outlined.</PARA>

<PARA>FUTURE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE</PARA>
<PARA>Potential Economic Disruption in Geelong by change to Motor Vehicle Industry Policy It is believed that two consequences for Geelong are possible in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> Effect 1 is suggested as a likely impact of adoption of elements of the IAC's post 1984 recommendations concerned with tariff reduction export facilitation but with continuation of 80/20 market sharing. </PARA>
<PARA> Effect 2 is suggested as a lilely impact of adoption of all elements of the IAC's post 1984 recommendations including any change in market sharing to below 70/30. Basically integrated manufacture in Geelong is replaced by assembly only. </PARA>
<PARA> Effect 1</PARA>
<PARA>Employment Ford-net decline of approximately 1,500 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Components and Production Suppliers-net decline of approximately 300-400 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Service Sector-at least one job lost for each two jobs lost in direct production 1,800-1,900 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Total net decline of 2,700 to 2,900 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>Regional Unemployment</PARA>
<PARA> Approximately 15 per cent of labour force by 1985 involving a government expenditure of around $24m per annum at current unemployment benefit rates. </PARA>
<PARA>Regional Economic Activity severe regional recession spread through all sectors, but especially in light engineering, retailing real estate, and construction, some State impact. </PARA>
<PARA> Effect 2</PARA>
<PARA>Employment cessation of 80 per cent of production activity-assembly only of ckd packs plus continuation of engine foundry. Net decline of around 3,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Components and Production Suppliers-net decline of up to 70 per cent of jobs, i.e. up to 600 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Service Sector-between 0.75 and 1 job lost for each direct manufacturing job lost.* Net decline of between 2,700 and 3,600 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Total net decline of between 5,300 and 6,200 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>Regional Unemployment extent would depend on method of phasing-out of manufacturing production</PARA>
<PARA> Around 20 per cent of regional labour-force by 1985 with phase-out of manufacturing production is gradual. </PARA>
<PARA>Regional Economic Activity Economic depression in Geelong with substantial flow-on of down-turn into Victorian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> (Note: of Effect 1-one job loss per two direct losses, with higher decline in direct employment is expected that a higher service-sector job losses per direct job loss.)</PARA>
<PARA>RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMMUNITY VIEWS</PARA>
<PARA> It is accepted that the Government must make its decisions in the broad national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> However, where such decisions could have major livelihood implications for an identifiable group of Australians, such as a regional community, it is strongly suggested that the Government has a responsibility to consult fully and directly with the persons to be affected before decisions are made. It is not accepted that because the final decisions rest with individual companies that this lessens Government responsibility. There is also a responsibility for the community to indicate the general nature of its concern to Government. In doing this the following points are made with the widespread support of the Geelong community:</PARA>
<PARA> there is a general concern in the Geelong community, through its high involvement in manufacturing, that the nature and value of manufacturing industry is not fully understood by Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically there would seem to be an inadequate appreciation of the value of concentrated manufacturing activity. The value of such activity in developing economies of scale across a wide range of small and medium-sized enterprises is very high. </PARA>
<PARA> in the uncertainty surrounding manufacturing industry the Geelong community does not see a short or medium term alternative to manufacturing for economic survival. At March 1981 there were 6,507 registered unemployed persons in the community-representing 9.0% of an estimated workforce of 72,000. </PARA>
<PARA> It is likely that any sustained period of unemployment in Geelong exceeding 10% would push Geelong's economy into severe recession. The delicate balance of Geelong's economy at the moment must be understood by Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Geelong's relative smaller size-total population 172,000-compared to the metropolitan centres of production means that adverse changes are not spread as thinly or absorbed so easily as in the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Geelong Region can expect some significant growth in processing/manufacturing industry during the 1980s. However, the current average investment for these projects of $1.36 million per employee and at least during the 1980s they do not offer any substantial replacement to existing manufacturing activity. Indeed existing manufacturers are crucial to the manpower needs of these projects. Ford has long supplied other Geelong industry with skilled employees through Ford's high commitment to apprenticeship training. </PARA>
<PARA> large-scale relocation of the work-force out of the Geelong Region is not a reasonable economic or social option to be encouraged by Government. While it may appear to be an attractive solution to skilled man-power shortages on resource projects, it must be recognised that such relocation is highly selective. Only the skilled are encouraged to move. Thus Region's like Geelong are left without their major resource for future economic development and with large numbers of unskilled and semi-skilled people in unemployment. This process has begun to happen in Geelong over the last 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA> the social problems and dis-harmony generated by unemployment in industrial areas appear not to be understood by policy-makers. With sustained levels of unemployment the effect of uncertainty in the employed labour-force increases rather than diminishes the tensions of industrial relations in the work-place.</PARA>
<PARA>SUGGESTED PROPOSALS</PARA>
<PARA> This submission supports the principle of 'gradualism' for changes in protection of the motor vehicle and components industry. However, it is suggested that decreases in Australian content and changes in market sharing particularly should only be undertaken after the Government is virtually absolutely sure that such measures will not undermine Geelong's medium or long-term economic structure or its cohesive society. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC merely recognised in its draft report that adverse effects in Geelong could be very high. It is suggested to Government that the Draft Report nowhere near fulfilled its reference in respect to regional implications. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore suggested to Government that a process of full consultation with the Geelong community before adoption of changes will enable Government to have a more informed picture of their possible impact not only in Geelong, but also, by assessment of the Region with most concentrated activity on the industry, of the total impact on Australia's manufacturing sector. The community is willing to lend every assistance to such consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC did recommend in its Draft Report the adoption of 'region-specific' adjustment assistance measures. It did not suggest, in the Draft Report, what these measures should involve. The Employment Strategy for the Geelong Region (attached) was produced because of downturns in others of areas of manufacturing in Geelong. However it is suggested that the recommendations of that Strategy are equally appropriate for Government consideration as medium-term assistance to this Region. Equally however measures for effective short-term assistance must be devised by Government. </PARA>
<PARA> (i) removal of the uncertainty over manufacturing industry;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) ensuring that capital and infrastructure is made available to manufacturers at competitive rates to that supplied to natural resource projects;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) relocation of a higher-order public administration function to Geelong to stimulate its tertiary/services sector;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) increased funding and commitments for up-grading the skills of the existing work-force in Geelong;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) special commitment for skills enhancement for those persons in Geelong at all levels of industry who will be responsible for the introduction of new production methods in manufacturing industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) and the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) have spoken about the motor industry but, when one looks at the wording of the matter of public importance put forward by them, they certainly have not taken the opportunity to put forward any arguments in support of the matter. I presume from that that there is no argument against the Government, in any of the conflicting statements that have been made, that would have any effect on the motor vehicle industry. When one studies past statements made by members of the Opposition, there are very many conflicting statements, statements that have done nothing but create mischief and cause concern within the motor vehicle industry. On 25 August 1981 the honourable member for Adelaide gave a notice of motion in this House which caused anxiety amongst the motor vehicle industry and people employed in it. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move: That this House calls upon the Government:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) to end the uncertainty caused by the draft recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is something to which he drew attention which does nothing more than create uncertainty. On 25 February 1981, in a question addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch), the honourable member for Adelaide made reference to the IAC's own admission about plants closing and thousands of jobs being lost. I contend that this is drawing unnecessary attention to the industry and creating unnecessary anxiety amongst people in it. On 19 August 1981 the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) asked the Minister a question about the automotive complementation scheme as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Minister aware that this scheme is coming into some disarray because of the allegations certainly made by the automotive parts manufacturers that there is manipulation of the scheme by transfer pricing . . . </PARA>
<PARA>All the conflicting statements have been made by members of the Opposition. They are made to destroy an Australian industry which has grown substantially since the end of World War II. In 1948 General-Motors Holden's Ltd, an Australian company, brought out an Australian car, the Holden. It was first presented to the Australian public at a cost of #675. For those members not as old as I am, that is $1,350. Today an Australian car sells to the Australian people for about $9,000. In 1948 it took two and a half years of average weekly personal income to purchase a car. Today it takes only eight months of average weekly personal income to purchase the equivalent car. Is that not an illustration that an Australian industry was born, has become efficient and has grown to compete as well as any other industry in the international market? Yet the industry is small by world standards. It has a market to produce only 400,000 to 450,000 units per annum. That is causing the industry trouble. Another thing that is causing it trouble-this was referred to by the honourable member for Adelaide-is the super-efficiency and high production of the Japanese manufacturers. They are causing difficulties through their competitive production not only to the Australian industry but also to every car manufacturing company in the world. We must address ourselves to those difficulties. They have led to the draft report of the Industries Assistance Commission that came out in February of this year. They will make this Government think very carefully to bring down a decision that will benefit all Australians on the final report of the IAC which, I understand, will be in the hands of the Government shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government realises very much that the Australian automotive industry underpins much of Australia's engineering capacity, skills and technology. We realise that it provides employment in the manufacturing, servicing and distribution sectors and in the very important Australian component manufacturing industry. Those industries combined employ directly 150,000 people. Including the other industries dependent on the automotive industry, that figure is probably as high as 250,000. More importantly, the automotive industry, through apprenticeships, provides much of the future skills for Australian industry. It is an industry of which all Australians should be proud. It has weathered many storms over the years. It has weathered production cut-backs and reduced profitability. It has weathered and is weathering the demand change to small, more fuel efficient cars. In the near future it will have to make changes to come up with world car technology, particularly concerning front wheel drive vehicles. The opposition and the honourable member for Adelaide say that the IAC's draft report came out this year and we should have made a decision. We will not be rushed into quick decisions. We will consider all the aspects. As I said, we will make a good decision for Australia. I will illustrate how hollow are the words of the honourable member for Adelaide. He made a speech to the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers on 9 June 1981. In one part of that speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot set out a precise view of the assistance arrangements that the Labor Party considers necessary because we do not yet have the benefit of the IAC's final report. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member said that the Labor Party cannot make a decision and does not have a policy because it has not seen the IAC's final report, yet he expects us to rush into making a decision. By his own admission in that speech the Labor Party cannot do so. When the final IAC report comes out and before the Government makes a decision many aspects must be considered. Consideration of all those aspects will enable the Government to make the decision that will benefit all Australian people. We must consider what percentage of vehicles should be local content if there is such a plan, export facilitation, how we can assist our industry to export more of its products, the effect of quotas on people, the rate of duty we should apply to motor cars and automotive parts, the effects on employment and the future of Australian technology. We must consider a whole host of things. Last, but not least, another group we certainly should consider is the Australian consumers. They are just as important, if not more important, than all the other factors I have mentioned. That is the total package that will be considered by this Government. We will not be rushed into a wrong or hurried decision. We will make a sound decision that will have a future for the Australian automotive industry, people in the servicing and distribution side of the industry, the Australian private motorist, the Australian commercial world that relies on the use of motor vehicles and Australian industry that also relies on the technology and vehicles that come from that industry. That is the decision we will make; they are the things we will consider. It will be a decision to benefit all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is the first of four Bills to implement further proposals relating to stamp duties and taxes imposed in the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay, that I announced in my Budget Speech on 18 August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> In the statements accompanying my Budget Speech it was indicated that, following a review of the level and scope of the stamp duties and taxes imposed in the Australian Capital Territory, the Government had decided to impose two new duties in the Territory. The first is to be imposed on new life insurance effected in the Territory and the other on new and transferred motor vehicle registrations in the Territory. This Bill and three associated Bills that I shall introduce shortly, contain the provisions necessary for the imposition and collection of the two new charges. </PARA>
<PARA> In announcing the new taxing measures I indicated that they would apply from 1 October 1981. That remains the Government's intention and it is hoped that passage of the Bills will occur in time for the Bills to come into operation on that date. Following approval of the Bills by the Parliament they are to come into operation on the date fixed by proclamation. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the substance of the present Bill. It will amend the Australian Capital Territory Taxation (Administration) Act 1969 to incorporate machinery provisions for the assessment, collection and recovery of the two new taxes. The scheme to be implemented to impose and collect tax on new life insurance effected in the Territory is modelled largely on the existing scheme relating to the tax on general insurance effected in the Territory. Persons who carry on a business of life insurance in the Territory will be required to register with the Commissioner of Taxation and lodge monthly returns of premiums received in respect of taxable life insurance business. Insurers will pay the amount of the tax payable in respect of that insurance but will be authorised to pass on the tax by recovering it from the persons liable for payment of premiums. </PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of the new tax, life insurance falls into two broad categories. The first category relates to temporary and term life insurance. With this type of insurance, the term of the insurance is limited to a specified period and the sum insured is payable only in the event of the death, within that period, of the person whose life is insured. If the person survives that period, no amount becomes payable under the policy. Tax is to be imposed in respect of this category of life insurance at the rate of 5 per cent of the amount of the premium payable in the first year of the insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The second category is life insurance other than temporary or term insurance. Included in this category is the whole of life and endowment insurance and the amount of the tax is to be calculated by reference to the sum insured. For life insurance with a sum insured greater than $2,000 the amount of tax is to be $1 plus 20c for each $200, or part thereof, of the amount of the sum insured that exceeds $2,000. Where the sum insured is between $100 and $2,000, the rate of tax will be 10c for each $200, or part thereof, of the sum insured. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax on life insurance will not be payable if the person whose life is insured is domiciled outside the Territory and stamp duty or other similar tax imposed by a State or other Territory has been paid in relation to that insurance. This exemption is to avoid the possibility of double taxation where a person who takes out life insurance in the Australian Capital Territory is required to pay stamp duty in a State or Territory because, for example, he or she lives in that State or other Territory. An exemption will also be provided for personnel of diplomatic missions of other countries where the other country provides a reciprocal exemption for Australian diplomatic personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the new tax to be imposed on new and transferred vehicle registrations effected in the Territory. The tax is to be imposed on the registration of all classes of vehicles, including trailers, that are registered by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. The tax will not be imposed where the vehicle to be registered in the name of a person was last registered in that person's name in the Australian Capital Territory or elsewhere in Australia. The amount of the tax is to be calculated at the rate of $2 for each $100, or part thereof, of the market value of the vehicle. Persons seeking registrations on which tax is to be imposed will be required to state to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles the market value of the vehicle and to tender payment to the Registrar of the amount of the tax payable on the basis of that value. The Registrar will not register a vehicle if these requirements are not complied with, unless the registration sought is exempt from tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Exemptions from the tax will broadly follow existing exemptions from other classes of Australian Capital Territory stamp duties and taxes. Thus, vehicles registered to public hospitals, public benevolent institutions, religious institutions, public educational institutions and diplomatic missions and their personnel of reciprocating countries will not attract tax. In addition, exemption will apply to licensed motor vehicle dealers in the Australian Capital Territory in respect of vehicles held by them as trading stock for resale. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been decided to provide an exemption for certain disabled persons. Disabled persons who will be eligible for exemption are those who would qualify for exemption from sales tax in respect of the purchase of a new vehicle. The exemptions from stamp tax will, however, apply to both new and secondhand vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> A memorandum containing more detailed explanations of the technical aspects of this Bill and the three other Bills to which I have referred is being made available to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a further Bill associated with the Australian Capital Territory Taxation (Administration) Amendment Bill 1981, which I introduced a short time ago. As I indicated in speaking to that Bill, tax is to be imposed on life insurance effected in the Australian Capital Territory and the purpose of this Bill is to impose the tax, at the rates declared in the Bill, on two categories of life insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax payable in respect of temporary or term life insurance is to be calculated at the rate of 5 per cent of the premium payable for the first year of cover. In the case of life insurance other than temporary or term insurance, the Bill will impose tax calculated by reference to the amount of the sum insured. For sums insured greater than $2,000, tax will be at the rate of $1 plus 20c for each $200, or part thereof, of the amount of the sum insured in excess of $2,000. For sums insured between $100 and $2,000, tax will be at the rate of 10c for each $200, or part thereof, of the sum insured. The Bill also makes provision for the exemptions from tax which I referred to earlier. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

The tax will apply to all classes of vehicles required to be registered, other than those registered to persons or institutions eligible for exemptions that I have already referred to in relation to the previous Bill. The rate of tax is to be $2 for each $100, or part thereof, of the market value of the motor vehicle or trailer to be registered. The Bill also provides for the exemptions to which I have referred.

<PARA> The Australian Capital Territory Tax (Insurance Business) Amendment Bill is the last of the Budget package of Bills in relation to stamp duties and taxes in the Australian Capital Territory. It is in consequence of the proposal to tax new life insurance effected in the Territory and its purpose is to withdraw an existing exemption from the tax on general insurance. The exemption I refer to is in respect of personal accident and sickness insurance which is undertaken solely in connection with life insurance. There is, however, no exemption for personal accident and sickness insurance not connected with life insurance. Now that it is proposed to tax life insurance effected in the Territory, there is no longer any case for retaining the limited exemption of life insurance-related accident and sickness insurance. All accident and sickness insurance effected in the Territory will now bear the tax rate that applies to general insurance. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals No. 13 (1981). </PARA>
<PARA>The Customs Tariff Proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. Proposals No. 13 (1981), which operates on and from tomorrow, contains tariff changes resulting from the Government's decisions on recommendations by the Industries Assistance Commission in its reports on Miscellaneous Manufacturing-Certain Refractory Products, and Railway and Tramway Locomotives Rolling Stock, etc. The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendations in both reports. As a result, certain refractory products such as bricks, blocks, tiles, crucibles, nozzles, et cetera, will become dutiable at a rate of 15 per cent, an increase of 7.5 per cent. The increase in assistance accorded the refractory shapes in question will reduce the disparity in assistance between these and related products. The production of refractory shapes will now receive a moderate level of assistance which will allow the local industry an opportunity to participate more in Australia's resources development. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the railway and tramway products report, the Government's decision that all goods under reference be dutiable at 20 per cent, represents a reduction in the level of protection from 30 per cent for most goods. It is an increase of 5 per cent for battery operated locomotives and most parts therefor, which is a small segment of the market. The proposed duty rate will provide this industry with assistance generally similar to that provided to the manufacturing sector as a whole, and will reduce disparities both within this industry and between it and other industries. The Government considers that the natural advantages of the local manufacturers will ensure there is no significant change in their position in the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Proposals also contains administrative changes to remove redundant concessional provisions in relation to tourist yachts and Papua New Guinea quota items. The provisions being removed have been unused for some time. A comprehensive summary setting out the nature of the changes has been prepared and is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall make just a few remarks on Customs Tariff Proposals No. 13 because the next occasion when one will have an opportunity to debate it will be when a Customs Tariff Validation Bill comes into this chamber. I believe that probably will not be until next May because the Government has changed its procedures, and these validation Bills will come in only once a year rather than twice a year. The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), following normal procedure, merely handed me a copy of the Proposals as he rose to speak. I am not blaming him for that; I am just pointing out how ridiculous are these procedures. Indeed there is no proper scrutiny in the House of Representatives, or indeed in the Senate, of important proposals affecting the livelihoods of so many. It has been my contention, supported by members of the Australian Labor Party, that we ought to have a standing committee on tariffs, bounties and Customs Proposals so that, in a non-party atmosphere around a committee table, we could look in depth at the proposals. That is not yet to be, but the way of the reformer is difficult. I will continue to say that this is what should be done. In the meantime I can merely say that the case made by the Government is not proved because it has not had time to look at it. We will have to wait for many months after the horse has bolted until the next Customs Tariff Validation Bill comes into this place before I will be able to make a more considered speech on the subject. In the meantime I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) deplores the funding of political parties for the purposes of elections, because it reduces the funding for housing, health, education, handicapped and early childhood programs;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) endorses as a prerequisite the holding of referenda to allow the expression of public opinion on the funding of political parties for elections;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) recommends that the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act be amended to take into account election funding when examining relativities between the States for revenue sharing; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) proposes that the Federal Government investigate the possibility of immediately reducing general revenue grants to States which adopt election funding by amounts equal to that spent by State Governments for funding political parties. </PARA>
<PARA>Right at this moment in the State of New South Wales $2m to $3m of taxpayers' funds are being set aside for the political purpose of the Australian Labor Party-to have itself re-elected to government. There is no sense of priority but just a wish to reinforce the ALP in office. Those funds could build 20 pre-schools in western Sydney. Those funds could build 10 centres for handicapped children. Those funds-$2m to $3m-could build 50 homes for welfare recipients. Those funds could pay a 4 per cent subsidy to 10,000 first home buyers. Those are the priorities of the Government of New South Wales. The Australian Labor Party has the gall to say that it amounts to only 20c per head of population. What it should be looking at is an alternative use for those funds and it should really be thinking of the needs of the State of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that any State government that adopts these procedures should not be encouraged by the Commonwealth and in fact should have detriments placed against such decisions and such legislation. Those $2m to $3m could pay the salaries of 250 school aides in New South Wales, whether they be in primary schools or secondary schools. Large numbers of these people have been sacked over the last months, the State Government claiming that there has been a shortage of funds. In fact, $2m to $3m could pay the salaries of 150 nurses or community health workers. Where are the priorities of the State of New South Wales? Those funds could pay an additional $6 a week for three years to all the 31,000 nurses in the State of New South Wales. Those funds could maintain, active and operative, the casualty centre at Parramatta Hospital which is being closed by the New South Wales Minister for Health. Those funds could double the assistance to handicapped children in New South Wales in any one of the two or three really paltry programs for disadvantaged and handicapped children in that State. The fact that the funds allocated to political parties in the State of New South Wales are equal to those allocated to handicapped children's programs indicates the level of concern of the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Policies should be enough to get governments re-elected. Let them raise their own funds. Let them appeal to the community and see whether the community supports them. All that is happening in the State of New South Wales is that bad debts are being paid with taxpayers' funds. The bad debts were incurred as a result of bad management within the Australian Labor Party through successive losses at Federal elections when it sought to raise funds. It did not raise enough funds because it could not attract electoral support. Now it has tapped the till of the New South Wales Government to pay off its debts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Misappropriation of funds, indeed. I think it is interesting to note that the first two governments to approve government support for parties seeking election were the fascist Government of Mussolini and the nazi party under Hitler. Those two governments were the first to support such a measure in a so-called democracy. Let us look at the situation in the United States of America. The United States Federal Act is about 106 pages in length and in four years there have been produced 130 pages of explanation of the regulations covering the funding of elections. What a simple system! If my colleagues opposite think the tax laws are complicated, they should look at the regulations governing public funding of political parties in the United States. They recommend that we follow in that direction, and the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales has done so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Next Saturday in New South Wales there is to be an election. Honourable members may be aware of this! At the same time a referendum is to be conducted. This seems to be an ideal opportunity, to my mind, for the State Government of New South Wales to tap public opinion. There have been statements made in this House and elsewhere that 40 per cent of the population is opposed to the public funding of election campaigns. Figures available to me from substantial, recognised and reputable polls indicate that 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the population is opposed to the public funding of political campaigns. If the Australian Labor Party is interested in demonstrating that there is public acceptance, the referendum next Saturday in New South Wales is a marvellous way of finding out what the feeling of that State is, of gaining acceptance by the community, if the State Government can, and then establishing public funding of the election campaigns of political parties. Of course, the Premier of New South Wales is not prepared to go to a referendum on this matter. He is prepared to go to a referendum on all sorts of matters, but he is not prepared to go to a referendum on this matter because he knows that the figures produced by reputable polls indicate that 70 per cent of the population is absolutely opposed to the Labor Party putting its hand in the tin and funding its own election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter is far more important than the matters that are going before the people by way of referenda next Saturday. This issue of public funding of political parties is of the greatest significance. Let us look at the matters that are going before the people of New South Wales in the referenda. The first is a four-year term for members of parliament. That is fascinating, except that only half the work has been done by the Government in New South Wales in regard to a four-year term. It forgot to recognise-or perhaps it did not-that a four-year term, if carried at the referendum, will mean a 12-year term for members of the upper House in New South Wales. The Premier said: 'I did not really mean that at all. I meant only eight years but at some time in the future I will have to have another referendum to approve an eight-year term for members of the upper House in New South Wales'. What a ridiculous situation! Here we have a matter ready made to be put before the people in a referendum. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter in the referendum is the pecuniary interests of members of parliament. In this House we have examined that matter properly and in detail. A distinguished judge has looked at the matter for Federal parliamentarians, Ministers and public servants. The Bowen report is available to every State government, should it wish to examine the matter. This Government is moving to establish measures whereby there is an alternative approach to the declaration of pecuniary interests. This alternative approach has not been examined by the Government of New South Wales and could easily be put into place without going to a referendum. Yet the Government of New South Wales refuses to go to the people to find out whether they are prepared to pay for the funding of political parties at elections. I think that is crass mistreatment and misjudgment of the people of New South Wales. I think it is a despicable and corrupt action. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the New South Wales Government is seeking to create a situation where, after the declaration of the polls on Saturday and after the sources of funds are indicated by all the political parties, it will have an enemies list of those who donated funds to the Liberal Party. We can see it happening now. We can see the 60 per cent of executive committees within the Labor Party which are controlled by the union movement having access to material available to the New South Wales Government. They will say to employers and to business: 'If you keep funding the Liberal Party, you are for it. We will call stoppages and strikes and we will abuse the information that we have gained from the New South Wales Government', information which will be included on a list of enemies of the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales. It is no wonder that this type of funding first commenced in fascist Italy and in nazi Germany. </PARA>
<PARA> I am amazed that any political party in this great country of ours can come forward in this way and do the same thing; tap the public purse to ensure its continuation in office. What does the Australian Labor Party really expect to gain from this except the denigration of the democratic process within Australia? That will be the result. The Australian Labor Party has sought to break down the democratic process by not encouraging people to participate in political parties. It wants to have a socialised, government-run instrumentality so that eventually one would have to apply to the Government to establish a political party and receive approval for funding. That is the ultimate result of that sort of thinking. I, or any member on this side of the House, do not want to see that sort of thing spread throughout Australia or be adopted by any State governments. The only process by which this can be stopped is to have the Government of New South Wales thrown out of office next Saturday. </PARA>
<PARA> If the ALP really wishes to cease being a captive of the union movement-it has said that political parties should not be captive of any section of the community-the way to do it would be to change the rules. It cannot be done by having up front public declarations of where funds come from. The Liberal Party has a completely open approach to the funding of political campaigns. Not one member of this side of the House has any knowledge of how his funds are raised by the campaign and the party machine. Members do not involve themselves in that process. It is not possible for an honourable member in the Australian Labor Party to be remote from the process of raising funds for political functions. It is simple to take out the figures on the amount of money available to the union movement. For the six-month period to the end of July the Amalgamated Metalworkers and Shipwrights Union has $9m available. That union and other unions are involved in the committees of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe any member could avoid the pressures that would come to bear on him, first of all, by control of voting numbers and, secondly, by the power of the purse within the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party has an inbuilt destruct button. Destruction will occur if it continues to attach itself so closely to various groups in the community. The process of government funding for political parties is not the answer that the Australian Labor Party is seeking. The proper process is to dispense with such legislation. If the Australian Labor Party wants to pursue it, it should be put to the people by way of referendum to see how they react to it. I will tell honourable members what the people will do. They would rather have the pre-schools, the health workers and nurses well-paid, and the advantages of an interest subsidy for first home buyers, than the funding of political parties to run election campaigns to reinsure in office the personal will of a small section of the community or the personal will of a member of parliament or a candidate. </PARA>

If the Australian Government continues to condone the use of taxpayers' funds in this way it is an abuse of its power.

The governments in those States will gain advantage from the Grants Commission being able to take into account what has happened in New South Wales. The Commonwealth Government ought to move immediately to reduce by $3m grants to New South Wales. If New South Wales wants to throw money around like that and not provide the services for which it was elected then it should not be subsidised by the Australian taxpayer. Let it appeal to the people of New South Wales and get the money from them. If this matter were put to a referendum there would be no way in which the people of New South Wales would support it. Why should the back-door method of funding political campaigns, of using taxpayers' funds which are allocated as general purpose grants by this Parliament, be used? A decision should be taken immediately to reduce by $3m the general grants to the New South Wales Government. To ensure that this process never happens again the legislation must be changed so that the Grants Commission can ensure that this is just a mere administrative factor that operates on every occasion that any State government uses its power to subvert taxpayers' funds into the payment of political parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the major arguments and assess the moral difficulties many Australians face when they say: 'Part of my tax must go to the members of an opposing party to have them re-elected'. It is morally wrong that taxpayers' funds should be used in that way. Honourable members opposite should not shake their heads. Of course it is wrong. They are absolutely certain that it is wrong. Two or three members of the Australian Labor Party in the House today are trying to put on a good front of support. Where is their support for this process? The problem is that they do not believe it. They do not believe that this is a proper process for the Government of New South Wales to adopt. There has to be some sort of equality in electoral acceptance before there is a close election. It is no good saying that money will buy votes. Money for publicity, television advertising, newspaper advertising, jingles and all of those sorts of things does not get votes. The only way to get votes in this country is to have the policies, the commitment, and to be able to present oneself in such a way on a day to day basis over a three-year period so that one gets the votes and the people support the policies of one's political party. That is why the Liberal Party and the National Country Party have been so successful in the Federal Parliament. There is a day by day continual effort on behalf of the entire population of Australia. It does not involve a capacity to buy one's way in with television advertising; it involves consistently providing programs for the benefit of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I dealt with the superfluous argument about offering information on donors when I said that an enemies list may be prepared. Let us consider an enemies list. If, in the real world, we know it is likely that the revelation of donors' names will provide marks for future intimidation, what about the possible impact if it were publicly known that a particular union supported the Australian Labor Party and that union got favoured treatment, whether or not it had anything to do with funding? How does the Australian Labor Party stand. It is the same for everyone. I think the public disclosure aspects are open to all sorts of corrupting influences. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you share my view when I say that I believe the legislation in New South Wales is corrupt. It is corrupt to use taxpayers' funds for the purpose of having the Australian Labor Party Government re-elected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to hear that grandstanding from the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). I suppose that this week the Government will try to pass a number of motions which it thinks might embarrass the New South Wales Government. It is hypocrisy for supporters of the Government to talk about deploring the funding of political parties for the purpose of elections when they have the Government Information Unit which is used purely for political purposes, during elections and between elections. It spends some millions of dollars. This year $5m was spent on the Government Information Unit. In addition hundreds of people are employed by Ministers and parliamentary members of the Liberal Party and National Country Party of Australia and are paid from the public payroll. So much for the hypocrisy about funding political parties! Crocodile tears were shed about $2m. The honourable member mentioned a figure of over $3m but the Liberal Party has been kind enough to decide that it will not accept any money from the fund. So less than $2m will be distributed in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How many other things could be done by a government which spends $40m on aeroplanes for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)? We were told that they were bought for security purposes. But when the Prime Minister missed the plane on which his wife and the Governor-General went to Great Britain for the Royal wedding, he went by British Airways. Apparently security was not relevant then. The $40m expenditure on the aircraft was not as essential as it was thought. Let us look at the reasons why the New South Wales Government has introduced legislation about public funding and why most democratic countries of Europe-I will give a list later-have introduced it. </PARA>

Those of us who support public funding legislation have basically four objectives: Firstly, to limit, or eliminate political corruption; secondly, to force parties to reveal their sources of income in order to clarify to the electorate what kind of interest their financial supporters represent; thirdly, to reduce the advantage that may be derived by certain groups or individuals from their command of superior financial resources; and finally, to reduce, limit, or control the cost of politics generally. I will try to come to the last point later in the debate. I note that I have five minutes less time in which to speak than the honourable member for Mitchell. When we are talking about eliminating corruption, let us think back to the days when the present Prime Minister was in Opposition and was the spokesman for labour. He and the Liberal Party were subsidised by one Keith Compton Gale, who was managing director of Gollin and Co. Ltd. He was provided with staff by Keith Compton Gale, who was later charged with fraudulently obtaining huge amounts of money from the Gollin group of companies. I think he is now serving a prison sentence of 16 years for that. He was a close associate of the Prime Minister at the time when he was a shadow Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Mr Yamamoto, a citizen of Japan and an employee of Toyomenka (a trading partner of Gollin's) for 20 years-plus, was stationed in Sydney for Toyomenka during the period February 1972-August 1975. He told the court-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will conclude by mentioning them again. Let us have a look at the transcript. In New South Wales there was a lengthy inquiry into the question of funding political parties. Part of the evidence which was agreed to unanimously was the overseas experience. I will quickly mention the situation in some countries. We are told by the honourable member for Mitchell that some of them are terrible countries, from a democratic point of view. The report from the Joint Committee of the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 3.4.1. Arrangements for the public funding of election campaigns in the Federal Republic of Germany are enshrined in the Political Parties Act of 1967. </PARA>
<PARA>The system has operated in Austria since 1975. In Italy legislation was enacted in 1974. Sweden introduced the payment of subsidies to political parties in 1965. Norway has given financial support to national organisations of political parties since 1970. In Denmark legislation regarding political funding has operated since 1969. It has operated in Finland since 1967. No date is given for Israel. In Canada legislation has operated since 1974. It has operated since 1976 in the United States of America for the presidential elections, following the scandal about where Mr Nixon got the money for his election campaign. I will quote from the general summary which is agreed to by all members of a bipartisan committee. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a vast number of States and provinces which enjoy a system of public funding. These systems exist within national systems, sometimes as a complement, sometimes based on distinct principles. The State or provincial systems have been the trailblazers for public funding in their nation. In the United States, for example, forty-nine of the fifty States have a system of disclosure and many long preceded Congressional action on many aspects of public funding and regulation of election abuses. The provinces of Scandinavia and West Germany have impressive systems now enjoying bi-partisan support. In Austria, there are 750 municipalities funding elections through the local town halls. There are something like one thousand systems of public funding and disclosure in different political units across the world. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SH4">Dr KLUGMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, but the factual part was agreed to by both sides, not the final recommendation. One thousand systems all over the world in democratic countries have public funding of political units. It is quite ridiculous to argue that, in some way, it is an undemocratic thing to do. Whilst the United Kingdom does not have an extensive system of funding, in fact, it has significant funding. I will come to that in a minute. I will quote from a book written in 1972, which is quite some time ago. The New York Times correspondent, Anthony Lewis, writing from his post in London in 1970, wrote in his article 'From the Vantage Point of Europe':</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> American permissiveness on money and politics seems almost Roman in its decadence. The thought of allowing politicians to sell themselves in spot advertisements on television would be revolting in Britain or anywhere in the established European democracies . . . </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SH4">Dr KLUGMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anthony Lewis, writing from London for the New York Times in 1970 said that. The article continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> European and other modern democratic nations have had to wrestle with the same problems of escalating political campaign costs and the degradation of the democratic dialogue we have experienced in the United States. In general they have been much more successful that we have in controlling costs and upholding the level of campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important to remember that all over the world people who basically believe in democracy and who basically believe in the effectiveness of elections believe that there ought to be public funding of election campaigns. There has been scandal after scandal. I have mentioned already the case involving Gale and the Liberal Party and the $25,000. The previous leader of the Liberal Party in New South Wales, John Mason, very prominently announced, though he never took it up while still leader, that he was offered either $1,000 or $5,000 per week-I have forgotten how much, although it was a huge amount of money-in order to keep casinos illegal. We are told also by the honourable member for Mitchell that the Liberal Party members of parliament do not involve themselves in the processes of collecting money for election campaigns. Let me quote from the Sydney Morning Herald of 12 September 1981, in which there was a write-up about the troika of the National Country Party. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>a liberal minister who canvassed funds in Melbourne before the 1977 election found that Nixon--</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Primary Industry-</PARA>
<PARA>had beaten him to most of the likely contributors. 'He didn't leave anything for the Liberal Party,' the minister laments. </PARA>
<PARA>All over the world in democratic countries there is a trend towards the public funding of political campaigns. I was going to quote an instance in France but I will not have time to do that. I think it is terribly important to remember that the Federal Government's only power in relation to this matter is that it can introduce free television and broadcasting time during election campaigns, for political parties on some fair and acceptable basis. The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), who will follow me in this debate, asked me to repeat the four propositions that should govern the funding of political parties. They are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. To limit or, ideally, to eliminate corruption. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. To force parties to reveal their sources of income in order to clarify to the electorate what kind of interests their financial supporters represent. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. To reduce the advantage that may be derived by certain groups or individuals from their command of superior financial resources. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. To reduce, limit or control the costs of politics generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take issue with the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) in strongly supporting this motion. I do so by looking at the points that the honourable member for Prospect has enunciated as being worthy of gathering support for the opposition to the proposition that the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) has moved and which I support. The motion states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) deplores the funding of political parties for the purposes of elections, because it reduces the funding for housing, health, education, handicapped and early childhood programmes;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) endorses as a prerequisite the holding of referenda to allow the expression of public opinion on the funding of political parties for elections;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) recommends that the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act be amended to take into account election funding when examining relativities between the States for revenue sharing, and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) proposes that the Federal Government investigate the possibility of immediately reducing general revenue grants to States which adopt election funding by amounts equal to that spent by State Governments for funding political parties. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion deals with the way in which the principle ought to be implemented, and that is by way of a referendum when people have had an opportunity to express a genuine point of view on whether an election should be publicly funded or not. It recommends also ways and means whereby this Government and this Parliament might express a point of view on the rather hypocritical way in which the New South Wales Government has cried poor mouth on the one hand and, on the other hand, has delved into the public purse to fund its election campaign on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply draw to people's attention the sorts of statements that were made not so long ago by the Premier of New South Wales. At the Premiers Conference, he was quite prepared to launch a vigorous attack on the new tax sharing deal with the claim that New South Wales was left short of funds. He was vicious in his comments. I draw the attention of honourable members to a headline which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday 5 May which stated 'Hospitals and schools will suffer'. He was as much aware as we are of what happens when one starts to fritter money away on frivolous exercises such as this at a time when it is not all that easy for State governments. He was as much aware as we in this House are of the nature of the expenses that are involved in the public funding of elections and the extent to which the State will be limited in meeting other demands. </PARA>
<PARA> In Parramatta, the area from which the honourable member for Prospect and I come, there is a hospital which we are to lose shortly. We will lose it because the State claims that it does not have sufficient funds. That is the fact of the matter. It is threatening to close down casualty wards in hospitals all over the State. The expenditure of $2m by the State Government would keep some of those casualty wards open. We hear complaints about the State Government having to charge fees in psychiatric hospitals. An amount of $2m would make a significant dent in that area. We have heard complaints about the need, on the State Government's part, to reduce its expenditure contributions to child care. Yet $2m would have a significant impact in that area and garner for the State additional public funds which would enable those facilities to be expanded and recurrent expenditure to be met. </PARA>
<PARA> The family day care programs have been cut down. We have heard the same claim that the Government does not have sufficient funds for schools. In the area in which the honourable member for Prospect lives-it is quite close to my own area-the schools at Burnside and Oaklands have lost staff. The school at Burnside, which is just around the corner from the honourable member's home, is likely to close. These facilities are at risk, and teachers and support staff are likely to be lost because the State Government claims that it has insufficient funds. We have seen the sorts of promises that are made in relation to first home buyers. Just imagine how much further they could be extended if the State Government used the funds that were available from this source to supplement those funds that are already available. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the situation in which police stations have been put on part time roster. What a disgraceful state of affairs. Just around the corner from the home of the honourable member for Prospect at Ermington we have a police station operating part time; police cannot be mustered because the Government is not prepared to make available sufficient funds to keep that station open. These are the sorts of events that have been taking place in New South Wales over the last few years under this New South Wales Government while it has frittered money away on such matters as the public funding of election campaigns. That is not the half of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Prospect sought by way of rebuttal of the proposition put by the honourable member for Mitchell to look at a number of expenditure items of this Government. He raised, firstly, the issue of the Government Information Unit; secondly, the question of Ministers' staff; and, thirdly, the overseas obligations of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) as the principal representative of this country. I take the same argument that the honourable member has raised and put it in the context of New South Wales. Does the honourable member for Prospect seriously want us to look at that other expenditure item which I was not proposing to raise in this debate; that is, the Premier's own information unit, his important publicity machine which has been used to promote his image in New South Wales? In the Premier's Department we have these vital public servants: Five special advisers, one chief Press secretary, four research officers and two assistants, one advertising manager, two journalists, one videotape editor, one videotape technician, an officer in charge of the ministerial Press office, a second in charge of the ministerial Press office and 18 ministerial Press officers. </PARA>

I did not complain about that. On top of that the Premier of New South Wales goes overseas from time to time. They were the matters of rebuttal raised by the honourable member for Prospect. They have absolutely no validity at all in relation to the Federal Government.

The honourable member for Prospect endeavoured to say that there was not a great deal of money involved in this, that it was an important point of principle and that we ought to recognise that there was some justice in this proposal because it would enable advantages-I think that is the word the honourable member used-which might be gained from obtaining funds from private sources to be removed from a particular party. I must say that what worries me is the advantage that has been gained by the particular party in government in New South Wales as a result of the public funding proposals and the way in which that party uses the power of political office. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to gather together the costs to the taxpayers of New South Wales not only in terms of the Budget appropriation item of $2.1m for simply running the scheme and paying the amounts involved to the Australian Labor Party but also the additional costs from the nature of the bureaucracy that has been set up in New South Wales for the purposes of administering this Act. It has to be recognised that significant costs are involved in establishing and maintaining an election funding authority. They are the costs of meetings and the payment of members and alternates who have to sit on the authority. There is the cost of research and publication that is involved in the work of the authority, the cost of maintaining registers, the administrative costs of allocating subsidies and recording disclosures. There are the additional costs of course, of by-elections if they have to be held. There will be legal costs associated with the management of this authority, the accounting and auditing costs of the authority, the costs of staffing the authority, the cost of hiring consultants, the cost of hiring inspectors and carrying out inspections in every political office in New South Wales-that is, not just the principal office of the parties but all of the offices that are involved-and the indirect costs to parties of meeting those legal, recording and auditing requirements. They are significant costs which are not recorded in that one line appropriation but which will have to be met by the taxpayers of New South Wales. It ought to be understood what is involved. It is not just the funding of the Labor Party that is involved; there is also the additional funding associated with the very management of this complex and difficult system that has been established. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the most reprehensible conduct of all in relation to the election campaign in New South Wales. We have seen not only a situation in which the Government of New South Wales is using millions of dollars of taxpayers' money to fund the Labor Party out of its past debts and to fund its present campaign but also the most slick, clever and dirty advertising program involving a State government and the use of State government instrumentalities. What we have seen is a series of government advertisements-not advertisements paid for by public funding but advertisements paid for directly out of the public purse. They are tremendously costly to the people of New South Wales. All of them are blatantly biased and deliberately touting the image of the Premier of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the arguments to support the two referenda proposals which Mr Wran has put up in New South Wales. I have here an advertisement which has been in many newspapers and which has also been repeated on television. It is headed 'A longer term for Parliament makes a lot of good sense'. I am reading from the one which appeared in the Daily Telegraph of Friday, 11 September. It deals with the question of a four-year term for the Parliament. It deals with the question of disclosure by parliamentarians of their financial interests. It goes on to say that those are good proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody would mind the arguments being put forward, particularly as they are supported by the Opposition and the Government, but what one notices is that one sees the glowing countenance of the Premier of New South Wales-the same campaign photograph that is appearing in every political advertisement made by the Labor Party. The advertisement states: 'If you approve, Vote Yes to Both Bills'. The fact of the matter is that if this were to be done in an even-handed way one would, of course, put a photograph of both the Government and Opposition leaders, but that is not to be the case. The fact of the matter is that over a period that has not been the only exercise which has been run out of the public purse and which has promoted the Labor Party's image. We have seen further advertisements. I produce the Daily Telegraph of Saturday, 5 September, advertising Carnivale 81. </PARA>

I could go through numerous situations where government advertisements with the Premier's photograph all over them are being used to advertise the Premier immediately before an election. These advertisements that we have seen have been produced by the Department of Industrial Development and Decentralisation, the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, the Department of Attorney-General and Justice and the Housing Commission of New South Wales. As well we have the railway advertisements which have the little sing-along ditty that public funding did not have to pay for and which promotes the Government's so-called achievements in public transport. This is the way in which the Labor Party in office seeks to advantage itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to give the House some details of the cost involved to the people of New South Wales. We have seen $576,000 spent on the Labor Party's election campaign on Sydney television. On country television we have seen over $300,000 spent as well as money spent advertising on radio, in the metropolitan Press and the country Press. The total is probably of the order of $1,199,000. The Labor Party claims that its campaign will cost $1.1m, of which it expects public funding to pay for $750,000. The Labor Party will get that amount from the central fund but in addition it will get of the order of $375,000 from the electorate fund for Labor Party candidates. We have a situation in which the Government's advertising-I have dealt with this matter in the debate-will cost something in the order of $1.25m. The referendum advertising, which is heavily slanted towards the Labor Party and Mr Wran, will cost over $1m. If these sums are added to the amount which I have suggested is being spent on the Labor Party's campaign, we see something of the order of $3,350,000 of public funds being spent on promoting the Labor Party. </PARA>

The purpose of the motion, of course, is quite apparent. Its purpose is to attempt to get some benefit from this issue for the coalition parties in New South Wales at next Saturday's election. In that election the coalition parties will be slaughtered, and honourable members on the Government benches in this House know that that is so. It was my privilege to be on the side of the Premier of New South Wales and supporting the Government in New South Wales for two years before I became a member of this Parliament. The people in New South Wales will vote sensibly next Saturday, as they did on previous occasions, because they know that the members of the New South Wales Government are honest and honourable men.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On occasions such as this I wish that the operation of the Parliament was televised. I draw to the attention of those people who are listening to the proceedings on their radios the fact that there has been considerable hilarity on the part of Government members about this matter. In fact, when the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) was moving this motion initially those honourable members who were sitting on the Government side were giggling like school children. They knew the purpose for which the motion was introduced and they were taking some strange, distorted form of relish from the procedures that were taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The people in New South Wales are aware of the fact that this decision by the New South Wales Government, which has now been implemented, represents another very substantial step forward in the great traditions of democratising society. For example, we could go back to the claims that were made by the Chartists. One of their claims, one of their demands, was payment for members of parliament. Prior to that there was no opportunity for ordinary members in the community to represent constituents within the national and State legislatures. On that occasion, all the forces of privilege within Western societies fought as strongly as they possibly could to prevent the claims and the demands of the Chartists being achieved, but they were achieved. As I have said, this provision is another step forward in the democratisation of parliamentary institutions and procedures in Australia, because we are lagging years behind so many other advanced industrial Western societies. </PARA>
<PARA> Is there any substantial difference between the Government funding the operation of an electoral booth to make it possible for people to cast a sensible vote and funding the projection and promotion of policies by political parties to make it possible for the electors to come to some sensible and reasoned decision? This is the issue which fundamentally concerns members of the Government. They know that as a result of the dirty little deals they do in back rooms, getting together the massive funds which are at their disposal, they are able to embark on massive advertising campaigns. Often they are corrupt and lying advertising campaigns, such as we had in the last election. The Government deliberately misrepresented and distorted a question of capital gains tax when it said that the Australian Labor Party, of all parties, a social democratic party, would contemplate taxing people on the basis of their own homes. Yet that lie was perpetuated. The Government persisted with it, and unfortunately sufficient numbers of people in Australia were confused by it. For that reason it was a very smart political act, a very smart political trick. Of course, the Goverment had the sorts of funds necessary to finance that type of campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extraordinary that this motion should be brought into the House in the last week of the election campaign when it has not even become an issue in New South Wales. The Liberal leader, Mr McDonald, has refused to raise it because of his own seedy record in respect of fund raising. For his own election campaigns he and his State electorate council participated in organising dirty little illegal gambling fiascos in back sheds in some of the suburbs of his electorate. That is on record. Is it preferable that funds for political parties be raised in such a way? That is the position the Government and spokesmen for the Government are adopting in relation to this question. The Liberals prefer funds to be raised at gambling nights and as a result of deals they do with companies. Do they deny that in 1977 substantial funds were given to them by IMB Australia Ltd which brought about a reconsideration of tenders for computer contracts, or that recent changes to the Broadcasting and Television Act were brought about by payments made to the Liberal Party by Rupert Murdoch? Is that denied by them? The National Country Party is also in the pay of multinational companies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is another frivolous point, but I would like that point to be made. I chose to come into this Parliament; I resigned from the New South Wales Parliament. Some members who sit on the Government side of the House came here after having been defeated in the New South Wales Parliament. One of them is even a former Leader of the Opposition. The same thing will happen to the present Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales this Saturday. He will be done like a dinner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia is the only advanced industrial democracy, with the exception of Great Britain, that does not have a working system of public funding of the political process. In Britain the Labour Government was looking to implement the Houghton committee of inquiry report which recommended public funding for British elections. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has described, as have other members on the Government side, the New South Wales legislation as corrupt. Perhaps when he parades on the world stage as a statesman he tells President Reagan that he was elected under a corrupt system because his election was funded by public funds. Does the Prime Minister tell Mr Trudeau in Canada that he was elected under a corrupt system because Canada's elections are funded by public funds at all levels of government? Does he tell Chancellor Schmidt in West Germany that he was elected under a corrupt system? Does he tell President Mitterrand in France that he was elected under a corrupt system? And so the list goes on. Australia is lagging behind in one of the most important steps in democratic development that was undertaken by so many other advanced countries so long before. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of this proposal in New South Wales is only 22c per elector per annum, the cost of the postage stamp before the most recent increase. The total cost is less than $2.2m. If we are to talk about spending priorities, the Budget that the Parliament is in the process of considering indicates that during the last 12 months the international tourist who masquerades as the Prime Minister in this Parliament spent in excess of $5m out of the taxpayers' pockets to fund his overseas jaunts. The honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) has already said that the Prime Minister spent $40m for two VIP jets, yet he went to the Royal Wedding in London on a commercial flight. In addition, $5m has been spent on the Fraser Government's Government Information Unit which is now on public record as having been used for party political purposes. What about the $150m cutback that this Government imposed on the New South Wales Government in hospital funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberals are not concerned about public funding as an issue. They are concerned about the provisions of the law that relate to disclosure. The law will mean that any candidate who receives more than $200 will have to disclose its source. any party which, at a general level, receives a donation of more than $1,000 will have to disclose its source. The Liberals do not want to acknowledge that they receive large donations from oil companies and the National Country Party does not want to acknowledge that it receives large donations from mining companies. In the McPherson by-election the National Country Party spent more money than the Australian Labor Party is spending on the whole State election campaign in New South Wales. This motion refers particularly to the need for a referendum to be held on this question. The greatest referendum that can be held will be held next Saturday. We know what the results will be. I have already said that the people of New South Wales will reaffirm the wise political decision they made on the previous occasion. The Wran Government will be re-elected. One of the issues that will exercise the minds of people in New South Wales is public funding. </PARA>
<PARA> If the people in New South Wales want to ensure that adequate funds are available to all political parties, to make sure that their funding comes from on top of the table, not from dirty deals under the table and that the sources of funds available to political parties are adequately disclosed so that the electors themselves know where the funds are coming from and where the perks may otherwise have been going to and if the electors in New South Wales reendorse, as they will, the Wran Government next Satuday, they will endorse a most significant step forward in the democratisation of New South Wales. When this Government and this Parliament have the same courage and concern to introduce this measure it will be a major step forward in the democratisation of the Commonwealth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I continue my speech on the Budget by again emphasising that Government members quote selective statistics in a dishonest attempt to portray Australia as a dynamic and prosperous country. Nowhere is such dishonesty more evident than in the area of unemployment. I repeat my question to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown): What will happen to the young first offenders referred to the Knox Community Youth Support Scheme group by local police and magistrates? The answer is stark and tragic; obviously they will end up in a penal institution. The Minister's claim that the young people displaced from CYSS will be accommodated by the new training schemes is just not true. Apart from the fact that the new training programs are not sufficiently extensive to provide places for the young people from CYSS, why destroy a scheme which has been so valuable in providing opportunities for personal and social development for unemployed youth? The decision to abolish CYSS was inhumane and the abrupt closure of the scheme on 31 October is also causing great uncertainty for both the CYSS project officers and the young people who rely on their help. I urge the Minister to reinstate the scheme. I can only hope that the newspaper reports are true and that, as a result of the overwhelming appeals from all over Australia, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is also considering reinstatement of the scheme. Another inhumane decision was the failure of the Government to increase the unemployment benefit of $36 per week for under 18-year-olds. It is an appallingly inadequate amount for young people who live away from home and those from the country, being $37 per week below the poverty line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the area of health where the total Commonwealth Budget outlay is $4,023m-an increase of 10.2 per cent over the outlay for 1980-81. This increase hides the sheer incompetence of a government which ended the widely popular and equitable universal health scheme of Medibank despite a promise to retain it. The William Angliss Hospital is the only public hospital in La Trobe and it ended the year with a deficit which will have to be carried into the next financial year. Unless the William Angliss Hospital receives additional funding, there is no doubt that increasingly it will have to restrict its services to the public. Such a restriction obviously will not concern the Government as it is attempting to compel the States to impose means tests in their public hospitals. Another appalling aspect of health care is the withdrawal of support for community health centres, a withdrawal which has been encouraged by the health policies of this Government. It is disgraceful that there are no community health centres in my electorate where there are over 1,430 people to every medical practitioner in comparison with 580 people to every medical practitioner in inner Melbourne. With community health funding virtually entirely absorbed in the block grants to the States, the future for community health is exceedingly bleak. The Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) has had the audacity to claim that the new health scheme is a responsible scheme. Does the Minister consider that it is responsible to introduce what amounts to a compulsory health insurance levy which will cost many families up to $11 extra per week? It is a flat rate tax in disguise which instead of being paid to the Government, is going straight to private health funds. Perhaps the Minister means that it is responsible to introduce a health scheme which is so complex that many pensioners and chronically ill patients are uncertain whether they are entitled to a Pensioner Health Benefit Card. The truth is that the new health scheme is confusing and archiac, and charges from the Minister that the Opposition is not dealing with the substance of the new arrangements are nonsensical, if not downright dishonest.</PARA>
<PARA> Social security is another area where the Budget provisions indicate a blatant disregard by the Government for the people who are in greatest need. Both the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and the previous Minister have claimed that pensioners are ensured social justice under the provisions of their Government. Whilst it is true that pension rates increase in line with the movement of the consumer price index, it is also a fact that the increase lags six months behind the June and December CPI figures. By the use of this skinflint accounting procedure the Government saves about $90m this year at the expense of pensioners. It is estimated that last year this lag in the increase cost pensioner couples $172. Does the Minister consider that this represents social justice? Another skinflint policy of the Government is the imposition of the means test on the over 70s who were free of means-tested pensions in 1978. Those who cannot pass the test are now receiving $18.25 less per week than other pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the Minister is out of touch with the people. He needs to get out in the electorates and to talk to the community support groups. The volunteers who work in the welfare agencies, particularly those who provide emergency relief, are stretched to the limit and both financially and physically are reaching breaking point. Each day thousands of people throughout the country are crying out for emergency assistance to prevent family breakdowns, starvation, untreated disease, eviction and violence. For these people there is the daily fear that they will not be able to obtain the basic necessities of life of food, shelter and clothing. The claim by the Minister for Social Security that the Government is assisting those in greatest need rings hollow in the ears of those people working in the welfare agencies. In my electorate the number of people in need has increased steadily over the past five years. There was an increase of over 20 per cent last year. Members of the Maroondah Upper Yarra Valley support team which co-ordinates emergency relief agencies in the outer eastern region of Melbourne have recently conveyed their concern to me regarding the lack of adequate emergency relief funds. Income security and maintenance is a responsibility of the Commonwealth Government and a comprehensive income security system must include the provision of adequate emergency relief funds as a necessary component of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of social security which I want to mention concerns the initiatives provided for disabled people. The program of aids for disabled people announced recently by the Minister for Health, to cost $2.4m, is woefully inadequate. Victoria is to get only $600,000. This amount is a disgrace in a year which is the International Year of Disabled Persons. Even in the overall Budget there is still no real recognition by the Commonwealth Government that disability carries extra cost which must be compensated for if disabled people are to have equal opportunities in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally in the area of social security is the failure of the Budget to provide much-needed funds for children's services. There is a particular concern in the municipalities of my electorate which contains a high proportion of young children and young parents. In the city of Knox, 80 per cent of the population in 1976 was under 40 years of age. At a recent meeting of outer eastern region municipalities, a number of municipality representatives expressed to me their deep concern at the lack of government funding for pre-school and infant welfare centres. The levels of subsidy assistance are just not keeping pace with the escalation in costs and the population growth of a rapidly developing area. There is no hope in this Budget for the young parents in my electorate, as the Minister has made it clear that there will be no money for new programs and services next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Housing is another area of this Budget which gives no hope for people in need. Two-thirds of the people in the electorate of La Trobe are buying their own homes, but with crippling interest rates of at least 12 1/2 per cent they are finding it increasingly difficult to meet their mortgage repayments and their other day to day commitments. High interest rates are a product of the overall economic policy of the Government. The Treasurer has estimated that there will be an inflow of $7,000m in 1981-82. He claims that this money is being used for resource development, but based on our experience of 1980-81 it can be anticipated that three-quarters of this inflow will be entirely speculative in nature; it will be speculation in real estate, in the share market and in the exchange rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Some foreign money has been used also for the takeover of Australian businesses. The Government, in order to make room for this inflow, is holding down the domestic supply. In consequence, with the high demand for funds from business corporations and semi-government authorities, interest rates are rising. It is the lack of government control of foreign investment which is causing home buyers to be crippled with increasing interest rate rises. The Federal Government has withdrawn from its housing responsibilities, and this is particularly evident in the area of public housing. The Budget shows that Federal housing expenditure has been reduced from 1.9 per cent in 1974-75 to 1 per cent of total Budget outlays in 1981-82. This is an appalling record, and, to cap it all, the imposition of the 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on building materials and furnishings could add up to $1,000 to the price of establishing a home. </PARA>
<PARA> Education is another area of this Budget which indicates the user pays policies of the Government; policies which are creating two classes of people in Australia-on the one hand the privileged users who have the money to pay for the best in health, education, housing and transport, and on the other hand the underprivileged who do not have the ability to pay and who must rely on government facilities to provide them with welfare, health and education. The Budget figures point the way quite clearly, with the 1982 general recurrent grant for government schools stabilising at $269.2m but the general recurrent grant for non-government schools increasing by 11 per cent to $414.1m. That is in spite of the fact that 77.7 per cent of our nation's children attend government schools and only 22.3 per cent attend private schools. These figures indicate a deliberate transfer of recurrent funds from public to private education. The allocations of capital grants indicate the same pattern, with a cut of 5 per cent for the government schools capital program in 1982. This latest cut means that the total government schools capital program has been cut by 36 per cent since 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me translate these figures into the realities of the education scene in my electorate. Many of the schools are operating in portable and other sub-standard classrooms, and those school buildings which are comparatively new are now being badly affected by the lack of maintenance funds for the undertaking of essential repairs. In addition, many small primary schools are unable to offer adequate classes in art, physical education, music and library studies because of the absence of specialised staff. Cutbacks have been made in the provision of emergency teachers, and this has resulted in the cancellation of many school camps and excursions. In some cases there has also been a cancellation of classes. </PARA>
<PARA> Having dealt briefly with some of the educational problems in my electorate, I shall now refer to one of the most irresponsible of decisions made by the razor gang-that is, the decision that nine colleges of advanced education in Victoria are to be consolidated by 17 August, or are to have their funding cut completely. This decision was made without any educational or financial rationale, apparently in the blind belief that wholesale amalgamations will save money. It is a decision which has thrown staff, students and educational planners into a state of chaos. It seems that now, indicating the typical ad hoc planning of the Government, the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) has recognised the enormity of this blunder, and at the last minute has backed down. The colleges will be financed for another 12 months from a special trust fund. The colleges are now left in a position of insecurity, still under financial threat but with a breathing space of 12 months. This situation must severely undercut any commitment to long term planning and educational efficiency in Victoria. Educational forecasters have been presenting clear evidence for some time that there are already teacher shortages in the areas of maths and science in Victoria. The shortfall in the total number of Victorian teachers in 1982 will be at least 600, rising to 1,400 in 1984-hardly an appropriate educational climate to threaten and financially undermine our teacher training institutions!</PARA>
<PARA> At this point I mention the precarious situation of the Melbourne State College. This College has a reputation for excellence and is an institution which arts students choose before Monash University, La Trobe University or Deakin University. Entrance scores on Higher School Certificate results also are consistently higher than those of the three universities. The College is more frequently nominated as the most preferred institution by diploma of education students than any other Melbourne college or university. The threat to the security and integrity of this College, by the acceptance by the Government of the ill-conceived advice of the razor gang, represents just another example of the Government's sacrifice of the education and social needs of the community. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DI4">Mr MILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member says, it is typical of the Government's attitude towards education and many other areas of policy. Another Victorian institution under threat is the Victorian College of Pharmacy, which is threatened with a 14 per cent cut in recurrent funding. Pharmacy is a high cost course since it has a high component of practical work in each of the biological, physical and chemical sciences. By so significantly reducing the recurrent funding available, the Victorian pharmacy student will be severely disadvantaged educationally compared with his or her counterpart in other States. A reduction in funding of this magnitude must inevitably lead to a lowering of standards of both education and, eventually, the practice of pharmacy in the State of Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The shortsightedness of this proposal is illustrated by a consideration of the activities of this College. Self-help-a virtue extolled by the Government-on the part of the College has led to the formation of an academic interface company, the Institute of Drug Technology Ltd, which is self-funding and provides a surplus to the College for supplementing research funding. This company employs its own staff and has carried out projects which include the manufacture, under State licence, of two drugs for human use, a synthetic drug candidate research program and an analysis of 2,4,5-T residues in streams and rivers. Work in this area, which contributes directly to the community, will be affected by the large cut in recurrent funding for the Victorian College of Pharmacy over the next triennium. This will be due to a reduction in standards of the College staff and a failure of industrial pharmacists to recognise potential problems with which the Institute could be of assistance. Thus, the Institute of Drug Technology Ltd, which maintains the utilisation of College resources, will return a lower surplus for use by the College. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time I have had available I have endeavoured to draw to the attention of the House the major deficiencies of this most heartless Budget. I reiterate that Government Ministers and members deliberately manipulate statistical information in the debates in this House in order to present an entirely false picture of the Australian people enjoying an unparalleled period of prosperity and security. One has only to conduct interviews with any group of electors in the capital cities of Australia to discover that they are highly critical of the policies and attitudes of the Government. It is a government which has demonstrated, by the razor gang decisions and by a series of heartless and depressing Budgets, that it completely lacks a sense of social justice. We have a Prime Minister who rightfully has been called the Robin Hood of the wealthy and the privileged; he robs the poor to help the rich. In the areas of employment, health, social security and education, the Government is following policies which must intensify the problems of rising living costs for the average Australian family. With the additional burden of rising interest rates, the impact of health insurance costs and the massive increase in sales taxes, this irresponsible Budget will add many more Australians to the ranks of the three million people who are presently classified as disadvantaged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regard the Budget now before the House as a document that has been prepared with the long term welfare of Australia in mind. As with most responsible Budgets, no doubt it has displeased a number of people within the community but I am hopeful that its implementation will result in a reduction in interest rates, which rates are presently plaguing young home buyers, and will assist in the control of inflation. However, it is no use the Federal Government bringing in a Budget which reduces borrowing if the State governments do not follow suit. Although I regard the Budget as a responsible document, there are a few matters about which I would like to comment as they are of considerable importance to my electorate and, no doubt, to other electorates throughout Australia. The order in which I place these matters is no reflection on their comparative importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my short experience in the Parliament I have encountered few organisations that show such a depth of understanding of what they are about or as much concern for their cause as the Isolated Children and Parents Association. Whilst it has been in operation for only 10 years, very few other groups would have such a comprehensive overview of education within Australia and of the problems of educating young people living in the isolation of the outback. Because of its work in bringing to the Government's notice its problems, the Government has over a number of years provided basic allowances free of a means test for eligible students who are boarding away from home, studying by correspondence or living in a second family home close to school facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme also covers children regarded as isolated for reasons of medical or social disability. It is pleasing, therefore, to see that as from the beginning of 1982 the level of family income above which allowances are reduced will be increased by 7 per cent and 14 per cent in regard to additional boarding and special supplementary allowances respectively. In addition the special supplementary allowance for eligible senior secondary students will be increased by 10 per cent. It is estimated that the scheme will cost $16.7m in 1981-82 compared with $14.5m in 1980-81, and that assistance will be provided for 19,170 children. The Government will be introducing a three-year pilot program costing about $4m to provide on loan video facilities to certain isolated students and communities. The advent of the communications satellite will provide another facility for education besides its other roles of communication and the provision of entertainment. It is to be hoped that the ground signal receiving equipment will be made available to people in isolated areas at a reasonable cost, as they already pay dearly for telephone and power charges-where they are available. </PARA>
<PARA> Personally speaking, I was disappointed by the announcement of the cessation of the Community Youth Support Scheme, as in my electorate there are CYSS projects operating in Griffith, Leeton and Deniliquin and all are doing an excellent job for the young unemployed. It was comforting to hear of the greatly increased expenditure in job training schemes for the young unemployed and of the assurance given by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) that officers of his Department will be visiting all CYSS projects before 1 October to ensure that these people presently catered for by CYSS will be appropriately cared for. This is particularly important in areas where there are no technical college facilities or there are geographical disabilities. The Minister's assurance of his flexibility in this matter is greatly appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the misgivings of a small minority of Government members and the doubts expressed by some members of the Opposition about the scheme, I feel it has served a useful purpose and I know that I would be expressing the sentiments of my colleagues in the Parliament in thanking the various project officers and community groups for their work and concern. In fact, one of the great merits of the scheme is the way in which communities have become involved. It was pleasing to read in this morning's Press that CYSS still has a chance of survival but, as the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs indicated in the House today, the outlook is not as optimistic as the media would have us hope. I am sure many of my colleagues would welcome a scheme similar to CYSS if CYSS must close, as they all feel strongly for those young unemployed in their areas who have particular problems that the normal education and work training systems cannot overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's $225m funding program for 1980 to 1983 for aged or disabled persons' accommodation was implemented under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 and the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972. This money has been contributed, in the case of the Aged or Disabled Persons Act, on a $2 for $1 basis to a maximum limit of $12,100 for single unit accommodation or $14,035 for a double unit plus a maximum of $1,920 per unit for land costs, and may be made to religious and charitable organisations and to local government bodies to meet the costs of erection, extension or purchase of those homes. The expenditure is estimated at $45.6m in 1981-82. Under the Aged Persons Hostels Act, under certain conditions, the Commonwealth meets the cost of hostel accommodation up to a maximum of $18,150 a person for buildings and up to $2,400 a person for the purchase of land. A further $250 is available for furnishings. Expenditure of $58m is provided for 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> Since my election to Parliament, in nearly every corner of the Riverina electorate I have been met by groups expressing the need for accommodation for the elderly. Whilst they realise it is better for the elderly to remain on their own in their own homes for as long as possible, this is not always practicable. Although the Federal Government has made a tremendous contribution in this area, there is still much to be done. The Riverina electorate has received substantial sums for care for the aged. However, the standard letter now received from the Minister states that all the $225m has been committed and that no assurance in relation to funding can be given. This is not the fault of the Minister but an indication that more funds must be provided for the elderly, particularly as this nation has an aging population.</PARA>
<PARA> In the city of Broken Hill, which has a population of approximately 28,000 people, nursing home accommodation is provided by the Sisters of Compassion. They provide care and accommodation for 50 elderly people at the Home of Compassion in south Broken Hill. The Sisters, a catholic order of nuns, care for the elderly with great devotion, but the numbers waiting to enter the home are heartbreaking. The only other accommodation for the elderly who require constant care is provided in the geriatric ward of the Broken Hill and District Hospital where, although the nursing attention provided is second to none, the conditions of the building are far below standard and, because of lack of priority by the State Government, there does not appear to be any possibility in the near future of alleviation of the problem. The geriatric ward caters for 69 elderly citizens. The city does have hostel-type accommodation at Aruma Lodge and home units provided by Southern Cross Homes at the Con Crowley Village, and this accommodation is first class. However, the residents of these units must also ultimately seek nursing home accommodation. So there we have it-nursing home accommodation for 119 people in a population of nearly 30,000 when surrounding districts are included. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is ludicrous, and to add to the tragedy the nearest practical nursing home accommodation is 500 kilometres away in Adelaide. Imagine the heartache of the elderly and their relatives in this situation. Of course, this is not unique to Broken Hill or the Riverina electorate but applies throughout Australia. The point I am making is that because the $225m has been used, we should not stop there. It is a long while before 1983 and the Government must have an ongoing commitment as regards accommodating the aged. This is particularly crucial when local groups are expected and, in most cases, are eager to raise their share of the finance towards the cost of caring for their elderly citizens. Without some ongoing commitment of finance by the Federal Government, local people will lose their incentive to raise money which they may have to return to donors if Federal funding does not become available. It is my hope that the Government will look into this matter so that nursing homes such as the 60-bed unit presently being promoted by the Uniting Church at Broken Hill and other accommodation for the aged will gain greater priority and that there will be an ongoing commitment announced soon for works beyond 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> This year $685m has been provided in Commonwealth grants to the States and the Northern Territory for road works. This was part of the Government's commitment announced in June 1980 to provide $3,650m in road grants over a five-year period to the States and the Northern Territory. The total allocation for New South Wales for 1981-82 is $214.34m. Of this, $103.57m is for national highways, which are totally funded by the Commonwealth Government, $64.5m for rural and urban classified roads and $46.27m for rural local roads. In addition to the finance provided by the Federal Government for rural local roads, local government has the alternative to pay for road works out of council rates, which in New South Wales have a ceiling placed on them, or they can be financed from the untied grants that are paid to local government under a tax sharing arrangement. This year in my electorate there has been approximately a 16 per cent increase in these funds. The only other source from which funds are available is the New South Wales Government local government assistance fund which appears to be on the decline. However, because of other claims on local government finances, there is still not enough money remaining to carry out even essential maintenance, much less construction work. The amounts provided by Federal and State governments for road works sound impressive, but I am convinced, as are the constituents of my electorate, that neither the Federal nor the State Government is spending enough on roads within New South Wales and, in particular, within the Riverina. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year representatives of local government throughout Australia converged on Canberra with the specific purpose of gaining greater funding for road construction and maintenance for their respective areas. I was pleased to see excellent representation of local government from within the Riverina electorate. While in Canberra the delegates met the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) and, although I know the Minister was sympathetic to their problems, he could not offer any hope of greater financial assistance. The stage has now been reached when my electorate is in a desperate situation as far as road funding is concerned and large amounts of money must be channelled by Federal and State government into the system. I am sure that I speak for all my colleagues, particularly those from rural areas, when I say that we will be working towards a greater share of the public purse being placed into road works. I urge our State colleagues to adopt the same attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> The allocation of $35m as part of the National Water Resources Program was particularly welcome. In the Budget Papers this amount was shown as a rural subsidy while it will in fact be used in both urban and rural areas. I hope that some of this money will find its way into the Riverina for salinity mitigation, drainage and flood protection works to continue works already being undertaken with combined Federal and State moneys. The town of Deniliquin is particularly in need of funds at this time for levee bank construction works, but this will depend greatly on State government priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of ever-increasing costs of freight, energy and communications for people living in isolated areas I was pleased to see an increase in relation to the zone allowance for dependants; from 25 per cent to 50 per cent in the case of zone A and 4 per cent to 20 per cent in the case of zone B. As a newcomer to the Parliament and a person who less than a year ago was the single income earner on a medium salary for a family of four teenage children-all of whom were, and still are, attending high school-I know the worries that parents in similar situations are facing today when they hear of increased taxation on clothing, shoes and some of the necessities of life. The position is made more difficult when one is in that situation because if one wants to enjoy the basics that two income families or people on higher incomes take for granted one has to obtain them on hire purchase. With interest rates at today's high levels this makes one's position even more untenable. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in order to obtain a balanced economy so that income taxes eventually can be reduced the Government must find ways of cutting its expenditure. It is interesting to note that outlays on defence pensions and other benefits are to rise this year by 15.8 per cent compared with a rise of only 10.4 per cent in all other outlays. The time has come for the Government to look into some areas which in the past it has been reluctant to approach. One of these areas is family allowances. Many Australian families on low incomes eagerly await their family allowance payments to provide necessities for their children. However, others on high incomes regard the family allowance as a pin money gift from the Government. I have heard many people say that they have never used the family allowance but have banked it for little Johnny or little Joan so that they can have some money in the bank when they get older. Because the family allowance payments are not large it might be that some accumulation is necessary over short periods to make necessary, worthwhile purchases. But I contend that if one can afford to bank these payments over a long period one does not need them. In other words, people on the poverty line could be receiving the same family allowance as, for example, a parliamentarian, a Queen's Counsel or a company director. Paying the family allowance to families on high total incomes is giving money away. Therefore, a means test is required for the payment of the family allowance. This may not be politically popular but it would allow more money to be made available for distribution in other welfare areas that are short of funds. No fairminded Australian could object to this proposal. In a similar way other outgoing payments of the Government could be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people oppose the Government's policy on sales tax for political reasons. Others are genuine in their concern. I support the Government only on the basis that in the not too distant future the decisions announced in this Budget will benefit those families that find themselves struggling today by reducing inflation and bringing down interest rates. If they do not then my attitude must alter. </PARA>
<PARA> A warning has been sounded by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) that the capital inflow into this country has slowed. At the same time the current account deficit has continued to grow. We cannot continue to depend on massive capital inflows from overseas. The Deputy Prime Minister pointed out that overseas trade is crucial to Australia's well-being. With the short term trade prospects deteriorating and long term outlook uncertain, it is imperative that this nation remain competitive. This means that any increase in inflation will pose a serious threat to our nation's welfare. This Budget has been drafted with these facts fully in mind. Other honourable members have eloquently spoken for and against the Budget. Most have referred to the needy, the unemployed and those who do not appear to be sharing in Australia's wealth. I can only hope that the Budget now before the Parliament will, by its thrust, keep this nation, whose economy is the envy of the world, on an even growth pattern so that those people and other Australians will benefit. </PARA>

<PARA>That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'whilst not opposing the Bill, the House rejects the Budget strategy because:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) it deliberately reduces the rate of economic growth;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) it increases unemployment;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) it adds substantially to the rate of inflation;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) it relies on a massive private capital inflow;</PARA>

<PARA> (6) it increases the burden of taxation to the highest level in our history,</PARA>
<PARA>and, in addition, deplores the Government's callous disregard of the millions of Australians living in poverty and its continued attempt to reduce the living standards of the great majority of Australians'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition regards the Budget as deplorable both in regard to the overall strategy on which it is based and the allocative decisions it encompasses within that strategic framework. It demonstrates convincingly not only that this Government has no answer to the scourge of stagflation but also that it has no real concern for the victims of that disease. It demonstrates further-if such demonstration were needed-that this Government is thoroughly dedicated to the task of bringing about a more inegalitarian and divided society. We on this side of the House deplore these developments. We especially deplore and abhor the callous unconcern for millions of Australians in poverty, and the continued and unceasing attempts by this Government to reduce the living standard of low and middle income earners and their dependants who represent the great majority of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Budget strategy is basically nothing more than a policy of contracting the rate of economic growth following a substantial rise in the growth rate in 1980-81 because of concern at rising inflation and interest rates. In order to reduce the pressure for higher inflation and interest rates the Government is aiming at reducing the Budget deficit by around $1,000m, thereby contracting the level of demand in the economy and hence reducing the rate of growth of output and employment. By so doing, the Government hopes to bear down on inflation and particularly wage increases, to which it attributes most inflationary pressure. Also, by reducing the size of the deficit, the Government reduces the size of the public sector borrowing requirement and, thereby, the government demand for funds in the capital market. It hopes by so doing to reduce interest rate pressures. Such policies are said to be compatible with non-farm product growth of 3 per cent to 3 1/2 per cent this year compared with 4 per cent last year. With expected recovery in farm product because of improved export prices and recovery from drought, it is expected that gross domestic product will rise by over 3 1/2 per cent compared with 3 per cent last year. </PARA>
<PARA> We see this strategy as being hopelessly misconceived in several respects. It rests on a false view of the underlying state of the economy. In this there are two aspects. It assumes that the increased economic growth rate last year was attributable to the successful implementation of the Government's economic policies. The Budget Speech is full of self-congratulation in this regard but such self-congratulation is an absolute nonsense. Rather, the recovery last year was attributable to a completely exogenous factor and to three absolute deviations from Government policy. The exogenous factor was the second oil shock-the 150 per cent increase in the world price of oil-which occurred in 1979-80 which made our energy resources infinitely more attractive for development, thus stimulating a massive upsurge in real business investment. A 21 per cent increase in real terms in such investment occurred last year. So much for the exogenous factor. The deviations from policy were, firstly, increased government expenditure in an election year-a politically opportunistic increase of 3 per cent in the real level of government expenditure, well above the normal one per cent rate of growth which has occurred in previous Fraser Budgets-which is a clear deviation from its normal policy. Second was the rapid rise in money supply. The Government's target rate of growth for the money supply was 9 per cent to 11 per cent. But M3, the standard measure of the money supply, grew by 13 per cent and M6, which includes non-bank financial institutions, grew by 16 per cent. This blow out of the money supply growth caused the Reserve Bank of Australia to criticise the Government trenchantly in its annual report for what it saw as the inflationary measures involved and the Government's failure to accept interest rate rises needed to prevent that increased money supply-most of which, of course, occurred from the unprecedented $6.5 billion private capital inflow last year. A further effect of the increased money supply was undoubtedly the stimulation of more growth than would otherwise have occurred. Another of these deviations had this stimulatory effect on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The third deviation was the increase in real wages in 1980-81-the first such rise since 1974. The Government claims there was a 3.9 per cent rise in real wages last year, but this ignores the impact on wage earners of increased interest rates. Even taking that into account, and that there was some increase in the tax burden, the fact still remains that there was a substantial increase in real wages last year. That increase in real wages occurred despite bitter opposition from the Government. It was not part of the Government's policy to increase real wages by almost 4 per cent last year; it occurred totally in opposition to the Government's policy. So the fillip to consumption expenditure and, therefore, to economic growth which stemmed from this real wage rise, was in no way attributable to Government policy. Thus the substantial increase in the rate of economic growth last year is no cause for government complacence or self-congratulation. It was quite demonstrably attributable to an outside influence, that is, the oil shock, and to the failure of the Government to achieve particular Government objectives rather than representing successful implementation of its policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of this false view of the underlying state of the economy is that the Budget ignores the fact that last year the growth was concentrated in the first half of the financial year. We had a 6.1 per cent annual growth rate in the first half of the year and only 1.6 per cent in the second half. Certainly national account figures are subject to revision and the difference between these two halves may be exaggerated in the figures that we have at the present time. But if the national account figures are anywhere near right then this contractionary Budget may well impinge not on a strong underlying growth, as the Budget assumes, but on a fading recovery. If this is the case, the growth of output and employment will be well below Budget estimates and the growth of unemployment will be well above Budget estimates. Already in the last two months we have seen unemployment increase sharply. This gives further cause to fear that the Budget assumption of firm underlying growth may be quite misplaced. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason why we see this Budget strategy as being highly inappropriate is that it relies on more unemployment to keep inflation down. The Budget assumes some rise in unemployment as a result of the falling growth rate in non-farm output and so slow employment growth. It is important to realise that this is not just something that is expected to happen despite the Government's best attempts to prevent it. Rather it is the deliberate intention of the strategy to bring this about. What a sterile and despairing policy this is! Here we have a government which presides over an economy with an official unemployment rate of over 5 per cent and an actual unemployment rate of probably double that amount. Indeed, in a Library discussion paper circulated to all members of this Parliament, Professor Perkins of Melbourne University estimates that the actual unemployment level is 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In this situation of a 10 per cent unemployment rate we have a government which moves in this Budget, as a basic part of its strategy, to deliberately increase the level of unemployment. What a disastrous policy this is. The basic Fraser Government formula for combatting inflation is to create more unemployment. It has been doing this ever since it has been in government. After six years it is still the same appalling and despairing policy. The restoration of full employment, or anything remotely resembling it, is simply not possible from such a policy. This is because, if we do have a pickup in the growth of output and employment, as occurred last financial year, so that unemployment begins to fall, inflation also starts to rise. The Government then moves to slow down that growth rate by the contractionary budget and monetary policies that we now have. So employment growth slows and unemployment increases again. </PARA>
<PARA> The terrible lesson of six years of Fraser Government-it is unambiguously spelt out in this Budget-is that the basic economic strategy that is pursued has made, and will in future make, a restoration of full employment quite impossible whilst that strategy persists. Furthermore, it is clear that more and more unemployment is needed to keep inflation at any given level. Why this is so is too complicated to explain at present. With these kinds of policies we need more and more unemployment to keep inflation at any given level. Hence unless policies are changed we must expect that ever higher levels of unemployment will be incurred. Inevitably what flows from such a conclusion is that new policies and a new means of dealing with our economic problems are needed. Rather than relying solely on fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies to solve these problems, we also need more government intervention in the form of economic planning, of which there is an absolute dearth in this country. We need controls on resource development, for reasons that I will spell out later in this speech. We need prices and incomes policies to enable a less inflationary resolution of conflicting income claims than presently occurs. The development and implementation of such policies will be key elements of the economic policy under the next Labor government. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was explaining to the House the reasons why the Opposition rejects the Government's Budget strategy. A third reason is that, in pursuing its strategy of reducing the deficit to reduce inflation, the Government employs measures which are themselves patently inflationary. An example of this is the health insurance rearrangement, which is about the fifth we have had under this Government. It is said in the Budget Papers that this will have the effect of increasing the consumer price index by some 0.75 per cent in the current financial year. This applies similarly to the sales tax increases, which are well known to the people of Australia by now. It is estimated in the Budget that they will add 0.75 per cent to the consumer price index this year. That, of course, is a patent understatement of the real inflationary effects of those sales tax increases. The full effect will be more like 1.75 per cent than 0.75 per cent. This follows from the figures of the Treasurer (Mr Howard), in his statement to this House on 12 March, when he was rejecting the concept of expanding indirect taxes. He said, at that time, that the reason for doing so was that they would be inflationary and that for every $500m additional revenue raised through increased indirect taxes there would be an addition of one per cent to the consumer price index. He said, in the Budget Speech, that the full year revenue from the sales tax rises would be $890m. So on the basis of those figures we can expect an increase in the consumer price index eventually from these sales tax figures of about 1.8 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Increased State goverment taxes and charges also are attributable to actions of this Government. All the States have been cut back in their funding by this Government and, as a result, are being forced to increase their taxes and charges. They too will eventually feed into the consumer price index and so add to the rate of inflation. So the direct effect of the Government's actions in this Budget is to increase the consumer price index by over 2 1/2 per cent. This includes 0.75 per cent for health insurance, 1.75 per cent or more for sales tax and some unknown additional amount for State government taxes and charges. What follows from this is that the inflation rate for 1981-82 as estimated in the Budget Papers at 10.75 per cent is certainly an underestimate. That figure is for the year on year, 1981-82 over 1980-81. But on the July 1981 to June 1982 Budget basis it is more likely to be a 12 per cent rise, as we estimated it. </PARA>
<PARA> How ironic it is that the action taken in this time of anti-inflation could have such a clear inflationary impact. But, in fact, the inflationary impact is even greater than it first appears because of the impact on inflationary expectations. Nothing is more likely to feed inflationary expectations than rising inflation itself. This is because it encourages people to endeavour to protect themselves against that expected higher inflation, and especially if there is no protective mechanism in place, such as wage indexation. Of course, in the process of protecting themselves by seeking higher incomes, people add to the rate of inflation. They bring about higher inflation. The Treasurer recognised the importance of this indirect aspect in his statement to the House on 12 March. So the inflationary impact of the Government's action are very substantial indeed. It is incredibly ironic that such action has been taken in the name of opposing inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> A further reason why the Opposition rejects the Government's Budget strategy is that it does not attack the interest rate problem at its source. The extent of the interest rate problem is, of course, clear to everyone in the community. We have had a rise in mortgage interest rates of some 3 per cent over the last 17 months, taking them to the highest level ever in our history. The Treasurer is emphatic in his Budget Speech that the cause of increased interest rates is increased demands for funds in the capital market. He claims that the Government must therefore cut its demand for funds in the capital market and thereby reduce the interest rate pressures by reducing the overall Budget deficit. But this is the same policy as he employed last year when, as we are all painfully aware, the policy was patently unsuccessful, as was shown by soaring interest rates. The rapid rise in interest rates last year occurred because the Government did nothing about the real cause of pressure for increased interest rates-that is, the greatly increased demand for funds in the capital market by the private corporate sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the rapid rise in the money supply the demand for funds from the private sector grew so enormously that there was still a shortage of funds. But the Government's response was not to control that private demand for funds but, rather, to reduce the public sector demand for funds. This policy was pursued even though the public sector borrowing requirement was well below the level of previous years. In fact, as a percentage of GDP it was at the lowest level since 1973-74. What the policy amounted to, therefore, was a policy of increasing taxes on Australian taxpayers so as to prevent them from having to pay higher interest rates. Such a policy would have been small comfort even if it had worked. But it did not work last year and we got increased taxes and increased interest rates. The same policy is being pursued again this year, only this time we are to have sharply reduced government expenditure as well as increased taxes. So the Government is again saying to the taxpayers that they should pay more tax and that they should have less government expenditure on their behalf so that they will not have to pay even higher interest rates. Again this will be small comfort even if it does prevent further interest rate rises-but there is no certainty of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether interest rates rise or not will be determined, as it was last year, by the strength of demand for funds in the capital market by the private corporate sector and by what happens to the rate of growth of the money supply. If business investment growth is as strong as the Government forecasts-that is, a real increase of 10 to 15 per cent-then there could be further interest rate rises. Certainly, the Budget figures for the combined corporate sector borrowing requirement and for the public sector borrowing requirement are the same as last year-that is, 5 per cent of gross domestic product. Last year it was 2 per cent of GDP public sector borrowing requirement and 3 per cent for the corporate sector borrowing requirement. This year it is the other way around; the total is still 5 per cent. So the expected demand for funds from these two sources is estimated to be just as strong as it was last year. With the Government stressing its much greater determination to restrict the money supply growth to the target rate of 10 to 11 per cent this year, it would seem that further interest rate rises are a distinct possibility. If the Government were really serious about reducing interest rate pressures it should tackle that pressure at its source, which is the corporate sector demand for funds, and do it by controlling the rate of resource development which is generating this vast demand for funds rather than reducing the living standards of most Australians by increasing their taxes and reducing Government expenditure on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> A further reason for opposing this Government's Budget strategy is that it relies heavily on a massive capital inflow. Last year the private capital inflow was an incredible $6,500m, by far, the highest ever in our history. This year the underlying Budget estimate of private capital inflow is, as the Treasurer admitted last week in questions on the Treasury estimates, an astonishing $7,800m-that is, much bigger than last year. Such vast inflows have substantial significance for the Australian economy. They clearly have impact on the level of foreign ownership and control of our economy. They certainly exert pressure for exchange rate revaluation to the extent that they exceed the balance of payments deficit on current account and thus create structural pressures in the economy, as they did last year with the 10 per cent revaluation. To the extent that they exceed the balance of payments deficit on the current account they also add to the money supply and so create the need for unpleasant offsetting action. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the capital inflow added $2.8 billion to the money supply or about 45 per cent of M3 growth. This year it is estimated to be much the same-that is, about 45 per cent of money supply growth. In effect, what this means is that Australians will be paying directly through higher taxes and a reduction in our already small public sector for this high level of capital inflow. This will come about because the Government is hoping to offset partially the impact of such substantial funds through capital inflow in the economy by reducing the deficit. It does that by increasing taxes and reducing government expenditure. Reliance on such large levels of capital inflow for money supply growth is also quite dangerous. What happens if it does not eventuate, as could well be the case? In that case, the Government has to take offsetting action. If it is slow in doing so, we could have an enormous credit crunch. On the other hand, if it comes in in even larger amounts than was estimated, we could have the need for the Government to take offsetting action by selling more government bonds and therefore bringing about higher interest rates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer (Mr Howard), in formulating this year's Budget, was faced with a situation in which after five years of coalition government the economy was at last showing signs of sustained growth. Through difficult economic circumstances and at times with politically unpopular measures this Government has turned the economy around and we are now starting to reap the benefits. In the last financial year we have seen an increase in consumer demand and consumer spending, reflecting in part the real increase in wages. We have seen a substantial increase in employment. We have seen a small resurgence in the profits of the business sector, which, of course, is the basis of future investment and employment. A new confidence has emerged in the Australian economy, largely brought about by stable and economically sound Government policies. This confidence is most obviously evident in the very large increase in business investment. Many of the problems which have been addressed in this year's Budget are in fact a result of sustained economic growth and confidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the greatest problems for the Australian community at the present time is the increase in interest rates. The rise in interest rates results from the demand for loan funds being greater than the loan funds available, and so interest rates are bid up. The large demand for loan funds has been caused by the confidence of the resource sector and the primary and secondary sector as they all try to expand their businesses or develop new businesses. Unfortunately, the amount of money demanded for this new investment has been much greater than the supply. The Government has limited its own borrowing program in order to ensure that a maximum amount of funds are available for the private sector. Even so, interest rates have still risen. With this in mind the Treasurer has budgeted for a domestic surplus in excess of $1,500m. This Budget surplus will substantially reduce the upward pressure on interest rates. Page 283 of Budget Paper No. 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . for any given set of economic and financial conditions a higher domestic Budget surplus reduces the need for liquidity to be withdrawn from the banking system by way of sales of Commonwealth Government securities to the non-bank sector. In that situation, pressures on interest rates will also be reduced below what they would otherwise be. </PARA>
<PARA>So it is clear that one of the fundamental considerations of this Budget is to produce a sizeable domestic surplus by which means it is hoped that the steam will be taken out of interest rate increases. That domestic surplus has been achieved in two ways: Firstly by restricting the growth of Government expenditure-although I might add that I would have preferred the Treasurer to have gone further in this direction; however, I recognise that that is not an easy task-and, secondly, on the revenue side, growth in employment, profitability of companies and wages will add to increased revenue, together with the sales tax which has been increased or imposed where none was previously payable. An alternative for the Government would have been to budget for a smaller domestic surplus by not imposing the new sales taxes and by reducing, say, personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as I have already pointed out, a reduction in the size of the Commonwealth Government's domestic budget surplus could add to the upward pressure on interest rates and it could well have been the case that any tax reductions for the average Australian taxpayer with a loan or home mortgage would have been absorbed by increased home loan payments as interest rates rose. In other words, the average taxpayer with a home loan might have been worse off if the Government had given tax relief in this Budget instead of applying the tax income to reduce the pressure on interest rates. Looking to the future, it is clear that once the upward pressure on interest rates is removed there will be a great opportunity for the Commonwealth Government to reduce personal income tax rates. I believe care must be taken at that time to ensure that the Government does no cave in to pressure to increase its own expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other matters related to the economy and the Budget which will have to be resolved in the period ahead. I refer firstly to the method of wage fixation. Wages increased over the last financial year at a rate which about 4 per cent greater than the inflation rate. Our competitive advantage in world trade is dependent on maintaining a low rate of inflation and controlling excessive wage demands. Since the end of indexation we have seen a number of extraordinary large wage claims. There is no doubt that these excessive claims threaten future economic growth not only in the resources area but also in industry generally. In a recent article the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), said that organised labour had repudiated any inhibitions upon the exercise of its power to obtain what it believed to be a fair price in the market. The honourable member for Wills suggested that unions would take this course of action because the Government had attempted to free-up the market place by removing some restrictions which were previously imposed on the private sector. Surely that argument by the Opposition can be sustained only if market forces are allowed to play their part in the pricing of labour. With minimum wages, restrictive union membership, closed shop arrangements, restrictions on the freedom of movement of labour and a multitude of other restrictions on the price of labour it is totally unreasonable to suggest that a fair market price for labour can be reached. The honourable member for Wills was probably really suggesting that the unions are more likely to rely on might than right in the market place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, following the end of indexation, will endeavour to find a new basis for wage determinations, and a number of points must be taken into account. The Commission ought to continue to be the basis of wage determinations in this country in order to ensure that all wage and salary earners obtain a fair share of the national cake. The alternative is a wages scramble in which the price of labour is determined by the relative strength of the union regardless of the ability of the industry to pay and regardless of the national interest. The Commonwealth has a role to intervene in national wage case hearings. It seems to me that the Government's role ought to be to put arguments before the Commission relating to the general economic climate as well as the national interest. The Government has a role also to ensure that the rules applying to the union on one side and the employers on the other are fair and just. We must ensure that one side does not have an unfair advantage over the other. In this way the umpire-the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission-can make a reasonable decision. Finally, there must be co-ordination and consultation between the Commonwealth and State governments as public sector employers. The country cannot afford to have one State setting itself up as a wage pacesetter when those decisions become the basis for subsequent leapfrogging deals. </PARA>
<PARA> Another separate but related matter which the Government has to take into consideration in the forthcoming year is the issue of protection. One factor to be considered is the extent to which unions involved in highly protected industries use their position of special advantage to push for excessive wage demands. Other factors of importance are the prospective increases in rural and resource exports, together with the appreciating exchange rate. The Government has recently referred a general reference on tariffs to the Industries Assistance Commission for report. A particular matter which is before the Government is the IAC report on the level of protection to be given to the car industry beyond 1984. Unfortunately, the public debate on this issue has become rather irrational, with exaggerated claims being made on both sides. It is clear to me that if we, as Australians, are going to be able to compete on world markets, we must aim to have as many efficient and world competitive industries as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate about the car industry at present is about the level of tariff which will assist the industry but at the same time continue to provide an incentive for the industry to increase its efficiency and productivity whilst having regard for the consumers and other domestic industries in this country. It is also clear that any change in protection ought to be gradual. Sharp shifts in Government policy shake business confidence and can do irreparable harm to the economy generally. I believe that many Australian industries are efficient and competitive, and there could be many more. For example, there is no doubt in my mind that in recent times, as a result of the IAC report on the white goods industry, that industry has rationalised and is becoming an extremely efficient domestic Australian manufacturing industry. There have already been substantial improvements in the Australian car industry. I believe this current review, together with a gradual reduction in tariffs, will increase the efficiency of the Australain car industry to the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The tariff debate is related to the rates of change and the impact of technological change. I want to refer briefly to a recent report by the Bureau of Industry Economics entitled 'The Long Run Impact of Technological Changes on the Structure of Australian Industry to 1990-91'. That report made the point that there would be a considerable long term cost to the Australian community if we endeavoured to slow the rate of technological change. Such moves would have adverse effects on the growth performance of all industries and would result in lower per capita consumption and wage levels and reduced material living standards. In releasing the report, the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) said that attempts to slow the rate of change 'would be likely to result in higher domestic costs and commodity prices, weaken the international competitiveness of exporting and import-competing industries and lead to a contraction in the level of external trade'. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Even a delay in the rate of adoption of new technology confined to specific industries, will have economy wide repercussions. For example, slowing technological change in the banking or communications industries would be detrimental to the cost levels of all industries, since the services provided by these industries are used by every other industry in the economy. It is short-sighted, therefore, merely to focus on the potential effects of technological change on the industry or sector in which the new technology is adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> The report found that employment in each of the 38 occupational groups studied was expected to grow during the 1980s. The same arguments, I believe, can be used against the maintenance of unrealistically high levels of protection for Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other matters will be the subject of the Government's attention in the next couple of years. Clearly, the current social security system needs to be reviewed. It has become evident that the number of recipients and the cost of the current pension system will increase dramatically over the next decade. Some consideration must be given to how that welfare bill is to be funded and whether benefits ought to be restricted to those in need. The current scheme, which provides an incentive for people to get rid of their capital assets or income-earning assets rather than providing an incentive for people to look after themselves in their old age, must be corrected. Another matter for consideration by the Government is the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System, whose report is to be given to the Government in the next couple of months. This will give the Government an opportunity to review fundamentally the working of the finance system in Australia. It is my hope that it will form the basis of increased participation by Australians in the ownership of our enterprises. This is one of the best ways in which Australians will be able to benefit directly from the development of our country. Such a move would also have the advantage that both Australian companies and the Australian people would share similar goals, which surely would enhance industrial relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, a matter which is being debated in rural Australia is the rules applying to foreign investment in our farmlands. In my view, the rules applying to non-resident foreign investors ought to be clarified and tightened to ensure that Australia's national interest is taken into account before approval is given for large rural land sales to foreigners. There are some cases of purely speculative investment, which I believe is of little benefit for Australians. As I understand it, the States have agreed to co-operate with the Commonwealth in an assessment of the extent and effects of foreign investment in rural land. There are, undoubtedly, cases where development, marketing and employment opportunities may be gained by foreign investment in our rural land. However, Australians must be given a reasonable opportunity to purchase the land. Whilst I understand that the Foreign Investment Review Board has a policy in relation to this matter and is required to be satisfied that the acquisition by a foreign person is not contrary to the national interest, I believe consideration ought to be given to the proposal that the acquisition ought to have some advantages for Australia. In other words, it ought to be positively in our national interests. I support the Budget. It is one entirely appropriate to our current economic circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to second the amendment moved on behalf of the Opposition by our shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). If I have time later I will repeat the actual terms of the amendment. I should like to deal with a number of topics in the Budget, partly because of my own interests and partly because it affects an area in the western suburbs of Sydney, where I live. I wish to deal with the question of the proposed alteration in the function of Parramatta District Hospital, and to some extent this question is also related to the Mater Misericordiae Hospital in North Sydney, a long way away. Last week or the week before members of the Parramatta Medical Board, who are medical practitioners with access to Parramatta District Hospital-not the full time staff but the private medical practitioners-accused the New South Wales Government of genocide, and I emphasise the word 'genocide', in proposing to change the role of Parramatta Hospital to provide rehabilitation and extended health care services. I am afraid that some members of staff, both lay staff and nursing staff, have been carried away by the self-interest of medical practitioners attached to the hospital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I accuse certain doctors of playing a confidence trick on the hospital staff and the general population. Doctors who do not have the qualifications necessary to admit private patients into the new Westmead Hospital in the case of Parramatta District Hospital and the Royal North Shore Hospital in the case of the Mater Hospital, incite the public and staff to keep the Parramatta and Mater hospitals open to deal with acute patients. That is the only way for them to have private patients in a public hospital. They want to use the facilities of public hospitals provided by the taxpayers, put private patients into them and charge them. They use the facilities and staff of those public hospitals and charge the patients as though they are treating them in a private hospital. As I said earlier, they do not have access to Royal North Shore Hospital in the case of the Mater Hospital, which is the nearest, or the new Westmead Hospital, often because they do not have the qualifications necessary. They work up the staff and the public to think that something underhand is being done. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, New South Wales has an adequate number of acute hospital beds. Hospitals should be run for the benefit of patients, not the financial benefits of a few medical practitioners. There have been numerous assurances-I am quite convinced myself-that no member of the staff of Parramatta District Hospital will lose his position. Staff members will have the option of either gaining a job at Westmead Hospital or being able to stay on at Parramatta District Hospital. There will also be openings in new hospitals and extensions in the area. Nobody will be sacked or lose his position. Let me tell honourable members and members of the public at large what is happening in the western area of Sydney. There is a new hospital, undoubtedly the most modern in Australia and probably one of the most modern in the world with the best possible facilities, at Westmead. It has at present 790 beds. This number can increase to 925 if and when that becomes necessary. The hospital at Fairfield has 147 beds; the hospital at Blacktown has 365 beds; the hospital at Liverpool has 337 beds with another 180 to come; the hospital at Mt Druitt to be opened in a couple of month's time has 200 beds; Nepean District Hospital has 249 beds with 100 being added; Auburn District Hospital has 296 beds; Auburn St Joseph's Hospital has 111 beds; the hospital at Bankstown has 340 beds, and the hospital at Lidcombe has 348 beds. There is no shortage of hospital accommodation in the outer western suburbs at present. It is my belief that a significant number of people are in hospital who do not need to be there, but that is an additional argument. </PARA>
<PARA> At present Parramatta District Hospital has 214 beds. It is proposed that at the end of the year it should have 134 beds for acute rehabilitation. It will be mainly for people who have undergone treatment, in some cases major cardiac or orthopaedic surgery, at Westmead Hospital. They will have to be rehabilitated. Westmead Hospital is on the other side of Parramatta Park from Parramatta District Hospital, less than 2 kilometres away. I can understand the worry on the part of staff who have become closely knit and have been attached to Parramatta District Hospital for a long time. Some of them do not wish to move. They do not have to do so. It is quite clear to the public that a huge new hospital has been built at Westmead with the most modern facilities. Few patients having the choice would rather go into Parramatta District Hospital than Westmead Hospital. The emergency casualty department of Parramatta District Hospital will continue to operate in the daytime at least. At night the very modern facilities of Westmead will be available. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of providing and running hospital beds is now immense. I realise that it may not be a fair method of defining the cost to take the total cost of the construction and equipping of the hospital and divide it by the number of beds, but by using this method the cost of providing each bed at Westmead Hospital is over $200,000. The recurrent cost of a hospital bed, excluding capital expenditure, is now approaching $200 a day in an acute hospital. I think that Canberra hospitals have the highest costs in Australia. On average it costs $200 a day per bed to provide the facilities and trained staff necessary to run a hospital. There is certainly no shortage of beds; as I said earlier, a 200-bed hospital is nearing completion at Mount Druitt. By the time the number of beds at Parramatta District Hospital is reduced from 214 acute beds to 134 acute rehabilitation beds the hospital at Mount Druitt will be complete. Hundreds of new beds are appearing in the western metropolitan region. The number is in excess of the recommendations of the World Health Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument has been put repeatedly-I do not want to get involved in it too much-that every area and municipality has the right to have between four and five hospital beds per thousand of population. I think this is true overall for areas such as the metropolitan area of Sydney. But obviously a number of people, for a variety of reasons, who live in the western metropolitan area will still attend hospitals in the city for certain specific conditions. They may have been treated there before and know the doctors there; the doctors know the cases. Patients may have been treated in a particular way at, say, Sydney Hospital or Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Therefore, some of the beds available in the inner city have to be added to those which are available in the western suburbs. I was pleased to see that the New South Wales Minister for Health, Kevin Stewart, is aware of the campaign by the doctors. He referred to their vested interests. In a statement a couple of weeks ago he said that the New South Wales Government:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . will not be intimidated by a campaign based on vested interests of the kind currently being waged by doctors attached to the Parramatta Hospital as visiting medical officers . . . the New South Wales Government has increased the number of hospital beds in the outer western suburbs by 950. </PARA>
<PARA> How that kind of increase in beds can possibly lead to people who were not under any threat 2 years ago, dying now because of inadequacies, is beyond my comprehension. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, I agree with Mr Stewart. To say that this is genocide is ridiculous. As I said earlier, I ask both the lay staff and nursing staff to think very carefully whether they are being conned, especially by the independent candidate who has nominated in Parramatta in the State election and who himself is one of the private doctors affected by the closing of Parramatta District Hospital. They should think for a long time and very carefully before they decide to support that particular person in a political campaign which is firstly, unnecessary and secondly, likely to be counterproductive. I think all of them would agree that a Labor Government will be returned in New South Wales on Saturday. They will obviously have much more say in a Labor Government if in that particular election they return a person who has been an excellent representative, Mr Barry Wilde. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal now with the last point of our amendment. In our amendment to the motion for the second reading of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) we give six points as to why the House should reject the Budget strategy. Our sixth point states:</PARA>
<PARA>it increases the burden of taxation to the highest level in our history. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me show honourable members just how true that remark is. In the last year of the Labor Government, 1975-76, when the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) was Treasurer, Commonwealth revenue was $18.2 billion. That amount has increased to $40.7 billion in the current financial year. That is a huge increase. Between the years 1975-76 and 1979-80 there was an increase in Commonwealth revenue of 62.3 per cent-in other words, money taken to a large extent from the people by taxation. During the same period, the consumer price index increased by only 47.4 per cent. So there was a 62.3 per cent increase in taxation and a 47.4 per cent increase in the consumer price index. That happened under a government which is reducing government services and which claims to be doing so to allow the people to spend more of their own money. In the years 1979-80 to 1980-81, Commonwealth revenue-taxation-increased by 18.6 per cent. During the same period the CPI increased by only 8.8 per cent. There was an increase in revenue of 18.6 per cent and an increase in the consumer price index of 8.8 per cent. The prediction for inflation in the current year is of the order of less than 10 per cent yet revenue goes up by 15.8 per cent, nearly 16 per cent. This Government, which claims to be a small government, is continuously excusing itself for giving less money to the States and for withdrawing from certain programs yet at the same time is spending a huge amount of money, much more money than any other government in the history of Australia and a much greater proportion than any other government in the history of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some argument from people in the community on the question of whether single income families or two income families are better off. To my mind, some of the people who ought to know better and who generally support the poorer groups in the community, are taking the wrong attitude on this matter. They are arguing that the single income family is as well off as the two income family. That is obviously not true as far as taxation is concerned because whilst they oppose-and that is the reason I am raising the matter-the spouse rebate of $830 for single income families where the wife, as is usually the case, is a dependant, it is quite clear that that family is still worse off than a two income family with a similar sort of income. In that case, the tax free threshold is $4,195 for each income earner. In the case of a family with a single income earner that benefit is available only once. In the case of a two income family-and my family is a two income family so there is no special pleading involved; it is not in my interests to mention this-both spouses receive a tax free threshold of over $4,000. That benefit is very significantly greater for the two of them than the tax benefit for one person plus the $830 rebate. Those of us who feel that certain families are paying an excessive amount of income tax feel it is very important that they should be assisted by increasing the spouse rebate to a greater amount than the present $830. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only a couple of minutes left in which to speak. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) talked about what the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission should take into consideration as far as wage earners are concerned and what Dr Isaac should take into consideration when dealing with the matter of doctors' fees which is at present before him. It is important to note that under the present system which commenced on 1 September doctors will have more private patients. The general practitioner will have fewer disadvantaged patients, whom he presently treats for 70 per cent of the common fee. When I say 'presently' I mean before 1 September. He will now either have disadvantaged patients for whom he will get 85 per cent of the fee or he will have patients for whom he can charge the full 100 per cent of the fee. In the case of specialists, a much smaller proportion of patients will be standard ward patients or public ward patients in hospitals. With the introduction of the hospital means test the specialist will now receive a fee for service instead of a sessional fee. So it is terribly important that Mr Justice Isaacs should take those facts into consideration before coming out with his conclusions as to how much doctors' fees should increase. It will probably mean, if it is done fairly, that there will not be a uniform increase across the board but that certain groups of practitioners will receive a bigger increase than others. He may find that some of them are so much better off under the changed system that is, the system since 1 September, that they should not have an increase at all. Again I emphasise that it gives me great pleasure to second the amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not matter what some people are given, they will spend it. They will waste it and will not be able to handle it. It is precisely the same thing with the Budget. It will not please everybody. But unfortunately, sometimes the people who really need the assistance do not get it. In some situations, people who do not really need it get it. The Budget will always be unpopular. I have been listening to the speeches on the Budget of many of my colleagues and of many on the Opposition side. I can understand that it is politically wise for the Opposition to knock the Budget, to smash it to pieces, to use it as a battering ram, to use it as a tool with which to undermine the Government. I am afraid that is part and parcel of politics. I have been very interested also in the different groups that have been formed within the Australian Labor Party and even within the Australian Council of Trade Unions-the Left and the Right. The philosophy of the Left is: 'We should have it. It does not matter where it comes from but we want our share'. The philosophy of the Right is a little bit more understanding of the problems we have in Australia today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Howard) has brought down a Budget. I will say exactly what I think about some aspects of it and also some of the limitations that I see inherent in it. It is very easy to stand up here and criticise. It is very easy to accuse someone of being disloyal or of being an ambusher. But if one is sincere a few people may start to listen and understand. Who am I to be critical? It is easy to be a back bencher and to stand up here and criticise. I repeat: If I had the job of Treasurer I may not be able to do nearly as well. Incidentally, that statement applies to some of the previous speakers from my side too. They are great when they can get the words out, but sometimes putting theory into practice it is not as easy as one might think. </PARA>
<PARA> Taking all that into consideration, I would like to say, firstly, that we thought-many of us still think this way-that the greatest enemy of the economy is inflation. I do not mean to criticise the Opposition; what is the use? During that period from 1972 to 1975 the then Government thought that if it spent big and gave away this and that it might indirectly help the needy, the pensioners, et cetera. But in fact it was killing some of those people on fixed incomes as a result of high inflation. Theoretically the business sector at that time might have been holding the reins, but there was bound to be a crash-and it occurred. We saw the problems with high inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The thrust of the Government's policy is to reduce inflation and to keep it at a standard that is the envy of the rest of the world. The present rate of 8.8 per cent, by international standards, is very good. Whilst people may criticise and condemn, I believe that the way in which the Government has gone about trying to correct inflation has been supported by the thinking people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I again refer to some of those within the left wing of the Labor Party who condemn, condemn and condemn and will never be satisfied. They seem to think that if we all have an equal slice of the cake it will make everything nice, smooth and happy for everybody, but we know that that is not the case. We have to remember absolutely if we are to achieve our goal we have to work for it. A lot of criticism is due to the knee-jerk reaction of members of the Labor Party who are always quick to use any unpopular but necessary decision in an effort to stir up public feeling to their own political advantage. Of course, any suggestion of riots, demonstrations or blood running in the street is bound to be sensationalised by the media. We even saw a pre-Budget rally in Hobart organised by a former Catholic priest. Guest speakers were John Halfpenny and a poor elderly pensioner who had led a pretty decent sort of life but believed in the philosophy: 'I should have the same as somebody else'. They stirred up a heck of a lot of trouble. They stirred up the emotions of the people of Hobart. I am afraid that that emotionalism has spread all over Australia. Those emotions have been intensified by stupid statements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, trouble makers. I am a Catholic and I hope that the Catholic Church condemns what has happened within the ACTU. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) will agree with me. There was a split between the left and right sections of the of the ACTU in regard to abortions on demand. I believe that the Catholic Church should support the feelings and aspirations of the majority of the people of Australia in regard to that divisive issue. It has to show its fortitude. If representatives of the Church are prepared to talk about the Mater Misericordiae Hospital in New South Wales they have to be prepared to talk about that issue also. The socialist theory got the people worked up in Hobart and all over Australia. But it just does not work that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any rise in taxation will be unpopular but it should be seen as part of a move to alter the balance of taxes. If it does that and eventually leads to a reduction in income tax levels, surely that is what the people of Australia want. But we have to come up with the goods. We cannot increase the base for indirect taxes and at the same time fail to reduce taxation without expecting a backlash. This Government will have to heed the warning, the feeling and the sentiments that are being expressed in every electorate in Australia. It just cannot keep saying: 'We will do this' and then not do it. It has to come up with an answer. I am afraid that that is a warning the Government should heed.</PARA>
<PARA> If the Government's strategy to relieve pressure on interest rates and to keep inflation under control is correct, eventually we may see a reduction in interest rates. Then, I hope, young people will be able to buy their own homes and the elderly people who have been forced into taking out mortgages or obtaining loans from solicitors will be able to meet their interest payments far more adequately than they are at the moment. Although the Budget has been described by some as restrictive, in the words of the Treasurer, that is an essential part of Government strategy and will help in a major way to ease pressure on interest rates. I hope he is right. He explains that the strategy will not only preserve the hard-won gains of the past but also exploit the potential for greater gains in the years ahead. It would be a catastrophe if the Liberal Party lost government as a result of some of these unpopular decisions we may be making. Could the honourable member for Braddon think of anything worse than having a socialist government? We have heard some of the speeches from our friends on the opposite side. They would not have a clue about what is going on in the market place. They would not have any understanding of what makes this the country that we call a great country. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the decision taken at the ACTU conference in regard to abortion. The divisiveness among members of the ACTU at the moment is indicative of what is going on within the Labor Party-the Left and the Right. They just cannot understand that people are fed up with some of the feelings and aspirations that the left wing element seems to be putting into the Labor Party. We saw an example of it in Victoria when they got rid of Wilkes. They used all the excuses in the world. It was the left wing that got rid of him. That is exactly what is happening with the ACTU today. It is putting its views and feelings into the Labor Party. That is what it is all about. I wonder whether the honourable member for Braddon or the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) could think of anything worse than having a Labor Government in Australia again. </PARA>

Therefore, we as a government have to be extremely careful that we do not lose the middle ground and that we do not underestimate the feelings of the ordinary, average Australian who may think that the Government, to a degree, is not understanding his problems. We have to be very careful because if we do not we could once again be giving Australia to the socialists. I could not think of anything worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At times governments make unpopular decisions in the long term interests of the nation. Responsible governments cannot always give the people everything they want, but on the other hand we cannot afford to ignore the fact that we represent the voters of this country and we must stay in tune with their general expectations. We must never think that we have so much knowledge and expertise that we can forget our role as representatives. That is extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid-I have seen this so often in this place-that some politicians of very high scholastic and intellectual ability are unable to read the feelings and mood of ordinary, average people. They think that everything they say and do is believed and understood. But unfortunately this is not always the case. Whatever the undoubted merits of the overall economic policy of the Government, it is essential that the Liberal Party is seen to have a human face and to be giving priority to ensuring that the average Australian shares in the country's prosperity not only through future resource development but also right now. I was disappointed, as were many other members of the Government, in what we did for the pensioners. I know the internal arguments concerning how much we can afford, how much we can give and how much we can do, but I know that many pensioners are finding it hard to survive today. It is a fact of life. I do not want any members of the Opposition to try to tell me what they have done for the pensioners. I know it is well used by members of the Opposition and well developed within the pensioners' unions that the Labor Party has the answer. In some areas of pensions our Government has a much better record than the Labor Party. Many welfare measures which one may have expected to have been introduced by the so-called protectors of the workers were in fact introduced by the Liberal Party, but members of the Opposition have a very sophisticated way of indoctrinating some of these elderly people into thinking that everything that this Government does is bad.</PARA>
<PARA> There are two major points to be kept in mind concerning the levels of pensioner benefits-whether they are adequate and whether they maintain their real value. Alternatives to the present pension scheme were the subject of an inquiry by a committee under the chairmanship of Professor Hancock. The Hancock committee drew the adequacy line for pensions at 30 per cent of average weekly earnings. Although under our Government pension levels have been slowly moving up, given the findings of the Hancock committee that an adequate level should be 30 per cent of average weekly earnings, we are still not doing enough. We cannot talk about the lucky country or a strengthening economy when a large proportion of our population exists on levels of income below the poverty line. We cannot consign elderly people to a human scrapheap. As we have built up our society we have made decisions that every individual is entitled to education. We have decided that children should not be forced to work. Then we decided that elderly people should not be obliged to work either. We have provided basic adequate medical care free of charge to pensioners. Surely it must follow that they should also enjoy the basic right of an income that is consistent and relative to a decent way of life. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I stress that I do not criticise the overall thrust of the Government's economic policy. I believe that overall the Budget is responsible and in Australia's best long term interest. But if we are to stay in office to achieve the great potential of this country we must show that we intend for all Australians to share the benefits. We must think of the vast number of low income people who cannot keep up with rising costs and whose day to day needs do not allow them to understand the importance of a tightening economy. Long term economic strategy must also take into consideration the immediate need of the poor people of the community. I am reminded of the passage from the old favourite the Wizard of Oz which seems to make a relevant point:</PARA>
<PARA> 'I don't know enough' said the scarecrow cheerfully, 'my head is stuffed with straw you know and that is why I am going to Oz to ask for some brains'. 'Oh! I see' said the tin man 'but after all brains are not the best thing in the world'. 'Have you any?' inquired the scarecrow. 'No, my head is quite empty' answered the tin man. 'But once I had brains and a heart also, so having tried them both I should rather have a heart'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They criticised it. But now they have a good political point they can attack us on in relation to the CYSS programs. Unfortunately they have a point, the point being that we introduced the scheme and after five years of trouble and of smoothing out some of the problems we had in it, many involved in it are doing a very worthwhile job. Many project officers are doing a good job. An interesting thing was said by somebody during the week-we as back benchers have a role to play. Had we had a greater role to play within the CYSS programs, had we used the many talents on the back bench to develop the CYSS programs and had we got rid of some of those project officers who used the CYSS programs only as hornets nests of socialism to develop their own ideology and philosophy, we would have been far better off. Unfortunately we were conned to such a degree that we have to do this and that but never get involved in the nitty-gritty. The five members from Tasmania know the problems of unemployment in Tasmania. Had we been given the opportunity to develop those CYSS programs and to have got rid of some of the people involved in them who were not doing the job, we could have developed a very good scheme. But unfortunately we are members of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not really criticising, but the point I am making is that had we been able to direct that flow of input and energy and to develop some of those projects in a better way, we would not have the problems we have today. Unfortunately we can be picked off by some members of the Opposition who were involved in CYSS to their political advantage. That aside, the practical point is that we need to develop a bridge between what we developed within the CYSS programs and what we should be doing in the future. It is very easy to say that on 31 October we are going to cut CYSS, but some of the buildings are half-constructed and some very good people in the local communities have got involved and the local authorities have got involved. Most of the project officers now, thank God, are good people. The bad ones have gone because we realised that they were not there for the interests of the young unemployed. They were not there to develop good schemes. They were there only to develop their own ideology. CYSS projects were referred to sometimes as hotbeds of socialism. I agree with that, because I saw some projects where the people involved could not even wash a cup because they thought it was not a good thing to wash a cup and to keep it clean. </PARA>

<PARA> I was not going to say very much about the Budget in respect of Tasmania. There is only one thing I would like to talk about. The $6m that has been pinpointed for the development and upgrading of the Tasmanian airport, I believe, is going to be an essential ingredient for the economy of Tasmania. We have seen declining industries because of our isolation. We have seen our young people leave Tasmania. But we have something bright on the horizon-a tourist industry. We have the Apple Isle. Incidentally, we all forget the hook; we all forget that it is known as the Apple Isle. It is a beautiful island. It is endowed with wonderful natural features. It can be developed as a tourist isle and jets from oveseas could bring to Tasmania people who would spend their money and their time in Tasmania. It could be developed. Therefore, I applaud the Government for showing the foresight of using that money to develop the airport of Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the sixth annual Budget of the Fraser Government and it permits us to make an overall judgment of the half-baked economic policies of the conservative Government elected in 1975. It is the thrust of what I am going to say tonight that if there remain in this community any thinking people who believe that the Fraser Government has any answers to the economic malaise that grips this country, they will be finally and totally disillusioned by the 1981 Budget. I referred to half-baked economic policies; that is, policies which are neither flesh nor fowl, on which the wets and the dries in the Liberal Party cannot agree. Indeed, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) waxed eloquent about divisions in the Australian Labor Party. Let me say a little about the divisions on economic policy in the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whatever the rhetoric of the Budget, the dries have been relatively quiet on it. It is certainly very difficult to say that this Budget in any sense represents the philosophy of the 'dries', a Friedmanite type policy. It is scarcely possible to have a dry Budget in which outlays are rising by 12 per cent-1 1/2 per cent above the anticipated inflation rate-and governmental receipts are rising by nearly 16 per cent. It is very difficult to say that that is a dry Budget. Compare the situation under the much abused Whitlam period. In Labor's last Budget the receipts of public authorities as a percentage of gross domestic product were 25.9 per cent. As a result of this Budget they will rise to 27.9 per cent of gross domestic product. This is simply, without qualification, the biggest taxing government that this country has ever seen. Therefore, it is very difficult indeed to refer to this as a dry Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, when one examines much of the vaunted rhetoric that the Government uses about decreased expenditure one sees that the underlying factor is often simply redistributive allocations and accounting tricks. To exemplify that I will take health expenditure in the present Budget. If one reads the Budget superficially it appears that there is a decrease in health outlays of $778m-a fall of 21.3 per cent over the previous year. When one starts to examine the Budget one finds that, if one allows for the new arrangements of hospital payments which are hidden in another section of the Budget and no longer clearly expressed in the health section the total outlays on health by this Government have risen by $370m over last year; a 10.3 per cent rise over 1980-81. That is only marginally below the inflation rate. When one continues one's research and reads the fine print of the Budget one learns that the new health insurance rebate will impose a hidden and delayed cost on revenue of $600m. It is a kind of accounting trick that transfers that payment to next year's Budget. If one includes this extra cost of the new health scheme the rise this year is $973m-a 27 per cent rise over 1980-81. The Government has introduced an inequitable, non-universal, complex health scheme and that is the economic result, although it is hidden away and difficult to get at. I would very much like to know what the dries think of a con-job operation like that. Certainly the dries, or the Friedmanite rump on the Liberal benches, can find little joy in that sort of Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I am, of course, not completely clear about where the dries stand with their attitude to small government. I recognise that they are unhappy about some of the social welfare increases that have occurred under the Fraser Government, although almost alone in explaining this increase is simply the expansion of unemployment. Of course the social welfare budget has expanded under the Fraser Government, but primarily because unemployment has expanded under the Fraser Government. No doubt the dries approve of the fact that 18-year olds are getting no increase in their unemployment benefit in this Budget just as they have received no increase in every Fraser Budget. No doubt they approve of the fact that the rise in the unemployment benefit rate for the unemployed without dependants is only 8.7 per cent-again some 2 per cent less than inflation. I am sure that they approve of those sorts of things. But what do the dries think about the massive assistance to Australian industry provided in this and previous Fraser Budgets? The whole thesis of conservative governments is that the government's task is to individualise profits and socialise the losses of the free market. What do the dries think about that? In the whole six years of this Government there has been a massive increase in real terms in industry assistance and development-a 17 per cent rise since 1975-76. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very good government propaganda to show business that there is government firmness, expecially when the Government is most firm on low income earners and when it hits anything but business. The idea of reducing government spending-small government-may be all right and may be represented by these dries as most efficient, most reasonable and economically rational when it reduces the spending on welfare, public education, public health services, public housing, and the socially disadvantaged. They say it is efficient, reasonable and economically rational in those areas. But there is a clear contradiction between the position of the small government people who have small government for the many but big government to facilitate profit-making corporate activity. It is the contribution of the six years of the Fraser Government-this contradiction between a policy of small government for the many and big government for the few-that is producing an increasing inequality of opportunity and income distribution in this society. I would like very much to have the dries clear up some of those contradictions in their position. </PARA>
<PARA> We have just heard from the honourable member for Franklin that the wets do not seem to get very much pleasure out of this Budget either. We have seen from what the honourable member for Franklin and other Tasmanians have had to say that they have mounted a dismal, wettish dirge on the Budget. I note too the distinctively wettish speech of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) who, I am disappointed to see, has left the House. His speech on the Budget was fairly wettish. It is true that the honourable member for Kooyong, in speaking on the Budget, because of the political exigencies of his present position, has to be all things to all men. But when one examines his speech one finds some distinctively wettish elements. He opposed the Budget because it is excessively contractionary. He argued too that the burdens of the Budget fall on those least able to bear them. He mentioned too the increasing unfairness of the income tax burden. Above all he gave this magnificent wet definition of the role of budgets:</PARA>
<PARA> In future, I would prefer to see a Budget framed on the basis of its being as economically and socially productive as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress the words 'economically and socially productive as possible'. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to promote balance in the process of growth itself, ensuring a sensitive adjustment between the challenge of economic productivity and the satisfaction of social need. </PARA>
<PARA>That sort of definition would have warmed even the heart of John Kenneth Galbraith. </PARA>
<PARA> We have just heard a protest about the Budget from one of the Tasmanian wets. I say to the five Tasmanian members of this House and to the Tasmanian people that it is the Government which all five of them represent which has abolished the Community Youth Support Scheme; it is their Government which has been increasingly tough on social welfare and particularly unemployment payments; and which has made pensioners increasingly desperate to retain their pensioner health benefit cards because of all the pressures which derive from the changes in the new health scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the other major part of my speech; to look at this Budget in the light of six years of economic policy. I ask honourable members to go back to just 1975 when the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) promised-this was his phrase-to 'turn on the lights'. Let us just examine what has happened to the lights in this country over six years. In that famous policy speech on 27 November 1975 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The major element in our comprehensive economic strategy is to bring about growth in production . . . a growth rate of 6-7 per cent is quite feasible. </PARA>
<PARA>In the whole of the six years this Government has never got near that figure for growth. After growth appeared, as it did in the first half of the last financial year, the Government, in this Budget, moved quickly to stifle it. Let us look at that. The expectation for the next year of gross non-farm product growth is 3 per cent to 3 1/2 per cent. I think that is an inflated expectation because the decline in growth rate in the second half of 1980-81 appears to have been fairly severe. I know that the figures are still provisional but from the figures for the second half of 1980-81 it appears that the economy, which the Government is about to contract, was already contracting in the latter half of 1980-81. Yet the thrust of the Government's budgetary policy this year is to contract an economy which was already contracting. This Government has no solution to inflation other than to contract the economy. The Government has now embarked on a policy which will snuff out the prospects for growth and, on its admission, increase to new heights the levels of unemployment. The first truth about this Government is that after six years it has no solution to the most critical of economic questions facing this country and that is how to provide growth without inflation. Yet on 27 November 1975 the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The major element in our strategy is to bring about growth in production. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has now had six years to achieve this. The Prime Minister's second economic pledge in 1975 was this:</PARA>
<PARA> There will be jobs for all who want to work. </PARA>
<PARA>Six years ago he promised that there would be jobs of all who want to work. In August 1975 278,000 Australians were formally unemployed. I suggest that that was a minimal figure. In August 1981 there were 378,000. I am using exactly the same source and again I argue that that is a figure which minimises the number of unemployed. Even on the basic statistics, under this Government, we have had a rise of 100,000 in unemployment. What happened to unemployment under this Government was that it peaked in 1977 and despite all the rhetoric it has remained basically static ever since. It is on a plateau, more prolonged and severe-I will mix my metaphors-than at any time since the Great Depression. The promise of this Budget-the sixth Budget-is for:</PARA>
<PARA> Some rise in unemployment over the course of 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA>After six years that is the yield of the 1975 promise. In 1975 the Prime Minister said 'there will be jobs for all who want to work'. Yet in this Budget the Government promises a further increase from an already intolerably high plateau of unemployment. Again I quote from the speech in 1975:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's economic strategy will be designed to bring down the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Much nonsense has been talked about this Government's economic strategy on inflation, mostly, of course, by this Government. In the second half of 1975 the rate of inflation ran at 11 per cent. Six years later, in 1981, what is the promise in this Budget? The government promises-this is a conservative statement-an inflation rate of 10.75 per cent for next year. From all the evidence we have it will certainly rise beyond 11 per cent, possibly to 12 per cent. All the suffering and all the costs of economic stagnation have yielded these sorts of gains. Little was achieved on the inflation front in 1976-77. There were some marginal but significant gains in 1978, 1979 and 1980 but the inflation situation is now deteriorating. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's answers to the problems are quite contradictory. On the one hand it has a set of contradictionary policies, a reduction of the deficit and a tight monetary policy, but on the other hand the deficit reduction is pursued primarily not by reducing outlays but by increasing taxes, by policies that will directly and indirectly fuel inflation. These taxing policies will directly and indirectly fuel inflation. For example, the private tax of health insurance which is regressive and inequitable, was designed, pretty unsuccessfully as I have shown, to reduce the deficit. It will contribute at least a 0.75 per cent increase to the consumer price index figure over the next year. This is directly inflationary. The sales tax increases, regressive and inequitable, designed to balance the expected losses from the oil levy are the thin edge of a wedge to provide a general consumer tax. These increases will be directly inflationary to the extent of at least 1 1/2 per cent, despite what the Government says. These are directly inflationary ways of reducing the deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> The 22.2 per cent increase in pay-as-you-earn tax receipts must increase pressure on wages and salaries and thus on prices. It must produce that pressure on wages because these receipts, which are being taken in with this hefty income tax grab, are not being used to boost the social wage. If we could boost the social wage with this money we might be able to reduce the pressure on wages. But this money is not being used to provide universal health services, it is not being used to provide better education resources, it is not being used to extend public transport, it is not being used to improve social welfare and it is not being used to provide better public housing. Therefore it will have an indirect inflationary effect because it will bring greater pressure on wages and ultimately on prices. Again, the policy of reduced allocations to the States, which compels them to increase charges for their services, will further generate inflation. The imposition of the user-pay philosophy this year on the public services will be inflationary. These will be the indirect inflationary effects of this deficit reduction approach. </PARA>
<PARA> After six years two things should be obvious to all on the inflationary front. Firstly, it is absurd to attack inflation indirectly through a deficit policy that directly as well as indirectly fuels inflation. Yet this is what the Government is doing. Secondly, it should be clear to all by now, for the evidence is overwhelming, that a policy of tolerating a high level of unemployment for a temporary period in the belief that it will make it possible to restore full employment without inflation has failed, and been seen to fail utterly. The rate of inflation is again moving into double figures, while unemployment is little below its highest levels. The tragic outcome of Liberal policies is a new inflationary spiral beginning at intolerably high levels of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> A major element in this policy disaster is the deficit fetish which has gripped this Government. Reducing the deficit has become an ideological obsession, an end in itself, irrespective of policy outcomes. Three assumptions have underlined this obsession. I will deal with these fairly briefly. They are as follows: Firstly, that there is a positive correlation between low deficits or Budget surpluses and low rates of inflation; secondly, that there is a positive relationship between low deficits and low interest rates; and thirdly, that as the public sector is cut back the private sector will somehow expand. All three assumptions are untrue. First of all, as Dr Barrie Hughes has conclusively proved, there is no inverse relationship between low deficits and high inflation. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed between 1975 and 1980 as deficits got bigger, inflation fell, and as the deficit was slimmed, prices growth stirred up again. </PARA>
<PARA> This financial year's domestic surplus will be accompanied by the highest rate of inflation in four years. Similarly for interest rates and the deficit. Over the past three years, as the deficit has fallen, interest rates have inexorably risen. Quite contrary to the underlying assumptions, as the deficit has gone down interest rates have gone up. Finally, the third absurd assumption is that as the public sector contracts the private sector will expand. Public private sectors are mostly not competitive but, on the evidence of Australian history, are mainly complementary. Most of the great expansionary periods in Australia were periods of expansion in public investment as well as private investment. The one exception to that is the Menzies period which was a period in which we lost our competitive advantage against most of the major West European powers which were prepared to involve themselves in public investment and economic planning. The nonsense underlining this Budget and the whole economic strategy has been aptly summarised by Hugh Stretton in a brief article. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> In a world in which productivity reflects education, skill and research, we are told to cut public production of all three. </PARA>
<PARA> In a world in which public and private enterprises are so closely meshed that they almost vary together, we are told that they vary inversely and that the way to increase total production is to cut public production. </PARA>
<PARA> In a world in which inflation has risen roughly in step with unemployment, we are told that maintaining unemployment will reduce inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also told that lower wages and welfare will make the lower classes work harder, but higher salaries and profits will make the upper classes work harder. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heard the acclamation from his colleagues, as, no doubt, did other members on this side. But that does not mean that the speech deserves such acclamation. I point to the particular matter upon which the honourable member for Bonython concluded, the absurd assumptions that he thought were underlying the statements of the Government in relation to this Budget. It seems to me that he based his criticism on another much more absurd statement when he suggested that we could continue to have further public expenditure expansion. Whilst it might have been easy to have public sector expansion in a situation in which the public sector did not use a significant proportion of the total resources available to a nation, I think the situation is very much more different when the public sector has expanded to the extent that it has already and when the cry in the electorate is, as it is now, for the public sector to contract a little. The cry in the electorate is for reductions in the expenditure that is necessary for the Government to maintaan public sector expansion. In fact, the electorate is clamouring not only for a reduction in expenditure but also for a reduction in the taxes which are necessary to maintain that expenditure. Whilst it might have been easy enough to argue for it when one was talking about a small amount of gross national product, it is very much more difficult, I think, to maintain that sort of argument in the situation that we have today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nobody likes to see interest rates go up. That is a fact that I can state very clearly, as well as can most other members in this House. We are not any different from the rest of the community. Few of us, I believe, are in the position where we could describe ourselves as being free from the commitment to pay off our home and the commitment to obtain for our families items of personal property that we desire if we are to live in the sort of developed community that we have today. I am in the position, I think, that most of my constituents are in, in that I have a mortgage on my home which I have to service. If interest rates go up they go up for me as much as they do for everybody else. I had the privilege of writing to a constituent about this matter only today. He sent me a piece of paper from his building society with some figures on it indicating the level of interest that he was required to pay. They bore a remarkable resemblance to the figures that I have to look at in relation to the mortgage on my home. I am not immune from these things. I appreciate--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may not be like the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) or the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown). They may have paid off their homes and may not be affected by these matters. But I am affected. I imagine that many of my colleagues are affected in exactly the same way. I do not like the fact that interest rates have risen. But I appreciate the economic circumstances which have brought this about. Not just domestic circumstances but external factors also are involved. We are faced with rising interest rates around the world. We have seen that people who seek out places in which to put their money are very prone to move that money from one place to another. That can have an effect upon money supply targets in Australia. It can have an effect upon domestic interests rates also.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The more significant factor, I suggest, is the extent to which the other forces that are at work in our economy also have an effect upon interest rates. Here I mention, particularly, the demands of the Government, not only of the Federal Government but also of State governments. Extensive private interests seeking to borrow money to assist in the development of vital resource projects are also competing for a limited resource. Money is as much a resource in these terms as anything else. The fact is that when governments enter the money markets and compete to fill their loans so that they will have the funds to carry out important resource projects they are, in effect, competing with private people like me and like many of my constituents who also have a need for money. The market forces operate. Some people believe that, in fact, we can influence these market forces by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, with my wholehearted support, has adopted another view. It believes that we cannot regulate interest rates artificially by arbitrary decisions of government, but rather that we can influence them by reducing the government competition. Of course, the Treasurer (Mr Howard), in his Budget Speech, outlined the steps that the Government was taking to reduce that competition from government. He mentioned, particularly, the decision of the Loan Council which cut about 4 per cent, in real terms, off the total amount of Commonwealth and semi-government borrowing programs. That was clearly a decision of the Government designed to get interest rates down. I think a matter that needs to be mentioned over and over again is that we are committed to lower interest rates. I believe that, as these decisions take their effect, honourable members opposite will be smiling on the other sides of their faces, particularly as events unfold. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole strategy behind this Budget is a strategy to reduce further the demands of the Commonwealth Government on capital markets to subsidise other government activities. In the post-Labor years we were busily paying off the Australian Labor Party's debts, as I have had to describe it in my electorate. We had an enormous deficit. Each year it had to be funded. The Treasurer might be able to help me but I think at times it approached $4,000m. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was 5 per cent of GDP, as the Treasurer has helpfully suggested. This amount of Labour's debt was something that had to be funded by the Government borrowing money in the market place. While it was possible to do that at reasonable rates of interest in the past, recently it has not proved possible. So the Government has had to move to a position where it is able to balance its budget. That is what the Government has been able to do on this occasion. The Treasurer mentioned in his Budget Speech that the overall Budget deficit has therefore been reduced to a point where this year it is estimated at $146m, which is a reduction of $981m on the outcome for 1980-81. He mentioned also in his Speech that, after allowance for transactions abroad, there will be an estimated Budget domestic surplus of $1,542m this year. That will be an important factor because it means that the Government will not be in the market place competing with the private interests or with the private borrower for the sorely needed funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One other matter that drew some comment in this Budget debate is the expansion of what we have known in the past as the wholesale sales tax law. The fact is that sales tax has been with us for a long time. It has been imposed largely on what I regard as luxury items or expenditure consumer items. The Government has made a decision to impose sales tax at a very minor rate upon a wider range of products. It has done that in the light of the decisions not to proceed with the introduction of a value added tax or to proceed with a form of retail turnover tax. They were decisions that I think were largely applauded because of the new sorts of regulations that would be required in the community to give effect to a new form of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Sales tax is already in place but it has been expanded to cover a wider range of products. I think it is important to look at the reasons for the Government pursuing this at this time. I fully support the reasons adopted by the Government. It is well known in Australia that there is significant tax avoidance. Whilst the Government has moved against the blatant schemes-I think it has done so in a very active and positive way-there are real difficulties in moving against the most gross avoidance practices that are current in our community. A simple examination of the household disposable income figures reveals the extent to which a large number of people in our community are taking cash for their services and taking cash for goods that they sell and are not declaring their income from that source. The fact of the matter is that there are no ways known to us and no ways, I believe, that have been advanced by the more vociferous spokesmen on behalf of the Labor Party which are known to enable those sorts of practices to be contained. The only sorts of arguments that have been effectively put were that one might manage to contain tax avoidance if one were able to reduce the income tax rates to a much lower level so that people would not feel that they were justified in taking cash out in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> One way that we can, in fact, encourage those people with high disposable tax free income to make some contribution to public revenue is to tax their actual expenditure. That is what is happening when we are taxing through a wholesale sales tax. I think this is a very important initiative, one which in the longer term will be applauded, one which the Labor Party will, I think, in the years ahead regret that it has opposed so forcefully on this occasion. I believe that the public wants a situation to emerge where income tax can be reduced. I believe that that will be the situation in future years. Indirect taxes can be used to garner the necessary revenue to maintain proper and existing government programs. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to deal with a number of other matters in relation to this Budget. I am glad that the honourable member for Parramatta is in the House because one of the matters which I wish to discuss concerns the district in which he and I live. It concerns the termination of the Community Youth Support Scheme programs. I note that the honourable member for Parramatta has offered some public views on the Government's decision not to continue with the CYSS programs. I must say that in my electorate I share the disappointment that more successful projects have not been able to be kept going. I certainly hope that in the examination that is taking place some of the aspects of the more successful projects can be picked up. In my electorate of Dundas the project at Epping recently developed a very important initiative which I think ought to be mentioned in this place and that was in the form of a fork-lift driving course-a very novel initiative in which a very good friend of mine. the chairman of that CYSS group, Theo Taylor, through his company had developed a course for which some eight young people had completed training. A second fork-lift drivers' course is currently in operation in his plant. Jobs have been arranged through the local CYSS program for those who have completed the course. That was a very important and successful initiative from that project.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the aspects which I would like to mention, though, also in relation to the two projects that have operated in my electorate at Ryde and Epping, was the very positive contribution by local government. The Hornsby Shire Council had made available to the CYSS program the property which had been previously occupied, and still is occupied, at evenings by the Epping youth service. The Ryde Municipal Council had similarly made available public property for the use of the Ryde project. I think this was very well received and very well understood in the community. Those connected with the CYSS projects particularly appreciated that. It was therefore with a great deal of disappointment that I read of the activities of the Parramatta City Council in relation to the Parramatta project. I thought that it was somewhat surprising that we would see in relation to the Parramatta project the willingness of the Parramatta Council to move the CYSS project at the time that this matter was under review and not to provide on any subsidised basis at all reasonable premises for the CYSS group to be able to continue its work. In a scheme that was designed to have public participation, in a scheme that was designed to have the active involvement of the community to support it, it was very difficult to see that the Labor controlled Parramatta Council took the view that the Parramatta project was not worthy of support.

Perhaps, if the honourable member would like this done, it would save the time which the honourable member has taken up if I incorporated in Hansard this letter to the Parramatta City Council from 'The Exchange'. I have not given the honourable member an opportunity to look at it but he may well have seen it. It is a letter which deals with the question of that group's accommodation and in which it made its comments. I will quote part of the letter before I ask permission to incorporate it in Hansard.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that might be the case. I note that last night at a Parramatta City Council meeting this matter came up for discussion once more. Although the specific question of accommodation for the Parramatta 'Exchange' was not covered the Council deigned to offer some views upon the Government's decision not to continue support for the CYSS projects in their present form. It will be interesting to see how, when faced with the opportunity to provide worthwhile accommodation to the Parramatta Community Youth Support Scheme, which I understand the Wran Labor Government is now suggesting it might continue to fund, the Council responds in terms of providing accommodation in Parramatta for that group, because other local government bodies have been prepared to provide support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to take the opportunity to raise briefly in this debate one other matter which is of concern to me. I welcome, of course, the Government's support for the handicapped. In this Budget the Government has provided substantial support for the mentally and physically handicapped, as was mentioned by the Treasurer in his Speech. He added also that the provision of $1,134m for handicapped people in this Budget represented an increase of the order of $660m or 140 per cent in the time that this Government has been in office. He mentioned a number of new initiatives. These included $1.5m as part of a $5m three-year program to improve access and facilities in Commonwealth buildings for disabled people; $690,000 to establish work preparation centres in Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane for mildly retarded young people; and an increase from $5 to $8 a week in the incentive allowance payable to all sheltered workshop employees. Those are important initiatives coupled with that initiative to provide $1.4m to assist in the production of Braille and audio books, the improvement of radio and television services for the handicapped and the provision of sport and recreation facilities for the disabled. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to encourage the Government to examine in a much more sympathetic way one other suggestion that has been put to it, particularly by the New South Wales Paraplegic and Quadraplegic Association of New South Wales. I have introduced Dr John Grant, the chairman of that group, to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in order to expand upon the Association's proposal for a mobility allowance for handicapped people. I believe its proposal, which was circulated widely to honourable members, is one very much worthy of support. The proposal that was put to the Government, I believe, may have been regarded by ministerial colleagues as a Rolls Royce proposal. The Association said that some 26,000 people needed assistance in this regard and recommended allowances that might be very close to the rate used in the United Kingdom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government's Budget can be summed up simply. It is disastrous, it is regressive, it is discriminatory, and it clearly reflects the old dictum: 'One law for the poor and none for the rich'. This is exemplified by contrasting the laws applicable to the small investor and the opportunity given to the large national and international corporations. The Government's foreign investment policies are a national scandal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put the following questions to the Treasurer (Mr Howard), and I am delighted he is in the chamber: Firstly, is it estimated that there will be an inflow of foreign capital into Australia of between $6,000m and $7,000m in 1981-82? If so, will a high proportion of this sum be speculative capital over which the Government will have little control and no measure of its cumulative effect once it is within Australia? Secondly, has the Government deliberately abandoned the regular compilation of all statistics in this field, including the periodic surveys that played an important role in monitoring the levels of foreign ownership and control in Australia? Thirdly, has the Government ceased the collection of statistical information relating to the level of (a) foreign investment in enterprises in Australia; (b) foreign ownership and control of (i) general insurance business, (ii) life insurance business, (iii) finance companies, (iv) mining industry, (v) accredited advertising agencies, (vi) tourist accommodation establishments, and (vii) manufacturing industry; and (c) foreign control in or of (i) manufacturing industry, study of large enterprise groups, (ii) mineral exploration, (iii) finance companies, (iv) life insurance business, (v) general insurance business, (vi) registered financial corporations, and (vii) the mining industry? The answer-I will not have to wait for it-is clearly yes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is inevitable that there will be downstream results from this Government's deliberate policies, from the lack of adequate surveillance, adequate statistics, adequate monitoring procedures and, what is more important, adequate knowledge of the cumulative effects of such foreign investment. The sell-out of our people's vast resources and assets has reached massive proportions. It is an appalling indictment of this Government's bankrupt policies, and I will give two examples of just how bankrupt its approach is. When the Australian Minerals and Energy Council and the Commonwealth-State Industry Ministers Conference established a joint study group to inquire into the Australian gem industry, there appeared faintly a ray of hope that the Department of Trade and Resources shared some concern for the industry. If it did it was to be sadly disillusioned. A working party was set up as far back as 1978 to examine the potential for processing of Australian gemstones. The group consisted of representatives of the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. A draft report was prepared and circulated to the industry. The initial report was released in June last year, that is, a year ago. Inquiries have been made persistently by the gem industry, and there appears to have been no progress whatsoever. The costly preparation of the report has been a complete waste of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian gem industry is of extreme value to the national economy and boasts potential for expansion. It has been abandoned and treated badly by this Government. Information contained in the report indicates a genuine effort at least to analyse sections of the gem industry and make comparisons with other countries. It points out various action taken to further the industry and to promote and protect it in the national interest. Other governments have emphasised the importance of importing uncut gemstones for the purpose of increasing their export figures. Loans have been made available at little or no interest to establish the cutting industries. Taxation imposts have been either limited or eliminated for several years in an effort to provide an industry capable of contributing large amounts to the national income. The actions of these countries have proved successful, in many cases at the expense of the Australian gem industry and with consequences to the Australian taxpayer, who should have received benefits from a wealthy industry but in fact has received nothing. The report is comprehensive and contains over 30 pages of information. It is interesting to note that it is available throughout Australia. It has been studied by all those who have an interest in the industry, except the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has spent large amounts of money compiling reports, promising the industry that action will eventuate but in fact adhering to policies of abandonment. In other words, if one puts it very simply, the study group proposes, the Government disposes. The national economy has been denied a large boost, and other aggressive disastrous legislation has been forced on the taxpayer. This shocking example of inefficiency is the work of a government which has been entrusted with a project of management involving a country extremely rich in gems, a situation making it the envy of the Western world. Departments such as the Department of Trade and Resources are being continually fed with facts and figures supporting the need for national initiatives. All it ever comes up against is a blank refusal, a blank wall. The report quotes Israel as having established one of the largest diamond cutting industries in the world. All raw material is imported. Government loans and subsidies enabled that country to enter into diamond processing in a very short time. India has advanced along similar lines and has been most successful. </PARA>
<PARA> These governments were progressive and quick to see the inability of other countries to manage their national wealth. Why is it that Brazil and New Zealand have also taken steps to protect their gem industry? Thailand has built an enormous sapphire business. How? Simply by processing Australian sapphire material and paying low prices to our miners. It is a scandal that the sapphire situation has now reached a stage where Australians do not know that the gem originates in this country and they go overseas to buy it. Believe it or not, this country supplies 75 per cent of the world's sapphires. Australia has the expertise capable of building a large processing industry. Our cutters process gem material, resulting in high class work which in most cases is superior to that originating in Asian or other off-shore countries. Opal has been almost entirely taken over by the Hong Kong market. Many of our cutters are forced out of business. Our dealers, who are fully experienced in overseas dealing, are now returning from regular trips having sold very little of their products. Why? Because of the opposition in Hong Kong. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me illustrate the bankruptcy of the Government in this area. On 26 August I asked a question of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) about the allegations that Conzinc Rio-Tinto of Australia is negotiating for De Beers to gain control of the marketing of diamonds from the Argyle project. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it a fact that such a contract will firstly mean that Australians will lose control over the pricing . . . and marketing of these Australian minerals; secondly, a return to Australian prices substantially below the world prices;</PARA>
<PARA>The extent and value of Australian diamond resources at Argyle are unknown to any Commonwealth agency. The deposit is substantially foreign owned and its value is at least one billion dollars. A week later an article appeared in Barron's National Business and Financial Weekly in London which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia now represents the greatest single challenge to the De Beers stranglehold on the international diamond wholesaling business. Australia could set up its own marketing mechanism which might some day rival De Beers. </PARA>
<PARA>I further asked the Minister whether he would take immediate steps to establish an inquiry as to the level of ownership, the conditions of development, the proposed marketing contract, and the value of the deposit to ensure that if it is developed it is in the national interest. I asked whether he would make sure that an inquiry is held before any contractual obligations are entered into. The answer was quite simply that he did not know but he would make inquiries as to whether the allegations were factual or not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer tonight briefly to what I think is a quite valuable document-'Government Scheming: An Expose on Employment and Training, August 1981'-produced by the Unemployed Workers Union, which is based in my electorate. It is a systematic attempt to answer some of the propaganda that is being put out by the Government suggesting that its training schemes replace any need for the Community Youth Support Scheme. The theme of the report by the Unemployed Workers Union is set by the Treasurer (Mr Howard). He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In many cases, employment schemes seems to have done little more than alter the composition of unemployment. They run the risk of displacing to some extent unsubsidised workers by subsidised ones. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that to the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce in 1978. The Unemployed Workers Union pointed out that whilst the Government is getting rid of CYSS in favour of its employment and training schemes, in fact it has nothing to boast about in this area. It points out that in 1975-76 the Australian Labor Party spent $205m on employment and training schemes. The Government is presently spending only $203m in today's dollars. This means, if the Unemployed Workers Union is correct, that the Government has in real terms cut funding by 44 per cent. Even if the Government's so-called 23 per cent increase over the last year is taken into account, this will result only in a 12 per cent increase in training opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> In this document the Union runs through the three main areas of training to illustrate its essential point; that is, that training means essentially the subsidisation of employers. Firstly, the report refers to the area of trade training which is one of the major components of the Government's training programs. It will involve $72m this year for the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training scheme to subsidise employers so that students can be released from work for training programs. The report points out that there is considerable doubt about the value of this program. It quotes the Myer report and states:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The Department (DEYA) did not comment on whether the program is achieving the aim of improving the quality of apprenticeship training. The Committee understands that this may not be the case.' It concluded that 'the program is an expensive means of providing an incentive to employers to take on additional apprentices, given that the subsidy is paid in respect of all apprentices.'</PARA>
<PARA>The second principal area that involves the Government is the so-called skills area training. There are three components to this. The first is skills in demand, funding for which has increased from $0.5m to $8m. Essentially, what skills in demand means is subsidies to the multinationals that control resource based industries. The second component is general training for individuals. That program has actually been cut even though it provides one of the few opportunities for retraining people over the age of 24 years. The third component within the skills training area is the training of manpower executives, for which funding has increased from $3m to $5m. There is no requirement that that training should have any orientation to the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The third principal area of training is the so-called youth training which, again, fits into three sub-groups. The first is the School to Work Transition Program which is supposed to absorb 16,000 people. It is a program to which the States have been particularly hostile, in which planning has been almost non-existent and whose value is quite unproven. The second component is the Education Program for Unemployed Youth. Whilst it may be of some value, the only surveys that have been done indicate that as few as 26 per cent of the people who have been through the program are in jobs four months later. Finally, there is the notorious Special Youth Employment Training Program which the Government's own surveys have indicated in the past has provided an opportunity for a great rip off for employers. That program will absorb $65m. Again, it will mean a subsidy for employers with no guarantee of effective training. CRAFT will get $72m, SYEPT will get $65m and the skills in demand program will get $8m. That is a very large proportion of the total amount of money to provide work experience and training programs of extremely dubious quality. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in my mind that these programs will not absorb the very large numbers of people who are currently involved within the CYSS program. They represent part of the Government's strategy not of helping young people but of transferring resources to the corporate sector and then boasting that it is trying to do something for people. The reality is that this Government is not interested in unemployment or unemployed young people. I refer to the Age of 24 August. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, Mr Brown, declined to be interviewed on the subject of a return to full employment. An aide said the Minister did not feel he had sufficient knowledge of the subject, and did not have time to be briefed by his departmental officers. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) get himself briefed on the quality of the training programs being offered, the direction of those programs and the suggestion that they represent a substitute for the CYSS program. I am quite sure that is not the case. I understand that the Treasurer, who is at the table, wants to transfer these programs to the Education Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to draw the attention of the House to the problems as well as the achievements of a community project which is in my electorate but which hopes to be a model for similar projects throughout Australia. I refer to the Beehive Retirement Centre in Palmer Street in East Sydney. This centre provides part time work for elderly and retired people who find that one of the curses of retirement is the enforced inactivity of people who are still able and willing to do a job of work but who otherwise cannot. The centre obtains Commonwealth financial assistance as, of all things, a sheltered workshop although it is not a sheltered workshop and this category of aid restricts its expansion and the expansion of the idea. This is the problem to which I refer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The centre's program is arranged in two sections. In the activities centre light, clean, part time work is provided. An amount of $5 per day is paid to those engaged in such work. The trade union movement has given its support to the arrangement. The work includes such light jobs as packaging, assembling, book covering, mailing newsletters, reconditioning old prams and rebuilding bicycles. There are 50 client organisations which offer work and for which work is done. These include-I mention a few in alphabetical order-the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Boulevard Hotel, the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association of New South Wales, Master Foods of Australia Pty Ltd, Radio 2SM, Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd, the University of New South Wales and Ward's Freight Services Pty Ltd. I could mention many others. </PARA>
<PARA> In the leisure centre, the other half of the program, facilities are provided for retired people seeking companionship and social activities. On average, the two halves of the centre cater for 95 to 100 people each day. Those using its facilities come from all over Sydney. The official purposes of the Beehive Centre-it achieves these, as I know from a recent visit-are to help retired and elderly people to avoid total dependency; to assist them through providing work to retain or regain a satisfactory lifestyle; and also, from an economic point of view, to prevent or defer the cost of their occupying hospital or nursing home beds. It is, in other words, a form of preventative community health. The success of this community project is primarily demonstrated in terms of the well-being of the participants but there is another point. When compared with the return on the expenditure of public funds for paramedical and hospital services the cost of this operation which is classified as preventative is extremely modest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sydney City Council, under the stimulus of Alderman Joan Pilone, opened the Centre in 1971 but it was obliged to limit its services to elderly people living within the city boundaries. A year later Mrs Pilone, who is now the Chairman of the Centre, interested the then Minister for Social Services, Mr W. C. Wentworth, who obtained Cabinet approval for the Sydney Beehive Centre to be given a subsidy under the Sheltered Employment Assistance Act, to allow it to extend its range to people throughout Sydney. This was because Mr Wentworth was responsible for this particular Act. In any case, Commonwealth funding in 1980-81 under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act-an inappropriate Act, as I say-amounted to some $59,000, which included salaries subsidies, equipment subsidies and rental subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA> The case for the concept of purposeful activity for retired people as a means of preventing or at least deferring dependence on costly health services speaks for itself. The population of Australians 65 years and over is about one million, or 8.8 per cent, and this percentage is increasing. Most people, not least members of parliament engaged in constituency work, realise that when retirement deprives a person of a purposeful occupation, an extreme sense of loneliness and a lack of purpose often lead to the onset of illness and permanent disability which place that person in the hands of public welfare services and institutions. So it seems to me that this organisation is showing its value. However, it is limited by the level of financial assistance that it gets. It is the only one. No other beehive centre can get this sort of support throughout the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I urge the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) to rethink their attitude to the case of Eamonn O'Connor while they still have an opportunity and before the inevitable increased bitterness which has poisoned British-Irish relations for so long is indelibly scoured into the Australian-Irish political scene by the death of this young man, however misguided his action may be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me quickly outline the case for reconsideration of the Government's stated intention to emulate the vicious, hard-line attitude of Margaret Thatcher to the original hunger strikers in the Maze. Of 32 counties in Ireland, nine are in Northern Ireland and six of these have been under British rule since 1918 and British military occupation since the early 1970s. The decision to partition Ireland was an act of British colonialism carried out not in Ireland but in the House of Commons, and against a four-to-one opinion against partition by the Irish people. Religious sectarianism is not the prime cause of the present impasse. That cause is the colonial economic and social repression of the catholic people of Northern Ireland. The Irish catholics suffer the worst unemployment, have the worst jobs and live in the worst houses. Having visited the United Kingdom recently, I detected a rising sense of disorientation on the mainland of the United Kingdom. Whatever Margaret Thatcher, the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs may say, eventually the British will get out of Ireland. I heard James Callaghan, the former Prime Minister and Home Secretary, when troops were sent into Northern Ireland a decade ago, advocate in the Commons the withdrawal of troops and the establishment of an independent Northern Ireland. An independent Northern Ireland is not my position. Eventually Ireland will be unified but Callaghan's view is a measure of the public despair and discontent rampant in the United Kingdom regarding Northern Ireland. </PARA>
<PARA> But these are not the life or death demands of the prisoners in the Maze. They demand to be treated as political prisoners, as do the 250 Irish republican prisoners who were convicted before March 1976. Explicitly, their demands are as follows: The right not to do prison work; the right not to wear prison uniform; the right to have free association with other political prisoners; the right to organise educational and recreational facilities and to receive one visit and one food parcel per week; and no loss of remission. For these simple demands, 10 hunger strikers have died already this year and now we have a problem in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government's attitude to Eamonn O'Connor, who wishes the Government to intervene on behalf of his incarcerated countrymen, is the same as Margaret Thatcher's. Let us examine it. Let them die, says Margaret Thatcher, for they are suicides in support of their cause. She says there will be no agreement on political status and so the shameful charade continues. The Australian Prime Minister joins her by saying that this is no Australian matter and is simply a matter for the British to decide. That is not the view he took about South Africa or Zimbabwe. As Max Harris of the Australian says:</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed many people regard it as a stroke of bad luck that the Irish are not black. If they were Ireland would have been unified decades ago as part of the process of de-colonisation. </PARA>
<PARA>Even if it is true that whether Mr O'Connor lives or dies is not the Australian Government's affair, since in its view decisions regarding Northern Ireland are for the British, and if it is true that Mr O'Connor's attitude is for him alone to decide, the fact is that Margaret Thatcher could save the prisoners in the Maze. Similarly, the Prime Minister could save Mr O'Connor in Australia. There must be a better way than just abrogation of responsibility. Let the Prime Minister and his Government express their utmost concern to the United Kingdom Government that, firstly, the situation in the Maze already has cost too many lives; secondly, that there is a need for a political settlement; and thirdly, that concern for Northern Ireland is now impinging upon Australian politics. Let it be done quickly and let the man be informed and urged to accept this intervention within the parameters of his original demands and to cease his hunger strike. Then an Irish national's life will be saved and one small positive humanitarian Australian move for a settlement in Northern Ireland will have been made. As a humane Parliament, can we do less?</PARA>

<PARA>A colleague of mine, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles), in closing his speech on another matter expressed considerable disagreement with my argument. In fact, he said my speech was stupid. He claimed that the men's sacking was a piece of petty politicking--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, well, that is all right. I am quite happy to say it but I will go on, will I not? He claimed that the men's sacking was a piece of petty politicking which 'threw into jeopardy the entire export shipment of wheat from this nation'. Whilst regretting the use of the word 'stupid', I am otherwise grateful for this statement to allow me to expand further on this matter and to draw attention to the great problem in our society of the acceptance of industrial expediency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There were no petty politics. It is reasonable to say that an agreement did exist between the Waterside Workers Federation and the Co-operative Bulk Handling Grain Shipping Terminal that, until the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission hearing was resolved, manning levels would be maintained. As work had ceased in one area, CBH, mindful of the cost responsibility to its co-operative shareholders, sought to transfer four men to a country area where work was available, still maintaining manning levels. However, these newly initiated members of the WWF have learnt their first lesson well; that is, not to take any notice of their employer. They refused to be transferred. For that reason they were dismissed. Then, Charlie Fitzgibbon closed down the Australian wheat export, claiming breach of agreement. The honourable member for Wakefield, who was somewhat agitated in regard to the other subject, apparently did not hear the final words of my speech as recorded in Hansard. They were:</PARA>
<PARA> All they-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the farmers-</PARA>
<PARA>really have to realise is that the strength of unions such as the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia is directly in proportion to the public's unsubstantiated fear of them. </PARA>
<PARA>The Western Australian farmer has no need to fear the WWF. He already owns all the facilities to load a ship at Kwinana. In fact, members of the WWF enter those premises with his permission. However, suddenly these farmers are told they should provide a handsome living and absolute security to an unspecified number of individuals who at no time have participated in the effort or risk-taking associated with growing a wheat crop. Why should they do this? It is not because these men possess some very special skills or propose to carry out the work to a degree of efficiency that cannot be improved. To the contrary; the wheat grower is to provide this employment because the men are members of the Waterside Workers Federation. He has no opportunity to pass on this cost to overseas customers, as many other sectors do when they have industrial problems of this nature. The scandals associated with the WWF in its traditional arena-shipside-are bad enough. I instance the $20m plus a year we pay to employ its already redundant members, the levies the union imposes on modern bulk shipping which has automatic loading facilities, and in this case the employers of wharfside labour paying the wages of those men involved in applying bans to wheat exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The legal process has run its course. Sir Leslie Price has abdicated his responsibility to Australian wheat growers for a very short term gain. The shareholder farmers of CBH now can turn only to the union movement for an example, and ignore Australia's laws that relate to this unsatisfactory situation. They must occupy the CBH terminal and commence the entire loading and handling procedure themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just a few moments ago in this House we head an unbridled, unwarranted and, I feel, entirely unjustified attack on a council in Sydney of which I was formerly an alderman, that is, the Parramatta City Council. That attack was launched by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). In launching this attack, the honourable member for Dundas, I feel, has sullied not only his own escutcheon but also that of his party. He mentioned quite vehemently that the Parramatta City Council has been intemperate, unfeeling and unresponsive in its replies to attempts by a Community Youth Support Scheme group within my electorate with which I have a very close association, to have the Council provide it with some alternative accommodation. In doing that, the honourable member for Dundas made an attack which I would like to refute. In order to do that I think it would be fair for me to point out the very splendid and proud record of the Parramatta City Council in terms of its social welfare activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Dundas has re-entered the chamber so I can re-educate him a little in the facts of life. Of all the municipal and/or local government authorities in Australia none has a more splendid record in terms of generosity towards social welfare than the Parramatta City Council. I would like to outline some of the things it does. For instance-I know this is a subject dear to the honourable member's heart-the Parramatta City Council maintains, at a cost of something like $130,000 per year, the largest meals on wheels program in Australia. It is also a giant amongst the pygmies in terms of local government and its treatment of old age pensioners. Pensioners who have lived for five years within the City of Parramatta get a full rebate on rates, not chargeable against an estate after death, at a cost of something like $500,000 a year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not required by law at all. Parramatta City Council also maintains a very large senior citizens centre within its city precincts-one of the largest in Sydney-at total government expense. On top of this I can name four properties which the Council provides for various social authorities. For instance, the Macquarie Legal Aid Service which replaced the defunct Australian Legal Aid Office, which has disappeared under the insensitivity of this Liberal Government, is maintained in premises at the Parramatta City Council's cost-free of charge. The Vietnam veterans are provided with premises from which they conduct their proper vendetta against the Government's insensitivity. The Parramatta Community Aid and Information Service is provided with something like a $40,000 a year subsidy and free premises. There are three cottages provided for the Rotary youth refuge, the Salvation Army youth refuge and a Lifeline youth refuge at Council expense. The CYSS group has been housed in a home at Council expense--</PARA></TALK.START>

The cost to the youth of Australia-the despairing, helpless, restive youth of Australia-who cannot find employment because of the Government's action is incalculable. For this gentleman to come in here and criticise a local government authority because of his own political bias, to me is beyond belief.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think none of us would have been surprised earlier tonight to hear the energetic lack of interest of the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) in regard to his electorate by supporting another terrorist organisation, the provisional wing of the Irish Republican Army. This seems to me to be in keeping with his support for other terrorist organisations such as the Palestine Liberation Organisation and any other organisation which has no interest whatsover in his electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I wish to raise a matter of some importance because it seems to me to be disappointing that the public's understanding of the new health insurance arrangements has been sufficiently clouded by a mist of propaganda from honourable members opposite that a totally wrong perception now exists throughout the nation. Health insurance is now cheaper or costs nothing at all for three-quarters of the people of Australia. Less than one in every four Australians now face dearer health insurance costs as a result of the Federal Government's changes to the health system that began last week. This is because the slightly higher weekly rates of health insurance will be far more than offset by a much bigger tax rebate, which the Government has also introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the disastrous features of the present Government is that it does not promote or advertise itself with anything like the flair or the expense of Mr Wran's State Government in New South Wales. As a result, the untrue propaganda alleging a huge rise in health care costs in Australia now is widely believed. The honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) can take credit for having spread that particularly nonsensical proposition. Three out of every four Australians are either better off or are paying no health insurance whatsoever. People such as the honourable member for Bonython who are spreading this untrue propaganda know it to be untrue. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the facts and the dollars and cents of what it really costs now for health insurance. Under Medibank Private the old family rate of $9 per a week for basic cover went up on 1 September by $1.40 a week to $10.40. But this new weekly bill will bring a tax rebate of 32c in the dollar, which means the Government will repay $3.33 of this $10.40 bill. The simple fact is that the rise of $1.40 a week will be more than offset by a rebate of $3.33 a week, leaving the insured person better off by $1.93 a week or about $100 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it not remarkable that a new system that is about $100 a year cheaper for a family should have been so dishonestly represented as involving a savage increase in costs? Similar savings are involved for those who insure with the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd, the Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia or the Manchester Unity Fund-which, I might say, is my family's health insurance fund-or other funds. So the eight million Australians who have been covered by health insurance in the past now will be better off when they get their tax rebate cheque at the end of the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, three million Australians who either are pensioners or are financially disadvantaged will continue to receive free health care under the new arrangements. By the way, there is a sort of inevitability about the Wran Government claiming all the credit in recent advertisements for this free health care for pensioners. In fact all but a very few pensioners will receive free health care entirely as a result of the Commonwealth Government's arrangements. Only a few thousand pensioners out of two million or so will be helped by the State Government. They will include those few pensioners over the age of 70 years who happen to be millionaires. The Federal Government is concentrating taxpayers' money on picking up the bill for those in real need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Existing quarantine legislation effectively limits the importation of queen bees to Australia to those from New Zealand, United States of America and Canada. This is because of the presence of Isle of Wight disease in most other countries.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the prevalence of Isle of Wight disease in Mexico is posing an increasing threat to North America apiculture. In addition, certain other bee diseases in North America are assuming increased significance. Accordingly, my Department has over the past four years, in conjunction with the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, developed a prototype bee quarantine facility which allows queen bees to be imported, held in quarantine and only their larvae released to the importer.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In view of the success of the prototype facility a permanent facility capable of holding up to 24 queen bee importations at any time is being constructed at the quarantine station at Eastern Creek in Sydney. The facility is due for completion by mid-September 1981.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1360" SPEAKER="Hodgman The Hon W.M." NAMEID="BV4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="CANBERRA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BV4">Mr Hodgman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Koppers (Aust) Pty Ltd has sought a site in the ACT for a timber treatment plant that would use a copper, chrome, arsenate or CCA process for treatment of pine logs. A site in the Hume industrial area was selected following a detailed evaluation, undertaken in consultation with Koppers.</PARA>
<PARA> The evaluation considered issues related to the site location and the potentially adverse impact on the surrounding area, including the Tralee tourist complex; environmental issues associated with a CCA process; and appropriate protection measures.</PARA>
<PARA> The study drew heavily on environmental guidelines for CCA treatment plants currently being finalised by the Victorian Environment Protection Authority, these being thought to be the latest and most authoritative controls in the field.</PARA>
<PARA> Formal notification of the proposal was given to the Department of Home Affairs and Environment in May 1981 under the Environment Protection Administrative Procedures of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act.</PARA>
<PARA> A recommendation about whether an Environmental Impact Statement should be required is awaited from the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No specific study of the Tralee Station domestic water supply or the underground well has been made. While environmental controls are designed to ensure that there is no significant pollutant escape from site, as a safeguard a number of bores are being drilled to facilitate regular monitoring of ground water surrounding the proposed plant site. Previous experience in the area suggests that ground water movement is predominantly northwards from the Koppers site and away from Tralee Station's underground water supply well but the possibility of movement in other directions is not being overlooked. While the well referred to may supply the Canberra Fraser Park International Speedway Complex it is not the only water supply available. Town water has been available to the property from the ACT for many years and could be used at the Speedway.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Officers of the Department and the Commission attended meetings with Mr Morrison on 8 April 1980 and 27 February 1981. Information regarding the nature of the Koppers operation and proposed environmental controls, including material on proposed ground water protection, were provided to Mr Morrison. At neither meeting was the question of the Tralee Station water supply or the underground water supply well raised by Mr Morrison.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) In 1975 a report was prepared by the Bureau of Mineral Resources on the engineering geology of the Jerrabomberra Valley. The study area included the proposed Koppers site. The report considered significant geological and soil characteristics in the context of possible constraints on future development. It presented material on a number of soil characteristics including texture, structure, depth, permeability and identified the location of organic soils without specifically measuring organic content. The information available on soils was regarded as sufficiently detailed for identification of a suitable site for Koppers in the Hume area and in November 1980 the Bureau was asked to comment on the preferability in geological terms of two possible sites for the Koppers plant. The Bureau indicated a preference for the site presently proposed.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The guidelines for CCA treatment plants referred to above indicate that the least favourable soil for a plant of this type is sand and gravel. The Bureau of Mineral Resources has indicated that in the area of the Koppers site the soil is predominantly a colluvium consisting of sand, silt and clay containing a thin discontinuous sand aquifer. With the presence of clay the situation is more favourable as clay soil types are considered capable of immobilising metal ions.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Yes. The authority which carried out soil tests was the Bureau of Mineral Resources. Copies of the 1975 Report to N.C.D.C. on soil in the Jerrabomberra Valley and a professional opinion (1980) on the potential for ground water pollution associated with the two Hume sites considered for the purpose are available for examination at the offices of the National Capital Development Commission.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Figures and details are available only in respect of Australian citizens. Records of Australian residents are not kept as they are normally the consular responsibility of their countries of citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to give specific details relating to each detention, arrest and charge to particular countries, as not all this information has been made public in Australia and its publication could be damaging to the persons concerned or to their families. If the honourable member requires specific information on particular cases or countries I can give it to him on a personal basis. I can however, give the information requested in general terms and this information for the period 1 January 1979 to 9 June 1981 is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) In 1979 the number of Australians detained was 209, the number imprisoned was 35, and the countries concerned were Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic, Greece, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, the United Kingdom and Yugoslavia.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) In 1980 the number detained was 201, the number imprisoned was 42, and the countries concerned were Afghanistan, Belgium, Denmark, Fiji, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, The Netherlands, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, New Caledonia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Singapore, Syria, Tahiti, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Vanuatu.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) From 1 January until 9 June this year 91 were detained, 18 imprisoned and the countries concerned were Canada, Czechoslovakia, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Malaysia, Mauritius, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Syria, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States of America.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Of the arrests listed in a, b, and c, above, 238 were for drug offences and others were for robbery, murder, false pretences, currency offences, theft, conspiracy, wounding, forgery, hijacking, fraud, and immigration offences.</PARA>
<PARA> There may have been cases of Australians being detained or imprisoned overseas that did not come to official notice.</PARA>
<PARA> In the cases listed normal consular assistance was made available. Such assistance includes advising the detained person about his rights and position under the local legal system; notifying families in Australia if requested to do so; assistance with access to legal representaton; and providing other assistance which may be appropriate in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian missions did not formally intervene in the legal process in any of the cases listed. It is not policy to do so unless we are convinced that one of our citizens has not received the same treatment under the law of the country concerned as a citizen of that country would receive, or unless the application of the law in a particular instance falls below international standards. This is standard international practice.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 May 1981 (Hansard, page 2222) Mr Hyde asked me a question, without notice, about the importation of oil rigs. I wish to add to the remarks I then gave in response to the question. At the time I informed the honourable member that the policy on the importation of oil rigs was under review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The review has recently been completed and I announced on 17 August 1981 that the Government has decided, after taking fully into account the views of all parties concerned, to introduce forthwith a significant de-regulation in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> Details are in my Press Release of 17 August 1981 and it would suffice for me to say here that the review was aimed at ensuring that the policy does not inhibit development, or add to the costs, of the offshore oil industry.</PARA>
<PARA> I might add, on the aspect of costs that the previous policy may have caused the industry, that research by my Department has indicated that at least for the last six years there has been no case where a foreign drilling rig, approved under temporary arrangements for use in Australian waters, has had its program interrupted because a local rig became available.</PARA>
