<PARA> (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under ''Cosmetics'' as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to: (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed. This campaign of public education would necessitate multilingual distribution of the information where appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to explain today why I have resigned from the Fraser Ministry. I resigned because of irreconcilable differences between the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and me about his method of government. Before speaking further, I wish to stress a matter which is of fundamental importance if the reasons for my resignation are to be understood. My resignation is not based on rivalry, nor is it inspired by any personal ambition. Throughout the turbulent post-Menzies years of the Liberal Party of Australia I have never been associated with any group that has sought to overthrow the leader. This is the first time I have publicly called into question the elected leader. Accordingly, it will be obvious that the decision to resign from the Prime Minister's Ministry was the most painful decision I have been forced to make in all of my 25 years working for the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister knows the anguish one feels when faced with the questions of deep seated principle. In March 1971 he resigned his portfolio as Minister for Defence. He said at the time in an interview which was republished in the Australian less than two weeks ago:</PARA>
<PARA> I know people could be hurt, I know it could assist the Opposition. But there was no alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> If I allowed these factors to stop me doing what I think is right, I would have put a quite impossible degree of power in the hands of one person. </PARA>
<PARA>The circumstances associated with my resignation are different in that there is no question of an election, there is no conspiracy to overthrow the elected leader of the party; nor will I give assistance to those who sit opposite. The report of the interview with the Prime Minister stated also:</PARA>
<PARA> 'It goes far deeper than that. It is the whole system of how a government should operate that is at stake,' he said. 'The most important part of cabinet government is collective wisdom. </PARA>
<PARA> 'No matter how good one man is, there is always something the others can contribute.'</PARA>
<PARA>Over recent months I have regretfully concluded that the Prime Minister is fracturing Cabinet government and the parliamentary system as we know it. Our system of government will operate only if there is a responsible relationship between the Cabinet and the Parliament. Our present system has deteriorated because that relationship has foundered. It has foundered because the Prime Minister increasingly centralised power around himself. Any erosion of the Cabinet system goes to the heart of the parliamentary process. By reposing too much power in the Prime Minister, the system of collective responsibility within Cabinet is destroyed; the responsibility of Cabinet to Parliament is abandoned; and the very democratic process is placed in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> I need to demonstrate by recent examples the damage that is being done. The Government's economic policies were vital to my role as Minister for Industrial Relations. Part of that role was responsibility for wages policy. Shortly after the election the Prime Minister announced the composition of the formal Cabinet committees. These vital policy and administrative committees make binding decisions. Nevertheless, when the Prime Minister announced the composition of these committees, the Minister for Industrial Relations was not included on any of the committees dealing with economic affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Press noted and commented on this omission. On the day of those reports the Prime Minister asked me to come to his office. He apologised for not including me on an appropriate committee. He said it was an oversight; it would be rectified as soon as possible. He said he would put me on the Monetary Committee, but he could not do it that day because this would be interpreted as bowing to Press pressure. It was erratic for the Prime Minister to defer this action, knowing that he was making it difficult for his Minister effectively to carry out the duties of a sensitive and important portfolio. Regrettably he did so solely to preserve his personal standing in the Press. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I accepted his assurance, nothing happened. He was reminded in January and again in March of his failure to appoint me to the Monetary Committee. This appointment was important for the effective presentation of the Government's case to the public. Here is an example of how the Prime Minister failed to honour firm undertakings repeatedly given. His failure undermined the authority of a senior Minister in a policy area relevant to his portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Government left us with the appalling burden of spiralling wages and rampant inflation. With some success we have been grappling with it ever since. Wages policy is central to our fight against inflation. The very question of a centralised wage fixation system has been the subject of a detailed inquiry by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. How we fix wages in Australia is critical. Constitutionally the Government cannot act directly in the area of wages. It is questionable whether a centralised system of wage fixation is desirable or can work. The national interest in wage restraint and orderly and stable industrial relations requires further careful examination of that very question. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recently argued before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for the maintenance of a centralised wage fixation system. The Commission determined that such a system would continue for a further two years. We should use that period to take a long and serious look at centralised versus decentralised systems of wage fixation. The aim should be to achieve consensus based on compromise between government, employer and union. If a transition is involved it can be planned and it can be orderly. In the last Government there was a Cabinet wages committee chaired by the Minister for Industrial Relations. It was a way to consult and have collective consideration within the traditional Cabinet committee structure. Nevertheless, after the election, the Prime Minister abolished that committee without consulting me as Minister for Industrial Relations. The Prime Minister made this important change without taking the opportunity to hear contrary argument that, by having no wages committee, by leaving the industrial relations portfolio totally unrepresented on any economic committee, he was reducing the effective administration of the industrial relations portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, in my absence, the Prime Minister persuaded a Cabinet committee to change confirmed government policy in the industrial relations field. In 1978 Cabinet accepted a submission from my predecessor that the Government incorporate the Public Service arbitration system into the conciliation and arbitration system. The former Minister had not introduced the legislation when I assumed the portfolio. It is important to understand that this proposal arose from a royal commission report. The proposal was then endorsed by Cabinet. It was later taken to the National Labour Consultative Council. That body, comprising leading employer and union representatives, endorsed the proposal. In other words, a royal commission, the Government, employers and unions all supported it. On 8 January 1981 I appeared before the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions-the so-called razor gang-and supported the established policy. I told the Committee that the decision was to be incorporated in a Bill to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I recommended that it include the decision in its report. The Committee then asked that I return later to argue the case. This I did on 6 February. The Committee accepted my argument. I thought that was the end of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> On 30 March, without telling me of his intention, the Prime Minister attended a meeting of the Committee and argued for its decision to be reversed. The Committee did so without hearing me again. This was a decision from a royal commission, endorsed by Cabinet, endorsed by the National Labour Consultative Council and now overturned after endorsement by a previous committee at which I was given the opportunity to speak. It decided to recommend that Cabinet not incorporate the Public Service arbitration system within the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It did so without hearing me again. The Prime Minister's role in having decisions reversed in the absence of the responsible Minister is totally contrary to the principles of Cabinet government. It is inexplicable, save by reference to the Prime Minister's obstinate determination to get his own way although undermining the authority of a senior Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, another example of the Prime Minister undermining the authority of a Minister was his diversion from the Government's stance against the union campaign for a 35-hour week. Representations were made by the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) and me. It was agreed after that meeting and later ratified by Cabinet that the Government should adopt policies to assist and support employers directly faced by the union campaign. On 25 March I submitted a copy of a statement on the 35-hour week campaign to the Prime Minister. I was informed he agreed that it was in keeping with the Cabinet decision and with government policy. He approved it. I showed it to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and he approved it. I made the statement to the House on 26 March. It was an important policy statement. It was to form the basis of the Government campaign against union demands for a 35-hour week. Among other things I said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will be supporting them--</PARA>
<PARA>The employers-</PARA>
<PARA>in their stance with all appropriate means. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement to the House made it clear that the Government would be 'strongly supportive of employers who stand up to union pressure'. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> This is the only responsible action for the Government to take. We intend to take a number of steps to lessen the burden that industrial action over the 35-hour week issue places on companies and firms. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the House to note the words: 'This is the only responsible action for the Government to take'. They are worthy of emphasis. They were deliberately included in the speech because the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia had told the Prime Minister, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and me that it was time to tell employers that they would be helped, not hindered, by the Government. The Prime Minister agreed with that theme. </PARA>
<PARA> On the very evening of the day I made the statement, the Prime Minister addressed the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce. He contradicted the theme agreed to by him and contained in my parliamentary statement by threatening reprisals against companies negotiating a log of claims containing a claim for a shorter working week. His threats followed two newspaper accounts that ICI Australia Ltd was alleged to be negotiating a 35-hour week with relevant unions. I learnt of this on reading the Friday morning newspapers. Subsequently the Prime Minister told me of his statement and asked me to a meeting that day with ICI executives. </PARA>
<PARA> This is another of the reasons referred to on the day of my resignation. Two things are relevant. First, effective industrial relations in this country have been put at risk by the undermining of the authority of the responsible Minister. Second, the nation requires steady and responsible conduct of its affairs, and especially in the extremely significant area of industrial relations. As my predecessor and I have frequently said, it is fundamental that the power of government in the field of industrial relations be used with fine judgment. Overuse of that power can aggravate a situation by hardening attitudes and shifting the focus from the basic conflict. This is especially so in an outmoded system of industrial relations unsuited to the shift of power between capital and labour. This was one of the reasons that I began a fundamental overhaul of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> On the day I resigned I said the Prime Minister had by-passed the system of Government. I turn now to the structure of so-called Cabinet government that the Prime Minister has evolved. Earlier I referred to the formation of various formal Cabinet committees. Such a committee system has been a common and sensible practice but the Prime Minister has introduced a powerful new element, the Co-ordination Committee. This Committee is effectively superimposed over other Cabinet committees and, in effect, over the Cabinet itself. It is supposed to comprise the coalition party leaders and deputies. Actually, it is often expanded by including some other Ministers. Its major role is to discuss tactics over the entire range of departmental and ministerial responsibilities. But when it does, the responsible Ministers are rarely, if ever, present when issues within their portfolios are discussed. Issues relevant to the industrial relations portfolio discussed by the Committee have included, I believe, wages policy, the Qantas Airways Ltd dispute and the 35-hour week. I was not present for any of these discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the strongest protest about such a debasement of our system. What is Cabinet itself if it is not a co-ordination committee? Why the need for the Co-ordination Committee? The Committee is in fact an extension of the Prime Minister's well-known lobbying of Ministers before issues are brought to Cabinet. Therefore, when Cabinet meets a significant number of Ministers have already determined many matters concerning government strategy. In some cases, policy matters have been decided. The decision of Cabinet is a foregone conclusion and, so, collective wisdom of Cabinet is aborted. I remind the House that the Prime Minister himself, after he resigned from the Ministry in 1971, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The most important part of cabinet government is collective wisdom. </PARA>
<PARA>Regrettably, by-passing the system of government does not stop there. As I have said there is a dangerous reluctance to consult Cabinet. Cabinet Ministers are sometimes directed by the Prime Minister to leave the Cabinet Room so that the Co-ordination Committee can deliberate on the matter before the Cabinet or on some other matter the Prime Minister wishes to pursue. It is wrong, indeed outrageous, that Cabinet Ministers can be dismissed from a Cabinet room to permit discussion behind their backs about Cabinet matters. This is not just a kitchen Cabinet; it is a formal structure crushing the Cabinet system. Added to this, individual Ministers are lobbied by the Prime Minister. That is a principle of proper Cabinet government that should not happen. It even happened on a matter as important and sensitive as the question of derecognition by Australia of the Pol Pot regime. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from individual caucusing by the Prime Minister and apart from the use of the Co-ordination Committee the Prime Minister also uses ad hoc committees. Provided an ad hoc committee of Cabinet reports back to the full Cabinet there can be absolutely no objection to the use of it to examine a complex issue. The method should be used only to unravel complexities to save time for the full Cabinet. Since the Fraser Government came to power there has been a plethora of ad hoc committees. Even worse, these ad hoc committees make Cabinet decisions. I am informed that between June 1977 and July 1979 there were approximately 5,900 Cabinet decisions of which more than 1,200 were ad hoc decisions. I do not have later figures. But it is damning evidence and an indictment of the erosion of the Westminster system. </PARA>
<PARA> What I in fact have shown reveals the Prime Minister's determination to centralise power and satisfy a mania for getting his own way. I say this well aware of the complexity of government today. A Prime Minister has the right to determine governmental structures for the smooth operation of Executive responsibility. I do not ignore the growth in Prime Ministerial government in many Western democracies. But this should not be an excuse for a leader to manipulate the system to retain personal power. </PARA>
<PARA> Outside Cabinet there is another development, that of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Apart from the complex system surrounding Cabinet, the House should note that each Commonwealth department is now duplicated in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. This causes waste but, far worse than that, it brings interference with, indeed supervision of, decisions made by Ministers and their departments. The role now given to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet challenges the authority given Ministers under section 64 of the Constitution. There is another equally undesirable effect. It places deep strains on the Public Service because it sets public servant against public servant. It is a major power structure for the Prime Minister. As a consequence, it is at odds not merely with the Constitution but with efficient management of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, to me, as a Liberal, it strikes at the root of liberalism itself. Liberalism distrusts concentration of power. It has always been associated with checks and balances and the division of powers. Liberals believe that in a healthy society power and decision-making are widely dispersed throughout the community. They are not to be monopolised. Therefore, the ever increasing centralising of power is striking at the heart and core of liberalism. Mr Speaker, Liberals believe in consensus, and consensus does not mean abject compromise. Strength does not mean bullying. I believe the growth of centralised power within our Government today is restricting effective formulation of policies required by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the matter which finally provoked my resignation. In this the Prime Minister was grossly disloyal to me and broke an undertaking to deny a false and damaging report published about me in my capacity as a senior Minister. On 14 April the leading article on the front page of the Australian was headed 'Fraser, Peacock row set to erupt'. It reported a 'bitter six-month feud' between the Prime Minister and me and 'the latest round of what amounts to the battle for leadership of the parliamentary Liberal Party'. </PARA>
<PARA> It then described conduct by me which, if true, would disentitle me to the respect of my colleagues in this House, the members of the Liberal Party and the Australian public. The article said I had plunged the Federal Government and my relations with the Prime Minister into crisis on the eve of the announcement of the 1980 election date. It alleged I had used that occasion to threaten resignation from the Ministry in order to force Cabinet to comply with my policy on Kampuchea's Pol Pot regime. It alleged that I had made that resignation threat after the Prime Minister had arranged to see the Governor-General to inform him of his election plans and immediately before the Prime Minister was to announce to this House his intentions as to the election. It described my threat as a 'bombshell' which threw Cabinet into turmoil. That allegation was false. It was an account which should be denied in detail if my credit as a responsible member of Cabinet and of my party was to be retained. At my request, conveyed to the Prime Minister through three ministerial colleagues who came to discuss this report with me, the Prime Minister agreed that he would issue a denial. Later, the Prime Minister deputed the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) to show me the form of his so-called denial. These are its full and complete terms:</PARA>
<PARA> I have seen the statement on the front of today's Australian concerning events that occurred last year. There are some significant inaccuracies in that report. </PARA>
<PARA>I was appalled when I saw its bareness and I said so to the Minister for Primary Industry. It scarcely could bear the description of a denial. It did not even deign to express which allegations were denied. For all the reader was to know, it might have been a denial of the allegations in the report that there had been a so-called bitter six month feud or that there was a battle for the leadership of the parliamentary Liberal Party. When I made this point to the Minister he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Any inadequacies are not for you to be concerned about. They are matters that the Prime Minister or Barnett will background on. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has agreed that those were his words. That meant that the Prime Minister or his Press Secretary would orally supply to the Press the details of what he described as significant inaccuracies. I accepted the assurance. The Minister for Primary Industry had been chosen by the Prime Minister as his personal representative. The near useless statement was issued but the Prime Minister said nothing. 'No comment', said Mr Barnett when asked about it. The Prime Minister has never given an explanation for his failure to repudiate effectively the allegations. His failure was disloyal and explicable only as an attempt to cast me as dangerous. This act of disloyalty, this breach of undertaking, was to be the last I would tolerate from the Prime Minister. I decided to leave his Ministry. </PARA>
<PARA> I now give an account of events illustrating a pattern of the Prime Minister's conduct which contributed to my resignation. It will be detailed. I am sorry about that but it is necessary to explain. In the early part of 1975 the Whitlam Government recognised the regime of Pol Pot as the legitimate Government of Kampuchea. Soon after disturbing reports of the atrocities perpetrated by this regime began to filter to the outside world. More horrific information about Pol Pot emerged after the invasion of Kampuchea by Vietnamese forces in December 1978. As a result, I sought and obtained Cabinet approval to review the question of Australia's recognition of the Pol Pot regime. On information provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and other sources, in July 1980 I concluded that withdrawal of recognition was imperative. Having reached that conclusion, I said as much in the course of an interview on the television program Sixty Minutes. At the time the Prime Minister was out of the country. On the day following the interview I cabled to him a transcript of the interview. He sent me a request for a submission to Cabinet to be considered immediately after his return on the following day. On 15 July 1980 Cabinet made a decision rejecting my submission. The minute reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Cabinet considered the question of the recognition of the Pol Pot regime and decided that there should be no change in the Australian Government's present policy. </PARA>
<PARA>I should explain that the question of recognition of the Pol Pot regime involved questions of principle that were to me of the gravest importance. On moral grounds, on political grounds, on legal grounds, recognition gave an impression of support to a butchering regime which had no effective control of the territory. Recognition was unacceptable to the overwhelming majority of Australian citizens. If Australia was to maintain a credible foreign policy and its government to retain the respect of its people, recognition had to be withdrawn. It is axiomatic that Australia has a vital role in Asia. In my view the integrity of Australia's foreign policy should not be compromised. </PARA>
<PARA> On principle I could not remain part of a government committed to recognition of the Pol Pot regime. After the Cabinet meeting I called on the Prime Minister and resigned. I told him that I resigned because I could not sustain a credible foreign policy for this country while we continued recognition of this regime. The Prime Minister said that he refused to accept the resignation. I told him that it was not a matter of offer and acceptance; I had resigned. The Prime Minister asked whether I would discuss the matter further with colleagues and called in the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Minister for Primary Industry. We discussed the matter at length. They offered a compromise on this basis: I would rejoin the Ministry if the Cabinet decision was amended. The words to be added to the decision made by Cabinet that day were these:</PARA>
<PARA> The Cabinet agreed that, as in the past, the matter would be kept under continuing review. The Cabinet also agreed that, if in the judgment of the Minister for Foreign Affairs circumstances alter, the Minister will re-raise the submission with the Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA>I did not give my decision that night. I said that I would inform the Prime Minister next morning whether I would return to the Ministry on the suggested basis. On the following morning I accepted the offer that was made. My resignation from the Ministry on this night has never previously been made public. Press reports have suggested a threat to resign. They were wrong. Mark this point: The terms of our agreement involved two undertakings. One was to keep the matter under review. The other permitted me to bring the matter back to Cabinet if circumstances altered. Circumstances did alter. </PARA>
<PARA> In early September the Prime Minister and I flew to New Delhi for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. En route, I showed the Prime Minister a report from Australian officials whom I had sent to Kampuchea to investigate the alleged deaths of Australian yachtsmen at the hands of the Pol Pot regime. This report chillingly described the methods of torture used by the Pol Pot regime and the types of cells in which the Australians were kept. It concluded that, in all probability, the Australians were gruesomely tortured by the Pol Pot regime before they disappeared. Asking the Prime Minister to bring the matter before the Cabinet at the earliest possible opportunity, I told him that this was compelling evidence of 'an alteration of circumstances' within the terms of our agreement and within the terms of the amended Cabinet decision. The Prime Minister, in breach of his agreement and of the Cabinet decision, refused the request. </PARA>
<PARA> Before our return to Australia various discussions concerning recognition of the Pol Pot regime took place between the Prime Minister, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, me and others. Although they are irrelevant to my decision to resign, I mention that in those discussions attempts were made to persuade me to change my view. As a result of several discussions with the Prime Minister in Singapore he gave me two undertakings: He would make no further public comment on the matter and he would have Cabinet discuss it as soon as he returned to Australia. Because of the sensitivity of the matter, he already had my agreement that I would not bring the matter before Cabinet without his concurrence. </PARA>
<PARA> I left Singapore on 9 September. On the morning of 10 September, upon returning to Australia, I began to prepare the paper to put before Cabinet. The Prime Minister returned later that day. On that night the Prime Minister, despite his undertaking, issued, on Mr Lee's behalf, a Press statement dealing with the Kampuchean question. The statement quoted selectively from correspondence between me and the Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister. Disturbed, I telephoned the Prime Minister when I learnt of this. In plain terms, I told him it was disloyal, as well as being a breach of his undertaking, made to me only the day before, not to make public comment about the matter. By releasing the statement the Prime Minister was publicly associating himself with it, if not actually adopting it. If the Prime Minister did not wish to give his weight to it, why did he issue a statement by a foreign Premier? Why not leave it to the Premier's own diplomatic representative in Canberra, according to the usual practice? The Prime Minister argued that it was not his statement but Mr Lee's. He said he saw no reason to inform me of it whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> Relying on the other undertaking given in Singapore, his original agreement and the Cabinet decision concerning review in altered circumstances, I requested that the Prime Minister have Cabinet meet the next morning to discuss the matter. The Prime Minister did not agree and told me to discuss the matter further with him on the following day. On the following morning, Thursday, 11 September, I sought unsuccessfully to arrange an appointment with the Prime Minister. My staff subsequently made two more unsuccessful attempts. Thereafter, when the House began its sitting, I spoke to the Prime Minister on the floor of the House during Question Time. I asked for the meeting with him, or with Cabinet. I told him, as he already knew from our conversation on the previous night, that I wanted to discuss the breaches of his agreements with me and the whole question of recognition of Pol Pot. He said to speak to his staff and that a time would be made available. When having that conversation I had absolutely no idea that the Prime Minister intended that day to put to Cabinet the proposed election date. </PARA>
<PARA> Later I tried again to obtain the promised appointment, but failed. Cabinet met that afternoon. The first and only item brought before it was the determination of the election date. Yet another undertaking broken. After the meeting I went straight to the Prime Minister's office and told him he had placed me in an intolerable situation. All this took place on a Thursday. There could be no Cabinet meeting on the Friday because everyone was leaving Canberra at the end of the parliamentary week. The Prime Minister had known since July that for intricate foreign policy reasons the change I sought in Australia's policy as to the recognition of the Pol Pot regime should be effected before 15 September, which was the following Monday. The timing was critical because it was linked with the earliest possible day of the meeting of the Credentials Committee of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> When I went to him, the Prime Minister called in three persons: The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), the then Minister for Special Trade Representations-now the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair)-and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). In a lengthy discussion I pointed out the existence of three options: First, I could resign; second, the Cabinet could change its policy; third, in the event that the Government did not change the policy, I could remain silent until after the election and then decline a portfolio in a new Government. When discussing the options I made it clear that if the policy was not changed, the third option-declining a portfolio-was acceptable to me. It was an honourable and a practical compromise. It would recognise my commitment but not disrupt the Government on the eve of an election. The Prime Minister, after all, was to call on the Governor-General that evening concerning the election. He left our meeting to go to Government House. As he did-for it has been reported otherwise-I repeated what I had said earlier: Even if the policy was not changed before the election, I would not resign. I assured him that I would go through the campaign maintaining my silence although I would not serve in his Government after the election. As he left us I gave that assurance. The Prime Minister turned to me and said these exact words: 'Thank you, Andrew'. That this exchange took place was corroborated in my office on 14 April by the Minister for Primary Industry in the presence of two of my ministerial colleagues. They had not known of it. Apparently, they had been under a false impression. </PARA>
<PARA> During the evening of 11 September, after the Prime Minister went to the Governor-General, the Minister for Primary Industry and I drafted a proposal to be put to the Cabinet for a reversal of its decision to recognise the Pol Pot regime. Later the Prime Minister accepted the draft and agreed to place it before Cabinet. On 21 September I left Australia to attend the General Assembly of the United Nations. Two days later the Prime Minister cabled Cabinet's acceptance of the proposal drafted on the night of 11 September. In the event, as is well known, due to the international controversy about the question, the credentials vote was not, in fact, taken in the United Nations until, as I recall, 13 October 1980. Next day I issued a statement announcing the Government's changed policy. So far as I was concerned, the matter rested there until, on the afternoon before the story was published in the Australian on 14 April, I heard the Prime Minister mention our differences over Pol Pot. It must now be obvious why the Australian report on 14 April was so disturbing for its falsity. It is obvious why the Prime Minister could not refuse my request that he correct that report. What remains incapable of even the most charitable explanation is why the Prime Minister, knowing all this, issued a denial by the bareness of which he serviced his word but dishonoured his obligation. </PARA>
<PARA> Before concluding, I wish to make some points abundantly clear. I oppose the philosophy of those who sit opposite. The central tenet of their socialist philosophy and all it would seek to implement is the antithesis of my philosophy and that of the Liberal Party. I am pledged to the principles of my party. I said earlier that I have been a member of the Liberal Party for many years. In that time I have led the Young Liberal Movement and the Victorian Liberal Party. Honourable members will be aware of my previous service as a Minister under three Prime Ministers and as a shadow Minister during the years of the Whitlam Government. In that time there was never any suggestion that I was not a member of the team or that I was unmouldable. I joined my party because it was a liberal party, not a conservative party. Liberalism, properly applied, will arrest the polarisation and the social conflict which is testing our country. Today I have touched lightly on some policy issues. A number of people urged me to develop detailed proposals, and I respect those views. However, my primary duty was to detail the reasons for my resignation, and this I have done. From this place where I proudly stand I will be debating the issues facing our nation and pressing the solutions provided by the party I serve. With my colleagues I look forward to that challenge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) has spoken of many issues. The honourable member in his letter of resignation and in his public statements at the time of his resignation made a number of charges about the conduct of Government business, about the stability and the direction of government and about me. Let me make a comment about one or two of the issues that he raised. The purpose of the Monetary Policy Committee of Cabinet is to consider matters relating to interest rates, banking policy and currency exchange rates. That is its only purpose. I agree with the honourable gentleman: After the newspaper report he mentioned he did raise the matter with me. I can remember making a comment to at least one of my colleagues about it. I think it was before I had pneumonia. But I think the honourable gentleman is in error in saying that he revived my memory of it early in the new year. It is also a matter that could have been raised in Cabinet itself. In the formation of this new Government it was determined that the Wages Policy Committee would not be re-established because it had not met all that often and that the proper forum for matters it dealt with should be Cabinet itself rather than a committee of Cabinet. That was why my Department put recommendations to me which I believed on good grounds ought to be accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to touch very briefly on two points. The honourable member mentioned the incorporation of the Public Service Arbitrator within the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commision. The recommendations-they are recommendations, not decisions-of the Committee chaired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) had not come to Cabinet and indeed it was only two or three days ago that Cabinet determined the matter and, on the advice of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), it is being left for further review. But no final decision had been made on that matter. It was a matter that would come to Cabinet; it was a matter which, in the course of its wide-ranging review, as honourable members will understand, will be brought before Parliament later this week. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kooyong knows full well that I spoke to him about the ICI matter. There was very great concern because of the report in the Melbourne Herald that the 35-hour week issue was out, that the floodgates were open and something had to be done to stop a rash of decisions as a result of that newspaper report coming on top of the Altona decision. What was said then, what was said in a Press statement issued by my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who surely has a significant responsibility in relation to these matters, reflected a Press statement issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by Mr Garland several months ago in the earlier Government. There was nothing new in relation to it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the honourable member for Kooyong's concern in speaking to the House today to substantiate the charges that he has made against the Government and against me. It would have been much better if he had spoken to me or to his Cabinet colleagues along the way. Only seven weeks ago the honourable member, according to a newspaper report of 8 March 1981, said:</PARA>
<PARA> For all that people write that there is enormous division between us, the reality is we work very effectively and very closely together. </PARA>
<PARA>I was pleased at that view of our relationship, which was expressed only last month. I am puzzled and saddened at what he has now done. On 10 April the former Minister's senior private secretary spoke at a meeting that had been advertised as being open to the Press. He made a wide-ranging attack on the Government. He specifically attacked aspects of the Government's actions on industrial relations. He accused certain people of a dishonest approach. I had no doubt that the principles of Cabinet government required that Mr Simon should resign. Under our system of Cabinet government no Minister can publicly attack Cabinet and not resign. By the same token neither can a Minister's senior private secretary attack Cabinet and government policy and remain in his position. </PARA>
<PARA> As is my practice, I consulted my senior colleagues to test their view and they agreed with me. I spoke with the former Minister. I wanted him to understand clearly that it was not only my view but also that of his colleagues that Mr Simon should go. If a Minister holds a view which is contrary to that of all his colleagues it is surely fair enough to expect him to check his own view to see whether it is appropriate, especially in a matter such as this. It says something about a Minister's attitude to Cabinet and to Cabinet solidarity if he requires that his own view should stand without the agreement of Cabinet, as one against all the rest. In Mr Simon's case, where the implications of collective responsibility were so clear and the former Minister was aware of the strong view of his senior colleagues, I cannot understand how he believed that Mr Simon could stay. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kooyong has given as grounds for his resignation that Cabinet is not consulted but by-passed and that Ministers are not given sufficient co-operation and support. Let me start with consultation and let me indicate how Cabinet does operate. Cabinet today operates precisely according to the principles of Cabinet government. If there were any difference between this and previous coalition governments it would be that Ministers are consulted more and that they are more involved in the decision-making process. Non-Cabinet Ministers are normally encouraged to be present at Cabinet meetings if there is a matter of interest to them. There are regular full Cabinet meetings. Under former coalition governments non-Cabinet Ministers were usually present only when their own items were being dealt with. Let me also refer to the way in which revenue decisions are taken in the Budget context. These decisions must obviously be taken by a small group. In many governments they have been taken by two or three Ministers only. Under this Government they are now taken in the Co-ordination Committee which meets with the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and with the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle). In addition, there is consultation with Cabinet and the Ministry about broad options. This is done before the Committee makes its final decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Cabinet government requires wide consultation and wide participation of Ministers in the Government's affairs. In the circumstances of modern government this is achieved by the extensive use of Cabinet committees. The committee system is a well-established and an essential ingredient of Cabinet government. It spreads the work load amongst Ministers and allows the system to cope efficiently with the massive volume of business. Leaving aside the Co-ordination Committee, to which I will return, the general rule is that standing committees of the Cabinet take final decisions. Special committees are also established from time to time. The review of Commonwealth functions is a recent example and the special committees have taken many decisions. The decisions of the committees are recommendations to Cabinet. These committees do not normally take final decisions. They make recommendations which go to the full Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> Now let me turn to the Co-ordination Committee, which normally takes final decisions on policy issues only in relation to the revenue side of the Budget. Its fundamental role, as set out publicly in its terms of reference, is to provide a forum for senior Ministers to consider overall Government strategy. It is comparatively unusual for the Co-ordination Committee to look beforehand at matters going to Cabinet. I have had a check made, and this shows that well over 90 per cent of matters going to Cabinet have had no prior substantive discussion in the Co-ordination Committee. Sometimes the nature of the discussion is: 'Is it worth these matters being discussed at all?' or: 'Should we ask the Minister to bring them forward?' That is the kind of discussion that a Prime Minister should have with senior colleagues. The kinds of issues which do go first to the Co-ordination Committee are those in which a Minister would seek some discussion with senior colleagues before deciding what to propose to Cabinet or in which there is a particular political or strategic significance on which some broad discussion might be held in the Co-ordination Committee before the matter is looked at in Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1979 the membership of this Committee has comprised the five most senior Ministers-the Leaders and Deputy Leaders of the coalition parties and the Government Leader in the Senate. Other Ministers are co-opted to its meetings wherever possible if there is substantive discussion on matters bearing on their portfolios. That is clearly why the Treasurer and the Finance Minister are often co-opted in the Budget context. The Co-ordination Committee also assists me with advice on matters which come to me for my own decision as Prime Minister. These are matters such as a letter to a Premier on a sensitive issue or the handling of some representation made to me on some policy or administrative matter which in the past may well have been determined unilaterally by the Prime Minister of the day. I find invaluable the Committee's advice in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to two other aspects of the Cabinet system. No Ministers belong to all the committees and, further, Ministers are sometimes unable to attend meetings. In both circumstances, however, all Ministers are bound by the decisions, and this includes the Prime Minister. When I am overseas or on leave the business of Cabinet government must go on, and many decisions are taken in my absence. Let me add that in the last two years more than 400 final decisions have been taken by committees of which I am not a member. Yet I am quite properly bound by those decisions. I see the relevant papers, of course, when they are circulated and I may ask that a matter be recommitted if I have some problem with it. Each and every other Minister has the same right, and on occasions that right is exercised. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that background I return to the charge that I have a determination to try to get my own way in Cabinet and that the system is manipulated to that end. I reject those charges totally and I reject them also on behalf of my colleagues on whom they reflect. What does it say of my colleagues that I as Prime Minister can persuade them all to caucus to one particular view? That charge is offensive to them, as it is offensive to me. The principles of Cabinet discussion, decision and responsibility have been reasserted and strengthened since the Government came to office in 1975, by contrast with the way in which they had been downgraded in the previous three years. The objectives of extensive Cabinet consultation and the widest possible involvement of Ministers have been paralleled, as members on the Government side would know, by the system of party committees and party participation which I have encouraged and in many senses initiated. Legislation goes to party committees before going to the party room. There is broader consultation on these matters than ever before, as is especially known to members who were here in earlier times. This has led to greater participation of members of the party who have an interest in a particular matter. There is a philosophy behind that approach, one of involvement and of recognition of the contribution that all party members have to make, and the Cabinet has been run on the same philosophy. If the former Minister's description of the operations of the Cabinet were accurate, it would be plain that the party room has been operating on one philosophy and the Cabinet on another. That is just not so. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering what might have led the honourable member for Kooyong to make these charges, I wondered whether it could be related to the number of occasions on which his colleagues in the Cabinet took a view different from his. I asked for some analysis to be made. This has shown that of the total submissions put forward by the former Minister in his foreign affairs and industrial relations portfolios his own recommendations were accepted without any significant variation in almost 90 per cent of cases. In some cases where his recommendations were not accepted, or not accepted in full, they were simply on funding levels in the Budget context, where no Minister would expect his bids to be accepted in full. Even so, the former Minister was able to convince Cabinet to lift Australia's foreign aid vote from $347m to $547m. This has fully maintained the real value of the foreign aid vote and is an achievement at a time of general expenditure restraint. The record does not suggest to me a Minister whose authority was being undermined by Cabinet policy. A Cabinet Minister must recognise that no Minister and no Prime Minister can expect to get his way on every decision, not even on every decision within his own portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of my own concern to ensure that the Cabinet system was operating properly, I commissioned a review in the latter part of 1978 in the course of which the views of all Ministers were canvassed. The recommendations brought forward as a result were largely adopted by the Cabinet, including changes arising from suggestions by the honourable member for Kooyong. I submit again that if the honourable member had concerns about the way in which the system was operating or about the handling of any of his individual submissions, these concerns should have been raised with me or with Cabinet. Cabinet is a group of men and women. If a member has a complaint about the way in which Cabinet is being run that is the forum in which it should be raised. Indeed, there is a duty to so raise it. These concerns should not have been raised in the way in which they were raised-in a letter of irrevocable resignation. I mention also the fact that in October last year the honourable member for Kooyong accepted a new commission in the Government. That is a significant factor indeed. If he had any concern as to his treatment as Minister for Foreign Affairs should he not have raised the matter then and said: 'I want matters to be handled differently from the way in which they were handled when I was Foreign Minister'? He did not at that time raise any such concerns with me. </PARA>
<PARA> This might be an appropriate time to say something about the issue of Pol Pot. The honourable member for Kooyong has spoken about it at length. Let me emphasise one point which is of great significance. I believe that it is a point of view that will be shared by all honourable members in this House. The only issue in relation to Pol Pot was the issue of timing. Because of the nature of the Pol Pot regime, derecognition at some point was inevitable. It was a brutal regime. It was perhaps the worst regime since the time of Hitler in the last world war. Cabinet had received a number of submissions from the Minister or the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs suggesting that recognition be continued, that the policy be kept under review and that derecognition be deferred. In the months before the period about which the honourable gentleman spoke, the issue had come forward. On those occasions Cabinet accepted the recommendations. At all times the matter was kept under continuing review. In July the Minister indicated publicly that his own view may have changed. He indicated that the matter came to Cabinet but, because of its concerns for co-operation with the Association of South East Asian Nations, Cabinet reaffirmed the view that had earlier been recommended by the honourable gentleman. But it was still a question of timing, not one of principle. It was only a question of timing. Nobody in this House has a monopoly on moral repugnance. We believed that we should offer further support to ASEAN countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter was certainly discussed with Mr Lee during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting in Delhi. On a flight from Delhi to Singapore, the Singaporean Prime Minister, the honourable member for Kooyong and I discussed the matter. Mr Lee argued at length that recognition should be continued. I pointed out to him that his Delhi Press conference left that far from clear and was open to other interpretations. I told him also that there was increasing public concern and that it was important that not only the Australian Government but also the Australian people should understand the general position of ASEAN because people in those countries live closer to the problems and the dangers than do we in Australia. The honourable gentleman did not come to Australia with me on the aircraft which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) would enjoy so much. He came on a commercial aircraft. I stayed longer in Singapore. The Singaporean Prime Minister indicated that he would issue a formal statement. I arranged for a copy to be tabled and distributed in Australia because, as I have indicated, it was important that not only the Government but also the Australian people understood the nature of that view. I did not know of the existence of certain correspondence between the Singaporean and Australian foreign Ministers. I still have seen only a draft of one of the letters because I am advised that no departments hold the correspondence. If I had known that Mr Lee would quote from those letters I would obviously have sought to deter him from doing so. Let me repeat that the division between the Minister and Cabinet was never one of principle; it was one of timing. </PARA>
<PARA> On 11 September Cabinet determined that a general election would be held. Ministers, including the honourable member for Kooyong, agreed with the decision and the date. After the processes had irretrievably been set in train I was surprised indeed to find that the Minister found his position in the Government untenable. I regret that the Minister seems to believe that commitments were given in Singapore and Delhi because there were no such commitments. Let me assert without equivocation that because of the nature of the Cabinet decision taken in July no commitment was necessary. That decision left it to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs to bring the matter before Cabinet at a time of his choosing. He did not need the concurrence of the Prime Minister or any other Minister. Therefore, to be told after the date of the election had been determined and the processes set in train that his position was untenable was something that I found hard to understand. If there was a problem in relation to the date of the election, surely there was a duty upon him to mention that problem or difficulty in Cabinet. It was never mentioned in Cabinet discussions at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Something has been said about three options and a commitment given in relation to a very brief Press statement which I issued on the date of Mr Simon's resignation. It was the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) who exchanged that piece of paper and the piece of paper with Mr Simon's resignation on it with the honourable member for Kooyong. There was no commitment beyond that. As I indicated later at a Press conference, the report was inaccurate specifically on whether there was a statement of resignation or whether three options were put forward. As the Minister for Primary Industry wrote down, the options were: That he would resign over the failure to recognise Pol Pot; that the Government would change its policy; or that there would be no change of policy and nothing would be done until after the election, but that he would not take part in a new government. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who discussed this matter, including the honourable member for Kooyong, indicated that that third option was no option at all, that that path would be too dangerous for any government to follow, because if news of that were to leak in the middle of a difficult election campaign quite plainly the position of the Government and of Government parties would be very greatly damaged indeed. The matter had to be properly determined, and it was determined. It has been said in the presence of one of my colleagues by the person who wrote that story that that story did not come from my office or from anyone associated with me. If there was any implication in the honourable member's remarks that it did, the writer of the story and the honourable gentleman who preceded me in speaking on this matter know that that implication is incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the statement that Ministers are not given sufficient co-operation and support, that there is interference and an undermining of ministerial authority. A defence is built into our system of government against the emergence of presidential-type government. That defence is the strong Cabinet system which operates. These days it is inevitable that Prime Ministers become involved in a wide range of issues. No Prime Minister could refuse to take an interest in major issues affecting the Government, in mainstream issues of concern to the Australian people. Plainly, the Prime Minister must be involved. I have had great involvement in economic matters but I believe that neither the former Treasurer nor the present Treasurer (Mr Howard) found that involvement in any way excessive. </PARA>
<PARA> The overwhelming degree of acceptance that Cabinet gave to the submissions of the honourable member for Kooyong when he was a Minister surely indicates in plain terms the measure of support that he was getting both from the Cabinet and from me. Indeed, I am sure the honourable member will recall that earlier this year when the question of responsibility for the public handling of industrial disputes-a general responsibility on behalf of the Government-was raised, I made it clear in Cabinet that the then Minister for Industrial Relations should take the lead. Is that undermining? Was that working overtly or covertly to diminish the former Minister's authority?</PARA>
<PARA> Again, thinking back to the time when the honourable member for Kooyong was Minister for Foreign Affairs, I sought to make sure that foreign affairs concerns were adequately taken into account, as I did in relation to the discussions about air fares and the Association of South East Asian Nations. I remember when the former Minister and I met with officials, including transport officials, to make sure that everything possible had been done to cover the foreign affairs interests in these matters. My involvement here is the proper role of a Prime Minister working to make sure that the interests of all Ministers and all departments are fully and properly considered. That is not seeking to undermine; it is seeking to support and to protect the proper and legitimate interests of this nation. It makes no sense to suppose that a Prime Minister would seek to undermine the authority of any of his Ministers, for such a course of action would only undermine the authority of his Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kooyong made a significant charge when he said that the stability and sense of direction of the Government had been cast aside. I find it strange that the honourable gentleman makes such a charge now. How can a Minister sit in Cabinet year after year holding such views and never raise those views in Cabinet? If any Minister feels that way, should he not tell me, should he not advise his colleagues? I introduced regular meetings of the full Ministry to enable Ministers to raise any matters that they wished concerning the Government and its policies. Opportunities have been deliberately provided. Why did the former Minister never raise those charges or complaints in Cabinet with me or with his colleagues? Let me add that if there were any truth in the claim that the stability of the Government had been cast aside-which there is not-it would not have been I or any other present member of the Government who would have cast aside that stability. </PARA>
<PARA> Plainly, Australia is one of the most stable countries in the world. People know where they stand, by contrast with the chaotic situation under Labor. There is renewed confidence throughout Australia. The direction of the Government has been maintained continuously ever since we came to office in 1975. The disaster of the Labor Government helped to make a perception of our direction clearer than ever. Throughout the last five years our first priority has been to restore the economy after Labor's madness. This was our pre-eminent responsibility, for a strong economy is the precondition for almost any other objective. The most vital element in restoring the economy has been the attack on inflation, and everyone knows that this Government has maintained that direction unswervingly. </PARA>
<PARA> We came to office stressing the value of the individual and the need for increasing opportunities for all Australians. We have always been a government that cares about people, for that is what liberalism is all about. The Government's direction has always been based on the belief that individuals are the best judges of how to spend their earnings--</PARA>

I believe that no Australian government has been more dedicated to strengthening the free enterprise system, more determined to avoid waste and over-regulation by government and more purposeful in strengthening the independence and responsibility of the States than this Government has been. This Government is committed to the widest possible use of the market as the way to give consumers the greatest influence over the allocation of resources. The Government has consistently stressed the importance of individual rights and unyielding resistance to racism, discrimination and exploitation. There has never been a government more determined to stand up for the individual against powerful unions, against bureaucracy, against racism and discrimination. Through the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and our support for the establishment of a human rights commission, we have demonstrated this commitment unambiguously.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our freedom of information legislation, if too mild and cautious for some of our members, is a significant start. It is this Government-not Labor, for all its professions-that has been prepared to make that start. I am proud of what we have been able to do in defending our magnificent natural heritage against exploitative development and in protecting the environment. Through all our policies we have acted to protect and to advance the interests of those in need, to make sure that expenditure restraint in other areas has been sufficient to guarantee that adequate assistance is given to those who need it most. Massive increases have been made possible by this approach in aid of the handicapped and the disabled. The Government's expenditure in that area now runs to more than $1,000m. What policies and actions could be more liberal than these? There is still far to go in many areas but the catalogue of our achievements is a good check list of what a liberal direction is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me turn to the direction which the Government takes in international affairs. This is an area in which I have always thought that the former Minister and I have co-operated significantly for Australia's advantage. I believe that our achievements bear out that claim. The Government established a new sense of purpose and direction in our relationship with South Pacific countries-an area which was largely ignored before 1975. The first Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting was established on Australia's initiative. These meetings have established a framework of co-operation between Commonwealth states within the region which was previously lacking. During the honourable member's period as Minister for Foreign Affairs the Government helped to achieve greater relevance for the Commonwealth in dealing with human rights and threats to peace. At Lusaka we supported the proper independence of Zimbabwe and the full equality of all members of that state before the law. We were both conscious that if Australia's approach at that conference was not successful then he and I together might well have been somewhat isolated in our spectrum of politics within this country. But we went ahead together in spite of that and enhanced Australia's reputation as a result. The then Foreign Minister was fully involved in all of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> By our actions we made clear to the world the direction of Australia's concerns. Again, Australia was at the forefront in our realisation of the growing military might of the Soviet Union and in our awareness of its significance. In 1976 I spoke to this House on that subject. That speech was prepared in co-operation with the Department of Foreign Affairs. Here is an issue of incalculable importance on which I worked closely with the former Minister to make plain the direction of Australia's policy. Since we came to office in 1975 the Government has consistently enhanced Australia's constructive role in world affairs and strengthened Australia's independent voice in the world. There was no undermining of the honourable member's authority as Minister in any of this. Let me add that when the honourable member for Kooyong was Minister for Foreign Affairs I thought it proper that he should accompany me whenever possible to major international conferences or in visits overseas. That is not the practice of all heads of government, as he well knows. Let me say again that, far from undermining his authority, I was seeking through his presence on these visits to provide for the fullest participation of the Foreign Minister and to enhance his and Australia's reputation. Not surprisingly, our policy in foreign affairs benefited as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that in the perspective of the issues of great and enduring importance to Australia on which we have worked together, personal feelings and difficulties should be treated as of little consequence. This Government has achieved great and significant objectives; the honourable member has been a part of that. How can it be that he has now turned aside? How can it be that the concerns he has enumerated today were not raised with me or with Cabinet? How can it be that he chooses this place to damage a great political party, even if that is not his intention, and good government? The hopes and opportunities of millions of Australians depend to a very significant degree on what we all do in this place. They expect better from us than we sometimes provide. They have every right to expect more than has been provided in the last fortnight. It is not surprising that people are concerned when issues which they rightly regard as minor and irrelevant or which they cannot understand are given quite disproportionate weight. The well-being of this country, as history has demonstrated, depends upon the great strength and cohesion of the Liberal Party and this coalition Government. </PARA>
<PARA> My concerns are for Australia and all Australians and securing for all Australians the benefits that the application of our Liberal philosphy can bring. Sometimes I am accused of being too blunt but if this country is to be governed well it is not always possible to avoid an argument. Firmness and determination are often the only answers to unreasonable actions. Plain speaking is necessary to defend Australia's markets against powerful trade groupings such as the European Community. I make no apology for having an intense pride in Australia and things Australian. I will always stand for that with whatever strength I and this Government can command. I do not apologise because Cabinet brought in the Air Force to protect people stranded through the actions of selfish, militant unions in the Qantas dispute. The Government will continue to take the firmest possible stand against the job-destroying 35-hour week campaign. This Government is the protector of the people, the defender of individual rights and of the interests of the Australian community. I am proud to lead a Liberal-based government which is prepared to act and to stand up for the interests of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most pleasing things about Australia at the present time is that the philosophy of this Government has become so widely accepted throughout the community. People are now recognising the benefits of more limited government in lower taxes, more jobs, higher growth, better incomes, lower inflation and more available resources to help those in need. This recognition is the true mark of the success of the course we marked out in 1975. Our direction is clear and all Australians will benefit further as a result. The honourable member for Kooyong has stated plainly and repeatedly and from the very first that his statement today will end the matter. We all welcome that. I approach the future without rancour. My enduring concern is the great importance to Australia of the stability of government, the achievement of our common purposes and the implementation of our Liberal philosophy through our policies. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House expresses its want of confidence in the Prime Minister because he has demonstrated himself to be unfit to hold that high office. </PARA>
<PARA>We have just heard an extraordinary litany of the vindictiveness, of the petty nature and of the petulance of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) towards his Cabinet colleagues, more particularly towards the former Minister for Industrial Relations. It was a searing indictment of how Cabinet is conducted by Prime Minister Fraser. The response of the Prime Minister was smug, as one would have anticipated. He said that Cabinet operates to his satisfaction. With that simple statement he appeared to think that he had repudiated the serious charges which have been levelled before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Prime Minister's statement was a chronicle of banalities. It did not address itself to the central issue. What is more significant in all of this is that the clash today between the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) was a clash of style and personality more than anything else. What is equally clear is that one of them is particularly careless in handling the truth but that both have a great deal to answer for on matters that need to be developed further in this Parliament. What is also quite patently obvious is that the great issue that was to go off with a loud bang today only got to the point of a squeak. The public is the loser in this. What is clear is that the Government is disunited. It is in turmoil. It is stricken by turbulence which is undermining its ability to govern the country. </PARA>
<PARA> For a fortnight the public has been watching the day by day turmoil of a government locked in serious internal conflict. The Prime Minister and one of his most senior Ministers have been engaged in a deadly exchange. The sum product of this extraordinary turbulence has been the destruction of one Minister; the tarnished reputation of the Prime Minister more deeply scarred; the Government steeped in dissension and disarray; and the process of government paralysed for several weeks as this unedifying public brawl came to a head. The real issue is not whether the honourable member for Kooyong is right or wrong or whether the Prime Minister is correct and proper in their respective conduct; rather it is the concern that the public feels about a confused and disunited government and the fact that the community has to pay a high price for it. The deplorable quality of national government is summed up in one critical statistic. The resignation of the Minister for Industrial Relations is the fifteenth resignation, stand-down or sacking from the Fraser Ministry in only five years. The Fraser Government is crumbling under the corrosive disabling influences of its own internal discord and conflict. There is no hero or villain in today's episode of the Fraser Government engaged in its latest binge of self-destructiveness. There is no black or white knight. This is a nasty and damaging episode in which all participants share culpability. I repeat that it is the Australian public which pays the price of national government distracted and in turmoil and the price of neglect of bad government. </PARA>
<PARA> A vast and unflattering range of charges and counter-charges has been made by today's participants in the leadup to this conflict over the past fortnight. The whole process has been vulgar and unedifying. The Prime Minister assured us that the former Minister for Industrial Relations is impetuous, emotionally unstable, fickle, pathologically insecure and implacably petulant. That is bad enough, but the former Minister for Industrial Relations is not to be outdone. He bluntly accused the Prime Minister of treachery, in fostering the publication of personally damaging reports against him with malicious intent, of impulsive and unpredictable behaviour, of an obsessive and marked determination to have his own way, of treating the Cabinet as a cipher, of being an alien to fundamental liberal principles and of being spiritually more at home with the National Country Party and, for good measure, added that the Prime Minister is mentally unstable. The dirty washing of the Government is decked out in grim array for all to see. The Australian Financial Review editorial summed up the situation this morning pretty well. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Today Andrew Peacock and Malcolm Fraser both have to justify themselves. This might be difficult, since to a cynical observer it might appear that so far they have been telling nothing but the truth about each other. </PARA>
<PARA>That seems to have been confirmed today. The editorial concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> The worst possible result today would be a mere listing by each of the contenders of the other's failings. It is up to Mr Peacock to make it more. </PARA>
<PARA>He did not make it more. He gave a list of issues about which he felt he had a justifiable grievance. We were expecting the big bang. It was not even a whimper. It was a tiny squeak. He has been frozen out of the economics affairs committees and procedures in the Cabinet and has been circumvented in the deliberations of the razor gang. He stated that he and the Prime Minister had some conflict about the 35-hour working week campaign. That was no surprise to anyone. He said that the Co-ordination Committee considered matters about which he was concerned and he was not involved. He stated that the Prime Minister lobbied Ministers. My God, I have to tell the House that is no novelty. In fact, all these things, I seem to remember, in some degree or other-nowhere near as large as this-are experiences of former Cabinet Ministers serving in this Parliament. I do not wish to go into all the issues which he has raised because, quite frankly, it was a thin set of complaints of 'principle' that the former Minister raised. </PARA>
<PARA> The spectacular achievement of the Prime Minister in responding, however, was to make the rather thin explanation of the honourable member for Kooyong look impressive. The substantive matter, which is the only matter on which we should deliberate for any time at all, concerns the recognition of the Pol Pot administration. Bear in mind that among other issues of principle that the former Minister complained about was that tendency of the Prime Minister to go outside Cabinet and to seek to go around collective responsibility. In the statement that the former Minster made to the Parliament he said that he adopted a number of tactics in an effort to win on this issue of principle. He spoke out publicly outside Cabinet-the very thing which he has condemned. He stated that he resigned, that that was withdrawn and that he threatened to resign. Five months later he resigned on this matter of principle which was settled in October of last year-six months ago. He claims that he won, but there is a rather curious and perplexing aspect about this. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the House that the honourable member for Kooyong deliberately clouded this issue. The Government did vote in favour of accepting the credentials of the Pol Pot regime at the last session of the United Nations, as the former Minister well knows. It is a very thin and fine technicality to argue that the Government nonetheless withdrew recognition of the Pol Pot claim to control of Kampuchea. The former Minister supported this. The Government voted for this recognition of the credentials of the Pol Pot delegation at the United Nations last October. What does this mean? It means that it compelled Australia to accept the Pol Pot regime in the United Nations and its specialised agencies for the whole of 1981. That is not new information. The honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) was kind enough to remind me of it. He has raised these points before in the Parliament. I leave the House with this very sober thought for consideration: If this matter was such an enormous matter or issue of principle why did the Minister not resign before this? Why was he prepared to accept an extension for 12 months of the recognition of a particularly odious administration which he has said he persistently condemned and which he could bear no part of as a matter of principle?</PARA>
<PARA> What has happened today is that we have seen a clash of style and personalities. We have seen conflict. The conflict which is evident on this occasion is only the latest of a long record of internal dissention and turmoil within the Fraser Government. It will not be the last conflict of personalities and style because members of the Government do not have any principles and they do not have any great policies. The Fraser Government is the most self-destructively turbulent of any in the history of this country. There are no winners in the Government ranks in this brawl, just losers. The Prime Minister loses little because he loses dignity. He has little of that left. The former Minister for Industrial Relations loses mightily because his resignation looks for all the world as if it comes from a trap craftily set by the Prime Minister into which he impulsively jumped. There is every evidence that the former Minister, as the Prime Minister has claimed publicly is his tendency, wilted under the heat. </PARA>
<PARA> The most serious and damaging aspect of this whole sorry state of affairs is the clear evidence it provides of the disarray and disintegration of the Fraser Government. Equally as serious is the manner in which the Government has sat immobilised for weeks as a government, preoccupied by this destructive personality conflict. There are matters of fact, however, which establish the erratic nature of national government under the Fraser Government and which are symptomatic of its congenital inability to work as a team for the good government of Australia. I have mentioned the most notorious of them. There have been 15 resignations, stand downs or dismissals from the Fraser Ministry in five years. Only 14 members of the original Fraser Ministry remain today although the period that has elapsed is so short. Friend and foe are bowled over like nine pins from the Ministry. I mention the three most notable. Vic Garland-he took the rap for the Government on a bribery charge. His reward? He was pushed out of government. Eric Robinson fought a proper and decent fight in defence of the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party. He was subjected by the Prime Minister and especially his National Country Party colleagues in the Ministry to extraordinary pressures and, finally, to inexcusable humiliation. Then there is Senator Withers, the fall guy in an effort to rig the electorate boundaries. He is now stranded on the back benches of the Senate like a large saurian, unblinking, and biding his time and waiting for his chance to strike back. The Ministry has become a Bermuda Triangle for the ambitions of the Prime Minister's friends and foes alike. Look at the letter in today's Age, unsourced, which points out that that much vaunted meeting of Liberal Party officials last Friday, allegedly endorsing the Prime Minister as its representative, did no such thing. It mentions Sir John Atwill of the Liberal Party. I shall quote the contents of the statement so the record is straight. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Sir John's statement last Friday declared that 'representatives of all State parties stressed their divisions' total support for the Prime Minister. The letter leaked last night is highly damaging to the Prime Minister and his supporters . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . all those attending the meeting of Liberal Party officials had been in the 'difficult position of wishing to express their organisation's support for Malcolm Fraser in the position of Prime Minister-in other words, support for whoever the Prime Minister may be at the time'. </PARA>
<PARA>There is not much dedication there. I understand that letter comes from Queensland, from Dr Herron, the President of the Liberal Party in that State. There is a picturesque quality to the membership and the behaviour of the Fraser Ministry, to the quality of the government which he provides. It is exemplified by the plotting and the counterplotting that have been going on within the ranks of the Government unremittingly for the past five and a half years. We have heard a litany of some of it today, but it represents only the tip of the iceberg. </PARA>
<PARA> Where are the great issues of principle? Where are the philosophical inspirations we were going to hear from the honourable member for Kooyong today? All he is seeking to do is to capture a coalition of malcontents on the back bench of the House of Representatives and the Senate; the free traders-he has never given any evidence of being a free trader in his days as Minister for Foreign Affairs-the discontents over Western Australian air fares; the States' righters in relation to Commonwealth-State finances; the members from Victoria and Queensland unhappy with the way in which the Prime Minister runs the Party; the anti-Country Party forces, which are not insignificant; and the largest group of dissidents of all-the anti-Fraser group. The Government is more interested in self-disablement, like the pyromaniac who wants to jump into his own fire, than it is in governing this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The genesis of these problems goes back some time. It goes back to Victorian factionalism. It goes back to the Liberal Party push in Gippsland and Peter Nixon's retribution more recently to even up the score-the vindictiveness in retaliation for the old wounds that were opened up on that occasion. That is the basis of the attack on Barry Simon. It goes back to 1971, to the clash between Gorton as Prime Minister and Peacock as the Minister for the Army and Fraser as the Minister for Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> Malcolm Fraser has proved that he has a long memory. He has set a trap for the honourable member for Kooyong and he has caught him. Australia is in trouble because of all of this. It is ambushed deep in the heartland of pay-back politics in the Liberal and Country parties. While this sordid affair goes on-and it will-it will be sapping the energies and diverting the attention of the Government from governing. The big problems will get bigger. The issues of increasingly costly housing, rising interest rates, skyrocketing unemployment, the failure of the Government to define a coherent policy in relation to mineral development in this country and the way in which the resource wealth will be shared, and shared fairly, are only a few of the issues that deserve to be considered before this Parliament. The fact that there are only five Bills on the Notice Paper-there are a number of statements of no consequence but there are only five minor Bills which were placed on the Notice Paper only last week-is an indication of how bereft of creative parliamentary work the Government is at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Too much of what has masqueraded as political exchange in the past fortnight is more suited for the gossip pages of the scandal newspaper. In that sense it seems appropriate that the whole thing should have been brought to a head by a planted article in the Australian on 14 April. I do not want to canvass that issue. It has been done already by both participants. I sincerely hope that neither expects us to adjudicate on which of the two we are supposed to support. We are left stunned at the relevations which have been made, at the depth of bitterness which is evident and the impairment of the proper functions of government which arise because of this disabling behaviour of members of the Ministry. But we are certainly not going to set ourselves up as some sort of conciliation and arbitration court. A scourge on both their houses. It is a clash of style and a clash of personality. It is nothing greater than that and it deserves to be condemned on that basis, and both of them deserve to be repudiated on those grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a trivial pretext on the part of the Prime Minister to bring about this crisis-the Simon resignation. What has he done about the conflict of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) with basic policy of the Government? What has he done about the overrunning in Cabinet solidarity in relation to taxation policy? What has he done about his going to the Gold Coast and proposing flat tax in direct conflict with Government policy? More recently he was in direct conflict with the Government in relation to Trans-Australia Airlines. The Government has double standards. Fierce retribution against the weak cannot be silenced against others. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister says that the Prime Minister could have killed all the speculation and the problems with a refutation of the article in the Australian on 14 April. How ironic. On 9 March 1971 the Prime Minister, then Minister for Defence just resigned, said:</PARA>
<PARA> One sentence would have killed that report. </PARA>
<PARA>He was complaining then of planted articles in the Packer newspapers, now owned by Sir Rupert Murdoch or rather Mr Rupert Murdoch-I am a little ahead of the event. The very same thing has been complained about today by the man who was then the Minister for the Army. If he had stood up and taken a firm line in defence of Gorton, who despite whatever shortcomings he may have, is a far better man and far better Australian than this Prime Minister will ever be, the course of events would have been considerably different. </PARA>
<PARA> But the situation is not Fraser's fault alone. Those advising him and those closest to him, his spiritual brothers, his hobby farmers from the Country Party, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), the Deputy Prime Minister, and the part time undertaker, are the people who share responsibility with him. These are the people who are passing on to him the advice as to how he should be handling this matter. However, the major problem is the Prime Minister's erratic ambition. For 15 years he has been at the centre of confrontation and division within Australian politics and its economy. He has an apparently insatiable ambition, an ego needing constant crises on which to feed to prove itself. In the meantime the country is divided. The problem goes back a long way, long before the 15 resignations, stand-downs, dismissals I have mentioned. There was the conflict with Gorton in 1970 and in 1975 the destruction of you, Mr Speaker. If you had been Prime Minister of a Liberal-Country Party Government in 1975 the atmosphere in this country would have been considerably different, and the atmosphere today would have been remarkably better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. In so doing I want to make it very clear that this is a motion which should be voted on with an independent frame of mind, and one in relation to which the members of the Liberal Party at least can exercise their great liberalism to find out whether this country is being properly managed. The motion which has been introduced will enable all honourable gentlemen opposite to judge the issue which has been put before this Parliament today. The issue is one of no confidence in the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Certainly, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) would need to support the motion because his whole litany in this place today has been about a man who is unfit to rule. He used words such as 'irreconcilable', 'manic obsession' and 'inability to consult'. We have been shown an aspect of somebody who is not entitled to be a Minister let alone the Prime Minister. It is hard to work out whether this is an epilogue or a prologue. It is hard to work out who is coming and who is going. The issue is that this nation has never been in a more pitiful situation. We have never placed much weight on what the Government says.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the record. If, as the honourable member for Kooyong said, he was very concerned about recognition of Pol Pot-he should have been-let me remind the Prime Minister and all Ministers of the many attempts we made throughout 1980 to get the Government to derecognise the Pol Pot regime as a genocidal regime. We spoke about this matter from February 1980 until the time the Parliament was dissolved. I asked a question in March 1980 of the then Minister for Foreign Affairs. The question, in part, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . how does the Government react to the comment made by Pol Pot's henchman, Khieu Samphan, that Australian support was precious to the Pol Pot regime and that Pol Pot counted Australia amongst his closest supporters. </PARA>
<PARA>That question was asked in March 1980. The reply stated: 'Well, of course, it is a political matter and there have been some discussions and perhaps there will be a political solution'. Why was the answer not given then that that regime did not deserve recognition, even in March 1980? Again, I raised the matter in August 1980 in a discussion on human rights. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> Two Australians were executed by the Pol Pot regime. </PARA>
<PARA> They were Ronald Keith Dean and David Lloyd Scott. Their offence, it is said, was to sail too close to the Kampuchean coast. Their butcher, the camp commandant, subsequently escaped to Thailand where he was fed by aid. His name is Duch. He has now returned to Kampuchea with a promotion, as Security Officer in the Central Committee of the Pol Pot faction Communist Party. It turns out that the confession of David Lloyd Scott was signed . . . on 12 December 1978. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable members to mark that date. My remarks continued:</PARA>
<PARA> On 13 December 1978, this Government announced that it had decided to open negotiations with Pol Pot with a view to entering into diplomatic relations. </PARA>
<PARA>Where is the substance of what this debate is about except the dishonesty of what has been happening and what has been put forward to the Australian people? The real issue of that debate at that time related to something else. It was this: I continued in that debate in August 1980 by saying that this country had a Foreign Minister who allegedly did not want to recognise Pol Pot but had to do so because the Prime Minister had had a discussion with Chairman Hua of China and had guaranteed Chairman Hua that he would continue to recognise Pol Pot because that was in agreement with Chinese foreign policy. So it is on record right throughout 1980 that the two gentlemen who are the subject of the debate today were in cahoots as to what ought to be done, paid no mind to the deaths of the two Australians which occurred in 1978 and at the same time as the deaths occurred urged that diplomatic relations be established. That is one example. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue today for the Australian people to judge is this: Who is entitled to lead this country? Where are the principles of these two people and where is their integrity concerning Cabinet solidarity and ministerial responsibility? I accept the word of the honourable member for Kooyong that Cabinet is a one-man Cabinet. The Prime Minister runs the lot. He spoke about the fracturing of Cabinet government which has taken place. Power has been centralised in one man. How can we have effective government if that is the situation? Is it not true, as the honourable member for Kooyong said, that he was not included in any matter of substance because he was virtually on the way out. We can see that is true because he has mentioned today how he was feeling the situation back in 1980. The wonder of it is why he accepted a portfolio in this new ministry in view of what happened in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister made the point that he wondered why the honourable member for Kooyong took eight months to come to a decision on his resignation. Perhaps the honourable member for Kooyong was following the precedent set by the right honourable gentleman in 1971. Let us place on record the fact that when the Prime Minister was Minister for Defence he resigned in March 1971 and made a statement to this House about what he thought of the then Prime Minister, Mr Gorton. He made that statement on the basis that there had been a call-out order for the Pacific Island Regiment in July 1970. He said that he was not consulted about it. The significant part of that is that the present Prime Minister, when he was Minister for Defence, did nothing about it for eight months. So there is some significance in that eight-month delay. The same situation applies in this case. It was said at that time that if Mr Fraser had felt aggrieved by any action of Mr Gorton regarding the call-out order he should have properly resigned. He chose not to do so. He let eight months go by before voicing his complaint. So there is some consistency in the two situations, although the Prime Minister has some syndrome about there being an eight-month gap before one faces up to the fact that one should resign from a Cabinet in which one has no support at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the other matters are very important ones. They are matters which were touched on by the Prime Minister. They concern how well the Government is doing. If that is an issue we want to widen this motion of no confidence to encompass the whole of the Government and not just the Prime Minister. We did not know what was happening until we heard the statements which have been made today. They are lightweight in their content but very heavy in their indictment of the tragic sort of Cabinet we have governing this country. It is a Cabinet that cannot get its own act together. When a Liberal Minister is in trouble with his Prime Minister, who is called in to act as peacemaker? It is the Country Party Ministers who are called in. Never at any stage did we see any senior Liberal Ministers involved. It was Country Party Ministers who told the honourable member for Kooyong how the situation could perhaps be solved. That might explain some of the problems that the country is now facing, because it is a case of a coalition-I emphasise the word 'coalition'-of two parties with two different policies having a tug-of-war all the time, and the country is making no progress. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Housing and Construction ought to talk. People cannot afford to pay mortgages these days because interest rates have escalated to 15 per cent, 16 per cent, and 17 per cent. Another Minister talks about hospitals and how this Government is helping the hospitals. Because of this Government's inability to get a health program going we find that State governments have to provide additional funding to help the additional 12 per cent of people who go to hospitals because they cannot afford doctors. Why is that? The reason is that people cannot keep up their insurance premiums. How many people are in health insurance funds today? The answer is less than 50 per cent of the population. So all the hospitals in the country are breaking down on two issues. They have to treat at least 12 per cent more patients and, because so many people are uninsured, the hospitals cannot collect the same fees they were collecting before. These are the fundamental issues. Is there any wonder that we have these problems when the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations are squabbling on the issues of what they think of each other instead of having what should be a fundamental unity of purpose to carry out the Government's so-called mandate to guarantee good economic government which it received at the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now come to the industrial matters that were raised by the honourable member for Kooyong. Certainly, he has been trampled underfoot. Certainly he has been of no significance in any matter of industrial relations. He has not been of any significance because the Prime Minister has taken over the running of the issues, as he does on any issue except that of making a statement in this House. Today was the first time that the right honourable gentleman has made a statement. Incredibly it was prepared in advance to answer a statement which was to be made by the honourable member for Kooyong and which the Prime Minister had not seen. That might be why we have to educate the people of Australia to look at the tragic record of the Prime Minister in the industrial relations area. This record goes back a long way. In 1977 we were going to be called back to a special session of this Parliament to deal with the air traffic controllers' dispute in Tasmania. But luckily the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) was able to settle the matter without the Prime Minister. Honourable members opposite know that that happened. Honourable members will remember the problems at the Redfern Mail Exchange. In this instance the Government rushed in immediately with another piece of emergency legislation to enable a Minister of the Government to stand down any employee. The employees had no rights at all. Then we had the Telecom dispute in which the Prime Minister rushed into this Parliament and said that not one person on strike would get paid. Of course, that dispute was settled on a Sunday 48 hours later and all employees received their back pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Thank God for Mr Justice Moore when we look at section 45D of the Trade Practices Act. The disputes concerning Gorman and Laidely that cost this country millions and millions of dollars were settled only because of the intervention of Mr Justice Moore who used his conciliatory ability-the legislation of this Parliament was against him-to get the parties together and to get the whole of the machinery of business back to work. The Prime Minister appeared on the late late show with John Singleton and said that it had nothing to do with him, that it was a State matter. That is how he acts. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent radar dispute has been mentioned in this debate. I would say that this dispute sent East West Airlines Ltd to the mortgagees for a start. The dispute, which went on for a long while, could have been settled by the former Minister for Industrial Relations. It could have been settled and would have been settled but the Prime Minister said: 'No, it is not to be done'. A working party of the Department of Transport had been working for two years on the cause of that dispute and had agreed on a settlement. This shows the sort of solidarity in the Cabinet. The terms and conditions of a settlement had been agreed upon. It was agreed that there would be a reclassification of radar technicians. That was the way that the dispute should have been settled. But no, the Prime Minister intervened. With the Public Service Board at his heels he took Mr Cole to Cabinet and said: 'No, you cannot settle that dispute'. So the Government paralysed the nation with that dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government ought to have a look at what Ansett and others think of its ability in the industrial relations field because the dispute cost them millions of dollars. The matter is now back in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on a proper basis and I hope it will be settled. The then Minister for Transport knew that a working party had been working on industrial relations in this area for two years. One should not trample that work under foot simply because one was Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the Government's record in the Altona dispute. The parties in this dispute were in discussion. They were talking about setting up working parties. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission had agreed that working parties would be set up to discuss the matter on a proper basis. The working parties were to conduct an investigation over three months during which time all industrial action would be halted. But the Prime Minister made a statement which said: 'No, there is to be no consultation, no discussion, no question of a 35-hour week'. As a result employees again went back to strike action. </PARA>
<PARA> The ICI dispute was referred to this afternoon. The game was given away very clearly by the honourable member for Kooyong when he told the House what he thought about the situation. Certainly his secretary Mr Barry Simon was right when he said there was a lack of an honest approach by certain people to make a point. It is very clear when one looks at the profits of the chemical industry which are escalating by 33 per cent every year that some fat should be given to employees because of increased productivity. But again we have a Prime Minister who is demanding that the chairman of ICI Aust. Ltd come to Canberra to make a statement contrary to what he had already told the Premier of New South Wales. He was told that he had to make the statement if he did not want to be hauled before the Industries Assistance Commission. This was the threat that was handed out. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given a summary of recent matters. Is this not an indictment of the Government? You would not allow the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Kooyong into your waiting room if you were trying to run a business. You would go broke because of all the squabbling between the two. We should look at where this country is going. The Opposition wants intelligent debate on matters that affect everybody in Australia. We should not be talking about who is to run the Liberal Party. The Government is completely incompetent. We now know that it is the National Country Party that is running the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there is one very clear fact about this debate it is that the Opposition has been caught short. Not only can it not get its act together; it does not have any act at all. Indeed, the anti-climax of today's debate is certainly very heavily underscored by the hollowness of the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). The Leader of the Opposition made one of the most pathetic speeches yet heard in this institution. The most charitable thing that might be said is that his speech and the speech of his deputy were both utterly irrelevant to the issues facing Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to speak in this debate as the Deputy Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party, a position which I have held since 1973. Speaking as the Deputy Leader, I say this: Of course it is a matter of regret for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), members of the Government and me that these issues have been raised today in the manner in which they have been raised. I suppose members of this chamber, those who are listening to this debate and those in the media might well ask why this debate did not take place before the Cabinet. If there were matters of concern to the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) that related to Cabinet process, to a 35-hour week or to other issues which he has raised, why were those issues not ventilated with the Prime Minister and particularly with his Cabinet colleagues? Loyalty in a Cabinet system goes both ways and every Cabinet Minister has a responsibility, an obligation and a duty to raise in the Cabinet room with his own colleagues those matters of concern to him and to Australia. But no time were those issues which I have mentioned raised as principal questions. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate is not a debate between the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Kooyong; these are issues which are between the honourable member for Kooyong and the entire Cabinet and the rest of the Ministry. I want to make that perfectly clear. Indeed that position was developed in the firmest possible manner by a statement issued by me and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) which said:</PARA>
<PARA> The conflict is between Andrew Peacock and the Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA>We went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The claim that the Prime Minister attempts to forcibly dominate or override Cabinet is nonsense. He has encouraged full and frank discussion and has fully consulted Cabinet on all major issues. </PARA>
<PARA>The words quoted from the statement bear the total endorsement of every Cabinet Minister and every member of the Ministry. It is abundantly clear that at heart this is a conflict between the honourable member for Kooyong and the Cabinet itself. All members of this House will recognise-I make this comment especially to Liberal Party members in the chamber-that politics is a bruising business. Many of us over time have had the odd bruise because of the nature of the system. Given certain experiences and circumstances in which I personally have been involved I remain with an unwavering and unshakable conviction that there is only one man to lead the Liberal Party of Australia right now, that there is only one Prime Minister to lead this country and that is the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member can say what he likes but the people know the Australian Labor Party's form. They have disposed of Labor before and they will do so again. The people of this country have universally endorsed the Prime Ministership of Malcolm Fraser and the Fraser Cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply say this: Over five years the leadership of Malcolm Fraser and the Government has brought stability, opportunity and growth to Australia. We have at the present time a stable nation, a stable government and a stable economy. The Liberal and National Country parties in three successive elections have won unparalleled victories giving the Government parties record or near record majorities in this House. These victories were achieved under Malcolm Fraser who has the capacity to take this country effectively into the 1980s. The Australian people's confidence in the Prime Minister is a matter of record. That leadership is needed to ensure that the Government's stability continues and that the complex and far-reaching decisions which are now being considered by the Cabinet and the Government will be carried through. </PARA>
<PARA> It is this Government and the decisions of the Fraser Cabinet that have restored economic stability from the chaos that was the legacy of the Whitlam years. Who in this debate can forget the soaring rate of inflation, the massive jump in the number of those unemployed and the destruction of business and community confidence? The economic mismanagement of the Labor Government is a matter legendary in the annals of Australian politics. The Australian economy is now growing faster than expected in the last Budget. I will not weary the House with the obvious dividends that are now a matter of public record. This stability did not simply happen. It was brought about by the deliberate implementation of sound policies and firm direction under the leadership of Malcolm Fraser. Such results are not the product of any government in disarray, nor of a Cabinet that does not have the confidence and the loyalty of the Prime Minister, nor of a Prime Minister who does not have the confidence and loyalty of his Cabinet. They are the results of team work, dedication to Liberal principles and of strong leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Fraser Government I believe there has been a greater emphasis on consultation in Cabinet than ever before. I have been in the Cabinet system in this country since, I think, about 1968. There are 10 committees of the Cabinet. Whilst retaining overall responsibility for Cabinet the Prime Minister himself is a member of only three of those 10 committees. I think the Prime Minister said in the House today that in the past two years some 400 decisions have been taken by Cabinet Ministers and by individual committees without the presence of the Prime Minister. At the same time the Prime Minister has been bound by the decisions of those committees of which he has not been a part. Fully one-quarter of the decisions made by Cabinet are made with the Prime Minister absent. The Prime Minister has himself established new Cabinet processes to involve the whole Cabinet in the fullest possible way in the conduct of Cabinet business. </PARA>
<PARA> A system of standing committees is in operation, each of which has authority to act on behalf of Cabinet in matters of policy. Far from being bypassed, Cabinet deals with a vast range of policy matters including all major policy issues. I doubt-this has certainly not occurred in my experience-that there has been any Cabinet in Australian history so thoroughly involved in collective control of government policy. The Prime Minister has encouraged Cabinet to extend its activities beyond specific items for decision to discussions at large. Through this process of consultation the Prime Minister exercises a quality of leadership which is acknowledged by every Cabinet Minister responsible to this House. So much for suggestions of a one man band.</PARA>
<PARA> The Co-ordination Committee of the Cabinet comprises the four leaders of the two parties, together with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick). It has co-opted the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard). This Committee has not dealt with any more than about 10 per cent of matters which have ultimately gone to the Cabinet. It has not taken the decisions in its own right. What a ridiculous suggestion it would be for a Prime Minister not to consult with his most senior colleagues on those issues which have the greatest strategic and political importance. Collective decision-making requires a unity of action once decisions have been taken. The success of this Government's Cabinet consultative practice is no better demonstrated than by the statement made by the Deputy Prime Minister and me. As I mentioned earlier, that statement had the unequivocal support of all Cabinet Ministers. Any assertion that the Prime Minister attempts to override the Cabinet system cannot be sustained and is totally offensive to every member of Cabinet and to every member of the Ministry. Consultation is, of course, a two-way street. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the point that surely must be a significant question in the minds of every honourable member of this House. Why were not the concerns that have been the subject of the statement by the honourable member for Kooyong today brought before his own colleagues so that they could judge the claims and assist in discussion of the issues for which obviously the honourable member for Kooyong had a very deep responsibility. I remind the House that the issues which have been raised by the honourable member for Kooyong are issues which have been the subject of Cabinet discussion. A very significant number of the matters which the honourable gentleman has brought to the Cabinet have been the subject of endorsement by Cabinet itself. The former Minister has in no way made known to Cabinet the issues which were the subject of his letter of resignation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition in this debate of course has not been able to distinguish between the issues of policy and personality. The Opposition has spoken of disunity. Of course the Opposition is conditioned to disunity as the result of its sorry history in government. I believe no one in this country can fool himself or herself into believing that the Opposition can today provide this country with stable government. I repeat what I said when I commenced my speech. The speeches of the two Opposition so-called leaders were the most pathetic presentations that this House has ever heard. The Leader of the Opposition knows a great deal about plots and conspiracies, but I will leave those matters for him to consider. </PARA>
<PARA> The quality of the Prime Minister's leadership and that of the Cabinet has been clearly established in the statement of strong endorsement and support issued by the Deputy Prime Minister and me. The Prime Minister is a man who has the courage to take those decisions, with his Cabinet colleagues, which he recognises are best for the coalition parties and, more particularly, are best for Australia. Sometimes difficult decisions have to be made, but they have to be worn by all members of the Cabinet because of the collective responsibility which accompanies a Cabinet commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Industrial relations has been mentioned. I think the Prime Minister has dismissed the assertions that have been made by the former Minister. At no time has the Prime Minister or I made any public statement which has not been in full accord with decisions of the Government. At no time have matters of significant interest in the industrial relations area been the subject of any decision except that taken by the entire Cabinet. Notwithstanding what the Opposition has said in this debate, of course the Government goes on with strength and with determination. The Australian people have put their faith in this Government to guide them to a new era of economic prosperity and strength. We will keep that trust. The Government rejects the motion before the Chair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a surprise to see the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) back to the fray in the House, back from the ashes of Stumpy Gully-the lion of 1975 who hurled abuse at the then Government; the man who talked about reprehensible circumstances when one Cabinet Minister of the Labor Government resigned. Over half of the Fraser Government has either resigned, been fired or stood down. He returns today to protect what he calls the Cabinet position and to attack the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). What we have seen in this House today has not involved a matter of principle. We have seen simply an argument, a power play, a political street fight and a public display of acrimony, the casualty of which is the good government of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kooyong in a display of mock indignation made a speech to the House. Over the last week or two we have witnessed the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) making a brutal attack on the honourable member for Kooyong on television programs, in the Press and now in the Parliament. After listening to what both these gentlemen have had to say today, what do we find? We find nothing; it has been simply a power play, a struggle for power within the Liberal Party of Australia. The only result will be a destabilisation effect upon the Government. It signals that the leadership of the Government, of the Liberal Party, is up for grabs. That is the total message from today. In my view, nothing that the honourable member for Kooyong said substantiated the case he sought to make except for the clear case he makes about the Prime Minister's megalomania and the way in which he wishes to run his Cabinet. The honourable member for Kooyong talked about his being appointed to the Monetary Committee. The Prime Minister replied to that and said it was a committee about interest rates and exchange rates. He talked about the Public Service Arbitrator being incorporated in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. That was a round he lost. </PARA>
<PARA> The real issue he got down to was the question of Pol Pot, and the way in which he was treated over the recognition of Pol Pot. He says he was treated shabbily by the Government, by the Prime Minister and by the Cabinet in respect of Pol Pot. However, the issue is simply that if the honourable member for Kooyong, as the Foreign Minister, believed that he could not live in a government which recognised the Pot Pot regime as the Government of Kampuchea he should have resigned. He did resign but he took his resignation back after he had been talked to by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). What was the basis of their arrangement? He said there was to be a compromise built around two facts-that the matter was to be kept under review, and one will never know what that means, and that the matter would be taken back to Cabinet if the circumstances altered. </PARA>
<PARA> What a weak old performance from a Minister, who resigned because he could not live with the policies of his Government in respect of Kampuchea and the recognition of Pol Pot, to take his resignation back on the basis that there would be some reconsideration if circumstances were to alter. What circumstances could possibly alter? There had been wholesale genocide in Kampuchea. The circumstances could never alter. Pol Pot was a murderer. His regime was a murderous regime. If the honourable member for Kooyong believed he could not live as Foreign Minister in a government which recognised that regime he should have tendered his resignation and stood by it. Instead of that, he squibbed it, as he has done on so many occasions. He took back his resignation and said he would cop the compromise that the situation would be kept under review or reconsidered if the circumstances altered. Then, on the flight to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in India, he told the Prime Minister about the deaths of a number of Australian yachtsmen at the hands of the Pol Pot Government. He said to the Prime Minister that these were altered circumstances. What would alter the circumstances-the death of two men compared to the death of millions in Kampuchea at the hands of Pol Pot? Would there be altered circumstances because the yachtsmen happened to be white, caucasian, Australian? Would that have made some alteration to the circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, I do not blame the Prime Minister for not taking any notice of what the honourable member for Kooyong said about his resignation. If he did not have the guts to stand by his resignation over Kampuchea, then he did not deserve any consideration by the Cabinet. Cabinet treated him with the contempt which obviously was due to him. However, that does not take away from the charges that he made against the Prime Minister in regard to the way in which the Prime Minister runs the Cabinet, the ad hoc committees and the fact that decisions are taken on an ad hoc basis. It does not take away from the fact that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is a mini-bureaucracy, a duplication of the Public Service within Prime Ministerial control. These are all legitimate criticims which smack of deficiences in managerial style. They smack of megalomania, disloyalty and all of the other other machinations which this Prime Minister has shown in his career in politics. To that extent, it became obvious to all of us that the honourable member for Kooyong had no place in the Fraser Cabinet. That is simply a matter of politics; it is a matter of how the honourable member for Kooyong handled his politics. Obviously, wittingly or otherwise, he painted himself into a corner. He probably did not want to live under the Fraser Government, but he should have resigned. He had the opportunity but pulled out. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech of the honourable member for Kooyong was a disgrace. It was a display of mock indignation and petulance. It was an attempt to establish matters of principle. It had nothing to do with matters of principle; he simply saw a chance to grab the leadership of the Liberal Party. The Cabinet sensed that. Its members are all in here today to support the Prime Minister. In all of the years of the Fraser Government we have never had any more than two or three speakers in any debate but the Deputy Prime Minister is here, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has returned from the ashes to speak for the first time in a debate for about five years, to my knowledge, and we have the hired gun of the National Country Party, the Minister for Primary Industry, sitting here. He will have his tuppence worth in the debate before long. There is also the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen). All these people have come in here to prop up what is called Cabinet solidarity. Why? It is simply because the Prime Minister is not now in a position to maintain his leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> What a pathetic defence the Prime Minister put up to the charges made against him by the honourable member for Kooyong. He never even answered the charges-not any of them. It is not that I think the charges were motivated by anything other than self-interest, but they were not answered. So, from this side of the House I say to the Government: 'A plague on all your houses'. It is a divisive Government, a Government in chaos and a Government without direction. It is in a malaise, and the Prime Minister has run out of ideas and has no direction for this country. The honourable member for Kooyong as well as other members on the back bench, has sniffed this and the so-called drys from Western Australia have understood the situation. This is a Government out of control; this is a government without policy. When this happens the rot sets in. The rot set in well and truly a week ago and today it has just gone further into the grain of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party. From now on, this Government is in trouble. It is destabilised, and the tragedy is that it will be Australia that suffers more than the interests of individuals within the Liberal Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Deputy Prime Minister says I am whistling in the dark. He is very pleased with the situation because now graziers alone run the Cabinet of Australia. The only interest in the Cabinet which was not that of a grazier, which was an urban Liberal interest, was that of the honourable member for Kooyong. Now he is out, the graziers are in full swing. The robber barons of the National Country Party will have even more of their way than they have had in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask honourable members to look at the record of the Government in recent times. There is vacillation on health policy; the Government does not know what to do with the present health scheme. We have seen vacillation on the airline policy. We have seen two or three tax policies floated in the last three or four months. There is no discussion in Cabinet; matters are floated in the newspapers to see what the editorial comment is like and then the Government recedes from a proposal or goes on with it. There has been no decision about taxation. There is vacillation in regard to Commonwealth-State relations, and the situation is similar in regard to the Broadcasting and Television Act and resources policy. The Government talks about how the average family will benefit from the development of Australian resources, but the Government does not have a policy. In fact, it has no policy about anything. It is this very vacillation which has produced this set of circumstances which has flushed the honourable member for Kooyong into the open and turned the Cabinet against him. </PARA>
<PARA> So, the tide is running out for the Government simply because it has no ideas. It has no strategy for Australia and it has no leadership. We have had five years of the Fraser Government. What do we have to show for it? We have abysmal, pathetic rates of economic growth. The rates are half those which obtained during the period of the Whitlam Government in the early 1970s. This week we have seen that inflation is off and running again with the highest consumer price index in the March quarter for four years. It is back to double digits after six years of hard slog under the Fraser Government. Interest rates are at their highest in Australian history, with deposit rates up to 17 per cent. I do not refer to certificates of deposit, that flighty piece of paper that we see occasionally, but to the firm deposit policy of the banks. The rate is 17 per cent. Unemployment is at record levels and rising. Where is the progress? Unemployment, inflation rates and interest rates are all up and there is low economic growth. The little economic growth we have seen in the early part of this year will be choked off by the high interest rates which prevail in the economy. Young people cannot afford to house themselves and working people cannot service a mortgage. They are not covered with health protection and again their standards of living will decline dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this is because the Fraser Government simply has run out of ideas, out of policies. It is bereft of policies and is now searching for some basis of philosophy. We see in the House today Professor Kemp and three other professors lined up behind the Government front bench in the official's box. They are here to give some philosophical basis to the meanderings of the Liberal Party and its Prime Minister. They are back to put the show in order. Neither the Cabinet, nor the Liberal or Country Party ministers, the drones of the front bench, can do so. They need to get the professors from Monash University or some other place to add some Ayn Rand quality or some mix of Ayn Rand and Friedmanism to the Liberal Party's philosophical basis on which to hang its policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is in chaos. It has no policies and no ideas. It does not know what to do with Australia in the 1980s. We are in the early part of the 1980s and the Government has no idea what to do. We see sitting at the back of the House all of the other heirs apparent looking at what is happening today. Most importantly, we see those who support the honourable member for Kooyong. What a motley crowd they are. They are the free marketeers, the people who believe in absolute free enterprise. What they have in common with the honourable member for Kooyong I will never know. Senator Withers, the toe cutter, is beached on the back benches of the Senate waiting to get at the Prime Minister. Senator Rae from Tasmania has his nose out of joint. What a motley crowd! What a natural cohesion! The truth is that there is no common thread of policy or politics. There is no common political thought between the honourable member for Kooyong and his supporters. It is an anti-Fraser group, married and matched to the drys, the economic rationalists and the Melbourne establishment built around the honourable member for Kooyong. That is the group which faces the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there are the other heirs apparent such as the Treasurer (Mr Howard) who is the mouthpiece of the Prime Minister. He could not get a piece of toilet paper through Cabinet without the support of the Prime Minister. He has no chance of getting anywhere with his Cabinet. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) is the Minister for Health. Fancy damning Australia with this negative, unimaginative product from Sydney's north shore. Is that what we have to tolerate for the future cause of liberalism in this country? Is that the likely leadership? Is that all the Liberal Party has to offer? Obviously, the choice will be for the Australian Labor Party. Members of the Government realise that. </PARA>
<PARA> Today signals the demise of the Fraser Government and the coalition. The Labor Party will be back to power at the next election as a result. What has happened here today has not concerned a matter of principle involving leaks to journalists and having stories corraborated and backgrounded. It has not been about Kampuchea. Andrew Peacock understood the Government's position on Kampuchea. It was committed to recognising a murderous and barbarous regime. The Prime Minister even got the Prime Minister of Singapore to make a statement in support of him. There was no way that the Government would change its opinion. It changed only under pressure from the honourable member for Kooyong. Even after that he resigned. There was no place for him in the Fraser Cabinet. The policy directions of the Cabinet and the influence of the Country Party cut urban Liberals out of it. Urban Liberals are trying to get back into the role of government within the coalition. That is what this row is about. That is what has produced this division. </PARA>
<PARA> This division will remain. It is a basic deep-rooted division which will destroy the stability of the Government. The problem for Australia is that even a solid Cabinet would have difficulties hatching policy for the 1980s to meet the problems Australia faces. In the light of this division there will be no chance. When a government starts to disintegrate it seems that nothing can stop it. This Government is disintegrating. It deserves to disintegrate. If the Government did the decent thing and talked about the reprehensible circumstances it talked about five years ago it would resign and give a decent united party a chance to govern Australia in the national interest. That party is the Australian Labor Party. We will be back much sooner than we thought. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have experienced a series of censure motions moved by members of the Australian Labor Party during the period they have been in Opposition since 1975. We have heard their wishful thoughts that the Government will not remain, that it will go out of office. Yet the Government is returned with outstanding majorities because the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has the confidence of the Australian people. That is why it continues and will continue to come back. This Government is stable and sound. It will continue to do the job of moving Australia forward in a very positive way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The massive allegations made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) today in his censure motion of the Prime Minister were based on the allegations made by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). The point that has to be made from the outset is that I do not accept these allegations, nor do members of Cabinet accept them. I regret having to say this. I have no desire whatsoever to be critical of the honourable member. I hope I can avoid being so in the course of my contribution to this debate today. The remarks of the Leader of the Opposition were based on those allegations which have no substance whatsoever. Everyone of us will vouch for that. I know that the honourable member for Kooyong has a very strong feeling about the Pol Pot regime. Has not every member of this House a strong feeling about it? Is it not one of the most brutal, revolting, loathsome regimes there has ever been? But there were good reasons for wanting to delay our derecognition of the Pol Pot regime concerning our neighbours in the Association of South East Asian Nations. I know that because of my own involvement with some of the ASEAN leaders. </PARA>
<PARA> On my way back from the Middle East in the middle of last year, I had discussions with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Malaysia. Both of them stressed that they did not want us to derecognise the Pol Pot regime while they were in the process of negotiating with Vietnam to see whether it was possible to get an independent government for Kampuchea. That was the point of view of the ASEAN countries. It is one we should accept and respect. It was not a case of whether we should derecognise the Pol Pot regime; it was a case of when we would derocognise it. The honourable member for Kooyong knew of our concern about the ASEAN countries. Unfortunately, he made no mention of it today in his address to the House. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kooyong made remarks about the Prime Minister's involvement in the ICI Australia Ltd case. Anything the Prime Minister said relating to the 35-hour week and mobilising the support of the private sector of the community was completely in accord with Government policy. It does not become the honourable member to speak as he did today. I know that we are all under pressures. There can be conflict of opinion and disagreement between departments. We can all be led to have prejudices and strong feelings. There can be disappointments. When an honourable member is in government he has to acknowledge these things and try to work them out. I know that the Prime Minister has spent countless hours on many occasions with the honourable member for Kooyong discussing problems and difficulties that the honourable member might have had. The Prime Minister has shown infinite patience in trying to resolve any misunderstandings and difficulties there might have been. </PARA>
<PARA> When the honourable member for Kooyong wanted to resign in the middle of last year I became involved. Why? As Deputy Prime Minister of this Government I did not want to see the honourable member resign when we were heading towards an election in a few months' time. I talked to the honourable member and tried to put my point of view. That view was the unanimous view of Cabinet that we should not derecognise the Pol Pot regime at that time. It was not only the Prime Minister's point of view. Everyone of us had exactly the same point of view. I was pleased that we found a means of coping with that situation. We decided to keep the matter under review and that the honourable member could make a further submission to a Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it was regrettable that the honourable member for Kooyong took such an intransigent attitude towards the Pol Pot regime on the eve of an election. Be that as it may. The issue that really triggered the resignation of the honourable member was the Barry Simon episode. The honourable member's private secretary made public statements which were unacceptable to the Government. These factors ought to be remembered when we are considering the whole matter because it was that issue that triggered his resignation. The honourable member for Kooyong has described the Prime Minister's response to Mr Simon's actions as evidence of the Prime Minister's so-called obsessive nature. Mr Simon did not, as the media seems to have put it in shorthand form, merely make comments about the Government's handling of the 35-hour week in relation to the ICI issue. He spoke of a number of matters. In his introductory remarks he said that he would discuss the breakdown in party disciplines and party administration. He said that he would mention the development of a presidential-style administration moving away from the Westminster system. He mentioned the dominance of the Executive over Parliament and the irrelevance of Parliament and its members. Then he got on to the subject of the 35-hour week. He said that he thought that there was distortion and lack of an honest approach by certain people and manipulation to their own ends. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Simon's remarks were made at a meeting to a substantial number of people including a journalist. Remarks of this nature, even in private conversation, would have represented at the least an indiscretion on the part of a senior member of a Minister's staff. Made as they were at a session of a national convention of the Australian Society of Association Executives, the remarks took on an even more serious aspect. Mr Simon's comments quite clearly implied criticism of the Prime Minister and of the Government in which his own Minister was a leading member. He criticised the way the Government was run, the way the Prime Minister acted, the way the Liberal Party operated and the attitude of the Executive to the Parliament and private members. He criticised Government policies and action in areas in which his Minister had a major responsibility. His remarks constituted a very serious breach of his responsibility to his Minister and to the Government of whom he was a servant.</PARA>
<PARA> To my mind from the moment he made those remarks there could be no question whatsoever about Mr Simon's not continuing in his job. There was no other course to be followed but that he should resign, be asked to resign or be dismissed. The simple fact is that no government can work as it should if its own servants are free to make public comments critical of the government and its policies and actions or the people in it. People can make high-minded assertions about freedom of speech and all the rest but the fact is that government servants, indeed servants of any organisation, must accept certain constraints as part of their responsibility. They need to accept these limitations on their own actions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should not talk. The Labor Party certainly applies constraints on anybody who opens his mouth. If a person breaches those responsibilities then that person must accept the consequences. The honourable member for Kooyong has described the Prime Minister's insistence on Mr Simon's resignation as evidence of the Prime Minister's obsessive nature. But there can be no question as to the correctness of the Prime Minister's attitude. In fact, I would be extremely surprised if any member, whether he or she is prepared to admit it, believes that a staff member could enjoy a luxury such as the abdication of responsibility represented in Mr Simon's remarks without suffering the inevitable consequence of being dismissed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the matters that have been put forward as significant is the allegation of the failure of the Prime Minister to observe the requirements of the Cabinet system of administration and decision making. It has been suggested that the proper procedures have been bypassed, that there has been either not enough consultation amongst Ministers or too much consultation with too few Ministers before matters are considered by Cabinet. Perhaps I am in a better position than anyone else in this House to comment on these assertions which I clearly do not accept. I have been a member of ministries led by six Prime Ministers. I have been a deputy Prime Minister to three of them. After almost 24 years as a member of this Parliament and 14 years as a Minister, I believe that I am fairly well-qualified to express views on the working of Cabinets and Ministries as I have known them. </PARA>
<PARA> The plain fact is that under the present Prime Minister the decision-making processes of the Government are more formal, more efficient and better organised than in any other Cabinet of which I have been a member. The Cabinet committee system has become more highly developed and organised under the present Prime Minister than under any other. A range of Cabinet committees has been set up so that there can be adequate consideration given to the increasingly wide range of matters coming before the Cabinet. This was quite impossible under a previous system in which there were many ad hoc committees. These committees are made up of Ministers from the Cabinet and those outside of the Cabinet. In this way it is possible to involve Ministers in a thorough consideration of the matters coming before the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important of these committees is the Co-ordination Committee. I have seen suggestions to the effect that there is something to be concerned about in having a co-ordination committee. There is nothing surreptitious or secretive about the existence of this committee, its membership or its responsibilities. The Co-ordination Committee consists of the Prime Minister, me, the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch), the Minister for Communications and Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) and the Minister for National Development and Energy, the Vice-President of the Executive Council and the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick). It is not a coincidence but a sensible and deliberate arrangement that members of the co-ordinating committee are the five most senior Ministers. Of course, four of them are leaders or deputy leaders of their respective parties, the fifth being the Leader of the Government in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The responsibilities of this committee are to consider overall Government strategy and priorities and to deal with matters referred to it by the Prime Minister. Previous Prime Ministers have so often made decisions themselves-a responsibility, a right that they have-but the present Prime Minister has found it more satisfactory and wiser to solicit the opinions of senior Ministers. That has been the basic function of that committee-not to caucus on matters to come before Cabinet. I completely reject any such suggestion. It is not a fair allegation to make of the Co-ordination Committee or of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak on behalf of myself and of the National Country Party. We have complete confidence in and absolute respect for the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has had the onerous job of revitalising the economy of this country, of getting back a bit of sanity into government. This country is showing great promise. It is moving forward at a time when the rest of the world is having great difficulties. Why is there confidence? Why is this country moving forward? It is because of the way it is being managed. It is because of the standards and the disciplines which the Prime Minister has applied to government. Of course there can be disagreements. I have not always agreed with the Prime Minister. Certainly he lets me know his opinions if he disagrees with me. But this is the way it should be. Ministers must not get incensed if they find that they are wrong or cannot get an agreement from their Cabinet colleagues; that is the working of the Cabinet. It is tragic that we are having this discussion today. Certainly I completely reject the censure motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I completely reject the assertions and the allegations that have been made by the honourable member for Kooyong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There would be no doubt as to why the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), the Leader of the National Country Party, would be so enthusiastic in his support of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). By manipulating the Prime Minister before the elections as to the destiny of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) those men were able to compromise the honourable member for Kooyong to stay in the Ministry before the election for the purposes of the election on the understanding that the honourable member for Wannon, the Leader of the National Country Party, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party and the now Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair), would have the opportunity following the elections to get the honourable member for Kooyong for having dared to test their policies in the Cabinet in July and again in September of last year on the question of Pol Pot. Let there be no mistake on the question of Pol Pot. One readily understands the pressures that might have been brought to bear by members of the Association of South East Asian Nations on this Government's policy. If there had not been an election on 18 October 1980 we would still be recognising Pol Pot. The election was responsible for the Government's change of policy. We would still be recognising Pol Pot if there had not been an election. We can dismiss that. The fact is that the only person on the Government side who was prepared to stand up in this Government, which had a majority of 48 members until the October election, the only person who had the decency and guts to stand up and say 'We should withdraw recognition of Pol Pot', has now been sent to the boundary, the back of the chamber, where he can be of no further influence in the policy-making apparatus of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kooyong has fallen for the three-card trick. He has been isolated with a few ineffective supporters, such as the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen). He will be of no further influence in this Government. The National Country Party is left to reign unabashed. Never has there been such dramatic National Country Party influence in a coalition government since 1949. The Leader of the National Country Party has said that there is nothing extraordinary about the Co-ordination Committee's giving information to Cabinet. The only extraordinary feature about it-he ran through the list of people very quickly-is that the majority of people who sit on it are members of the National Country Party. That is important. It is about time some of these woolly-nosed Liberals woke up to what is going on in this so-called coalition. If one looks at the people who have been stabbed in the back by this Prime Minister one will find that they are all Liberals. They are all members of the Liberal Party. Mr Ian Sinclair got back into the Ministry. He was not kept out in the cold in spite of all the allegations. He won his way back. That was not the case with Reg Withers because he is a Liberal. The Government could not take back Reg Withers. </PARA>
<PARA> Now the Co-ordination Committee, the so-called important overview committee that looks at all the submissions that go to Cabinet, is controlled by a very firm nucleus of Country Party members. That is bad enough, except that the Prime Minister finds himself more at home in the Country Party than the Liberal Party. It is his natural political home. It is no wonder that the honourable member for Kooyong, after 5 1/2 years, has found that he has had enough. But he has fallen for the three-card trick. He would have been better off staying on the front bench, fighting and trying to use his influence there. The only thing I can say after listening to his speech is that he is easily offended. We in the Australian Labor Party have to put up with much more than that. He should have stayed on the front bench and tried to fight this very snide influence which has grown into the Fraser coalition and which gives the Country Party complete domination. </PARA>
<PARA> The events which occurred on the day on which he resigned were quite a joke. On the radio program PM it was stated that this was not the end of the matter because Mr Peacock had the support of Mr Killen. Fair dinkum! That would be like having the Chinese table tennis team behind him. Fancy having the Minister for Defence behind him. He would be looking around all the time. The Minister would be of no help at all. It was also stated on the program that Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle was standing behind Mr Peacock. She is a member of the other chamber. She is dispensed to look after the financial affairs of the country. She would be of no assistance whatsoever. Who did the Prime Minister appoint as the new Minister for Industrial Relations? Who could be relied upon more than any other member of the Liberal-National Country Party Government in this country, taking into account the 780 members who constitute all the parliaments of Australia? Who could be relied upon to get down on his knees and lick the boots of the Prime Minister? The snide Mr Viner was appointed as Minister for Industrial Relations. He will be down on his knees and it will not matter what the Prime Minister says to him. Mr Viner will carry out the instructions that are given to him. There will be no dispensing of Mr Viner to the back benches for not doing what the Prime Minister wants. In fact, he can read the Prime Minister so well that he carries out instructions before he is told to do so. He now looks forward to making announcements about how he can provoke industrial relations disputation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole of the Australian body politic has been ridiculed by this affair, this so-called family affair within the Country-Liberal Party. We have been told that the matter is not important because the country is being well run and that the Government had a resounding victory at the last Federal election. Half of a per cent separated the difference in the voting pattern between the people who voted for the coalition government and the people who voted for the Australian Labor Party. In addition to that, the Liberal and National Country parties sold themselves to every major financial institution in this country in order to raise the millions of dollars that were required to buy the votes of the Australian voters. They were not voted back in on the policies they had enunciated and carried out between 1975 and 1980. They bought their way back in like the scum that they are. That is the way in which they will continue to try to hold government in this country, by keeping the electoral laws in such a way that they have this magnificent advantage in that they can take the cheques off all the multinationals who come into Australia in order to reap the millions of dollars that are required. </PARA>

<PARA> Let us look at some of the matters which were raised by the honourable member for Kooyong. First of all, it should not have come as a surprise to him, seeing that he has been in politics for so long, that this Prime Minister likes to dominate everything. On the questions of industrial relations the Prime Minister is absolutely paranoid. He cannot control himself for one instant. Why the honourable member for Kooyong should be surprised about that is difficult to understand. The reason that the Prime Minister gave Mr Street the industrial relations portfolio originally was that they share this beautiful relationship which they have carried on since school that Mr Street never challenges Mr Fraser. The Prime Minister knew that if he put Mr Street in the industrial relations portfolio he would at least sit quietly and would play a different role than Mr Viner. He put Mr Street into that portfolio and, in addition, set up his own department of industrial relations within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in order to ensure that his voice was the important voice on industrial relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the honourable member for Kooyong that he should have stayed on the front bench and fought the matter himself because he has no allies. If one looks at the front bench of the Liberal-Country Party coalition Government one will see that there is no one from the Liberal Party who would challenge or in any way argue with the Prime Minister of this country. All his conversations, agreements and conspiracies will be done with the Country Party while all the other members of the Ministry, the MacKellars, the Howards, the Fifes and the Moores, will sit there like dummies and take it. It is the only chance they have. If they raise their voices they will find themselves subject to the same type of conspiracy which the Prime Minister used to oust the honourable member for Kooyong. It is no accident that the honourable member for Kooyong found himself on the back bench a couple of weeks ago. If we look at what fired the matter we will see that it was the leaking of the story to Malcolm Colless of the Australian. It is no surprise to anybody that Malcolm Colless from the Australian should be granted the advantage of receiving the leaks from the Prime Minister's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> We have this beautiful relationship in Australia now where News Ltd, proprietors of the Australian, is totally committed to the Fraser Government and the Fraser Government is totally committed to News Ltd. So it is no surprise to anybody that Malcolm Colless should have received the story. The only question is: Who gave it to him? Was it the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) or the Prime Minister? Now there is such a thing as a journalist not letting people know where he gets his stories from. The Minister for Primary Industry is someone who looks forward to the journalists continuing that, because we often read stories coming from his office. When Malcolm Colless was asked where the story came from he did not have to say that he got it from the Prime Minister. He could have said: 'I did not get it from the Prime Minister'. He could have cleared the Prime Minister of Australia by saying: 'No, I did not get the story from that office'. But what did he say? When he was questioned by Richard Carleton he said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Okay, then, will you deny, and will you support what Mr Fraser said that it did not come from . . . his office?'</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Colless said:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't intend to comment at all on that question of where my information comes from. </PARA>
<PARA>The journalist was not only not prepared to say where he got his information from but also not prepared to say that it was not the Prime Minister of Australia who gave it to him. He was not protecting informants, unless the Prime Minister was the informant. The honourable member for Kooyong nearly split our sides when he said-following the Prime Minister's statement, that there were inaccuracies in the story that appeared on 14 April-that the Prime Minister, or the Prime Minister's Press secretary, David Barnett, would rectify it. He would have to be joking. Fancy sending David Barnett to the Press Gallery to rectify a story which he has been put in charge of leaking to the journalists. Every Minister will now be subjected to these additional pressures which are going to be placed on them because the Prime Minister has this enormous advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> He also has his own little department overseeing every Minister. Now there are some Ministers that he does not have to worry about. He does not have to worry about the Minister for Primary Industry, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) or the Minister for Communications-or rather we should call him the Minister for Rupert Murdoch. He does not have to worry about the Minister for Industrial Relations, as he will be barking all the time. If the Prime Minister does not want to knock over in Cabinet someone who looks as though he is raising his voice against anything the Prime Minister wants to do, and if he does not want him on the agenda for Cabinet meetings then he will just send the big puppy dog from his office, David Barnett. He will say: 'Upstairs, boy'. He will give a whistle and say: 'Just spread this around and we will deny it tomorrow and that should finish that bloke off'. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are not reading that sort of thing every day we are reading that the Minister for Defence is heading for Washington, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is hanging on to his seat like death because he is going to be speared overseas somewhere. Overseas posts are not being filled because the Prime Minister cannot decide which Minister should fill them. I will bet that they will all be Liberal Ministers who will be sent. He will not be getting rid of the heavies from the Country Party who are now running this country. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the reason we say that in this whole fiasco is a family feud within the Liberal Party. In the eyes of the Australian public the Government shows no decency at all by having this brawl which means absolutely nothing but which brings the Australian body politic down into the gutters. What does it matter to us or to the people outside reading the newspapers, watching the television or listening to the radio whether Malcolm Fraser or Andrew Peacock is Prime Minister? Under either ultra-conservative regime we would still have 500,000 people unemployed; we would still have tens of thousands of people living in poverty. The Government would still refuse to recognise the real social issues and problems of this country. It would still refuse to come to reality with all the sorts of pressures that will build up. It would still refuse to recognise the objectives of the young people who will want to work in the 1980s and the 1990s. It does not matter a damn who is the Prime Minister out of the two who put themselves forward. What does matter is that the people of Australia think a lot less of this institution than they did a fortnight ago because of the actions of this Prime Minister and the way in which he has to get rid of his opponents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) this afternoon delivered to this House a speech which has been culled from all the flowers of St Giles and Billingsgate. The time must wait for a proper dissection of that boisterous and thoroughly vulgar speech. I will await that opportunity at some time in the future. A censure motion, a no-confidence motion, is a matter of high parliamentary principle. I would have thought that that on its own would have encouraged from the Opposition and from the honourable member for Port Adelaide a proper and parliamentary approach to the issue. But alas, it has not. I will await the opportunity of dealing with the honourable gentleman in what I describe as a proper fashion. But there is a further matter of high principle involved, probably as basic a principle to this parliamentary institution as any that I can apprehend. I propose to come to it in short time. It is the whole principle of Cabinet government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I turn to that, may I say to the House that I would be less than human if I did not at once acknowledge the fact that this is a day of infinite sadness for me. To lose a colleague in government, however the loss may occur, is a sad event. I find the loss of my honourable friend the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) in this fashion a matter of singular sadness. We joined the Ministry together. Some members in the House may recall that I was under obligation to leave that Ministry. I am bound to say in my defence that I left in dramatically different circumstances from which my honourable friend has left the present Ministry. We have been friends for many years. We have shared disappointments, anxieties and a lot of laughs. For the most part we have looked out on the world in striking correspondence of views. The friendship that we have had has suffered grievously by this action. But time has her own balming effect. For the promise of the years of my friend to be so abruptly cut short is a sad business, but the muster of misery is added to infinitely by the manner in which it has been done. But one question must be asked, and I ask it. I only hope that my honourable friend, in charity, will understand the motives that compel me to ask it. I want to put the question before the House and I want it to approach the question as critically and as uncharitably as it may care to. My honourable friend has said: 'The blame for my going from the Government lies with the Prime Minister.' The Prime Minister and the Government say that the blame lies with the honourable member for Kooyong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a member of the Government. Does it not show what an impoverished understanding the honourable member has of the principle to ask such a fatuous question. I am dealing with a matter of high principle. I know that this sounds strange to that collection of vulgar and mechanical politicians who have no understanding of the system we are dealing with. This Parliament and the country must make an adjudication of who is right-the honourable member for Kooyong or the Prime Minister and the Government. I want to deal with the principles that are involved in this great issue. An assessment can only be made by a consideration of the most fundamental of principles. I understand the sense of anguish that sweeps through my honourable friend. I can acknowledge the fact that we can all find that sense of courage to endure the anguish of others. I say to my honourable friend that I hope he will understand the sense of anguish that races through many of us in this Parliament and throughout the country today. If he can understand that, then his sense of charity will be acknowledged to be deep. But there remain powerful reasons for me to say to my honourable friend that he is in error in the decision that he has taken. I say to him further that he has transgressed against one of the essential principles of our political society as I understand those principles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To address myself to this matter is not a task that I relish. One cannot turn one's back on a quarter of a century of friendship and imagine that it has never existed or that there are not still strong strings of relationship in that friendship. But a sense of duty arouses. One must say blunt and harsh things. Before I turn to that may I turn, albeit in a peripheral way, to some of the views offered this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and some of his colleagues. I can acknowledge the fact that this is a heaven-sent opportunity for the Australian Labor Party to exploit what has taken place. That neither surprises me nor dismays me. But neither the frequency nor the ferocity of the criticism that comes from the Australian Labor Party regarding this issue will in any way put the Labor Party in proper light because, as the years between 1972 and 1975 show, its role in seeking to be sententious about parliamentary conduct is a role that can be described only as a vulgar masquarade. </PARA>
<PARA> How many honourable members who sit opposite today and who have served in the two governments led by Mr Whitlam would be prepared to give to this House the instances of when they were defeated in the Cabinet and, either on their own account or through the assistance of some other colleague, took the issue into the Caucus. I notice that the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham) is standing up. There it is! There is the very perversion of the principle that I propose to enunciate. Without shame and without inhibition, constantly and coarsely, the Australian Labor Party has put political principle and regarded it as a mere coquetry of political prostitution. That is a harsh thing to say but it deserves to be said. I want to return to the dominant principle that governs every person who sits in a Cabinet. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened to the honourable gentleman in silence. I hope that he can find some sense to understand what I am putting to him. There is one dominant principle that pervades all Cabinet activity and all Cabinet consideration-that is, there is one view and that view must be either respected or ignored. In the case of the Australian Labor Party it has the mechanics whereby it can, as a matter of convenience, overrule that. That is not the case with those, nor should it be the case with those, who acknowledge the strength and proprieties of the Westminster system of parliament and of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now want to consider the complaints made this afternoon by my honourable friend the honourable member for Kooyong. I think it would be fair to say that the majority of his complaints have been drawn from times when he sat as a member of a government.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4U4">Mr KILLEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say this to the honourable gentleman opposite: I have never been in the habit, and I do not propose to lapse into the habit, of disclosing what appears before a Cabinet, what business has been conducted before a Cabinet, any decision of a Cabinet, the manner in which that decision has been arrived at or who was in favour of that decision or who was against it. I acknowledge as being utterly sacrosanct in a parliamentary sense that there is one corporate view of a government. If one does not like it, one has one's remedy. For the purposes of illustrating the conviction with which I hold this principle I want to take every charge made by the honourable member for Kooyong as being right. I want to say to him that a Minister sitting in a Cabinet may oppose with skill and with determination the making of a particular decision. But once that decision is taken he has one clear duty: If he does not like it he has the remedy to resign. If he does not like it, that is his remedy. But if he accepts that decision he has a clear duty to defend, in the Parliament and in the public arena, that decision with the same skill and with the same determination with which he opposed it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is not a matter of mere inclination. This is not some dreary sentimental attitude which finds its origins in the dim past. This is a matter that can be identified only as one of inescapable duty. A Minister on many occasions may find himself placed in a predicament that he does not like. In the governments in which I have sat at one time or another I have never known a Minister who has found a refusal of a proposal standing in his or her way. But that Minister is bound to accept the decision of the Cabinet. As I say, this is not a matter of inclination. If one neglects to observe that duty and that principle then one negates it. If one seeks to diminish it one seeks to to nothing else but to destroy it. </PARA>
<PARA> Government is not, as some people imagine, a matter of abstract theory. The carrying out of government from day to day and from year to year calls constantly for discipline and the observance of fundamental principles. To be a Minister of the Crown is, I acknowledge, a great honour. But there is a price to be paid for that honour. An individual can have no personal views other than on what friends he will make or, if I may introduce a touch, I trust, of acceptable levity, what horses he will back. He can have no other personal views on anything whatsoever. Being a Minister of the Crown imposes a great burden. It can be a physical burden, it can be a mental burden. It may be a burden to be measured in terms of sheer loneliness or of constant anxiety. But that burden is there. The price further to be paid for it is that at all times that Minister will acknowledge that there is one corporate view. The honour of that office calls for that constantly and for the constant submergence of all personal views. This is not a matter of personal view on my part. I hope that the House will acknowledge the sources of Professor Jennings in his classic work on Cabinet government from which I now wish to quote. He cites what Lord Salisbury said when he stated the principle, as I understand it, to be couched in perfect language. Professor Jennings said in his work:</PARA>
<PARA> For all that passes in Cabinet (said Lord Salisbury in 1878) each member of it who does not resign is absolutely and irretrievably responsible, and has no right afterwards to say that he agreed in one case to a compromise, while in another he was persuaded by his colleagues . . . It is only on the principle that absolute responsibility is undertaken by every member of the Cabinet who, after a decision is arrived at, remains a member of it, that the joint responsibility of Ministers to Parliament can be upheld, and one of the most essential principles of parliamentary responsibility established. </PARA>
<PARA>I have stated my attitude to the House and to the honourable member for Kooyong. I believe he has erred grievously today. If he had stated one case which he felt had become the catalyst in his resignation, that to me would have been the honourable and the perfect thing to do. But my honourable friend had gone back through the years. I believe that, once having accepted a decision of Cabinet, he is estopped. Forever as he remains in this Parliament he cannot be heard to say: 'No, I disagreed with that. I fought this way; I was in opposition to it'. </PARA>
<PARA> We all go through this world having a variety of regrets to life and to what happens. I believe three of the great regrets of life are the spent arrow, the spoken word and the lost opportunity. I do not want to be critical or sententious of my honourable friend, the honourable member for Kooyong. What I have said to him this afternoon has been said by a person who has been, and will seek to remain, his friend. But I would be less than honest if I did not say to the House that I have said it as a friend who has been hurt indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One would need a heart of stone not to feel compassion for the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) in what he has had to say. He is torn between his personal feelings and innate decency and his compulsion, much of it externally applied, to hold the line for a government for which he feels a sense of duty, mixed with a touch of personal revulsion. The Minister said that people sometimes suffered from phychological burdens and pressures. That was shown in the Minister's face today. The Minister put up a defence to charges that were not made. Like the Minister's predecessors in this debate he has not denied the specific nature of the charges made by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). Let me remind him of what those specific charges were. At one stage he said: 'What is Cabinet if not a co-ordinating committee. The Prime Minister lobbies Ministers before meetings, then there is just a rubber stamp'. 'The collective wisdom', he said, 'is aborted'. 'Where is the collective wisdom', he asked, 'which Malcolm Fraser extolled in 1971?'. He then made perhaps his most important point, something which I have underlined in my notes. He said that Cabinet Ministers are sometimes asked to leave so that the Co-ordinating Committee can meet. Where has there been a denial of that allegation, a most serious allegation, of the breakdown of the principle of Cabinet responsibility? Who has denied it? Did the Prime Minister deny it? Did the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) deny it? Did the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch), deny it? It certainly was not denied by the Minister for Defence. As the honourable member for Kooyong said, it is not just a kitchen cabinet. Individual Ministers are lobbied. There are ad hoc committees of Cabinet which make real decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Between June 1977 and July 1979 of 5,900 Cabinet decisions 1,200 were made by ad hoc committees. Was there any denial of that? No, not at all. The Deputy Prime Minister made the suggestion-I did not copy his exact words but honourable members will recall it-that the Prime Minister had spent a long time, perhaps hours even, agonising with the honourable member for Kooyong, discussing his problems, never denying him the opportunity to speak. That is not exactly what the honourable member for Kooyong said. He indicated that he was desperate to get time with the Prime Minister, that he had begged him for time, that he had been given assurances and that those assurances were not fulfilled. Not even the Prime Minister said that he spent long hours agonising with the honourable member for Kooyong. Knowing the temperament of the two gentlemen involved, one would think it was very unlikely. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kooyong specifically raised the question about the story of his resignation on the day that the last election was determined. My notes say that the honourable member for Kooyong then went to see the Prime Minister and said that he was in an intolerable position-the United Nations General Assembly was to meet on 15 September and the credentials committee had to decide whether Australia would support the Pol Pot regime or an alternative. The honourable member for Kooyong said the Prime Minister then called in the Deputy Prime Minister, the right Hon. Ian Sinclair, then Minister for Special Trade Representations and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) Mr Peacock suggested three options-a change in policy, resignation, a silence and a refusal of office after the election. As the Prime Minister left to go to see the Governor-General the then Minister for Foreign Affairs agreed not to resign and to keep silent throughout the campaign, to which the Prime Minister replied: 'Thank you, Andrew'. On 14 April the Minister for Primary Industry corroborated this in the office of the honourable member for Kooyong. There was no reference made in earlier speeches about that. Nobody denied it, yet it is absolutely fundamental. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn for a moment to the specific reason for resignation. That was the question of the Australian leader article of 14 April which said that Andrew Peacock had 'plunged the Government into crisis' before the 1980 election over the issue of Pol Pot and described the then Minister's threat as a 'bombshell'. That, one would think, ought to be denied in detail but nobody so far has talked about the leaks. The Minister for Defence, who has now left the chamber, would well know the latin tag cui bono-who benefits? When we think of the peculiar timing of that leak of 14 April who stood to benefit? Was there any benefit to be gained by the honourable member for Kooyong or was there only a benefit to be gained by the grand leak master himself, the Prime Minister, the greatest exploiter of the Press and the greatest user of the Press that we have had in Australian political history?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us go back to the Prime Minister's record. The Prime Minister utterly lacks personal credibility. His assurances simply cannot be believed. His accuracy is in inverse proportion to the vehemence with which he speaks. He is recklessly indifferent to the truth, callous in his attitude to the poor and weak and committed to the philosophy of winning at any cost. He is the most arrogant and most confrontationist Prime Minister in our history. This is the political leader who won supreme power in his own party by the use of the knife. He knifed John Gorton in 1971. He was of little help to the right honourable member for Lowe (Sir William McMahon) in 1972 and 1973. He sandbagged and knifed Sir Billy Snedden, the present Speaker just as he later knifed Sir John Kerr and Reg Withers, both of whom had helped him claw his way to the top. He is the politician who tore up 75 years of constitutional usage in persuading the Senate to block the passage of the Budget. He created a situation in which political stability was to be put at risk every time that one party had a majority in the House of Representatives and another party had a majority in the Senate. In his pragmatic but unprincipled party, the right honourable gentleman has not only survived but also has appeared to prosper for the most pragmatic of all reasons-that he was a winner. He had the killer instinct and after every crunch so far, up to this, he has won. I think that the Government now sees itself in disarray. I believe that before very long the Prime Minister will go. That is not to say the beneficiary will be the honourable member for Kooyong. I think it much more likely that some other figures will emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to touch on the speech of the honourable member for Kooyong. There is a fundamental ambiguity in his position. He has not offered a clear alternative philosophy to that of the Prime Minister. It is possible to stitch together a coalition of Liberal members who detest the Prime Minister. But there is no common thread of policy in that coalition. We can get a curious coalition of States' righters, small government men, decentralisers, welfare hardliners, racists, puritans, extreme free marketeers, anti-protectionists and ex-Ministers harbouring personal grudges because of their dismissals. They can be linked together with small 'l' liberals, supporters of a genuine freedom of information legislation, anti-authoritarians, libertarians, the compassionate and those who do not see politics as a blood sport. Both groups have one thing in common-they detest the Prime Minister and they wait and pray daily for the proverbial bus to run over the Prime Minister and to take a few others with him. They detest the style of the Prime Minister but they share nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental weakness of the position of the honourable member for Kooyong is that he attempts to fly without the wings and feathers of an ideological position. I comment in passing that the role of the Press has been particularly deplorable in all this. We have had no discussion whatever about ideology, about the fact that there are value systems tied up in the conflict between the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Kooyong. It has been talked entirely in terms of a personality contest. The honourable member for Kooyong is devoid of ideological position or commitment. He is a man for all seasons waiting for a favourable breeze. He lacks the killer instinct of his erstwhile leader. The Prime Minister will be brought down almost certainly within the life of this Parliament but I believe the honourable member for Kooyong will not be the beneficiary. The strongest points in his speech pointed to the Prime Minister's authoritarian methodology. There he was on very much stronger ground. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to the role of the Prime Minister as a manipulator. The Prime Minister has always used every instrument that he could to destroy his enemies. I believe that he has done an effective job in destroying the honourable member for Kooyong because he would have seen the honourable member for Kooyong as the only alternative with significant public support. It is clear that, at the moment, the Government is so preoccupied with matters of personality that it has completely lost sense of its priority, the introduction of legislation. Has there every been, Mr Deputy Speaker, in your political experience, a time when the Notice Paper has been so threadbare? I think that at the moment there are only four Bills, all in my area of interest, on the Notice Paper. Debates on a number of Government statements have been adjourned. They are yet to be dealt with. We are still waiting for the rush of legislation. The problem is, of course, that there is too much bitter division within the Government parties to reach agreement on legislation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me restate the point I was making at high speed before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. The main point made by the honourable member for Kooyong in his speech this afternoon explaining his resignation as Minister for Industrial Relations was his attack on the methodology of the Prime Minister in running his Government. The Prime Minister, it is alleged, has eroded the Cabinet system by destroying the concept of collective responsibility within the Cabinet and undermining the constitutional relationship between Cabinet and this Parliament. The honourable member for Kooyong gave specific details of this in quite a long speech-it lasted 53 minutes-and his accusations have simply not been answered. The Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have tried a very broad-brush defence. They have done this by completely evading the specific issues raised. Instead they have painted a completely unconvincing picture of the Prime Minister as a warm, approachable character who likes nothing more than a good long chat to reconcile differences of opinion between his Ministers. As I recall, the Minister for Industry and Commerce had exactly the same opinion of the Prime Minister on this subject as the honourable member for Kooyong in November 1977. One has only to state the proposition to recognise its palpable absurdity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been no specific reply to the points made by the honourable member for Kooyong. The differences in style and methodology between the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Kooyong are very great. One has a closed mind, the other has an open mind. One is distant, remote, hard to talk to and resistant to new ideas, except those of an authoritarian nature. The other is affable, approachable, easy to talk to and open to new ideas. One would look good in a uniform; the other looks good in anything. The key difference is this: The Prime Minister is a great advocate of the anti-concensus style in politics. He destroyed Billy Snedden who was a practitioner of concensus. He won office in 1975 by overturning the conventional wisdom of Australian politics which had developed throughout the Menzies era and lasted, with some variations, until 1975. His anti-concensus style which became electorally popular in the mid-1970s was followed also by Robert Muldoon, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. It has inflicted great harm on the fragile concensus on which the parliamentary system rests in Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain. I fear that it will lead to horrendous social division in the United States. The Prime Minister has applied his anti-concensus style with a notable lack of success in the field of industrial relations. That is essentially why the honourable member for Kooyong had to go. Australia is no longer a parliamentary democracy in the strict sense; it is really a bucolocracy ruled by graziers. </PARA>
<PARA> In that amazing Co-ordination Committee of the Cabinet there are five Ministers. Of those five Ministers two are members of the National Country Party. The Prime Minister is himself a de facto supporter of rural interests as against urban interests. The tragedy of the honourable member for Kooyong was that he was the most credible representative in the Cabinet of urban liberal interests. That is why he had to go. The Prime Minister will not change in style. It would be like expecting a crocodile to turn vegetarian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I turn to the substance of the censure motion I want to clarify several points relating to my part in events, particularly those points relating to the story which appeared in the Australian on the Pol Pot issue. I do this with some sadness because I have been closely associated with the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock)-I regret that he is not in the House-over a number of issues and events and believe there is a bond of friendship and trust between us. I stress that the relationship in any dealings that I have had with the honourable member for Kooyong has not been because I have been a member of any particular party but because of that relationship. At page 10 of the statement of the honourable member for Kooyong to the Parliament he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At my request, conveyed to the Prime Minister through three ministerial colleagues who came to discuss this report with me, the Prime Minister agreed that he would issue a denial. Later, the Prime Minister deputed the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) to show me the form of his so-called denial. These are its full and complete terms:</PARA>
<PARA> I have seen the statement on the front of today's Australian concerning events that occurred last year. There are some significant inaccuracies in that report. </PARA>
<PARA>I was appalled when I saw its bareness and I said so to the Minister for Primary Industry. It scarcely could bear the description of a denial. It did not even deign to express which allegations were denied. For all the reader was to know, it might have been a denial of the allegations in the report that there had been a so-called bitter six month feud or that there was a battle for the leadership of the parliamentary Liberal Party. When I made this point to the Minister--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, me-</PARA>
<PARA>he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Any inadequacies are not for you to be concerned about. They are matters that the Prime Minister or Barnett will background on. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not an accurate account of the events. The words in the denial were the words asked for by the honourable member for Kooyong and written down by me in longhand. I, along with the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), who have confirmed this, conveyed those words to the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The Prime Minister agreed quickly to the use of those words. The Minister for Defence and the Minister for Finance have confirmed with me tonight that they returned with me to Mr Peacock's office. It was the Minister for Finance who said to the honourable member for Kooyong: 'You have got the words that you wanted'. After some further discussion, in the presence of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Kooyong agreed that he had got the words that he wanted. Those words were: 'There are some significant inaccuracies in that report'. They were the key words that he wanted. The Press statement was not issued until later in the afternoon. I carried it to Mr Peacock's office without the other two Ministers. I will quote from some notes that I made following my visit to Mr Peacock's office. </PARA>

I said if there are any inadequacies in the statement in terms of his name being missing and direct reference to the article or any other matters, that was a matter for the Prime Minister or David Barnett to explain. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Kooyong wanted and had agreed to the words that were typed up in the formal Press statement and were issued later in the day. Later I heard Press reports to the effect that the honourable member for Kooyong was claiming that undertakings were not being honoured. On the Wednesday I visited the office of the honourable member for Kooyong and I spoke to him about these reported claims. Again I made a record of the conversation. I shall read it to the Parliament. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Today I visited Andrew Peacock and sought clarification about his statement at his Press conference 'that there is a whole series of events and there were some undertakings given yesterday which were broken.'</PARA>
<PARA> I asked Peacock if in any way he thought I was associated with broken undertakings, pointing out that as far as I was concerned the only undertaking was to get the Prime Minister to publicly state that there were serious discrepancies in the report referring to the story on Pol Pot in the Australian on Monday. </PARA>
<PARA> Peacock raised the question of briefing by Barnett and I said to him that I had said in the discussion yesterday that 'any shortcomings in the statement are not a matter for you to be concerned about.' You have got the words you wanted. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat that:</PARA>
<PARA> You have got the words you wanted. Any shortcomings are a matter for the Prime Minister and Barnett to answer for.'' I did not suggest that there would be background briefings. Peacock wrote those words down and indicated that he accepted entirely my explanation of the events. He went on to say that I was not party to any undertakings that were broken. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only did the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Finance and I disagree with the honourable member for Kooyong on the words used but also it is apparent from today's statement that the view of the honourable member for Kooyong on the reason for his resignation is now different from the reasons he gave at his Press conference on 15 April. In that Press conference he was asked, concerning undertakings:</PARA>
<PARA> Were they broken in the statement issued by the Prime Minister yesterday?</PARA>
<PARA>He answered:</PARA>
<PARA> The statement issued by the Prime Minister yesterday was surprisingly vague. </PARA>
<PARA>The next question was:</PARA>
<PARA> Do you consider that unsatisfactory?</PARA>
<PARA>He answered:</PARA>
<PARA> Well I indicated that I hoped there would be further explanations given. Evidently there weren't. </PARA>
<PARA>The undertaking the honourable member for Kooyong appeared to be concerned about seemed to relate to the Nationwide program. This was borne out by what Mr Simon said on PM on 15 April following this question from Nasht:</PARA>
<PARA> What were those events that prompted the final action?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Simon replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Well, as I understand it, there were certain undertakings given yesterday which by the time last evening came, and one particular television program clearly indicated that that undertaking had been broken, where discussions were to take place in regard to an allegation that Mr Lynch's office, or Mr Lynch himself, had been involved in the release of the Pol Pot story to the Australian yesterday morning, and that undertaking was clearly broken and the Minister sought clarification from the Prime Minister last night, was unable to obtain that clarification and after a great deal of thought, and I know anguish, he felt he had to resign, that this was the last straw. </PARA>
<PARA>That was confirmed also by the honourable member for Kooyong himself on Nationwide on 15 April, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> There was an undertaking in regard to your own program last night which was broken so far as I am concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>This reason-that is the reason given on Nationwide-was also widely accepted as the reason by wide sections of the media. Michelle Gratten had the story in the Melbourne Age of 16 April; it was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald, the Sun Pictorial and the Australian Financial Review of the same date; and Paul Kelly had the story in the Sydney Morning Herald of 17 April. All those newspapers carried the story of the Nationwide program being the central issue for the honourable member for Kooyong. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn now to the options about which the honourable member for Kooyong has spoken. He said he gave three options to the Prime Minister in the Prime Minister's office. The first was:</PARA>
<PARA> I could resign. </PARA>
<PARA>The second was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Cabinet could change its policy. </PARA>
<PARA>The third was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the event that the Government did not change the policy, I could remain silent until after the election and then decline a portfolio in a new Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I can-I did on 14 April-corroborate for the honourable member for Kooyong that he gave those three options on 11 September. I corroborated that in the presence of the Ministers for Defence and the Minister for Finance. But the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Finance, who were present, and I do not remember the words 'Thank you, Andrew' coming into the conversation. But whether the Prime Minister did in fact say 'Thank you, Andrew' is irrelevant. The fact is that the conversations that I had with the honourable member for Kooyong on the night of 11 September continued for hours and final agreement on the handling of the Pol Pot matter was not reached until 11 o'clock that night, some five and a half to six hours after the Prime Minister had been to and returned from Government House. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the options are concerned, the truth of the matter is that option one was a gun at the head of the Government; option 2 was also a gun at the head of the Government; and option 3 was not accepted as a real option by anybody present in the room because the Government was about to go to the country at a general election and, if the story that Mr Peacock would not accept a portfolio in a new government had broken, it could have brought down the Government. It was because each of the options proposed by the honourable member for Kooyong was impossible that I spent hours that night getting agreement on words that would satisfy the honourable member for Kooyong to be used after the credentials vote was taken in the United Nations. That agreement was not reached until 11 p.m. on the night of 11 September. Therefore, it is clearly not correct for the honourable member for Kooyong to claim, as he did this evening on PM, that the question of his three options on the Pol Pot issue clarified the matter before the Prime Minister went to Government House. The Prime Minister put the agreed formal words on the Democratic Kampuchea problem to Cabinet in Melbourne on 23 September-it had been agreed that it would go to the next Cabinet meeting-and Cabinet agreed to the words used. At this point Mr Peacock was in fact at the United Nations awaiting, he hoped, the credentials vote in the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that puts to rest once and for all the claims and counter-claims that have been made in this matter. I have been central to this issue. I am sorry to have had to come into this House and disclose what I thought were private conversations leading to sensible agreements. I have done so because it was the honourable member for Kooyong who first broached the issues that drew me into the Parliament tonight. That is all I have to say on those matters. I have nothing to add to what Ministers have said today that so devastatingly kills the Opposition's censure motion on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We have just listened to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) invite the House to make, presumably, a judgment as to which member of the Cabinet or former member of the Cabinet we are to believe-which one is telling the truth. He then dismissed the entire substance of the Opposition's censure motion. Let us get back to the heart of the very serious allegations made by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). The first was that under this Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) power has become dangerously centralised and the concept of Cabinet government has been eroded. He stated that this process has been developed by the Prime Minister's use of his Department and by the use of the co-ordinating committee, a committee which carries out the Prime Minister's dictates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first question that we have to ask ourselves is: Is this a fact? Is there such a body as the co-ordinating committee? That of course is admitted. It has not been denied by the Prime Minister or any other Minister. We heard a sterling defence by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen), who claimed to be a friend of the honourable member for Kooyong and then proceeded to shaft him. But all the sterling defences in the world about the concept of Cabinet government do not meet the very serious allegation of the honourable member for Kooyong, who stated that the Prime Minister at a Cabinet meeting-I ask the House to consider this as a concept of responsible Cabinet government in 1981 under Malcolm Fraser-will direct a member of Cabinet to leave the Cabinet room so that the Co-ordination Committee can make a decision in his absence. That has to be a truly novel concept of Cabinet government. </PARA>

The Prime Minister says to Peacock or to the Treasurer (Mr Howard), or some other responsible Minister with whose views he does not agree: 'It is time for you to leave now John.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable knight for Stumpy Gully has had a hand in all of this, and then of course there is Senator Carrick. Everybody knows that when the Prime Minister sniffs, Senator Carrick blows his nose. This is the group that, by its every existence, imports a concept of servility into the whole concept of Cabinet government. Unless that is answered, it must prove the honourable member for Kooyong's very serious allegation that the concept of Cabinet government is being eroded under this Prime Minister. It is an odd and perverse situation indeed that even the Minister for Defence, with his rhetoric could argue that this odd and novel Fraserism represents any concept which is within the framework of the Westminster tradition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Suppose honourable members opposite were to go to any high school in Australia and be asked who is the Minister responsible to the Parliament for industrial relations. That is the concept under the Westminster system that the Minister is part of a Cabinet but in administering his portfolio he is responsible to the Parliament and through the Parliament to the people of Australia. The somewhat naive gentlemen opposite would answer that, of course, everyone knows that the Minister for Industrial Relations is responsible to the Parliament for the formulation and the expression of the Government's attitude on important industrial issues. But, what does the honourable member for Kooyong say? What does this former important spokesman for the Liberal Party-he was recognised as such within his own State and within this Parliament-say? He says that on not fewer than three major items-wages policy, the Qantas Airways Ltd dispute and the 35-hour week-the Co-ordinating Committee, the gang of five, met and formulated policy without even his involvement. So, the views of the then Minister and the expertise that existed within his Department, and the capacity and knowledge that go with that, were all swept aside because of this motley group who are concerned to centralise power around the Prime Minister. If ever the Prime Minister accepts a knighthood, the stiletto ought to be the central part of his coat of arms-the regalia that he wears. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone knows of the enlightened views, the tolerance and the judgment of the Prime Minister and his cohorts in the National Country Party on industrial affairs. It is these men who formulated the attitude that was put to this House in regard to the 35-hour week. What nonsense they spoke. Of course, it was interesting that the former Minister was not very anxious to get closely involved in that debate. In relation to wages policy, the honourable member for Kooyong said there was a Cabinet decision which, after it had been checked and verified through the processes of his party, he put public. Within a matter of days, the Prime Minister had walked away from that decision and had adopted a policy of industrial confrontation directed at any employer in this country who disagreed with his somewhat narrow and novel views. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the defence and maintenance of the Cabinet system of government, the Prime Minister, nor any Minister, has denied the substantive allegation of the former Minister, the man who was elected and who swore an oath to be responsible ultimately to this Parliament in the terms of his portfolio. What did the then Minister do? What could he do when he saw that in these areas in which he had sworn to accept his responsibilities as a Cabinet Minister he could not uphold those responsibilities to this Parliament and that the operations of his Department were being continually eroded, contrary to the concept of responsible Cabinet government, by the actions of the Prime Minister and his gang of five? What could he do? I cannot judge the Minister for Primary Industry, who wants to swear one set of allegations against the detail of what has been said by the honourable member for Kooyong. All that we on this side of the House can say is that none of us were there; we were not privy to the conversation. Even with the best will in the world we cannot honestly tell which Liberal or which member of the National Country Party is telling the truth. </PARA>

Anybody who wanted to lead the Prime Minister over hot coals into the valley of death will be found limp and corpse-like with a glazed look upon his face. That is the man's reputation. In clawing his way to leadership in Australia he has helped successfully to plant the knife in two leaders. He dragged the very constitutional structures of this nation and our constitutional conventions into the direst crisis that the people of Australia have ever seen. He is confrontationist by nature. Do we wonder when we see the Prime Minister cast his gaze upon those Ministers and tap them on the shoulder and say: 'Now get up and let us see where you stand, whether you support me or the honourable member for Kooyong'? All on this side of the House have seen the somewhat disgusting spectacle of all these Ministers getting up and saying: 'He was a friend of mine. I loved him well, and I will still love him. But I am bound to tell this House that my fear of the Prime Minister transcends all'. There has been no greater performance since Brutus slipped the knife into Julius Caesar than the performance we saw from the Minister for Defence tonight. Et tu, Jim!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sadness of this spectacle is that whatever might be said about the honourable member for Kooyong by some of his former Cabinet colleagues, the opinion polls seem to suggest that he has a much higher standing in the electorate than does the Prime Minister. Although he may be feeling a little bruised and battered tonight he can rest safe in the knowledge that at the moment when the spectre of losing office confronts some of his former colleagues they will shaft this Prime Minister, come to him and say: 'All is forgiven.' In the meantime the damage that has been done to this institution and to the concept of Cabinet government is irreparable. The only honourable course for this House is to pass this censure motion, condemn this Prime Minister and his ways and give this nation a leadership which at least has some integrity and honour and which is able to say to the people of Australia that the Parliament of this nation will not again be subjected to the spectacle to which we have all had to be witness today. Honourable members can make up their minds whether they want to believe the Prime Minister, members of Cabinet or the honourable member who had to put in his resignation in disgust because he could no longer suffer the indignities and injustices which have now befallen the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is not an easy motion for any person to speak on from this side of the House. Perhaps one of the most ungracious contributions of the whole debate was the closing portion of the remarks made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). By implication and by use of those immortal words 'Et tu'-he substituted the name 'Jim'-he impugned the sincerity of the remarks made earlier this evening by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen). I have not known a more honourable person in this House than the Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Moreton. I think it is very regrettable that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports should have injected that note into his remarks. It is, of course, a matter of regret for any government that a senior Minister should resign. It damages that government. I do not believe for a moment, nor I imagine do any of my colleagues, that the events of the past two weeks have not been of significant damage to the cause of the Liberal Party and the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had a very lengthy debate today. We have canvassed in great detail the events of last year surrounding the policy of the Government towards the recognition of the Pol Pot regime in Kampuchea. We have also debated the events of the last two or three weeks leading to the resignation of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). I have not been as directly connected with some of those events as have some of my colleagues who have spoken previously. Therefore, I cannot speak with personal knowledge of the detail of the discussions and exchanges. Therefore, I shall confine myself to making a few general observations about the operation of the Cabinet system of government which has been a focal point of the remarks not only of my former colleague, the honourable member for Kooyong, but also of the Opposition and other Government speakers. Unlike other Ministers who have spoken in this debate, my experience of the Cabinet system of government is limited to service under the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) over the last five and a half years. I can say only that the degree of consultation, the number of meetings, the inordinate lengths that are gone to to ensure that people are consulted and informed in the decision-making process is, on my experience, very extensive and wide. I am sorry to have to say, in deference to what my former colleague said in his speech, that as a Cabinet Minister for the past three years I cannot recall one occasion on which I have been ordered out of the room so that a meeting of the Co-ordination Committee could take place. </PARA>
<PARA> As anybody who knows about the operation of a Cabinet system will realise, full Cabinet meetings are often followed by meetings of other Cabinet committees. Indeed, in the nature of the operation of Cabinet business there is nothing particularly unusual about that. In my experience the level of consultation and the degree of debate and disagreement inside the Cabinet have been extremely intense and wide. By and large, I believe the Cabinet system has operated very effectively and in accordance with what I understand to be the proper principles of Westminster government. According to my recollection, the Co-ordination Committee was established in 1978 or early 1979 out of a concern about earlier criticism that arrangements for consultation between senior Ministers were too informal and, therefore, too open to criticism. In other words, it was designed to answer concern at that time that there was not formal machinery for senior Ministers to consult about broad government strategy. It is therefore ironic that it should be criticised as a method of focusing power inside the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What is most important and what really matters about this debate is not so much the events of the past few weeks but, rather, what the censure motion is all about. It is a motion expressing want of confidence in the Prime Minister. Although it is important to make a finite judgment about every single thing that has been said about the events of the past few weeks, perhaps the best test of whether this House should express confidence in the Prime Minister is to make a judgment on the stewardship of the Prime Minister and the Government over the last five and a half years. I invite honourable members to ask themselves whether the record of this Government over the last five and a half years and the potential of this Government and in particular of the Liberal Party of Australia to solve the challenges of this country for the remainder of this decade is either the record or the potential of a government and a party that should be condemned. It is increasingly becoming a matter of accepted fact that the economic policies of this Government have worked in a way quite beyond the expectations even of some of the more enthusiastic supporters of those policies only a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context I am reminded of all the things that have been said by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) when he was campaigning in the McPherson by-election, about the economic policies of this Government. The Opposition said that the Budget which was brought down in 1978 would drive the economy through the floor. It said the same thing about the 1979 Budget. These criticisms have been voiced about the sorts of economic policies that have been followed by the Government led by the present Prime Minister over the last five and a half years. Of course, the truth is that those policies have borne fruit. The essential Liberal principles to which we committed ourselves in 1975 by and large have been adhered to-with some deviation, I confess-over the last five and a half years. If they are adhered to with renewed vigour over the remainder of this term of office, the Government will be returned again as it has been on three earlier occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of economic growth in Australia at present is far beyond the expectation that we entertained when the Budget was brought down last August. Australia is one of the few countries in the industrialised world at the moment which is experiencing real economic growth. Does that show the performance of a government whose leader should be censured? Does that show the performance of a government that deserves the condemnation of this House? It shows the performance of a government which has very much delivered the goods that it promised when it was elected in 1975. We have seen not only economic growth but also a sustained growth in overall employment in this country over a period of two years. We have seen this country go from a nation that was seen as an uncertain recipient of overseas investment to a country which is increasingly seen as having a stable and predictable economic climate in which to invest. That is a creature, not of uncertain leadership, not of hesitant decision making, but of sound, sensible and stable leadership. It is not a creature of a government that deserves censure. It is not the outcome of the leadership of a person who deserves to be censured by this House at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not pretend for a moment that the economic and other problems of this country will be solved automatically over the next few years. I do not pretend that the great wealth that this country has, particularly in the resource area, will be realised unless we adopt sensible and sensitive policies. The problems will not be solved unless we recognise that it is impossible at one and the same time to finance the growing demands of a private sector and an expanding public sector. Unlike those opposite, I do not believe that it is possible for us to have the growth in development that we would like to have in this country unless we are prepared to rein in the avaricious demands of all levels of government in our community. More than ever, the economic circumstances of Australia at present demand more and not less of the essential economic philosophy of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that, beginning this week with the announcement of the review of Commonwealth functions by the Prime Minister, we will see a re-assertion of the essential economic faith of the Liberal Party, which is about small government, about reducing the demands of government on the community's resources and about making way for the expansion and the activity of the private sector. I believe this House and the Australian people expect from this Government a continuation of the sort of stability that has produced not only the gains in economic conditions throughout Australia but also those other social gains of which the Prime Minister spoke in his remarks earlier. I believe that the essential Westminster Cabinet system has functioned properly under this Government. In contrast to what occurred between 1972 and 1975, a degree of stability has been restored to the operation of government and to the Cabinet system by this Government. I believe that the Australian people want this Government from now on to concern itself with responding to the challenges and the opportunities that remain in this decade and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the progress that we have achieved over the last five years is itself demonstration enough of the futility and the irrelevance of the motion that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition. Perhaps the most telling indictment of the Opposition's own inadequacy in this area is that for week after week the Leader of the Opposition, the principal spokesman for the Opposition, has not raised any questions in this House, has not made any speeches, as far as I am aware, and has not generally concerned himself with economic affairs or industrial relations matters in Australia. So concerned is the Opposition about the conduct of those affairs by the Government that the Leader of the Opposition has almost exclusively concerned himself with other matters over that period. I believe that the record of this Government in office over the last 5 1/2 years and the promise for the future which the essential philosophy of the Liberal Party offers to this country are reasons enough for this House to reject decisively the motion of no confidence moved by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6I4">Mr MACPHEE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Balaclava-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Last week I announced that all people entering Australia will be required to carry a passport as from 1 July 1981. The measure is intended to curb abuses of the existing Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement. It is not aimed at restricting the right of Australian and New Zealand citizens to visit or to settle either permanently or temporarily in the other country; it is aimed primarily at those foreigners who pose as Australian or New Zealand citizens. At the same time I indicated that, consistent with our special trans-Tasman relationship, Australia wished to maintain a special status for New Zealanders. The new measures will preserve a uniquely privileged position for New Zealanders in Australia's immigration policies by allowing them to come to Australia without visas and to remain here without entry permits. The existing arrangement provides that people who are citizens of Australia and New Zealand and those who are citizens of other Commonwealth countries or of the Republic of Ireland with resident status in Australia or New Zealand may travel directly between the two countries without either passport or visa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been concern in Australia for some time about the susceptibility of the arrangement to abuse. This led to official talks in 1974 and to a visit to New Zealand by the then Minister for Labour and Immigration in 1975, seeking the introduction of a requirement that all trans-Tasman passengers carry a travel document. Whilst this was not proceeded with at that time there have been further talks at ministerial and official levels on this matter. New Zealand has visa abolition agreements with some 21 countries. As a result, nationals of those countries may travel to New Zealand without prior screening. This severely limits New Zealand's capacity to prevent the entry of undesirable individuals. Once in New Zealand, any person can exploit the trans-Tasman arrangement by simply buying a ticket in an assumed name and claiming on arrival in Australia to be a New Zealand or Australian citizen or a citizen of a Commonwealth country or the Republic of Ireland with resident status in New Zealand or Australia. Officers controlling entry at airports are under considerable pressure to process passengers quickly and are unable in most cases to challenge the validity of such claims in the limited time available. Moreover, Australia has such a multiracial society that persons challenged may well be Australian citizens. In those circumstances challenge and interrogation could cause great offence. </PARA>
<PARA> In the report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, Mr Justice Williams drew attention to the evidence of abuse of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement by the illegal drug trade and recommended the introduction of a passport requirement for such travel. It is known that members of several terrorist organisations are aware that it is much easier to circumvent Australia's normal stringent safeguards against the entry of terrorists by entry from New Zealand than by attempting use of fake documentation or other means of direct entry. Australian and New Zealand criminals have taken advantage of trans-Tasman travel both to escape justice in their own country and to find new fields to exploit in the other. New Zealanders now constitute half of the criminal deportees from Australia. Some of the New Zealand criminals have been deported from Australia several times, having returned to Australia under yet another false name after each deportation. </PARA>
<PARA> People abducting children from Australia have also exploited the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement. Whilst there are measures to prevent the removal from Australia of abducted children, these depend on the children being taken from this country under their own name. The ease with which new identities can be assumed for the purpose of Trans-Tasman Travel allows the established controls to be by-passed simply by claiming to be travellers to New Zealand. This is an era of fast and relatively cheap international air travel when residence in Australia is sought by many more people than can be accepted in our normal immigration program. There has been evidence in information provided by deportees and most recently by the Regularisation of Status Program applicants of entry from New Zealand to circumvent Australia's migrant entry controls. </PARA>
<PARA> There are important differences between the Australian and New Zealand policies and procedures. Whereas Australia has a comprehensive visa screening system, New Zealand has agreements with 21 countries providing for certain types of visa-free travel. Whereas Australia has a computerised entry control screening system, New Zealand is still in the process of developing one and it will take a minimum of 12 months to be in operation. Whereas Australia has a non-discriminatory immigration policy, New Zealand wishes to continue to give preferential treatment to certain traditional source countries. In the interests of both overcoming the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement abuses and-(Quorum formed). I am indebted to the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) for calling a quorum. It was his predecessor who was exceptionally concerned with this subject. I am delighted he is so concerned also. I was referring to the importance of overcoming the abuses to the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement and at the same time extending the special relationship between the two countries. In the interests of doing that, last month Australia proposed to New Zealand the adoption of common entry, screening and control policies and procedures. This would have meant that all persons entering New Zealand would automatically have gone through the same procedures as those employed by Australia for screening of undesirables. I would have thought that this was a reasonable proposition to put. But this proposal was rejected by the New Zealand Prime Minister in a letter to the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Fraser). Despite that, when I was in New Zealand shortly afterwards I held extensive talks with my New Zealand counterpart both with and without officials. It became obvious that those policies and procedures could not be harmonised. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministers and officials have also examined other options for overcoming abuses. Some foreign governments and representatives of some ethnic groups in Australia have argued that, since Australia has a non-discriminatory migration policy, people entering from New Zealand should be on the same footing as people travelling from all other countries. Under this approach, New Zealand citizens would need to undergo the tests of Australia's migration, temporary residence or visitor criteria to obtain a visa in a passport for travel to Australia. They would then have to obtain an entry permit on arrival. The Government considers that such an approach would be inconsistent with Australia's wish to maintain a special provision for New Zealanders in Australia's entry policies, reflecting the special fraternal trans-Tasman relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> Surveys of passengers arriving from New Zealand in the past six weeks have shown that the proportion without any identification whatsoever on their persons or in their baggage varied between 7 per cent and 12 per cent. This was con- firmed by baggage examination. Translated to the total of trans-Tasman movements, that would mean that between 30,000 passengers and 50,000 passengers had absolutely no identification on arrival in Australia. In addition, 30 per cent of passengers surveyed had no authoritative identification such as passports or driving licences. </PARA>
<PARA> Another option would have been to step up the questioning and baggage search of all persons arriving from New Zealand without authoritative identification-that is, about 70 per cent of those travelling. As the above figures indicate, this would involve a large proportion of the total trans-Tasman travellers. Those unable to provide satisfactory evidence of their claimed identity or entitlement to free entry to Australia would face the prospect of being refused entry. Such an approach would inevitably penalise some innocent people and impose on carriers the cost and inconvenience of returning people to New Zealand. The remaining significant option was to introduce a passport requirement. This in fact was the only feasible step with any prospect of overcoming the major abuses of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement and has been adopted for implementation as from 1 July 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested by some people that this measure will be ineffective as terrorists and professional criminals can readily obtain false or altered passports for entry. It is true that such people have shown that they can obtain false documentation. I have acknowledged previously that passports alone will not eliminate all of the serious abuses. Nevertheless it is the professional judgment of security and police authorities that a secure form of identity documentation such as a passport adds to the security of the entry system. This is especially true now that our authorities have introduced security materials, the use of which will make passports increasingly difficult to falsify and which are progressively introducing systems which will more readily detect attempted falsifications. </PARA>
<PARA> For the less professional operators, the inconvenience and the difficulty of having to obtain false documentation are deterrents. A much greater deterrent is the fact that authorities have information networks which produce intelligence on the purchase, preparation and use of false documents and this significantly increases the probability of detection. Another factor is that, under the present arrangement, people are not subjected to any restriction at all on the number of aliases which they can use for clandestine trans-Tasman travel. At least with a passport requirement, they are limited in the number of passports which they may carry and the very fact of possession of two or more passports in different names, if discovered, would normally lead to the apprehension and expulsion of undesirables using multiple documentation. Thus, the passport requirement is not being introduced in isolation. It will have some effect in itself and it will complement other measures now being taken. The additional protection for Australian society is ample justification for its introduction. I might add that the European Economic Community has reviewed its procedures for travel between member countries. Despite the strengthening of economic and political links within the Community it decided to retain an identity document requirement but it elected to use a card rather than have a full passport. What is important to note is that the European Economic Community did not believe that it was appropriate to abolish documentation. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been suggestions from time to time that an identity card might be preferable to a passport as a means of identifying Australian and New Zealand citizens travelling across the Tasman. This proposal has the attractions of cheapness and simplicity. However, it also has its shortcomings. Australia has already established procedures for passport issue and recent steps to make the passport much more secure than a normal identity card. Unlike the passport, the identity card makes no provision for details of previous international travel-data of considerable importance to security, narcotics control and police authorities generally. One further consideration is that in officials' discussions, New Zealand has made it clear that if an identity document requirement were to be introduced for trans-Tasman travel-it has always opposed this-New Zealand would strongly prefer that to be a passport. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the introduction of a passport requirement would seriously reduce the flow of tourists between Australia and New Zealand. Those who make this assertion are unable to provide any evidence to back it up. In fact the passport represents only a very small part of the total cost of an overseas visit, including a visit to New Zealand, and it remains valid for all overseas travel for a period of five years. In discussions on this matter, representatives of Qantas Airways Ltd, which has a very substantial share of the market across the Tasman, have affirmed that the introduction of a travel document would not reduce Qantas's business on the trans-Tasman route. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a suggestion also that Australia's action was hasty. I ask the House to consider the facts. More than six years ago, the then Australian Minister and Australian officials informed their New Zealand counterparts of Australia's concern at abuses of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement and the then Minister for Labor and Immigration sought measures to close the loopholes. There have been Ministers' and officials' discussions on the matter in 1978, 1979 and 1980. At the conclusion of ministerial discussions in April 1980, my New Zealand counterpart and I issued a joint communique announcing that we would consider the matter further at the next scheduled ministerial conference. That conference took place earlier this month in Wellington. Some weeks before it, Cabinet determined what the Australian negotiating position should be and this was relayed to the New Zealand Government by my colleague the Honourable Tony Street on 27 March 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been contended in the past few days that the passport requirement will be prejudicial to the close trans-Tasman relationship. It seems to be forgotten that passports are primarily a means of identification. Australian citizens have had to carry passports to identify themselves as Australian citizens entitled to entry to Australia without permits on returning to Australia from all places except New Zealand. I am sure that the relationship with New Zealand will not be jeopardised by a requirement that Australians and New Zealanders identify themselves as such on entry to Australia. On the other hand, the abuse of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement and the broad potential for abuse have been irritants in relations between the two countries. Action to overcome abuses should help eliminate such irritants. The passport requirement by itself maintains the special privilege for New Zealanders and ensures ready entry for all except the dishonest. It is our assessment that it will facilitate and speed up entry at Australian airports after initial transitional teething troubles are overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> One other feature of the Australian Government decision is to limit the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement to persons who are citizens of Australia or New Zealand. The existing provision for certain other residents of both countries reflected the fact that Australia's immigration policies and New Zealand's immigration policies previously contained a special preferment for citizens of the Commonwealth and Ireland. When Australia finally eliminated that form of discrimination in 1973, in regard to people entering from all other countries, it did not take action to amend the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement in the same way. This step is overdue, given the firm public commitment to a non-discriminatory policy which treats all of its migrant communities on an equal footing. </PARA>
<PARA> In the field of immigration and international travel, there is very close co-operation between the two countries. Australia has been giving New Zealand the benefit of its knowledge and experience on technical aspects of tightening up entry arrangements and there has been regular consultation at both ministerial and official level on a wide range of other aspects of migration and migrant settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> In his statement last Friday, the Right Honourable Duncan MacIntyre, Acting Prime Minister of New Zealand, reiterated that Australia's decision did not affect the essential feature of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement. By this, he was referring to the free access of New Zealanders and Australians to each other's country. Mr MacIntyre went on to describe the special relationship and the free travel as: 'the mark of a special relationship between Australia and New Zealand which the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement represents'. Mr MacIntyre also expressed his confidence that the current close co-operation between Australia and New Zealand on immigration and security matters would continue and further help to ensure 'that the possibilities of abuse of our respective rights and privileges of entry are reduced still further'. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement, which I commend to honourable members, seems to take due account of the fact that all Australia has done is to ask that citizens of Australia and New Zealand travelling freely between the two countries take steps to identify themselves in a reliable and internationally acceptable manner. It is worth noting that Mr MacIntyre's constructive, understanding response has been echoed by the President of the New Zealand Chamber of Commerce, Mr S. R. Hull, who issued a statement last Sunday. Mr Hull stressed the value of a passport to travellers not only in facilitating their travel but also as a means of identifying themselves for a variety of other purposes. Mr Hull went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The disaster at Munich is still fresh in our minds and I believe the commercial community would accept the necessity for carrying documentation when visiting Australia if it helped to prevent a disruption of the Commonwealth Games or any other activity. Further, I believe documentation between Australia and New Zealand would facilitate the freedom of entry for bona fide New Zealand travellers rather than frustrate it. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I would like to reaffirm several points in the hope that current misunderstandings of the Government's decision can be dispelled. First, whilst the new measures will not eliminate all entry to Australia by undesirables, they will substantially reduce it. Second, Australia continues to welcome free trans-Tasman movement of New Zealand citizens and the passport requirement will not impede their entry apart from that of a small proportion of criminals. I might add that residents of the Cook Islands and Niue, as New Zealand citizens, have the same right of entry as other New Zealanders. Third, while the new measures preserve a special place for Australian and New Zealand citizens, they eliminate current differences in treatment between migrant groups on the basis of their nationality. Fourth, Australia looks forward to continuing close co-operation with New Zealand in the field of immigration as well as in other aspects of the relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the new approach will be seen for what it is. It is a set of measures which preserve the special relationship with New Zealand; which eliminate a discriminatory element from the former approach; which close loopholes open to exploitation by people who pose a threat to Australian society; and also which facilitate the entry of the vast majority of trans-Tasman travellers. I commend the approach to honourable members. I present the following paper:</PARA>

We see a special purpose and very special reasons for maintaining the proper and acceptable links with our near neighbour New Zealand. I think that even Mr Muldoon would have to admit that things have changed slightly internationally since 1920. This is not a matter that has been raised for the first time by the Government in the last few months. It has gone across the political spectrum. It was first raised by a Labor government when my very dear friend Mr Clyde Cameron was the Minister for Labor and Immigration. The matter has been pursued ever since.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We in the Opposition in no way want to see fractured the long-standing relationship that has existed between Australia and New Zealand. But the statement provokes from us the necessity of making a decision. It is not something upon which the Opposition can sit on the fence in the hope of winning some political favour. It has always been my view that in these matters it is best, if possible, for the country to speak with one voice so that people outside Australia are able to read that both the major political parties which may form the government of this country are near to the same view on these questions-in this case, specifically the relationship between Australia and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree with the statements that have been made by the New Zealand Prime Minister about the step that has been taken as detailed in the announcement of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Thousands and thousands of Australians and New Zealanders visit each other's country every year. This is something that we want to encourage. It is because of those visits that we have such a close relationship. Many people in both countries want to see each other's country before they go anywhere else in the world. I think that we have been generous at a government level in the way in which the governments of the day of various political colours have allowed people, and encouraged people, to travel between our two countries. But problems have existed. It would be futile for any person in public life to think that the present system could have continued without the problems escalating. </PARA>
<PARA> It may not be true, but it appears to be true, that people who are carrying on some sort of criminal activity at the international level want to make their way to Australia. We have read just recently that there is a bumper opium crop in the Golden Triangle of South East Asia. The American and international groups which are working on trying to prevent this large escalation of production of opium will not know the impact of their work until they are able to get some idea of how much of it finds its way on to the streets, as they say in their document, of New York, London, Paris and Sydney. Australia is looked upon by international pedlars as a clearing house for drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true, and I do not think anybody would argue, that some people have found it convenient to come into Australia via New Zealand because of the easy access they may have to that country. I think we should make it quite clear that in no way are we condemning or throwing a blanket across the whole of the New Zealand people. But New Zealanders have a different system of allowing people into New Zealand to that which exists here. Anybody who has been outside the country knows that there is some difficulty getting back in. Even the shadow Minister last Sunday had to queue up for over an hour to have his documents inspected before he could get back into Australia. But that is not the case with New Zealand because of its easy visa system with so many countries. From information which has been given to me from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs I understand that these countries include Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Japan, Luxemburg, Malta, Monaco, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden, Tahiti, the United Kingdom-as one would expect-the United States of America, West Germany, Iceland and Ireland. Citizens of those countries can go to New Zealand without a visa. They cannot do this if they wish to come to Australia. This means that if they arrive in New Zealand they have not been screened by the New Zealand authorities in New Zealand or by the New Zealand authorities or people acting for them in the country where application for a visa has been made. So it is a much simpler process for a person to go to New Zealand in the first instance than it is for him to obtain for a visa to come to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Discussions on this matter have been conducted over the last seven years. If we could have worked out some system whereby both countries had the same level of scrutiny of people who wished to visit our respective countries the announcement made by the Minister may not have been warranted. The whole thing could have been avoided. The net could have been set up at an earlier stage and people would have been discouraged from trying to enter New Zealand in the same way as they are discouraged from entering Australia because of the system which applies in this country. No system, of course, is perfect. The people we are dealing with are very clever people. They falsify documents. They are used to breaking through the barriers set up by the various bureaucracies around the world. They are dealing in vast amounts of money. Bribery and corruption exist wherever they go. At least we ought to make it as tough as possible for them to enter this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The first editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald following the Minister's announcement stated that we were using a sledgehammer to crack a nut in Australia. If we are saying to the ordinary, decent New Zealand citizen 'We want you to have a passport because we are trying to stop some other people entering Australia' it may appear that way. I am sure that every thinking Australian will support the move which, in some way, will prevent people from bringing drugs into this country. I believe it is a step that has been taken by many other countries. It is a great pity, perhaps, that the system which applies in Australia was not adopted by the New Zealand Government itself. As I said earlier, this matter has been negotiated for years. The Opposition tonight cannot embrace the idea as though it were its own exclusively. We in the Opposition cannot say that the idea is going to work and keep out all the people that we hope it will keep out. We do say that it is certainly worth a try. I do not think that it will impose an enormous burden because the figures which have been provided show that a good proportion of the people travelling to Australia from New Zealand already hold a passport. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise the question-I am sure many other people raise it also-why people coming from New Zealand require a passport; surely there must be a simpler way of identifying a person who travels between Australia and New Zealand. If we are dealing with the sorts of people that I talked of earlier we are dealing with very skilful people. They would easily falsify a simple social security document, if that is what the people who asked the question had in mind. It may be that it is a more difficult task for such people to falsify a passport. We have a responsibility to our own people in Australia. Perhaps some people in New Zealand will be upset by the announcement. Time will show. If the new system is a failure we can alter it, go back to the old system and hope that we can catch the people we are endeavouring to catch. If it proves successful-figures will be available to show whether it is successful-it will show that the step taken by Australia was correct. I am sure that the evidence available to New Zealand is making that country think again about the procedures which it has adopted. New Zealand must be finding that many people are illegally entering that country as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people in this country say that New Zealanders are already given special treatment and that this system is not going to change the special treatment that they are given. On behalf of members of the Opposition I say categorically that we support the special relationship that exists between Australia and New Zealand. We do not support, nor would we give support to, adopting a visa system whereby people would have to apply for a visa to travel backwards and forwards between the two countries. Let me assure the House that people working amongst the ethnic communities in this country and many of the very influential spokespeople in the ethnic communities who come from other parts of the world think people coming from New Zealand should be treated in the same way as they are treated. They believe New Zealanders should have to apply for a visa to come here. If one asked the Minister or any other person in Australia who has access to the figures-if they were truthful; I am sure they would be-they would indicate that they did not know how many people from New Zealand settle in Australia. They could tell us the number of travellers who came from New Zealand, but they could not tell us the number of people who say that they are only coming to Australia for one month, two months or three months but who never go home. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to understand that Australia and New Zealand have a common labour market. If jobs are available in Australia but not in New Zealand Australia will attract a number of people to work in this country. The reverse situation would apply. If jobs were available in certain categories in New Zealand and Australians were out of work people would be heading to New Zealand. That happens. It is not one way traffic. More New Zealanders are coming to live in Australia. Substantial numbers of Australians find it convenient to live in New Zealand. As I said earlier, many people in Australia believe we should not have a special relationship with New Zealand and that we should impose on that country the same hurdles-if I can use that term-that are placed before the people of Greek, Italian, Yugoslav or Lebanese communities. I do not support that view. I hope that no one in this Parliament supports that view. Australia has a history of co-operation and special interest with New Zealand. That is what should happen. </PARA>
<PARA> This new measure will assist in catching common criminals who come to Australia from New Zealand. It will help to prevent Australian criminals from escaping easily to New Zealand and vice versa. It will stop the common criminal from New Zealand making his way into Australia. As the Minister said in his speech, some of these common criminals have been deported on multiple occasions. They merely change their name when they buy their ticket and fill out their incoming card. We have to spend Australian taxpayers' money sending them back to New Zealand. I would go so far as to say that the new system that has been announced by the Government-it was initiated by Clyde Cameron when the Labor Party was in office-is worth a try. I do not think we should be wildly enthusiastic that it will solve all the problems that confront us. I think we will win the general support of the people if the Parliament speaks with one voice. New Zealanders themselves may then understand that it is not a measure on which we are widely split. I think the Parliament to a very large extent agrees that this measure should be adopted. I think New Zealanders ought to understand clearly that there is no proposal in this country to adopt the easy visa system which has been established in that country. We are not attempting to interfere and say that New Zealand should not have that system. That is New Zealand's business and its decision. I think there would be wholesale opposition in this country to the abolition of the visa system for any number of countries, particularly bearing in mind the number of countries from which New Zealand does not require a visa. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence has been before us and questions have been raised in the past seven years. I have gone to the trouble since this matter was raised with me of having long discussions with Clyde Cameron. Perhaps he would have taken an even tougher stance in Parliament had he been here tonight because of evidence which was placed before him as the Minister for Labor and Immigration in 1975. Nonetheless I think this step will win the support of the Australian people. We ought to keep a very close watch on its impact. It ought to be monitored. Reports ought to be presented to the Parliament every 12 months so that the Government can answer any criticisms which may come either from within Australia or, more specifically, from the people in New Zealand. The New Zealand Prime Minister said that perhaps this will in some way permantly fracture the enormously good relationships between Australia and New Zealand. I hope that those words will not come true. I certainly-I am sure this applies to my party-do not wish to see that occur. We are looking forward to very good and fruitful relationships with New Zealand. We believe this step taken by the Government will in no way fracture that relationship. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills now before the House are the normal supplementary Bills to provide appropriations to cover increased costs of various programs, mainly through wage increases, and to provide funds for new programs such as some that were introduced to fulfil election promises. In a sense these Bills are very ordinary and commonplace. However, in one sense I suppose they are different in that they are rather remarkable because of the fact that they are here. One of the quite amazing aspects of the Parliament so far this year has been the absence of legislation. This Government seems to be suffering from legislative constipation, an inability to bring legislation before the House, with the result that most of our time in the last several weeks has been taken up with the discussion of statements of various kinds, including the rather amazing discussion we had today. At last we have substantive legislation before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although these Bills are commonplace and ordinary, they open up the possibility of substantial discussion of economic policy and therefore they are, indeed, important. The cost of the new appropriations contained in these two Bills is in the order of $520m, an increase of some 40 per cent on what was involved in these Bills last year. That cost is offset by savings in appropriations of some $148m. These so-called savings amount to adjustments of appropriations in Appropriation Bills (Nos 1 and 2) which were passed by Parliament in the Spring session last year. Those appropriations are now being cut back in the way spelt out in the statement of savings expected in annual appropriations which has been published by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I pause briefly to look at those so-called savings, those cut-backs in appropriations which were passed by the Parliament last year. Honourable members will notice that in the area of defence there is a saving of some $66m, $52m of which is on new equipment. There is a saving or cut-back in veterans' affairs of $12m. That means the whole of the appropriation for the Defence Service Homes Corporation is not to be spent this year. In the area of social security there is a cut-back of $5.6m, $2.9m of which is for aged and disabled persons' homes and $2.6m for aged persons' hostels. In each case it amounts to a reduction in the appropriation of some 10 per cent-a quite substantial reduction, given the inadequate nature of the original appropriations in the first place. Education is cut back by some $7.3m, most of which relates to a 20 per cent reduction in the appropriation for the school to work transition program. In housing and construction there is a reduction of $15m, of which $5m, representing a reduction of 10 per cent, is from the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. So, that inadequate appropriation is to be further cut back as well. One area which interests me considerably is that of Aboriginal affairs, where there is a cut-back of $800,000, of which $148,000 is for communication to Aurukun and Mornington Island. None of the allocation is to be spent this year. </PARA>
<PARA> These so-called savings in appropriations include cut-backs in areas which clearly are areas of undeniable need. The Opposition takes the view that it is appalling that these cut-backs have occurred. I note in particular that for aged persons' accommodation-which, as I have already mentioned has been cut back by some $2.9m-there was an appropriation for 1980-81 of only 36 per cent of the real level for 1975-76, the last year of the Labor Government. So, that appropriation was way below the real level of expenditure under Labor and now it is being further cut back by some 10 per cent. This is an area of quite obviously undeniable need. The fact that these cut-backs are being made-of course there are further cut-backs to come later this week with the announcement of the razor gang report-indicates the Government's anti-public sector bias and its lack of concern for programs to assist people in real need. </PARA>
<PARA> I pass on from these cut-backs in appropriations to look more generally at the state of the economy and the effectiveness or otherwise of the Government's economic policies. The Government is continually claiming that economic recovery is under way and that this is attributable to the Government's economic policies. Earlier tonight the Treasurer (Mr Howard) reiterated these claims. The Opposition does not deny that some degree of economic recovery has occurred and is occurring, but I make three points about that. Firstly, we say it is not as extensive as the Government claims; secondly, it is happening largely because of the failure of the Government to achieve particular policy objectives and because of factors beyond the control of the Australian Government; and, thirdly, the likelihood of recovery continuing will be determined largely by the extent to which the Government fails to achieve policy objectives. I now turn to a consideration of those three points. I refer firstly to the extent of the recovery. A month ago the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> We are now starting to see, quite unambiguously . . . the evidence of strong growth in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the supposed evidence for that growth. The evidence to which the Treasurer referred was, in the main, the movement in the total output of goods and services. Rates of growth have certainly increased but they are still not high by past measures. Budget forecasts were for gross domestic product to increase by 3 per cent or more and for non-farm gross product to increase by 3.5 per cent. In January this year the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Stone, said that the growth in the gross domestic product would be less than 3 per cent because of the drought in Queensland and New South Wales affecting the farm sector. He said that growth in non-farm gross product would be about 3.5 per cent. At the end of March this year the Treasurer said that growth in non-farm gross product would increase by around 4 per cent-in other words, it would exceed the Budget forecast. More latterly he has again indicated that he expects it to be over 4 per cent. In fact, this claim is borne out by the latest national accounts. Growth in 1980 was about 4.3 per cent for non-farm gross product but the growth in gross domestic product was only 3.1 per cent because of a 15 per cent fall in farm product. </PARA>
<PARA> If the assumption of growth in excess of 4 per cent is true it is an improvement on the Budget forecast and an improvement on the growth rates over the last few years. However, those rates, of course, were abysmally low. For the first four full financial years of the Fraser Government the average rate of growth in gross domestic product was only 2.4 per cent compared with the rate of 6 per cent to 7 per cent which the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) claimed was attainable in his 1975 policy speech. We have had anything but growth rates of 6 per cent to 7 per cent. Current estimates of growth of approxi- mately 4 per cent or more can be seen as strong or satisfactory only in the light of the very diminished expectations flowing from the experience of the last few years. The rates of growth are better than those of the last few years, but, of course, they were abysmal. </PARA>
<PARA> It is most important to note also that by far the best year for the Fraser Government was the 1976 calendar year in which the course of the economy was determined mainly by the policy adopted by the Labor Government. In that year non-farm gross product increased by 6.6 per cent. The growth rate since has been nothing like that. Once the Fraser Government's policies got into full swing growth rates were substantially reduced. As I have said, in the first four years they averaged a mere 2.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also said by the Government that our growth this year is better than that in most of the other developed countries. That of course is true but we have been affected much less by the 150 per cent rise in world oil prices in the 18 months to the middle of 1980 than have most other countries. This is something that the Government continually skips over but it is absolutely fundamental to understanding why the experience of Australia in respect of growth in 1980 has been different from that of most of the other developed countries. There was in the 18 months to the middle of 1980 an enormous increase of 150 per cent in oil prices. This was known as the second oil shock after the first shock of October 1973 in which oil prices quadrupled overnight. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the rest of the world has been very adversely affected by the increase in oil prices we have been protected from the adverse impact on our balance of payments of those higher oil prices because we produce 70 per cent of our oil needs. Most other developed countries have suffered severe balance of payments dislocation because of this factor. In other words, the greatly increased cost of oil has led to a large increase in their import bills which has caused the dislocation of their balance of payments and therefore led them to adopt policies which contract other imports in an attempt to achieve balance of payments equilibrium. To reduce imports they have adopted tough, contractionary fiscal and monetary policies which are dually designed to reduce the demand for imports and also to prevent inflation getting out of control as the higher oil prices feed into their economies. The international recession which is very obvious at present has been induced principally by the direct and indirect effects of the second oil shock; that is, the direct effects on the balance of payments and inflation and the indirect effects through the tough fiscal and monetary policies adopted to overcome the direct effects. The recession has been exacerbated in some countries by the resort to Friedmanite monetarist policies in countries such as Britain in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> Although our exports have been adversely affected by a consequent diminution in world demand for them and by drought we have, nevertheless, been largely protected from the international recession, not only because of our substantial self-sufficiency in oil but also because the dramatic world oil price rise has made our energy resources much more attractive as nations seek to move rapidly away from petroleum as an energy source. This is a tremendously important point. Not only have we been protected by meeting 70 per cent of our oil needs from our own resources but also the increased oil prices have made Australian energy far more attractive than it was previously. Hence, there has been a dramatic increase in investment in resources and resource related industries over the last year. We have been a double beneficiary. On the one hand we have been largely protected and on the other we have benefited because of the much greater attractiveness of resource development in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is this large resource investment surge which is fuelling growth in Australia at the same time as the cause of that surge, the second world oil shock, is causing acute economic difficulties leading to an actual decline in output in several developed countries. The extent of our insulation from the world oil price hike has been diminished by the unnecessary importation of its inflationary consequences through the adoption of import parity pricing for Australian produced oil. That policy has meant a dramatic rise in petroleum prices and taxes and is the major reason why our inflation rate still hovers around the 10 per cent mark. Without import parity we would have been much more protected from the inflationary recession besetting the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> A further point regarding the Government's claim that our growth rate is good compared with other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is that in the first four years of the Fraser Government our rate of growth was abysmally below that of comparable countries. Real gross domestic product per head in Australia grew by 1.2 per cent per annum in those four years compared with 4.1 per cent for our industrialised trading partners. Until last year in the period of the Fraser Government in this country our growth rates had been way behind those being achieved by the rest of the developed world. Thus, in this context, bearing in mind our great advantages over most other countries beset by rising world oil prices, we hardly have cause for self-congratulation at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect to look at in regard to the supposed recovery is employment. The Government continually points to rising employment as a sign of economic recovery. Certainly on the available figures there has been notable employment growth over the last two years. But it is important to note also that that growth has been slowing down. Since the Government ordered the Commonwealth Statistician not to publish figures for wage and salary earners in civilian employment each month the only published guide to employment is the monthly labour force figures. These show that the maximum annual growth for employed persons in Australia occurred in July 1980. In the 12-month period to July 1980 employment growth reached its maximum of some 212,000. Since then, however, there has been a clear downward trend with a lower figure for almost every successive month. The latest figure for February 1981 shows an annual rate of growth of only 146,000. That is still a substantial figure but it is far less than the rate of growth in July last year. It is important to note that that trend is still on a downward path. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the figures for full time employment they show an even greater decline in the rate of employment growth. In the 12 months to May 1980 they rose by 182,000 but there were successive monthly declines in the rate of growth thereafter so that in the 12 months to February 1981 they rose by only 105,000 or two per cent. Clearly, the employment growth rate has been declining, especially with regard to full time employment. Also, the number of registered unemployed in February 1981 was 19,500 higher than in February 1980-in total 482,000-that is, approaching half a million unemployed. Such developments on the employment front put all this Government's talk of strong economic growth in some perspective. The fact is that the rate of employment growth has substantially declined in the last six months. What has occurred has not prevented higher unemployment. To claim in these circumstances that strong economic recovery is occurring is clearly absurd. How can we have strong economic recovery occurring if we have diminishing rates of employment growth and rising unemployment? To claim that Australia is out of the recession, as the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said a month or so ago, when we have almost half a million people unemployed and the number of unemployed increasing, is clearly crass stupidity. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the second point regarding the idea that recovery has occurred largely because of events beyond government's control and because of the failure of the Government to achieve certain policy objectives. Firstly, I turn to the consideration of events beyond government control. That is, of course, principally referring to the massive rise in world oil prices to which I have already referred. This factor brought about the consequent investment surge that has occurred in resource projects and resource related industries. There is simply no denying that private investment has increased considerably, if not spectacularly, over the last 12 to 18 months. The latest figures show that new fixed capital expenditure by private enterprise for the September quarter 1980 was 37 per cent above the level for the September quarter of the previous year. Expected investment in the December quarter 1980 was 50 per cent above the actual investment in the December quarter 1979 and 25 per cent above the actual investment in the September quarter 1980. Those figures certainly demonstrate considerable investment growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The major areas of investment growth are in the mining industry, the processing of basic metals, and in finance. The latter area is, of course, closely associated with the investment surge in the resource areas. The process of capital raising is becoming infinitely more important given the enormous amounts of capital needed for these resource projects with the inevitable consequence that the finance industry has also become a major growth area. Altogether, the large rise in business investment will add substantially to non-farm gross product this year. Professor Nevile estimated that the Budget forecast of a 10 per cent real growth in investment would increase non-farm gross product directly and indirectly by a little over 1 per cent. If, however, the growth of investment is possibly as much as 20 per cent-this could be the case-that could add something like 2 per cent to non-farm gross product. </PARA>
<PARA> But capital investment is not the only source of growth at present. To the extent that that occurs, it is not attributable to Government policy but rather to the fortuitous large increase in oil prices and the availability of alternative energy resources in Australia. There are other sources of growth. Some other sources are purely domestic in origin. The irrefutable fact in relation to each of these domestic sources of increased growth is that they result from the failure of the Government to achieve its policy objectives rather than the successful implementation of those policies. For instance, the increase in retail sales is pointed to as some evidence of an increase in consumer expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> There certainly has been some increase in real terms during the last year. In the three months to February 1981, in comparison with the same three months in the previous year, there was a rise of 15 per cent which, after allowing for a 10 per cent rise in the goods component of the consumer price index and a population rise of a little over 1 per cent, still shows some notable real growth. Rather than proving that Government policy is working, this growth in consumer expenditure must surely be attributed to the fact that real wages have increased in the last year for the first time in five years. I think it is important to note that in the first four years of the Fraser Government there was, in fact, a reduction in the level of real wages in this country. We can hardly expect there to be a growth in consumer expenditure at a time when the real incomes of most consumers-that is, wage and salary earners-were in fact being reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research has calculated that in the whole history of Australia as a federation-back to 1900-there have been only four five-year periods in which there have been reductions in real wages. Those four periods are during the First World War, during the Second World War, during the Great Depression of the 1930s and during the five years up to 1979-in other words, in the first four years of the Fraser Government's period of office. The reduction in real wages which has occurred under this Government is not a normal phenomenon; it has been a quite marked and distinctly different thing from what has happened over most of the five-year periods in the course of our history as a nation. It has been a dramatically important development and one which has most certainly restricted the possibility of an expansion of consumer expenditure. Last year there was, in fact, an increase in real wages. That increase in real wages gave wage earners a capacity to spend that they did not have before. That therefore led to some increase in retail sales and consumer expenditures generally. </PARA>
<PARA> But it must be recognised that that occurred completely againt Government policy. It was not Government policy for there to be an increase in real wages. The Government is still talking of the need to reduce the level of real wages. It is certainly not for allowing them to increase. The increase in consumer expenditures resulted from an increase in real wages. The Government likes to take credit for the increase in consumer expenditure but abhors the reason for it-the increase in the real capacity of wage earners to buy goods and services. Similarly, if we look at the public sector we can see a complete contradiction between the Government's proclaimed policy of reducing the public sector and what happened in this financial year. The Budget involved a real 3 per cent increase in public expenditure. Of course, it did that because 1980-81 was an election year. It was fortuitous electorally to use the Budget to increase Government expenditures in various areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Nevile at the University of New South Wales, who is a foremost fiscal analyst in this country, has calculated that that 3 per cent growth in public expenditure will add 1.5 per cent to non-farm gross product in this financial year. Public expenditure growth, which is the source of the public sector stimulus, is providing a considerable degree of economic growth this year and is a major cause of the increase in the rates of growth. A 1.5 per cent increase in our growth rate is not to be sneezed at. Yet this is coming from an increase in public sector expenditures which the Government says basically that it is against. The Government does not explain how it came to give the 3 per cent increase last year. The Government is obviously in a contradictory situation. Once again the Government's failure to adhere to its policy of reducing the public sector has been a major factor in increasing the level of demand and so achieving the higher rate of economic growth. Yet the Government claims that this higher growth is attributable to the success of its economic policies. This is obviously absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the building industry, there was some pick-up of activity in 1980, the details of which I will not give because of time pressures. Such expansion again is clearly attributable more to the Government's failure to adhere to its money supply targets in 1980, thus enabling easier access to credit than would otherwise have been the case, than it is to any aspect of Government policy. In 1979-80 the Government's money supply target was 10 per cent. The actual growth of money supply as measured by M3 was 13 per cent but these figures obscure the considerable volatility in the rates of growth of the money supply which have generally been allowed to run well ahead of the target rate over most of the year, only approaching the target rate near the end of the financial year. This has been very evident in the current financial year with the money supply allowed to run way ahead of target prior to the election. Indeed, the growth rate of M1 in the three months to November 1980 was an extraordinary 26 per cent. For 1980, M1 rose by 17 per cent and M3 rose by 13 per cent, both well above the targeted levels. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not to be unexpected, therefore, that an industry such as the building industry, which is basically dependent upon the availability of credit, would respond favourably to this easier credit environment even though it was accompanied by interest rate rises in April and July 1980. Activity in many other industries would be stimulated by the building industry growth and by the greater availability of credit. Thus yet again, by failing to adhere to or achieve the announced policy, this time in relation to the controlling of the money supply, the Government has stimulated investment in the buiding industry and in the economy generally. It then claims that this is evidence of the success of its policies. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be clearly seen from this analysis that such recovery as has occurred has been predominantly due to specific failures by the Government to achieve its declared objectives-that is, to contain wage growth, to reduce the size of the public sector, to restrict the rate of growth of the money supply-and to the world oil price rise which is clearly not attributable to government policy. It follows then that rather than bearing out the Government's claims of the success of its policies the fact that there is some economic recovery demonstrates quite the opposite-that is, that when a more stimulatory policy is implemented than has been applied previously the economy responds to that stimulus. That is what the Opposition has been maintaining all along. Accordingly what has happened in regard to the increased growth rate bears out the validity of the economic policies advocated by the Opposition rather than demonstrate the success of the Government's economic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I wish to raise relates to the likelihood of this modest recovery being maintained in the future. This depends, as I say, on whether the Government continues to fail to achieve particular policy targets. Since past failure to achieve policy targets in areas of money supply growth, wages and the public sector have clearly stimulated the economy, it follows that recovery continuance depends on whether the Government continues to fail in those areas. Unfortunately it seems that the Government is likely to achieve its objectives in these areas this year, especially in regard to the money supply in the public sector; so economic recovery will accordingly be held back. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the money supply, increases in the interest rates after the election and a widening gap in the balance of payments current account mean that the money supply rate of growth is now declining and has reached the upper levels of the target rate of growth of between 9 per cent and 11 per cent. It is slightly above that level because of the slight increase in the March quarter, but it is still near the target rate of 11 per cent. Furthermore, this contraction in the annual rate of growth of money supply has involved a sharp continuation in money supply growth over the last few years. In the three months to February 1981, M1, in fact, declined by one per cent and M3 grew by only 9 per cent. This was before the seasonal run-down in the money supply which occurs from April to June when company and provisional tax payments become due, and there is a heavy drawing down of liquid funds from the banks. In these circumstances, it is difficult to believe we are not entering a period of acute tightening of credit, with the consequent adverse effects on growth in the building industry and in the economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> We are later this week to have revealed to us what the Government has decided to do to cut back on public sector spending which will mean that there will not be stimulus coming from this area either. In those circumstances I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill, the House-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) deplores the failure of the Government to fully spend appropriations in important areas of Government expenditure;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) rejects the Government's claims that the improvements in economic growth that have occurred recently have been due to the effects of Government policies;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) recognises that such modest recovery as has occurred is due to the failure of the Government to achieve particular policy objectives and to factors beyond the control of the Australian Government;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) notes with alarm the gathering signs of an acute credit squeeze as exemplified by record and rising interest rates and shortages of home mortgage finance;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) expresses its concern that severely restrictive monetary policies and a threatened tightening of fiscal policy will produce a renewed downturn in the rate of economic growth, and a further rise in unemployment, and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) accordingly expresses its complete lack of confidence in Government economic policies'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we consider Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) this evening I believe it is an appropriate time for any government and any member on the Government side to consider what are or ought to be policy objectives and, in that context, to consider what ought to be appropriated in order to support those objectives. In passing I would simply reject the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). In my speech this evening, rather than discuss in broad terms the economy as such, I thought, given this is an appropriate time to consider policies, I would consider some areas that may be appropriate for policy consideration. I do so on a couple of bases. The first is that we have to accept that our society is changing, even if some of the changes that we see about us are not very palatable at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In any time of change the government of the day must be responsive to that change as well as responsible in government. It must be sensitive as well as sensible. It must be a government that is aware of the needs of all Australians and willing to take the initiatives which society will, it is hoped, quite happily follow. It must be prepared to look at policy problems and at issues broadly and flexibly so that the appropriate response in these changing times can be articulated. As I said, rather than discuss the economy in broad terms I thought I would narrow the discussion to four areas: Firstly, the question of industrial relations; secondly, the future in energy and energy research; thirdly, the need to develop new industries in this nation; and, fourthly, the future of immigration and immigration policy in Australia. These four issues are all of great importance in themselves. In my view they are issues that will consume a good deal of time, discussion and debate as the 1980s roll on. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking about industrial relations, it is certainly not my purpose to indulge in a spate of union bashing, much as I for one might have a reason to be rather angry about the strike of the airline hostesses seeing that the strike prevented me from getting home to my electorate last weekend. That is not my purpose. Rather, I am concerned about the fact that as the 1980s go on the tendency for industrial disputation to take place in sensitive or key areas will have a very deleterious effect on the development of this nation. Going back to the bases that I enunciated at the beginning of my speech, we have to be able to look at the issue widely and flexibly so that we can articulate and develop appropriate responses. It is not just a question of considering such things as the current issue of the 35-hour week. The overall and wide-ranging adoption of a 35-hour week would be immediately damaging but, in the longer term, we have to be prepared to consider changes in working hours along with a whole range of other possible policy options. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, one of the things that we ought to be prepared to do is to make permanent part time work much more of an option in future working patterns. We must be prepared to consider ways in which we can avoid unnecessary disputation in key areas. I am not necessarily wedded to the idea that we should have something like the United States Taft-Hartley provisions in relation to national emergency strikes. Nevertheless, we ought to be prepared to consider ways in which we can avoid disputation, particularly in these sorts of key areas. We ought to be prepared to consider much more fully than so far has been done the idea of working as between employer and employee on an industry award basis, the so-called industry unions, or perhaps the establishment of industry agreements which do operate in some areas. The discussion ought to be re-opened about the States themselves vesting various of their own powers in relation to industrial matters to the Commonwealth as one way of achieving a more nation-wide response to the difficulties that we face. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally enough a good number of advantages could flow from moving to accepting part time work on a permanent basis. Permanent part time work is eminently suitable for, for example, married women. It is worth bearing in mind that it is an accepted fact that there still are increasing numbers of married women who are seeking employment of some sort or another. It is interesting to note that in 1979 some 72,000 married women were looking for work, compared with 40,000 in 1974. It is an increasing phenomenon. The provision of what we might call permanent part time work for them is obviously an attraction to them. Single parents, pensioners and people who do not want to go into a higher tax bracket would find permanent part time work attractive, that is, work that is not just provided on a casual basis but rather has a degree of permanency about it that we would associate with normal full time work. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the broad theme of industrial relations that we are discussing. I appeal for the government of the day to consider the most flexible of approaches because this is a changing society and we have to be prepared to meet changes flexibly and appropriately. One of the things that is of concern regarding energy, quite apart from the generally argued proposition that insufficient time or effort is being put into energy research in Australia, is that a good deal of energy research funding follows what we might call an almost predictable pattern. In other words, we tend to continue to fund the sorts of projects and research that have been funded in the past. Sometimes it seems to me that there is a failure to be more imaginative in our funding of research programs. </PARA>
<PARA> In this respect I mention a couple of research programs that are taking place in my electorate through the James Cook University of north Queensland. They are not currently being funded, yet they are projects which, I think, could demonstrate a need to be funded. Yet perhaps because of the fettered approach I mentioned before, the fetters of precedence, these projects so far have not been funded. The first I mention is a research program into using the humble peanut. It is a product for which Kingaroy is fairly famous. For those who may not know, it is a product that is also grown fairly extensively in north Queensland, particularly on the Atherton Tablelands. Peanut oil has properties which can make it very useful in diesel motors. I am not technically minded and I do not understand the technicalities of it, but apparently one of the advantageous properties of peanut oil is that it is a dry oil. It is a better quality oil than many other oils that are being experimented as alternatives to dieselene. The James Cook University of north Queensland has had a demonstration project going for nigh on two years in order to prove the properties of peanut oil in diesel motors, to compare them with conventionally fuelled motors, and to prove that peanut oil can be a useful and viable alternative, particularly for on-farm use. </PARA>
<PARA> A little while ago the University put in a request to the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council for funding of its research project, and failed. It is being submitted again. I use this as an example of the way in which one fears that energy research funding is simply going along the accepted lines of funding the sorts of things that have been funded before. Yet when we see the possibilities of this research and the possibilities of quite viable on-farm use in a regional part of the nation, we wonder why it cannot be seen to be worthy of funding. It is something that goes back to what I said in the beginning-flexibility of approach, imagination to meet changing needs and circumstances. In considering its appropriations in the future the government of the day ought to be concerned about these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Another piece of research, part of which is carried on in the north Queensland region, is research into the use of tallow as a fuel source. Again I mention that I am not technically minded and in this speech I do not propose to attempt to go in to the way in which that solid matter, tallow, can be used to fuel diesel motors. It can be done apparently by using some dieselene to start a motor and heat it and then switching over to tallow, which has been made liquid by the heat that the machine is generating. However, when one considers the number of export meatworks that exist around the nation, it is an area of research that appears to be worthy of funding. Yet the fetters of precedent appear to ensure that it misses out. As we consider the energy future of this nation, we have to be prepared to consider not just the traditional coal-to-oil or shale-to-oil processes but also to be imaginative and to research other interesting and perhaps promising areas and to ensure that in future years support is given where it is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of new industries is an area, of course, that one could go into at great length and produce all sorts of examples about. At this time of the night, in this debate, I do not have the time to do that. But I do touch briefly upon the part that tourism can play in Australia. It might sound as though I am hitting a tired old theme but, when one considers that Australia does not get a very large part of the international tourist market, when one considers that the nation has a tremendous amount to offer in safety, free from disease and when one considers that there are vast parts of this land to be opened up to tourism, then it certainly can be seen that tourism is one of those newer developing industries which this nation can take hold of to its advantage as the 1980s proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I can use an example from my electorate of the way in which so very few international visitors, even very few Australians, see a quite remarkable part of the world. Yet there it is to be offered and promoted. The Government has, of course, introduced some very good initiatives to promote tourism internationally for Australia. I think of the Budget allocations in recent years for the Australian Tourist Commission. I think of the introduction of depreciation on tourist acommodation buildings. But more can be done. At least these initiatives ought to be pursued, and certainly I would see the Australian Tourist Commission, as the 1980s evolve, having a far greater role in the promotion of tourism than it presently has. It is an industry that is labour intensive and will create jobs for this nation. It can grow with the nation in the 1980s. It certainly is an industry worthy of very considered and considerable support as required. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to immigration. I believe that immigration will perhaps be the biggest single debate area of the latter 1980s. As we develop our natural resources and as we take advantage of the so-called resources boom, so we will find the need to have a much higher immigration intake than at present for two reasons. Firstly, we may simply need greater numbers of skilled workers in various areas; secondly, we will want to match resource development with our domestic population base. Hence as a nation we will have to consider most seriously taking in far greater numbers of immigrants than we have in recent years. That brings with it one other very large area for consideration. When we think about an increased intake of migrants to this nation we will certainly have to consider our relationships with South East Asian nations and the intake of migrants from that part of the globe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the attention of the House to the speech made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) two days before the last Federal election in October 1980 in which he pledged to give back increases in the crude oil levy from 1 January 1981 as rebates on family allowances. This pledge was subsequently widely publicised in the media prior to the election. I draw the attention of the House also to the address given by the Governor-General in which he said that the Government would be looking closely at its family policies with the objective of further enhancing the position of Australian families. As yet these pledges and commitments are mere rhetoric.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The increase in the oil levy for the first six months of this year, according to the Treasurer (Mr Howard), will be $170m. According to figures provided by the Parliamentary Library and outlined in the other House by Senator Harradine on 26 March this amount of $170m would mean monthly increases in family allowances as follows: For the first child an increase of $5.80, for the second child an increase of $8.30, for the third child an increase of $10, for the fourth child an increase of $10 and for the fifth and subsequent children an increase of $11.65. This is what could be done for Australian families which would provide across-the-board average increases in the order of 22 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members may recall that the family allowance system was established in 1976 when child endowment payments and rebates for children were abolished. The new scheme was estimated to cost $1,020m per annum, or $785m more than the annual cost of child endowment. However, the savings to the Government through the abolition of the rebate scheme was almost equal to this cost. There was, therefore, in effect little net cost to the Budget in 1976-77. The family allowance has remained the same since 1976. It has not been indexed to the cost of living increases. In June 1976 the family allowance for the first child as a percentage of the average weekly wage was 1.95 per cent. Today it represents only 1.21 per cent of the average weekly wage. Over this same period living costs have risen at an enormous rate-according to the CPI, in excess of 60 per cent. Consequently the family allowance has been eroded in excess of 60 per cent during that period. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1941 the Child Endowment Act provided for the payment of an endowment, as it was then called, at a flat rate of 5s a week. This 5s represented the amount calculated to be the cost of keeping a child for a week. The present amounts of $15.20 a month for one child, $36.90 for two children, $62.90 for three children and $88.90 for four children would do little to meet the cost of keeping a child in today's society. It is evident that all families have been seriously financially disadvantaged by the failure of the Government either to increase or to index family allowance payments. Not only has the allowance remained the same since June 1976 but also the Government is now paying less in family allowances. If the Government had retained a system of child rebates and endowment and had indexed the rebate in a manner similar to the dependent spouse rebate, the cost of this scheme would have exceeded that of the family allowance scheme after its first year of operation. It is estimated that the cost of this scheme in 1980-81 would have exceeded the cost of the family allowance by $458m. Does the Government have a firm commitment to the family allowance scheme or is it trying to phase it out, albeit quietly?</PARA>
<PARA> To be meaningful, any system of family allowance should be increased regularly to compensate for inflation. As I have already outlined, the present level of the allowance is little more than a token gesture of family support. The debate on the future of the family allowance allows us to explore the need to encourage the development of the family unit as a basic structure of our society. At present the economic difficulties faced by young couples today-I mention the costs of buying a house and meeting heavy loan repayments in particular-are forcing them to hold off having a family until they have reached an adequate level of security. Even then the pressure is on them to restrict themselves to having a small number of children. I do not suggest that at the present time the system of the family allowance is an effective means of encouraging and supporting the family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been under attack for what I have said about the airline strike and, in particular, for what I have said about the air hostesses. I thought that I would give those people something to look at by saying a few words on what I think about the airline strike at the moment and the way in which it has affected Australia and the way in which it has affected Tasmania. I could not believe it when the hostesses said that they would go out on strike right on the eve of the Easter break. It was at a time when people were preparing to go from point A to point B and to travel from one State to another to visit their relatives. People had been saving for a holiday and had been primed up for that holiday period. These hostesses threw the whole situation into pandemonium by saying that they were going on strike. I could not believe it. We then saw what occurred. Businesses were affected: Hotels, boarding houses and all types of businesses which are dependent on the tourist industry were affected disastrously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There were also human problems which developed from that strike over the Easter period. Elderly people were trying to get home. One lady aged 76 from Hobart-I will not mention her name-went to New Zealand by the direct link from Hobart to Christchurch. She tried to get back prior to Easter. Because of the strike she could not get back. She finally had to fly from Christchurch to Sydney and from Sydney to Melbourne. She then had to wait and try to get back to Hobart. Unfortunately, she had a heart attack on the way back. Sick people were left stranded in Melbourne. They could not get back to Hobart. Sick people were left stranded in Sydney. The result of a selfish act by air hostesses was pandemonium. They have a body representing them. Surely to goodness they must know what they are doing to the economy and what they are doing to the emotions of the Australian people. Surely they know what problems they are causing to the people of Australia. They are a privileged lot. I have called them 'pampered darlings'. I repeat that statement. They are pampered darlings. Instead of trying to help people on to planes or doing something else some of them preen themselves. What they did and the way in which they have created the problems in the community is incredible. I would have thought with their good salaries and conditions-apparently their conditions get better each year and they move up the salary scale--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition always talks about unemployment. There are many unemployed young girls in Tasmania who would sweep and scrub the floors of hotels just to have a job. Those girls, of course, have been denied the opportunity. The tourist industry in Tasmania has experienced a dramatic downturn. It is one of the most important industries to Tasmania. Because of this selfish, rotten strike being conducted by these air hostesses many people in Tasmania have lost thousands of dollars. They have denied the opportunity of employment to many people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The worst part about the strike is what could happen in the future. People will get it into their minds that they will not be able to go on holidays because of the possibility of strikes. The unfortunate thing is that these people strike at times when the public is most vulnerable. They pick us off slowly but surely. If they are not striking at Easter time they are striking at Christmas time. They have the audacity to say that they want something else. They want only their own way and if they do not get it they go on strike. The word 'conciliation' should be taken out of the dictionary because there is no such thing as conciliation; these people want their own way. If they do not get it they hold the rest of Australia to ransom. I am afraid that politicians such as those on the opposite side of the chamber and some of those on this side of the chamber are too lily-livered to take them on. The airlines of Australia provide an essential service. But we allow these people to pick us off. </PARA>
<PARA> We then start arguing about air fares. The unfortunate part about it is that the air fares go up because of the incessant demands. The Australian community cannot afford to meet these demands. These pampered darlings, these glorified waitresses, have held the rest of Australia to ransom. They have created so many problems for the people of Australia. Members of the Opposition had better agree with me because many people in their electorates feel exactly as I do. These people have held us to ransom. They have created so many problems. They are nothing but selfish-I will not use in this House the word which I think describes them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was only last Saturday that our war veterans marched in cities all over Australia to remember those who made the supreme sacrifice so that we all could live in peace and freedom. Yet already I have received many protests from my constituents concerning the march. Of course, the public's attention is turned to the arrest of more than 60 women who wanted to join the march in Canberra to protest against rape of and violence against women in war. But whilst public attention is drawn to that group of women who wanted to honour the victims of such violence, I have received complaints that in the parade in Melbourne, alongside or following our veterans, marched groups of people who were known as notorious supporters of Adolf Hitler. I name at least two organisations which were deeply involved, supporting as they did the nazi occupation of their respective countries during the Second World War. They are the Organisation of Captive Nations from the Baltic and the Ukraine and the organisation of Ravna Gora Chetniks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I speak with some authority on this matter as I volunteered at the age of 13 to fight the nazi invaders of my native country. I emphasise that I welcome the many ethnic groups who joined the march and represented people who fought together with the allies. It was good to be reminded that many people all over the world fought with us for the ideals of freedom and democracy against the evil forces of fascism and nazism. But one does not have to be a student of history to know that the Organisation of Captive Nations is largely infiltrated with former nazis and quislings from the Baltic and the Ukraine, who ran from the scene of their crimes with the nazi SS troops on the victorious approach of the Red Army, our allies in the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> One makes certain allowances on the basis of ignorance on the part of the top leadership of the Returned Services League. Even so, that leadership should be held responsible for the decision to allow former quislings to join the Anzac march. Many of my constituents and I were especially incensed to see the Ravna Gora Chetniks march in the parade. It should be known to the organisers of the march that during the Second World War the Chetniks of Draza Mihajlovic fought on the side of the nazi occupiers of Yugoslavia. However, if the organisers of the Anzac march are ignorant on the subject I recommend that they read the works of Randolph Churchill and Brigadier Fitzroy McLean. Have the organisers not seen the film screened a few months ago on television entitled The Battle of Neretva that describes the collaboration of Chetniks with German nazis? I also remind the House that only recently in Belgrade a former war criminal, Chetnik Vojislav Rajcic, was sentenced to death for killing 49 people, including two allied pilots, between 1941 and 1945 in Yugoslavia. He admitted killing both airmen and even said that he somehow found it easier to put to death his fellow countrymen. His favourite way of killing was to cut his victims' throats with a knife. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems somewhat ironical to me that the top echelon of the RSL was informed of the political views of 300 women in Canberra yet the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation pimps neglected to inform it of the political activities of war criminals in Yugoslavia, the Baltics and the Ukraine. If for much longer we allow incompetent ASIO spooks to determine who takes part in Anzac parades we will finish up with former SS troops goose-stepping down St Kilda Road in Melbourne in future Anzac marches. As it is, as a result of ASIO incompetence, 300 Australian women, some of them members of the RSL, were not allowed to march-many of them were arrested instead-while former quislings were parading down our streets. </PARA>

It is appropriate that they should hold their convention in the national capital. I think it is time not only that we paid them tribute for holding their convention here in this city, but also that we paid tribute to the work that Lions International and, more generally, service organisations have done and are doing in our community.

I remember that one of the things that concerned me was the question: Why should I join a group of people who seem to have common interests or common backgrounds? Ultimately, one was persuaded by this view. In our society on one's own it often is hard to do very much, but when one can group together with like-minded people there is an opportunity by way of a combined effort to make some sort of contribution in the communities in which we live.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously he is against that organisation. However, I will pay tribute to it. So it is that I joined the organisation, and I hope that through it I was able to make my own small contribution. I certainly pay tribute to all those men and women who over many years have given large amounts of their time, their efforts and often their money in the service of their communities. To be sure, a lot of time is spent on fellowship within those organisations and, in some respects, a lot of time might seem to be wasted, but in the net result those people make an enormous contribution of effort which deserves recognition. We do well, on this the occason of their convention here in Canberra, to pay tribute to that contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think there is a more significant reason for it being appropriate in the national Parliament to pay tribute not only to the Lions organisation but also other service organisations. Without the work done by Lions and other service organisations the business of government would be so much more difficult. There is no doubt that to a significant extent the community relies upon the work that service organisations-voluntary groups-do. If government were to be expected to take over all the functions those organisations perform I should think that government would be placed in an almost impossible position. We do rely on their effort and their contribution. I think it is appropriate that we should be able to do so. It would be a poor society indeed which existed purely on the premise of government handout. It would be a poor society indeed which did not recognise the real compassion, the real concern and the real caring that can come about simply because some people wish to make a contribution to the benefit of others. If it were all left to government that degree of compassion, that degree of caring and that degree of sharing would be missing from our society. So it is that, as I said, it is appropriate for government, it is appropriate for the national Parliament, to be aware of, to recognise and to pay tribute to the efforts of Lions International and the efforts of like organisations. I conclude by congratulating Lions International on its continued success in the Australian community. I congratulate it on holding its convention here in this city this week. I wish the convention every success and the future efforts of Lions International every success. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The table shows figures extracted for the past nine years from 1972-73 to 1980-81. The table shows that for beer, for example, in that period the amount of excise collected increased from $420m to $1,010m. However, as a percentage of total Commonwealth revenue, the excise collected on beer in that period dropped from 4.4 per cent to 2.9 per cent. In the case of spirits, the percentage has remained fairly steady at 0.3 per cent, increasing from $31m to $100m. In the case of tobacco, excise collections have increased from $328m in the financial year 1972-73 to $717m in the current financial year. But as a percentage of total Commonwealth revenue those collections have dropped from 3.5 per cent to 2.1 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposition that I am putting to the House is that in fact the amount of excise collected from beer, spirits and tobacco is insufficient, that the amount spent by the community because of the use of large quantities of alcohol and tobacco is much greater than the amount that is collected by the Commonwealth Government in excise. The amount of excise collected on beer as a percentage of total Commonwealth revenue has dropped from 4.4 per cent to 2.9 per cent. This is a very significant drop. My own view would be that there should be a very significant increase in the excise for beer and that there should be a significant lowering of the excise for low alcohol beer so as to encourage people who want to drink beer to drink low alcohol beer. We should certainly discourage them from continuing to drink high alcohol beer. If we can do this maybe the number of accidents on the roads and the number of people suffering from alcoholism et cetera will be significantly reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that in over 50 per cent of accidents which result in death or injury one of the people involved is affected by alcohol. It has always struck me as ridiculous that we do very little about it. We talk about the civil liberties of people who drink and drive but we do nothing about breath testing people who come out of pubs and clubs. It is quite obvious that it would be reasonably easy to reduce the incidence of driving under the influence if we put police patrols outside hotels and clubs and took active steps to discourage people from drinking and driving. </PARA>
<PARA> If I may say so, this is usually a completely gutless government. It caves in to pressures from every group. In some cases it justifiably wants to deal with such groups. There is no doubt that the Australian Hotels Association, the brewers and so on are taking very active steps to mobilise public opinion against an increase in the amount of excise collected on beer, tobacco and spirits. I think it is very important that we, as fairly responsible parliamentarians, give some backing to the Government and indicate that we will not make this a political issue, that we will not attack the Government on this issue. The Government deserves support if in fact it is intending to do something about it,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address the House very briefly as the honourable member for Balaclava on a matter which I wanted to raise earlier in the day; that is, the death of a former member for Balaclava, Sir Percy Joske. I just want to record what I believe both sides of the House would wish to have recorded. I wish to pay a short tribute to Sir Percy. He had a very distinguished career at the Bar, in this House and as a judge. Above all he will be remembered as the pioneer of the Matrimonial Causes Act which was the first uniform divorce law in Australia and was the foundation for the law introduced by the Whitlam Government, passed by this House in 1975 and which will soon be updated further. It was a pioneering piece of legislation, undoubtedly the most effective piece of legislation initiated by a private member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make these observations not to intrude upon the time of private members but for the sake of the family of Sir Percy which I think should have recorded some of the esteem of the House. I would like to refer to the foreword by Sir Garfield Barwick to the fifth edition of the book Matrimonial Causes and Marriage Law and Practice Australia and New Zealand. Sir Garfield Barwick, as Attorney-General, said in January 1961:</PARA>
<PARA> When in 1951, Mr P. E. Joske, Q.C., became a member of the House of Representatives for the Victorian constituency of Balaclava one of his self-imposed tasks was to plead the case, in Parliament and in the community, of a uniform Australia-wide law of divorce. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir Garfield went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Joske's first step was to carry this jurisdictional reform a stage further. He did it in the Matrimonial Causes Act 1955, which he himself introduced as a private Member's Bill. Two years later, with the Government's approval, he introduced, again as a private member, a comprehensive measure that dealt with the grounds of divorce as well as with questions of jurisdiction. This Bill was vigorously debated in the House of Representatives and outside, but was eventually replaced by a Government measure, which became law as the Matrimonial Causes Act 1959. It is fair to say that the Act could scarcely have been acceptable to the Parliament if it had not been for the earlier strenuous efforts of the member for Balaclava. The changes introduced by the Commonwealth Act were great in both detail and in principle. Apart from changes in the grounds of divorce, which are not now the same, in any State, as hitherto they have been, there are important procedural changes, involving new professional habits in every State, laid down by the Act and carried out in the Rules. </PARA>
<PARA>Because of the indulgence of the Opposition I will not proceed further with the tributes that were then paid except to say that in the parliamentary debates of 14 May 1959 Sir Garfield Barwick, in introducing what was then a Government measure, paid great tribute again to Sir Percy as the member for Balaclava for this private member's measure. I know Sir Percy is still held in high regard in my electorate of Balaclava. In fact last night I addressed a joint branch meeting of the Liberal Party. Condolence motions were moved and very complimentary things were said in memory of Sir Percy. He is remembered also by practitioners in the family law area because his book on Australian family law is still the principal authority. Also, I understand that the Clerks of this House and elsewhere are still referring people to his excellent work on the law of public meetings. He is a person whose works ought to be remembered by this House and I thank the House for the opportunity to record my comments on them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Dean) in welcoming members of the Lions organisation to Canberra. I just wonder what possible reason he could have had, when he conducted his debate with himself in 1965, for not joining the organisation. The matters that I would like to raise in the few minutes left to me tonight are connected with an article which appeared in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald. A report in that paper concerns a leak, evidently from intelligence sources, which indicated inaccuracies in statements made by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) concerning the presence in Vietnam of Soviet Backfire bombers. Honourable members will recall that in the middle of last month both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence reported in public that they considered that Backfire bombers had been stationed at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam and the implication was made that the presence of those bombers in Vietnam represented a serious problem for Australians. I think that the report that appeared in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald, which repudiates those statements, reflects very much to the discredit of the Government. An intelligence official is reported as having attacked the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence for having jumped the gun on an unconfirmed intelligence report when they made that statement. The official said that they were acting 'like hungry dogs going for a bait'. That was the description, apparently by an unnamed intelligence official, of the use by the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister of unconfirmed intelligence reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that the Prime Minister jumped the gun on that matter is serious for a couple of reasons. First, I think it reflects upon the decision making process within the Department of Defence that both the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister could have used an unconfirmed intelligence report in that way evidently without consultation with the Department of Defence. I think, too, it has serious implications for the way in which Australian defence policy is made and it shows the lack of wisdom in coming forward with unconfirmed statements such as this. The statements seemed to be intended to cry wolf and crying wolf in any aspect of Australian defence policy has very dangerous implications. One is that it creates suspicion among the thinking section of the population about calls to arms or discussion of threats when threats actually exist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Appropriations for 1980-81 under Division 103-Parliamentary Reporting Staff-were made on the basis of draft estimates approved by the Presiding Officers and prepared in accordance with guidelines issued by the Department of Finance.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is estimated that expenditure to 30 June 1981 will fall short of appropriations by the amounts shown in the Finance Information Paper.</PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure on overtime is related directly to the sittings of the Parliament and its committees.</PARA>
<PARA> In the six months of the financial year 1980-81 to 31 December 1980 sittings of the Parliament were shorter than in a normal year because of the October general election.</PARA>
<PARA> In the appropriation for other administrative expenses an amount of $208,000 is included for the purchase of computers and ancillary equipment. This amount was sought and approved on the basis of a recommendation for the introduction of word processors in the committee transcript area. Implementation of this recommendation was delayed by a decision to make a detailed examination of the word processing equipment requirement of all of the parliamentary departments.</PARA>
<PARA> Following that examination, specifications were prepared and tenders invited for the supply of equipment on a term contract basis. The closing date was 27 February and the tenders are now being assessed.</PARA>
<PARA> It is unlikely that the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff will incur any expenditure before 30 June 1981 against the 1980-81 appropriation of $208,000.</PARA>
<PARA> However, it is expected that in the near future the Department will be in a position to place orders and will incur a liability of up to $208,000 which will be met in 1981-82.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0K4">Mr Wilson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The criticism of the winning scheme by Mr Norman Day, the architecture critic for the Melbourne Age, among others, has largely revolved around their preference for schemes by other finalists. The winning design by Frank Martin has not been challenged on functional or cost grounds.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The site for the building has as yet not been changed. The Government is considering whether the National Archives building should be located on a site in the Parliamentary Zone instead of that originally chosen in Constitution Avenue.</PARA>
<PARA> The alternative site is being investigated in the light of the decision to build a new Parliament House on Capital Hill, and the desirability of establishing overall planning intentions for the Parliamentary zone in terms of the types of activities and buildings which should be located in that area.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The competition was conducted by the National Capital Development Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> The assessors were: A. J. W. Powell, Commissioner, N.C.D.C. (Chairman); R. G. Neale, Director-General of the Australian Archives; J. H. Andrews, Architect; C. F. Madigan, Architect.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The estimated cost of the National Archives building in 1979-80 prices is $22.68m.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Until the site and design have been confirmed and the Government has approved a construction program no advice on either the completion date or the estimated workforce can be given.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Yes, my attention has been drawn to the article referred to in the question and in response, I can assure the honourable member that the Government certainly does realise the necessity for a properly constituted archival organisation, properly funded and as fully staffed as is necessary to carry out its specified functions. An indication of this lies in the Government's intention to achieve a complete and carefully co-ordinated legislative programme in the field of both Archives and Freedom of Information. The Bills at present under consideration carefully complement each other to form a fully integrated information policy which receives vital support through the records management aspects of the Archives Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Briefly the Government's attitude to Archives is made clear in two areas of general activity. The first is in the legislation at present under consideration and in the opportunity given to all interested parties to contribute to the development of that policy through the operations of the two Senate Committees to which the Bill was referred. The second is the programmed development of new sophisticated and purpose-built repositories in all States and the ACT. The building programme will culminate in Canberra with the construction of a National Archives building. This National building will be supported by a large supplementary repository in the suburb of Mitchell which will become fully operational during April 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The issue of the resources necessary for effective operations in each of the areas mentioned in the question is now under review and every effort will be made within existing economic guidelines to make appropriate provisions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) I am advised by the Australia Council that the Crafts Board has decided to reduce its funding to the Crafts Council of Australia. The Board has also separately decided not to continue its subsidy to the Crafts Council's publication project, 'Craft Australia' beyond December 1980. I am informed that the Crafts Board's decision derives from its recognition that the latest developments in the crafts confirm a trend to diverse and decentralised initiatives. The Crafts Board believes that the evolution of the Crafts Council of Australia and its constituent State Councils must take into account the expanded development of the State Councils, the growth of specialist interest groups and the roles of other agencies such as art galleries, craft centres, library networks and regional arts councils. It is the Board's view that, in response to these developments, the Crafts Council's national office must become a smaller flexible administrative unit, placing greater emphasis on a co-ordinating, directing and monitoring role and developing strategies on how best to utilise the potential of those other agencies in the interest of the crafts.</PARA>
<PARA> The Crafts Board's decision not to continue its subsidy to 'Craft Australia' beyond December 1980 relates to the Board's policy to give priority to support for the area of critical research and documentation, and that a potential market exists within the membership of the Crafts Council movement (currently estimated at 100,000) which would enable an increase in subscriptions from the current level of 6,000 to allow the journal to achieve self sufficiency.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Crafts Board has advised me that it did not issue a press release on this matter. I am informed that the matter was first discussed with the Crafts Council of Australia in November 1979 and, following its decision to withdraw from funding 'Craft Australia', the Board notified the Crafts Council of Australia by letter in January 1980 of its decision which was to take effect from the beginning of 1981.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Minister for Social Security has advised me that a National publicity and community information campaign has been planned to increase awareness of the special difficulties and abilities of disabled people during the International Year of Disabled Persons (IYDP).</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The campaign aims to inform the public-</PARA>
<PARA> about the Year and the United Nations; theme: 'Full Participation and Equality'; and</PARA>
<PARA> that lack of physical access and the attitudes of society are the main barriers confronting disabled people.</PARA>
<PARA> The first part of the campaign, the publicity program which was produced in consultation with many disabled people, was approved by the IYDP Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers' Council and went into operation on 4 January 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> It includes-</PARA>
<PARA> a series of 60-second radio and television commercials based on the theme ''Break Down the Barriers'';</PARA>
<PARA> posters, bumper stickers, button badges and t-shirts, all based on this same theme, which have and are being widely distributed throughout the community.</PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the campaign, the community information program is being designed to capitalise on the awareness created by the publicity campaign in providing the public with more detailed knowledge about disability and disabled people. As part of this program a national IYDP bulletin ''Breakthrough'' is being produced on a monthly basis. The rest of the program which will include leaflets and film material is being considered by the IYDP Commonwealth/State and Territory Ministers' Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) A total of $1,000,000 has been approved for expenditure in the 1980-81 and 1981-82 financial years for IYDP publicity and community information purposes. $650,000 of this has been allocated for 1980-81. It is hoped that this amount will be complemented by community air time and supported by special features on television, radio and in the press.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Officers of my department have given a great deal of consideration to how best 'Life. Be In It' could be involved in the International Year for Disabled Persons (IYDP). The Policy Committee which administers the national 'Life. Be In It' program on behalf of the Recreation Ministers' Council has discussed the matter with officers from the National Secretariat of IYDP.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the nature of the national program being developed by the National Secretariat of the IYDP it is not proposed to use or extend the 'Life. Be In It' campaign to promote IYDP. However, appropriate activities for the disabled will be included in the programs being developed for 1981 by State and Territory Departments responsible for recreation. Discussions are continuing with IYDP and 'Life. Be In It' on the possibility of producing a special 'Life. Be In It' poster for IYDP to supplement the national publicity program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There are still some outstanding matters relating to the rules of registered health insurance organisations in respect of medical and hospital benefits above those payable under the basic tables in the terms of the revised health insurance arrangements introduced from 1 September 1979. These matters are being negotiated with individual organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The rules of all registered organisations are being examined as part of my Department's continual rules' review process.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The rules that are regarded as discriminatory relate to the exclusion of medical and hospital benefits for pre-existing illnesses, certified mental diseases and tuberculosis.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The relevant rules are regarded as discriminatory in accordance with policy that was conveyed to all registered benefits organisations by Circular (MB203/HB134) for adoption in connection with the revised health insurance arrangements introduced from 1 September 1979. The policy was formulated having regard to the intentions and spirit of the health insurance legislation relating to the operation of the basic medical and basic hospital tables.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the abovementioned policy, organisations' rules may exclude benefits (above the basic level) for pre-existing illnesses. However such exclusion should be removed after twelve months' membership. In this way, contributors' certainty of entitlement to benefits after twelve months' membership for pre-existing illnesses is assured.</PARA>
<PARA> For mental diseases and tuberculosis, exclusion rules for such illnesses are regarded under the policy as discriminatory where persons receive treatment privately i.e. such persons should be eligible for both medical and hospital benefits if charges are raised.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0K4">Mr Wilson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is a fact that Australian sportsmen and sportswomen have received assistance from the Commonwealth Government to enable them to participate as Australian representatives in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. There are few opportunities for participants in Olympic and Commonwealth Games sports to become professionals. However, what competitors do with their careers at a later time is a matter for each individual.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Like all National Sporting Organisations, the National Sporting Organisations to which disabled sportsmen and sportswomen belong are eligible to seek assistance towards international competition both in Australia and overseas under the Commonwealth Government's Sports Development Program. In 1980-81 $60,000 has been provided under the program for the Australian Sports Council for the Disabled, the Australian Paraplegic and Quadriplegic Sports Federation, the Australian National Council of and for the Blind and the Australian Deaf Sports Federation. Of the $60,000, $52,000 is to assist people to participate in international competition in Australia and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) While this assistance is already available to National Sporting Organisations, it is hoped that in the future greater encouragement will be given to disabled people to participate in sport and recreation activities, to the highest level that they wish. To assist in this process, the Government has recently appointed the National Committee on Sport and Recreation for the Handicapped. It will be this Committee's responsibility to make recommendations to Government on priority areas for funding the development of sport and recreation opportunities for disabled people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 10 March 1981:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report from a London Times reporter in El Salvador, reprinted in the Canberra Times of 5 March 1981, which states that (a) the United States of America White Paper claiming that communist arms are being sent to El Salvador leftist guerillas has omitted reference to terrorism by rightist guerillas and (b) leftist attacks are aimed mainly at structures, not people.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) If so, does the report also claim that it is impossible to confirm charges about communist arms, and that captured guerilla weapons are mostly antiquated and that some are even homemade.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is he able to confirm that, as the report suggests, El Salvador's President is less than keen to have U.S. arms and told the New York Times that it is of no use to have the greatest and best army in the world if the people are dying from hunger and that he wants economic aid to ensure his agricultural land reforms.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Will Australia join Canada in supporting the President's view and take the side of the starving against mass murderers, irrespective of leftism or rightism.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) My attention has been drawn to the article in question.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is a brief reference in the article to the difficulties involved in identifying the source of captured guerilla weapons. This is hardly a rebuttal of the extensive and thorough evidence provided by the United States of the organised supply of arms from outside. Indeed, some of the United States' evidence even suggests that special efforts have been made by the suppliers of these arms to disguise that source. They have, for example, supplied United States weapons captured elsewhere, including Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The report suggests that President Duarte appreciates the need for social and economic progress. That need is also recognized by the United States Government, as was made clear by Vice President Bush during his recent discussions in Washington with Mr Street.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Australia is opposed to murder and other violations of human rights in El Salvador and has recently given clear expression to this view at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. At the same time I should note that El Salvador is located in a region of long-standing and genuine concern to the United States and has become an issue in East-West relations. The United States is justified in seeking to cut off the flow of weapons from communist countries which is promoting disturbance and revolution in Latin America.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr Malcolm Fraser</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I refer the honourable member to my reply to his earlier Question on Notice No. 45 (H of R Hansard, 25 February 1981, p. 197) in which I outlined the nature of the CSIRO study. As I indicated then, CSIRO will at the appropriate time, call for tenders for aircraft to meet the requirements of the study. From the tenders received CSIRO will select the type of aircraft which most closely conforms to its specifications, taking into account cost considerations. As was also indicated in my reply to the honourable member's earlier question the agreement to provide a Hercules to Victoria is a separate exercise but one which is nevertheless relevant to the CSIRO study. Details of the arrangement are to be settled by consultation between Commonwealth and Victorian officials. The in-principle agreement between the two Governments, however, does provide that CSIRO be able to take advantage of the trials and operations of the Hercules, fitted with the Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System (MAFFS), to collect data on bushfire behaviour and control. This was also made clear in a press release of 8 February 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) One of the matters to be settled by officials is that of the specific 'on-call' and 'stand-by' arrangements for the Hercules aircraft which is being made available to Victoria. The Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System will be on loan to the Victorian Government from the US Forest Service. Its deployment, therefore, will largely be determined by the fire control priorities of that Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The MAFFS unit and the necessary retardant mixing tank will be located at a RAAF base in Victoria. The possibilities for deploying the aircraft to other States would be severely limited by the necessity to return to that base to re-fill the MAFFS unit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Checks are made by departmental officers as between assigned benefits claims for disadvantaged persons received by my Department and claims received by private health funds in respect of any information received or gained that the declaration by a patient assigning his right of medical benefits to a doctor, or a doctor claiming for assigned benefits, is false. A person (usually the patient) in assigning his right to medical benefits, has to declare that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) I am not entitled to benefits for the abovementioned service(s) under a medical benefits table conducted by a registered medical benefits organisation, providing benefits for professional services;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the patient in respect of whom the service was provided is an Australian resident or is a person to whom the Health Insurance Act 1973 applies by virtue of an approval under Section 6 of that Act; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) I do not have an entitlement to, or a right to claim compensation or damages in respect of these services.</PARA>
<PARA>The practitioner claiming for the assigned medical benefits has to declare:</PARA>
<PARA> I declare that to the best of my knowledge and belief, the patients in respect of whom assignments have been received are entitled to make such assignments under Section 20A of the Health Insurance Act 1973.</PARA>
<PARA>I declare that a copy of the assignment or agreement form has been retained by the patient in accordance with Section 20B of the Health Insurance Act 1973. I declare that none of the amounts claimed is in respect of a professional service:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that was rendered is a recognised hospital to a patient who was not a private patient;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that was rendered in carrying out a mass immunisation;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) that was a medical examination for the purposes of life insurance, a superannuation or provident account scheme or admission to membership of a friendly society; or</PARA>
<PARA> (d) in respect of which to the best of my knowledge and belief, a Commonwealth Medical Benefit is otherwise not payable under the Health Insurance Act 1973.</PARA>
<PARA>I further declare that no other payments have been sought from the patient other than those specified in the columns headed 'amounts payable by the patient' on the attached assignment forms.</PARA>
<PARA> Departmental officers review any complaints from patients, members of the public, practitioners or officers of private health insurance organisations. The normal checking procedures for assigned benefits claims, or claims processed by health insurance funds, show from time to time matters which should be examined, and the various techniques of bringing together statistical information supplied to, or compiled by my Department, give rise to many of these examinations.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Although there is no evidence to indicate the fact, it is possible that some money is paid for medical services for disadvantaged patients under direct (bulk billing) arrangements for persons covered by private health insurance, either as a result of a mistake, or a misunderstanding, or deliberately.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The income tax revenue forgone in the financial year 1979-80 as a result of the special deductions for expenditure on exploration and development of (a) petroleum and (b) other mineral resources allowed under Divisions 10AA and 10 of the Income Tax Assessment Act has been estimated as $28m and $43m respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> These amounts relate to the deduction of capital expenditure allowable under the special mining provisions, but not the ordinary provisions, of the income tax law. They also exclude the deductions under Division 10AAA relating to the transport of minerals. Revenue was also forgone in that certain deductions for expenditure on mineral exploration and development plant were allowed over shorter periods of time than would have been the case if the plant had been subject to depreciation allowances at normal rates. As indicated in the parts of the Statements attached to the Budget Speeches that relate to Industry Assistance throught the Taxation System, concessions that accelerate tax allowances in this way, while conferring no greater total deduction over the life of the plant than would otherwise be available, permit a deferment of tax which entails a cost to the Budget.</PARA>
