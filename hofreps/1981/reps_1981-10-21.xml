<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA> Sale of Trans Australia Airlines would inevitably result in:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the creation of a private monopoly of major airline services in Australia;</PARA>

<PARA> 1. The failure of the Federal Government to lead the way in employment of disabled people by employing a greater number of such people within the Commonwealth Public Service-note the small number currently employed within the Service.</PARA>

<PARA> 6. Failure by the Federal Government to alter, or create a ''disability'' allowance means test free for all disabled people-this would assist with necessary equipment and mobility costs.</PARA>

Further, in order to provide him with an opportunity to clarify the technical aspects of the matter, I ask: Will he now answer my original question, that is, whether major media groups, including the Fairfax, Syme, Herald and Weekly Times and Advertiser groups, indicated their intention to work with Telecom Australia in developing a national videotex system using Prestel?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first part of the honourable member's question is no. The answer to the second part is that there are two areas. The way in which I started my response yesterday was the result of the confusion of the honourable gentleman in the way in which he presented his question, for there is a very real cause for public debate about the circumstances of providing captioning on television screens, to which the first part of my answer yesterday referred. That relates to Seventex and that form of teletext which is radiated and which involves the application of funds which the Commonwealth included in the Budget in order to help those who have a hearing impairment to enjoy television.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the second part of the question-the part that the honourable member has now identified as his principal concern-about the degree to which consultations were undertaken by various media groups with Telecom in respect of Prestel, there have been, over the course of time, considerable discussions by, I understand, the British Post Office with various groups and by Telecom Australia with various groups, and a number of them have communicated with me. The basis of the Government's decision was in no way related to any of those discussions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the honourable member's concern over a shortage of meat inspectors at a time when the lamb season is about to open in Western Australia. The fact is that the lamb season has been caught up in a number of events which have caused a shortage of inspectors at several spots around Australia at the moment. With the close-down of a number of abattoirs because of a shortage of cattle, the Bureau of Animal Health did not continue its recruiting campaign and allowed the numbers to run down following retirements and resignations. In addition, the meat substitution problem in Melbourne caused the need for a number of inspectors to be transferred there to carry out the new procedures. The Katanning problem, I am pleased to be able to inform the honourable member, has been overcome by the availability all of a sudden of a number of inspectors from Wagga Wagga, which is closing down its works in a few days' time. Those inspectors will be transferred to Katanning and, therefore, I hope that the problem of Katanning will be resolved. I wish the Katanning operators all the best for a good lamb season.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, is prefaced by my indicating that I have exchanged correspondence with the Minister on uranium enrichment. I quote an extract from the correspondence:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government regards the possible establishment of an enrichment industry in Australia as a commercial matter, to be determined by the companies concerned. Similarly, the negotiation of contracts for the supply of enriched uranium or enrichment services would be a commercial matter.</PARA>
<PARA>Does the Minister acknowledge that the decisions on whether uranium enrichment is to be conducted in Australia, what technology is to be used and the terms on which such technology is to be transferred to Australia involve fundamental questions of nuclear proliferation? Why then has the Government handed over these decisions to the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia, which is a consortium of private companies, which means that such decisions to set up this important industry are therefore to be based entirely on commercial criteria? Why has the Government abdicated its responsibilities for policies in this highly sensitive area to commercial interests and to the exclusion of the States? Why has it sold out any public interest in this potentially valuable industry? Will this Government take immediate steps to reassess this scandalous policy initiative?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A commercial group, the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia-this is a number of leading Australian companies-is doing an evaluation of the possibility of setting up an enrichment plant in Australia. It is the Government's aim that, if there is to be an enrichment plant in Australia, it be privately funded and operated so that it will be based on a sound commercial proposition. However, I want to clarify the situation. The type of technology that the group selects will have to be approved by the Government. Also, any sales that it makes of enriched uranium will have to be approved by the Government to ensure that they meet our international safeguard requirements. There will be no neglect as far as our international responsibilities are concerned and there will be no weakening of our position, in order to ensure that the proliferation rules laid down by international organisations are fully upheld.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Has the Minister seen reports that the curfew at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport may soon be lifted for the new wide-bodied aircraft? Did the Minister say on 5 June that he was conscious of the noise sensitivity of the communities around Australian airports and that he would take the views of those communities into account?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr HUNT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I must say that the headlines that appeared in the Sydney Sun yesterday were misleading and sensational and were clearly designed to sell the edition. The Government has not made any decision to vary the curfew in any shape or form. I have issued statements about the matter and I adhere to them. The Government's position is thus: There will not be any easing of the curfew applying to airports until there has been a proper evaluation of the noise levels of the Airbus 300 and until adequate discussions have been held with local community groups and the aircraft noise abatement committees at those airports. I have made that point very clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report may have arisen from the results of tests that have been taken and which indicate that the Airbus 300 is far and away the least noisy jet aircraft being operated by airlines in Australia at present. In fact, it is only a fraction noisier than the propeller driven F27. Undoubtedly, it is a less noisy neighbour than any other jet aircraft flying in the sky today. The Government has not moved from its position. It intends to continue to monitor the situation and to assist local communities to monitor the noise level around airports to ascertain whether it would be increased by allowing the Airbus 300 to operate in curfew hours.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure the honourable gentleman has some understanding of the concepts on which the defence of Western Europe is based. Quite plainly, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation powers need to be able to match the Warsaw Pact states in terms of overall armaments. It is a sad fact of life that, in terms of the numbers of divisions, numbers of tanks, numbers of guns, numbers of aircraft, numbers of armoured personnel carriers of a very sophisticated kind that have been designed so that soldiers can fight from within the carrier and have a good deal of protection from different kinds of warfare, the Warsaw Pact countries are basically and substantially ahead of the NATO powers. For a long while that has meant that the basic defence of Western Europe rests either upon the nuclear deterrent or upon the willingness of Western European parties within NATO to use tactical nuclear weapons. If it rested on conventional weapons alone, it is probable that Western Europe could not be defended for more than a few days.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Egypt is the largest single trading partner that Australia has in the Middle East. Last year we exported over $400m worth of products to that country. This growing trade has been due largely to the policies of the late President Sadat after he managed to bring about peace with Israel in 1973. The opening of the Suez Canal has brought Egypt in considerable revenue. There has been exploration for oil and oil is now being exported from Egypt. Manufacturing industry has increased considerably and Egypt is exporting many products. Indeed, two million to three million Egyptians working around the Middle East are now repatriating funds to Egypt. So its external financial position is strong and it is expanding its trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is terribly important to recognise that the key to the stability of Egypt is a continuation of those policies laid down by President Sadat. Indeed, I believe a stable Egypt is very important to the whole of our trade with the Middle East region. Should there be a threat to the political or economic stability of Egypt, then I believe the whole area could be jeopardised. It is important for a person like the new President, President Mubarak, to continue, and be able to demonstrate his ability to do so, to follow through with the policies that were laid down by President Sadat-not only his economic policies but also his peace accord with Israel. Should there be any uncertainty in Egypt not only would trade be jeopardised but there would be a real possibility of a threat to the whole peace of the region. It is in the interests of Australia and the whole world that Egypt's stability be maintained. We wish President Mubarak all the best in the enormous job that he has of progressing his people.</PARA>

If the proprietors of the Geraldton meatworks close down their meatworks it is not because of any requirement for meat inspectors at Katanning.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has always maintained that Australia can hope to see substantial and steady increases in employment only by the adoption of economic policies which encourage industry and commerce to invest in those areas which generate large numbers of job opportunities. Indeed, there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that those policies are working. Just how successful those policies have been can be seen from the current employment figures. The Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force statistics, released today, show that employment has grown in Australia by some 140,800, or 2.2 per cent, over the 12 months to September 1981. That is a very good performance indeed. It is so good that in the month of September alone, total employment grew by 109,800. That increase occurred in one month. It is a very good increase indeed. I suppose that I can best illustrate on that evidence just what a successful performance it is by saying to the House that during the 12 months from August 1980 to August 1981 the net increase in total employment was 109,600, whereas in the month of September alone we saw a growth of 109,800 jobs. Of those 109,800 jobs, 100,000 are full time jobs and some 9,000 are part time jobs. So the year on year growth in employment has increased since August from 109,600 to 140,800.

It is true that the extent that public sector utilities are prevented from replacing internally generated revenue from increased charges by larger borrowings has an impact on their charging policies. The point that has to be made is that the approach the Federal Government took at successive Loan Council meetings this year was designed to reduce the overall demand for funds in Australia from all forms of public authorities. We make no apology for having done that. It was done because we believed there was an overall requirement to ease pressure on interest rates and, to the extent that it was necessary for State utilities and semi-government utilities to carry their share of the burden of reduced loan raisings, that was only fair and proper.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Australian Financial Review of even date in an article entitled 'Sea, air defences get spending priority' Mr Peter Robinson, who is normally quite perspicacious in what he writes, displays a lamentable slump in his usual standards. Amongst other things he said this of me:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . spent most of his reply to Mr Killen's statement supporting the rival contenders for the tactical fighter order-the General Dynamics F16 and the Panavia Tornado. </PARA>
<PARA> He appeared surprisingly committed to the F16 which he claimed was much cheaper than the F/A18 and much better suited to Australia's requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The F16, he claimed, would cost only around $1,500 million compared with the $2,400 million of the F/A18. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case, the ultimate cost of the F/A18 would be closer to $3,300 million. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on later-and I do take offence at this-to say:</PARA>
<PARA> But most of the figures and 'facts' quoted by Mr Hayden were familiar to any journalist covering the fighter issue as material issued by General Dynamics. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not true. I find that offensive. First, I did not give a surprising commitment to the F16 or, indeed, any aircraft. At page 2205 of yesterday's Hansard I said:</PARA>
<PARA> It may well be, in the light of all the analysis that the Government has carried out, that for all that the F18 is a preferable buy, but on the basis of what the Minister said in this House today, he has not established that case. </PARA>
<PARA>I put that to one side and come to the more substantial irritant which is the allegation that my so-called figures and facts were obtained from handouts by General Dynamics. That surprises me coming from Mr Peter Robinson with the claims, if not pretensions, he lays to being a defence expert. I said in my speech that the costing bases were selected acquisition reports which are United States Department of Defence publications. I refer him and anyone else who is interested to the United States Department of Defence selected acquisition report of 31 December 1980 issued on 20 February 1981 in which there is a detailed disposition of costing factors and numbers of aircraft planned for the United States Navy and Marine Corps. I shall not go into that to save time. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw Mr Robinson's attention to the Defence Marketing Service Market Intelligence Report of April 1981 which, for the fiscal year 1982, points out that the United States Navy official estimate of the project cost for the F18 is $US31.9m. If one allows only 10 per cent inflation which seems quite generous, one arrives at a unit cost in 1984 delivery terms of about $30.5m. If we add 50 per cent for the spares and other ancillary items that must be associated with deliveries to get an all-up cost and multiply it by 75 we get $3.3 billion. In fact, we get a little more, but that is the figure I quoted. The sources are reliable official reports, not handouts. </PARA>
<PARA> The source for the F16 was the selected acquisition report of the same date as the one I just quoted. It provides details of a total program cost and so on. The DMS report of January 1981 provides other relevant data. One arrives at a unit cost of $US15.7m for the F16. If one adds 50 per cent for spares and multiplies by 75 which is a conversion factor, because the amounts are expressed in United States dollars, we arrive at a figure of about $A1.5 billion. If we add for inflation over the next couple of years above that stipulated year to the date of delivery we still arrive at a figure of $1.8 billion or about half of the actual cost we will be meeting for the F10. I have quoted the source for the Tornado costing. It came from a telex which was sent to my office by Panavia. I draw the attention of the House to a publication 'Air International' of August 1980 in which it is stated that the Egyptian Air Force acquired 40 F16s at a total cost of $US961m; that is, about $20m each all up. If we multiply that by 75 we get a toal cost of $1,500m. I refer back to the statement by Mr Robinson. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> But most of the figures and 'facts' quoted by Mr Hayden were familiar to any journalist covering the fighter issue as material issued by General Dynamics. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not use that sort of material but, from the way in which Mr Robinson has approvingly quoted handouts from General Dynamics as a source for this information, he is quite obviously restricted to such sources for his information. I suggest to him and to others that there are more reliable official sources. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the House to the constitutional question this Message involves. The Message purports to repeat the requests for amendments contained in Message No. 160, which the House rejected on 14 October. The right of the Senate to repeat and thereby press or insist on a request for an amendment has never been accepted by the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On several previous occasions when a request was pressed on the House by repetition the House had regard to the claim that the public welfare required passage of the legislation which was the subject of the pressed request and gave the pressed request the House's consideration notwithstanding that the House resolved to refrain from determining its constitutional rights. The House so informed the Senate of the terms of its resolution in its Message to the Senate in reply. It is not certain whether the Senate's right to press a request by repetition is justiciable in the courts. However, it is a matter of constitutional propriety as between the Houses based on the provisions of sections 53 to 57 of the Constitution. Strong arguments that the Constitution does not give the Senate the right to press a request were advanced by Quick and Garran, who were intimately involved in the development of the Constitution. Their views may be found on pages 671-2 of their classic analysis of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1943, some 40 years later, the question was examined by four eminent constitutional lawyers, Garran, Knowles, Bailey and Castieau, who, after considering other learned opinion, summed up the question in the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> In our opinion, the Constitution in denying the right of amendment and conferring the right of request intended a substantial difference. In this we respectfully agree with the views expressed by Sir Harrison Moore, Sir Isaac Isaacs, and Sir John Latham. We think it clear that the Constitution did not intend to stultify itself by giving back in one clause what it had taken away in another. The essence of the difference between request and amendment is that in the case of a request the right of decision as to the form of the Bill rests solely with the House of Representatives. To press a request is to insist upon it-which is a contradiction in terms, and also in our opinion unconstitutional.</PARA>
<PARA>Other more recent legal opinion has been of a similar view, including that of Professor J. E. Richardson, Professor Geoffrey Sawer and Professor Dennis Pearce. I respectfully agree with these opinions. It rests with the House whether it will consider Message No. 185 insofar as it purports to press the requests that were contained in Message No. 160.</PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That this House endorses the statement of Mr Speaker in relation to the constitutional questions raised by Message No. 185 transmitted from the Senate in relation to the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos. 1A to 9A) 1981;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) That this House declines to consider Message No. 185 insofar as it purports to press the requests that were contained in Message No. 160 from the Senate; and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, what you have said in regard to the Message indicates the legal position to the extent that you relied on opinions given over a period. It comes to the major issue still raging in this nation of ours, namely, what are the rights of the Senate as against the rights of the House of Representatives. Of course, we were the victims of that type of issue in 1975 when the present Government, then in opposition, made it very clear that it felt the Senate had the right to dictate whether the then Labor Government should remain in government. It is rather significant that the chickens are coming home to roost now in that the Senate is saying to the Government that it is not going to get a particular measure passed. Of course, there is a substantial difference between the two matters. We were threatened with extinction because we could not get the Supply Bills through, but these Bills relate to something altogether different. They are taxing Bills. Mr Speaker, you made the point that the opinion you quoted says that any pressing of a request by the Senate is unconstitutional. I do not know whether that is still the position. If one looks at the opinion of Professor Richardson, which you also support, Mr Speaker, he does not make the distinction that it is unconstitutional, but he states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In the opinion of the writer, to press a request sets in train a course of events leading to the establishment of a deadlock under section 57. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, can set in train the double dissolution procedures. Mr Speaker, you are quite right in saying that matters relating to section 53 are not justiciable, and there is authority for that point in Osborne v. the Commonwealth, decided as far back as 1911. In other words, the High Court then said that this is a matter that has to be resolved at a political level, not at a judicial level. However, as you are aware, the High Court has now said in the Petroleum and Minerals Authority case that matters relating to section 57 are justiciable. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the message, we now find ourselves in the position that we are arguing the validity of the Senate being entitled to send as many messages as it likes. I take the view that it cannot do that, because otherwise we just would not get anywhere. The point I made when the matter was last before the Parliament was this: How long will we have this charade of continually debating the one message from the Senate? Will the Government indicate its strategies and what it proposes to do? I would have thought it could have said on that occasion that if the Senate continued to press its request it would regard the Bill as having failed to pass and would submit another Bill in three months time. That would mean that the Government could then go to the people on a double dissolution. In fact, we invite it to do that. I think that is the only thing it can do. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear beyond any legal doubt that last night's message by the Senate is a failure to pass the Bill. I make the point that I am of the opinion-it is a personal view but I think it can be substantiated-that the pressing of the request last evening by the Senate certainly amounts to a failure to pass. So in three months from last evening, namely, 20 January next, the Government will be in a position to re-introduce this measure. If it is again not passed there can be a double dissolution. Following that election, it is then a matter of what government is elected. I just make the point that of course we have opposed the measure. As my colleague the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has said, we do not approve at all of the measure. We are now discussing your message as to the legal position. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not accept the view that the Senate can continue to press messages. We do not accept the view that the Senate has any superior power. In fact, we take the view that it has an inferior power. As I have said, the history of the 1975 debacle has clearly indicated to people in the Senate that they can do what they like with the House of Representatives, particularly in respect of matters relating to appropriation or taxation. Let me make this very clear and re-assess the situation. Section 53 states that the Senate cannot pass any amendments to money Bills. In respect of appropriation or taxation matters, it would be quite ridiculous and quite illogical to suggest that because it cannot pass an amendment it can continue to send messages which have a more devastating effect, that is tantamount to a complete rejection of the Bill. There has always been an argument as to whether the power of the Senate entitles it to reject these measures. In my view, it does not. Others have the view, of course, that it has that power. In the constitutional debates it was said that if the Senate were to have the same power as this House in financial matters then we would be heading for financial chaos. That is the position. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time that this whole matter was resolved in constitutional terms. It is important that the Government clearly give a lead to the people of this nation and say that it wants a constitutional amendment which states that in matters of this type the view of the Government-that is, the view of the House of Representatives-will prevail, and that the Senate has no power to reject Supply, nor does it have any power to terminate the life of a government through a message. Here we are in the extraordinary situation of having received a second message from the Senate on sales tax legislation. I understand that on 11 previous occasions the Senate has pressed its request. After that the House has given up and nobody has bothered to pursue the matter any further. I agree that in the present case there is not much point in sending another message back to the Senate. But what I would like noted is a view that the Government should abandon this legislation altogether. It is regressive legislation. The Government has no mandate for it. The Opposition will continue to oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I support what you have said about the legal position following receipt of the message. I just draw a distinction between the opinion given by those people you have mentioned and that given by Professor Richardson, whose opinion would be that 'The wheels are now set in motion for a double dissolution'. I agree with that. I think the only solution for the Government-I am not offering this as a solution; we oppose the legislation-would be to reintroduce the measure following 20 January next year and then, if it is returned by the Senate again, let it become the grounds for a double dissolution. But the motion before us states:</PARA>
<PARA> That the consideration of further action . . . be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting. </PARA>
<PARA>If I am correct in reading into that statement that the Government does not intend to do anything more about the matter I am delighted, because that would be the end of the Bills. But we are still left with the matter which has been raised and to which you, Mr Speaker, addressed your mind-that the Government has a duty to do something about altering the Constitution. We just cannot go on year after year with the Senate dictating what terms it thinks should apply to the House of Representatives, particularly if those terms affect appropriation and taxation measures. Such a situation does not lead to stability in government. It does nothing for a fixed term for this House. Technically, we can be forced to an election every six months, if the Senate decides to reject the Supply Bills or in any way affect the financial arrangements that a properly elected government with a due mandate is entitled to press for. Mr Speaker, we support you in the matters you have raised, but if the Government wishes to continue with this legislation, of course, we will not support it. </PARA>

As recently as this morning, Senator Mason, the Acting Leader of the Australian Democrats in another place, indicated very clearly what he had said on an earlier occasion, namely, that if at the end of the period of three months the Government continued to believe-as the Government will-these measures should be pressed because these Bills remain and will be integral to the 1981-82 Budget, then the Democrats in another place would not vote to delay the legislation either directly or by effect. The words that Senator Mason used on the radio program AM this morning were to the following effect:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No, we will not be blocking them then for reasons which we have stated time and time again, that the Democrats have said we will not precipitate a re-run of November 1975. </PARA>

I am not in the position-the Government will be in a position next week-to indicate with more precision the exact time of presentation of Bills to the same effect after the three months period. The Government will also be in a position at that time to give an indication of the precise date of operation of the sales tax legislation. Let me simply repeat what I would have said in response to the question that the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) tendered to me this morning. The Government has no intention whatever of abandoning this sales tax legislation. It has been totally and utterly misrepresented since it was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make it quite plain to the Opposition and to the Australian Democrats that I will welcome the opportunity over the next three months to argue the case for a more sensible taxation system in this country, to argue the case for a broadening of the taxation base and to put at rest so much of the dishonest misrepresentation of the effect of all these sales tax measures-to point out to the Australian community, for example, that indirect taxation in this Budget will rise to a lesser extent than indirect taxation rose in last year's Budget, and that by a broadening of the taxation base the capacity and scope for future relief in the personal taxation area is thereby increased. Those who will be arguing for the Government to alter its mind about this legislation will be arguing against that approach. I repeat that the Government has no intention whatever of abandoning this legislation. It will be presented after the expiry of three months and we are confident that it will pass through both Houses of Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition accepts the proposition that it is no longer a matter of a message being sent from the Senate to this House of the Parliament. There is ample legal opinion-that of Garran, Sir Harrison Moore, Sir Isaac Isaacs, Sir John Latham, and, of course more latterly Professor Richardson, the current Professor of Law at the Australian National University-that makes it clear that there is only one occasion on which a message can be sent to this House from the Senate. If that practice persists on second and subsequent occasions it ceases to be a matter of conveying a message to this House. It then becomes a matter of the two Houses of this Parliament being in conflict, there being a deadlock. We now have in place the first step towards the circumstances which in three months time will allow the Government to take subsequent action leading to a double dissolution. I will come back to that. I wish to make a couple of other points first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It must not be misunderstood on the part of any observer that the attitude which the Opposition is expressing now is in some way a withdrawal from our staunch and unflinching opposition to the sales tax proposals. That opposition stands firmly in place. We are talking about a constitutional matter. The second matter that we should consider at this point is the very serious defectiveness of the Australian Constitution. It is a Consitution which was fabricated after borrowings from the parliamentary system in Great Britain and, I presume, elsewhere; there was certainly a borrowing from the congressional system in the United States of America and perhaps a quick glance-over of the presidential system in France. The upshot is that in important areas the Constitution is a defective pot-pourri. </PARA>
<PARA> The sort of conflict that we see now is something that one anticipates will occur fairly frequently in the future. We should not be lulled into the false sense of conservative satisfaction that, things presumably having been so predictable in that long, grey and enervating twilight presided over by the late Sir Robert Menzies, they will continue in that manner. That period was an aberration. I suggest that we in this House should be addressing ourselves to how we can repair the Constitution. It is inappropriate to have two Houses in one Parliament with equal authority, especially when one House has, I suggest because of the electoral system, less immediate sensitivity to the feeling of the electorate and, I suggest on the record of this Parliament, certainly when the conservatives are in charge of the Senate, a reckless disregard for the proprieties and conventions which have been practised in the past. I find it arrant humbug that the statement presented to us today talks about-I am sorry, Mr Speaker, it is your statement. I withdraw that. I know my place and do not intend to rise above my station. I apologise. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say that I think it inappropriate to talk about the matter now being one of 'constitutional propriety as between the Houses'. There was no propriety in 1975. As a result of 1975 the rules were changed; and they were changed by force, not by us but by the conservatives. It is nonsense to propose in the wake of that, with such immediacy of its effects before our minds, that there would be two principles-one of self denying ordinances which we impose on ourselves giving immunity to the Government in the Senate in situations like the one prevailing at the moment and another of being prepared to be clobbered when the conservatives have control of the Senate. There must be a consistent set of principles in action to make the democratic system work. The conservatives have shown on their performance as recently as six years ago that they cannot be trusted to follow what are not just convention but also sensible ground rules for the effective and proper functioning of this parliamentary institution. Therefore, the only way of reassuring members of this Parliament-certainly those on the Opposition side-and the great mass of people outside who are concerned about this defectiveness is for a constitutional change to take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have made it clear that in the meantime there are some restraints that we accept in relation to Supply and Appropriation Bills, but I think it completely unreasonable to expect the Opposition to accept any greater restraint than that in the light of its experiences in 1975, knowing full well that that abuse of authority is a power that the Government keeps up its sleeve like a blackjack to use should the occasion ever arise again. Experience shows that in certain situations this country can reach very quickly into very grave instability. What happened in 1975 can pale into insignificance compared with what could arise in a circumstance of grave economic crisis. I do not apprehend that grave economic crisis in the immediate future, but I do share the very large amount of worry of many people throughout the world about the failings in economic management in the United States of America, about the retreat in overall economic performance amongst the industrialised countries of the world and about the evidence of instability arising in a number of aspects, which, in some cases, I suspect, are feeding over into extravagant foreign policy declarations by some people in some parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I merely mention those things in passing. They largely fall into the category of hypothesis rather than being a firm prediction of what might happen but the fact that, hypothetically in certain circumstances, a very serious situation of instability generating a great threat to this country could arise is, in my view, sufficient justification in the mind of any reasonable and concerned person in this Parliament to support a constitutional change. The Senate should not have the authority to reject money Bills. The only way the Government will get that and will get the Opposition to endorse it consistently is to support us in a constitutional change-a referendum. The Senate should not have authority beyond a very limited period to impede the flow of legislation which comes out of this House of Parliament. This House is the seat of government. This is the popularly elected House in our parliamentary institution, and we need to enshrine that in the Senate. It is a matter of opportunism for the conservatives that they are not prepared to take this up at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members with a sense of history-the right honourable member for Lowe (Sir William McMahon), of course, does not have to rely on history; the experience of antiquity is within his own reach and experience in this Parliament-would recall that in the early 1950s the then Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, was confronted with a hostile Senate. He declared publicly that he was contemplating a referendum to change the Constitution so as to limit clearly the power of the Senate. That is what this is all about. Having said that, let me move on quickly to the role of the Australian Democrats in this matter. A game of bluff was supposed to have been going on between the Government and the Democrats. Who would lose his nerve first? Who would collapse? It was never in doubt. On AM this morning Senator Mason declared:</PARA>
<PARA> No, we will not be blocking them then for reasons which we have stated time and time again . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats have stated every sort of reason time and again. Last Wednesday in this place, in a similar debate when the message from the Senate on this matter first came back to us, I referred to what Senator Mason said when speaking for the Democrats in the Senate on 16 September. Speaking of the Government in relation to the Sales Tax Bills he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We will not condone its failure to remove the sales taxes on necessities and we will continue our campaign against them for as long as is necessary, certainly up until the next election whenever that might be. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Mason does not know how the election calendar works. He thought that the next election was three months away instead of three years away. The Democrats will give in in January. All they ever intended to do was thrash the Government with a feather from a dodo. That seems appropriate for that party. The Democrats' nerve went first. There was no need for their nerve to go. Only a fool would contemplate for more than a couple of seconds that the Government would ever want to force a double dissolution and go to the people seeking a popular mandate on the great principle that it was not prepared to face up to in the last election-to increase substantially indirect taxes. Let the Government go to the people and tell them it intends to increase indirect taxes for the average Australian household by $5 a week. Of course it will not do that. It was not prepared to do it in the course of the last election campaign. When it got caught out in the by-elections on the Gold Coast, in South Australia, and in Western Australia it said that it would never consider for a moment introducing a broadly based indirect tax unless it substantially cut income tax. Again, a firm pledge was dishonoured as airily as one could imagine. Bill Sikes would be proud of the Treasurer (Mr Howard). </PARA>
<PARA> The sales tax increases are nasty and regressive. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), our spokesman on economic matters, pointed out in this House on 14 October how the incidence of indirect taxes falls on income groups in this community. According to a table he presented, it is most severe on the moderate income earners and the poor people. It is least severe on the wealthiest groups in the community, the people who form the Government's electoral constituency. The source of this information is a paper by Neil A. Warren entitled 'Australian Tax Incidence 1975-76-Some Preliminary Results'. I recommend that speech by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read some of them. I have read nearly as many as those of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), but the Prime Minister has been here a little longer. I am sure we will catch up. Let me deal with the regressiveness of the incidence of this taxation. There has been a 30 per cent real increase in indirect taxes since the Fraser Government came into office nearly six years ago. In the same period there has been a real increase in average household earnings of only 5 per cent. This means that in real terms the indirect income tax bite has increased more rapidly than the rate of increase in income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me put that into some comparative form. Taking as an example someone earning a medium income of about 85 per cent of average weekly earnings, a quite modest income, for every $5 of income increase in the last five years there has been a $2.70 real increase in Federal indirect taxes. For someone earning twice the average weekly earnings-the sorts of people who litter the leather chairs and cushions in the corner of the Melbourne Club, advising the Government on what to do to bring about a more equitable society and for whom incentive pumps up profits at the expense of the poor and less well-off-for every $5 increase in income in real terms there has been a $1.90 real increase in Federal indirect taxes. How does the Treasurer justify that? How does he square that with any notion of equity and social responsibility? The indirect tax rate increased by $2.70 in real terms for people earning modest incomes of 85 per cent of average weekly earnings. It went up by only $1.90 for people earning twice the average weekly earnings. That is the sort of issue we are talking about which the Democrats ought to be prepared to stand firmly behind. They have expressed themselves staunchly, out of concern for the impact of these iniquituous regressive taxes. This morning Senator Mason said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . these new sales taxes on the necessities of life are a distastrous mistake, an electoral mistake, a mistake for the people of Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with all those things, and it is a mistake for the Democrats to back out now. There is not much point in their making timid attacks and then fearful retreats. If that is the way they operate in Parliament in the course of this parliamentary term, the public will be poorly served. The Democrats can quite safely confront the Government on this issue, defeat, with the support of the Australian Labor Party, the sales tax proposals, and people will be better off. Those disastrous imposts of which Senator Mason talks can be removed from the life of the average citizen in this community. The Democrats still have a chance to stand up and be counted because the conservatives are not foolish enough, no matter how foolish some may want to argue they can be, to want to fight an election on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise the question of the way in which this matter is being dealt with. In doing so, Mr Speaker, I draw attention to the second paragraph of your statement, about the way in which the House has previously dealt with these matters. In the second paragraph of the statement you said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On several previous occasions when a request was pressed on the House by repetition the House had regard to the claim that the public welfare required passage of the legislation which was the subject of the pressed request and gave the pressed request the House's consideration notwithstanding that the House resolved to refrain from determining its constitutional rights. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me, firstly, that we are not giving consideration to the public welfare in relation to the pressed message. That avenue seems to be being cut off. Secondly, I am extremely unhappy, not knowing before we came into the House how this matter would be dealt with, that it is no longer a resolution of the House but an endorsement of the history of the constitutional standing of this House in its relationship to the Senate in regard to a pressed message. Mr Speaker, the Government has now moved that we should endorse your statement about what we should do. That means that in three or four years time, if the same thing happens, people will look back and say: 'The House of Representatives in October 1981 merely endorsed what the Speaker had to say'. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure has never been tested in relation to the rights of the Senate. It has been a view of the House of Representatives, and a view of many of the constitutional lawyers of this country, that the Senate does not have that right. But it was the view of many constitutional lawyers and of most people who have served in the House of Representatives since Federation that what took place in 1975 could not take place. I hope that we will get an opportunity to consider this matter before a vote is taken. I am very unhappy that the Government should ask us merely to endorse your statement as being an action taken by the House of Representatives and decline to consider the message. Previously the House of Representatives, according to your statement, has considered the public welfare message of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the public welfare message? It has been outlined by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). The Treasurer (Mr Howard) presents a view that we are misrep- resenting what he is trying to do. How on earth could we misrepresent what the Government is trying to do? It is raising another $330m in a full year from increasing sales tax. It is as simple as that. It is as plain as black and white. The Australian taxpayers will have to pay $330m in a full year as from January next year that they did not have to pay before the Budget was introduced in August this year. No one can misrepresent that. That is what the Australian Democrats, the Australian Labor Party and the Independent senator, Senator Harradine, are being asked to vote on. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I agree with the Leader of the Opposition entirely-the Senate could throw the whole legislation out and this Government would not go to an election. It would not dare go to an election on this issue. The Senate ought to throw it out. In consideration of what the Senate has asked us to do there ought now to be a full scale debate in this House again on the ramifications of the sales tax. Many more people in Australia now understand the burden that will be carried by the people of Australia once these sales taxes start applying. It might be all right for the Democrats to pick out three or four things that they think might be popular but once these taxes start being applied on a multiplicity of goods the living standards of Australian people will be affected. It will not be just the sales tax; it will be the sales tax on top of a 22 per cent increase in pay-as-you-earn taxes that will be paid by wage and salary earners in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to do what the House of Representatives has done in the past-there ought to be a discussion on this matter. It is not a question of recognising the number of times on which the message may come back. I do not believe it is in the best interests of the Parliament or of the Constitution and specifically the best interests of the House of Representatives merely and glibly to fall into line especially when there is a bloke like the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) in the Government. One would not want to trust him too far with the tactics that will be adopted in the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister had better start wearing gloves. He will be caught with his fingerprints one of these days. This is all that the Senate is asking us to do. Labor Party representatives in the Parliament are always expected to say: 'We will abide by what is right, by what the Constitution appears to say'. The constititional lawyers have told us that the facts are as the Speaker has outlined them. I am not critical of your outlining this, Mr Speaker. I am critical that the next step on top of your outlining this-I do not know whether you have asked for it-is for the Leader of the House to move in to say: 'We will end all this. We will just endorse what the Speaker has had to tell us'. That does not seem to be the correct next move as far as we are concerned. We on this side of the House are justifiably entitled to have some very deep suspicions about the way in which this Government is trying to manipulate and interpret for its own benefits what the Constitution has to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all knew what happened in 1975-it should never have been allowed to happen-would be repeated, that once again the Australian people would be looking in the near future at the sort of political turmoil that they lived through in 1975. This will happen because the Government has demonstrated the way in which the Senate may be used. There were many constitutional views and opinions that the Senate could never do what it did in 1975. But we did not hear the conservatives in the House of Representatives in 1975 saying to the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the then Leader of the Opposition: 'Let us not proceed. The Senate has to pass the Budget'. The Government members are up on their high horses about $330m worth of sales tax legislation. They say what a terrible thing it is that the Senate is doing, but they blocked the whole Budget in 1975. How would it be if every government in the House of Representatives for the next 100 years were to face a hostile Senate on the constitutional interpretation given to it by the conservatives of 1975? We could not govern this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a precedent for this case. The precedent is outlined in the second paragraph of the explanation given by the Speaker. We should discuss the ramifications for public welfare contained in the message. What are the ramifications contained specifically in the message? All the Australian families who have children going to school will have to pay more to clothe them in 1982 not just as a result of the increased costs of clothing and labour but as a result of the increase in sales tax which has been imposed by this Government right across the board-on books, building materials, school clothing and shoes. The Government has not missed anything that affects the average wage and salary earner in this country. That is why the House of Representatives ought to put aside time to discuss these matters. That is why the Democrats should understand more clearly the debate on the sales tax. That is why, instead of playing around with it and sending messages to the House of Representatives, they ought to do what they originally intended to do and that is to vote with the Labor Party and with Senator Harradine to throw the whole thing out. There is absolutely no way that this Government will call an election. We understand that as well as Government members do. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this motion requires a great deal more consideration than has been given to it this afternoon. I do not believe it is in the best interests of the House of Representatives merely to endorse your statement, Mr Speaker. The ramifications of doing that and the way in which this may be looked on in the years to come will not serve the House of Representatives in the way that it ought to be served. We ought to discuss the public welfare ramifications of the pressed request from the Senate and then we should formulate our own resolution from the floor of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The announcement by ICI Australia Ltd yesterday that it is not going ahead with its $500m Geelong investment is a tragedy not only for that region and for Victoria but also for the whole of this country. But from a reading of this morning's newspapers it is not the only bad news that we have to withstand. All who are dedicated to creating new jobs, as we in the Australian Labor Party are, will feel the tragic and disastrous effects of the announcements in today's newspapers. They are almost as bad, if not as bad, as the announcement by ICI. In these newspapers today we read that plans for a $100m titanium processing plant appear certain to be shelved. Further, there are likely to be revisions of the Altona petrochemical company's expansion plans. Hundreds of millions of dollars of investment will be lost because the ICI plant at Point Wilson was going to be a potential customer of Altona. It is well known that the Alcoa Portland investment is under grave threat. The list of closures of enterprises and failures of possibilities to materialise is a tragically long one. I do not have the time to give more detail on this today because my task must be to highlight the root causes of these grave disappointments and to seek by persuasion to bring about changes which will prevent recurrences of these losses of investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minster for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) in Question Time today may have said that I am not one of his main advisors. Of course, I am ever hopeful that he will come to his senses and accept the sort of advice that we on this side of the House are putting to him. While he and the Government pursue the present economic policies we will have more closures, further lack of investment and more announcements such as that made by ICI yesterday. I need go, as I said, no further than the list that I have given to show that this is so. </PARA>
<PARA> I want now to move on to the root causes of these problems. Firstly, inflation is raging in Australia right now due to the inept policies of the Fraser Government. We are becoming less competitive at a time when, to create the 2 1/2 million new jobs we need in this decade, in the 1980s, we have to become more competitive. I will return to that point a little later. Secondly, there has been the appreciation-the upvaluation-of the Australian dollar. It has risen by 12 per cent since 1979 and 8 per cent in the last 12 months. This is making worse our lack of competitiveness. This would not be happening if our national Government were properly controlling capital inflows into this country at the present time. These root causes of the problems, incidentally, have been given by ICI in its statement. The third root cause is that there are grave uncertainties emanating from this Government right now which are, indeed, leading to the killing off of manufacturing industry today and eliminating all those service industries and service jobs in the tertiary sector which are tied to manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with these points in a little more detail. The first point I want to deal with is the disastrous return to double digit inflation. According to the Budget Papers, our inflation rate is likely to be 10.75 per cent this financial year compared with an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of 9.5 per cent. I am glad to see that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is going to take part in this debate today after all. I welcome him to this chamber and to this debate. It is the first time that we have managed to entice him in here for, I think, years. It is no good his seeking, as he did in Question Time today, to lay the blame for these problems on the workers of this country. Total economic mismanagement of this country by him and his partners in this venture called the national Government has caused the increase in inflation. If he wants more co-operation from workers in relation to the 35-hour week or, indeed, in relation to wage restraint he ought to give to the workers of this country a total economic package which is acceptable to them. This prospect of increasing inflation destroys any remaining vestige of credibility that the 'fight inflation first' strategy that he has been pursuing ever had. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet it seems the Government wants merely to repeat a dose of this philosophy in its sixth year of office. That is what it is doing in this Budget that we are still debating in this Parliament. To fight inflation first, under this Government, means to fight inflation forever, using the same tactics of keeping a lid on the economy, which tactics, of course, are leading to such announcements as we heard yesterday from ICI. ICI, Geelong and the rest of us are the sufferers from the renewed lid on the economy, the stringent monetary and budgetary policies which are being pursued. The tragedy of this approach is that it has effectiveness only when there is no significant growth in the economy. Indeed it essentially controls inflation by putting a halt to growth. The Government has no anti-inflation policy for a growth economy and so, having reached only 2.9 per cent real growth as it did in the last financial year, it has had to slam on the brakes with razor gang cuts, reduced Loan Council programs, higher sales and income taxes-in the previous debate we were discussing the sales tax aspects-and the Government's very tight monetary policies. Is there any denying that these are some of the root causes of the high costs, incompetent management and the uncompetitiveness which ICI referred to in its statement when it announced tragically that it will not go ahead with that investment at least for some time. It is against this background that necessary developments and industry policies must be assessed. My Labor colleagues and I believe that we should be moving in the opposite policy direction to that now being taken by this Fraser Government. Instead of yet another bout of restrictive macro-economic policy we must have a renewed emphasis on longer term industry policies, fight inflation directly by reducing taxes and charges, strike a bargain with the trade union movement and promote a broad base of growth in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the major elements of this alternative strategy? I will go though them quickly. Firstly, we must have some means for containing inflationary pressures under conditions of economic growth. This means that we must have a policy for prices and incomes which should be mutually agreed to by the major sectors of the community. It is this policy which the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Labor Party have been jointly pursuing in recent months. It aims to find social consensus where there is now only contest and to limit claims on the economic system to a non-inflationary level. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a positive approach to these problems of increasing costs in our community instead of the rhetoric of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as displayed in Question Time today. This approach to industrial relations, to prices and to general economic policy must be underpinned by a further policy change towards the introduction of a degree of indicative economic planning. I am sorry that I do not have time in this debate to go into that matter in more detail. But if we had this approach, this closer partnership between government and a company such as ICI, if we had this prices and incomes policy, if we had the indicative planning approach, we would not have had the announcement such as we had yesterday from ICI. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to our currency upvaluing. The Government has reduced the competitiveness of Australian manufacturing industry by allowing the vast capital inflow of the past 12 months to cause an appreciation of the exchange value of the Australian dollar. This, of course, has made imports cheaper and our exports less competitive. That is another reason why ICI has not been able to go along with this investment. Indeed the upvaluation of the dollar has been equivalent in price effect terms to a fall of about 40 per cent in effective levels of tariff assistance for most of our import competing industries. By allowing the capital inflow of over $6,000m to have this effect the Government has effectively caused the manufacturing sector to contract in response to the expansion of the resources sector. The ICI announcement is just another example of this contraction in the manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Capital inflow is, of course, related to the investment phase of the minerals and energy development. But that investment phase is not the only cause of it. There is far too much speculative capital coming into this country, far too much for portfolio investment which does not create jobs in the community. The so-called Gregory thesis which implied that new export industries could displace established industries is proving correct, even at this early stage of the resource-based expansion. We have not had to wait for the increase in exports, which will not be significant until 1983. We are getting this effect because this Government is allowing this capital to flow into Australia unabated. The Labor Party believes that the appreciation of the dollar in these circumstances represents a gross mismanagement of the economy. This mismanagement is damaging our longer term growth prospects and ironically will ultimately mean that Australia will import less from the rest of the world than would otherwise be possible. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to cut tariffs in order to bring imports into this country for the export stage of our resource-based industry expansion, if only we had an expanding economy right now. That greater volume of imports would automatically be coming into this country without any cuts in tariffs, with all the dangers there are in those for manufacturing industry. Not only are ICI and Geelong suffering from this policy but also so is our reputation as a trading nation. The same criticisms could be validly applied to any attempts to effect an across the board reduction in levels of tariff or quota protection. That uncertainty is the third reason given by ICI for its decision. Such a decision is very clearly threatened by the Fraser Government following its reference to the Industries Assistance Commission on ways of reducing general levels of protection for Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well for the Minister to talk glibly as he did yesterday to the National Farmers' Federation about offsetting some of these future tariff cuts with accelerated depreciation. We want the accelerated depreciation to help industry now. Manufacturing industry is suffering right now. New investment is not taking place right now because of the lack of adequate industry policies on the part of this Government. As the report of the Crawford Study Group on Structural Adjustment recommended, such general measures as reducing tariffs are not desirable in circumstances of high unemployment. Our unemployment rate is presently 5.8 per cent and rising. Tariff reductions can only increase this level as alternative job opportunities do not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> This particularly applies to the regions and skilled categories in which our manufacturing sector is presently concentrated. I refer, of course, to Geelong among such regions. I could refer to Adelaide, Albury-Wodonga, Melbourne or many other regions which are heavily dependent on our manufacturing industries. There is little point in restructuring the work force out of some of these industries because they are said to be inefficient when that restructuring would merely mean that people will be restructured into unemployment. Such change rightly creates a strong reaction which will result ultimately in reduced import levels. Thus a decision which superficially may appear to benefit an expansion of trade could in fact lead to a contraction of trade in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> The free trade theorists in Treasury and in the Liberal Party ranks who seem to be having such an influence at present do not appreciate the point I have just made. They seem unable to raise their analysis above the level of simple economic theory to take into account the social and political factors, particularly those relating to the longer term. What is the point of deterring investment in the new jobs in Geelong, other parts of Victoria and everywhere else investment may be contemplated when there is such high unemployment at present? A far more productive approach, indeed the one advocated by the Labor Party, would be to establish mechanisms in Australia to enable a higher overall growth rate to be pursued without an increase in the level of inflation. I have given an indication of how this can be done. The present Government has no such mechanisms. It is presently retreating as fast as it can from even the miserable 2.9 per cent growth rate that we had in the last financial year because even this modest growth is accommodating a renewal of inflationary pressures under the sort of policies it has. Restriction and recession are the Government's only weapons against inflation and the only weapons it is using at the moment against this industry generally. It is no wonder that I repeat that I believe the Government's policies are totally inept. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is ironic that the Australian Labor Party has raised this matter today. It is the party that brought resource exploration and investment to a halt through takeovers and threats of expropriation. It is the party that destroyed domestic and overseas confidence in the resource industry. It is the party that allowed industrial strife to reach new heights, with over six million working days lost in 1974 alone. In office, the Australian Labor Party abolished the investment allowance, drastically curtailed the export incentive scheme, saw the near cessation of mining and oil ventures in Australia, slashed tariffs by 25 per cent overnight and in one year alone caused the loss of some 123,800 jobs in manufacturing industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The litany of Labor's demonstrated inability to manage the Australian economy goes on and on. Its current industry platform demonstrates that it has learnt nothing since 1975. Under a Labor government, Australian industry could expect the termination of the investment allowance, an expansion of the functions of the Foreign Investment Review Board to monitor transnational corporations in Australia, a restriction of overseas investment, the introduction of a resource rent tax and an excess profits tax, the monitoring of technological change, the exemption of unions from the provisions of the Trade Practices Act, support in principle for the introduction of the 35-hour week, the supervision and monitoring of international resource negotiations between mining companies in Australia and overseas buyers and, of course, a commitment to a much larger public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In complete contrast to this, and as a result of the very policies which this matter of public importance proposed by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) seeks to attack, $35 billion worth of major manufacturing and mining projects are either committed or at the final feasibility stage. This does not include the Point Wilson project, which was at the preliminary study stage. The revival of business confidence has been brought about by our policies designed to assist and encourage industry growth. In 1981-82 $524m will be outlaid in direct industry assistance and development. This compares with $181m in the 1975 Hayden Budget. Manufacturing industry has now recovered from its setbacks of the mid-1970s and has embarked on a new growth phase. Factory output, having fallen after 1974, has now improved and surpassed its previous peak. In real terms, manufacturers' sales were up 3.4 per cent in the year. Over the past year manufacturing industry has demonstrated its confidence in Australia and in the policies of this Government by increasing by 44 per cent the value of its investment. Yet the honourable member for Adelaide in this House today had the hide to claim that no more investment is taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> The ICI Australia Ltd Point Wilson project was only one of some 366 projects that are now in the offing, yet the Opposition has worked itself into a frenzy over the shelving of that project. It has taken the suspension of that project out of perspective. As with any such project, the viability of Point Wilson turned on its competitive prospects. I have been assured by the Chairman of ICI that government policy for the manufacturing sector was the least of that company's considerations in postponing the project. The reasons for the postponement are far more fundamental than those offered by the Opposition. They concern the capacity of Australian industry to maintain its competitive edge. That is no more quickly destroyed than by unreasonable wage demands, the implementation of a 35-hour week and industrial unrest. On these fundamental issues the Opposition has remained silent or become the spokesman for some sections of the union movement, at the same time jettisoning any sense of responsibility to the Australian people or those employed in the work force. It has jettisoned any responsibility for creating an environment that seeks to sustain the competitive edge of industry in this country. The Opposition demonstrates a total lack of understanding of the Australian industrial scene, blinkered as it is by narrow sectional interests. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is firmly committed to the development of a stronger, more viable and internationally competitive manufacturing sector in the interests of the nation as a whole. We are convinced that the best service government can provide to industry is to set the precondition for sustained economic growth and to minimise its demands on and intrusions into the private sector. The re-establishment of a sensible economic framework has therefore been a prime objective of this Government since our return to office in December 1975. Over this period we have ensured that policies for the manufacturing sector have been developed within the broader framework of policies aimed at restoring growth and stability in the economy as a whole. But we are not in the business of directing the activities of industry or underwriting the success of individual commercial ventures. These are matter for judgment and decision by those who stand to gain or lose in the market-place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been very conscious of the need for a predictable policy framework against which industry can make its investment decisions. This has been a key feature of our approach and the record speaks for itself. As well as inheriting an economic shambles when we re- turned to office in 1975, we found an unco-ordinated and ad hoc attitude to industry development. It was this Government that formulated a comprehensive and soundly based approach to industry policy in the White Paper on manufacturing industry in May 1977 and this was reconfirmed in August 1979 in our response to the report of the study group on structural adjustment. Within this framework we have developed specific measures designed to encourage positively industry activities that are efficient, innovative, internationally competitive and more oriented to export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> I instance just a few of those measures. We have taken decisions to introduce improved depreciation rates for plant and equipment, to extend the application of the investment allowance, to increase government support for industry development and industrial research and development, and to increase support for Australia's small business community. We have acknowledged the role that reductions in protection can play in bringing about improvements in Australia's industry structure. Significant progress has been made in reducing the Australian tariff, at the same time having very careful regard to the capacity of this country to absorb social and economic change. Let there be no mistake: Sudden sharp cuts in assistance, ill-conceived and ill-considered, are not a feature of this Government's approach and we will not repeat the overnight across the board 25 per cent tariff cut of July 1973. That action contributed to a significant loss of business confidence and caused disruption and hardship for many firms and individuals as well as for particular regions. Gradualism and predictability are cornerstones of this Government's approach. There is no doubt that there is certainty about this Government's policy towards industry, certainty about our determination to bring inflation under control, certainty about our capacity to rein back the size of the public sector and certainty about our ability to eliminate Budget deficits. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent references to the Industries Assistance Commission on protection, export incentives and budgetary assistance for industry are no basis for uncertainty about the Government's industry policy. In fact, these references are designed to do the opposite. For example, the outstanding issue of protection will be settled sooner than would otherwise have been the case by the IAC's report being brought forward by 18 months. The reference on budgetary assistance to industry is designed to ensure that the forms of Government assistance are the most cost effective which can be provided. Existing levels of assistance-I emphasise that-will be maintained. They will be provided in what the IAC report and our consequent consideration of it show to be the most cost effective manner. I repeat that ICI's decision to defer the Point Wilson project should be kept in perspective, reflecting as it does conditions in the international chemical industry. The chairman of ICI, Mr Milton Bridgland, said yesterday that there was very little the Government could do to improve the economic attractiveness of the project in the short term. The fact is that the project was subject to a feasibility study which would necessarily examine the prospects of selling the corporation's output a number of years ahead. That study would be bound to be influenced by conditions in the world market and, in particular, by the major structural redevelopments taking place in the world petrochemical industry. This restructuring was sparked off by the oil price increases. It has been accelerated by the present depressed state of the world petrochemical market and the desire by some oil-producing countries to broaden their industrial base through the development of export-oriented petrochemical industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The highly regarded international publication on the chemical industry-I refer to Chemical Insight-recently reported that Saudi Arabia was about to commence the construction of major chemical plants which could produce, as well as other chemicals, about 1.6 million tonnes of ethylene, 335,000 tonnes of caustic soda, and some 810,000 tonnes of polyethylene. Saudi Arabia is not, of course, the only country planning extensive new petrochemical capacities based on cheap gas. It will not even be the largest producer because, by the end of 1980s, Canada and Mexico each may be producing up to 1.9 million tonnes of the ethylene compared to the 1.6 million tonnes produced by Saudi Arabia. ICI's decision reflects the specific circumstances of the chemicals industry. As I have said on a number of occasions, and I repeat it here, resource development projects are neither pre-ordained nor are they guaranteed. They will always be subject to ongoing assessment of market conditions, costs and other factors. ICI's announcement demonstrates the crucial importance of keeping wages and other costs under control so as to maintain the competitive edge of Australian industries. </PARA>
<PARA> If I could reflect on Question Time today, I think it is a matter of concern to all honourable members of this House to read the statement by ICI that the construction of its plant here would entail a 20 per cent cost disability over the construction of a plant in the United States or Europe. Surely that is the problem of the competitive edge we are fending off at present in Australia. Although individual projects may be deferred from time to time, there can be no doubt as to the overall strength of investment in industrial development. </PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that, in the final analysis, Australia will secure supplies of raw materials, and will offer opportunities for major developments in the chemical industry, such as the production of caustic soda for our large and expanding alumina industry. Australian manufacturing industry has now recovered from the setbacks it experienced in the mid-1970s and has embarked on a new growth phase. The environment for industry development is being restored, and this Government will not hesitate to take the necessary steps to reinforce that environment of a growing and competitive Australian manufacturing industry. The Government rejects the motion before the Chair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a tired effort that was, a repetition of Government policy speeches indicating, quite obviously, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) must be ready to resign. Surely such an action would be the most noble he has ever taken-in fact, probably the only one. That tired old worn out policy speech we have heard so often for so long indicates that we have nothing much more than a Rip van Winkle in the Minister, who is obviously not aware of what is going on out there in industry. In the 1981 report of the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association, HEMA points out its disappointment at the Government's failure to adopt positive policies to the development of industry. We did not hear anything about that. Dealing with the Industries Assistance Commission reference on ways of further reducing industry assistance, the report said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The continuing pressure on the manufacturing sector seems not only unreasonable but politically counter productive. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only is the Minister a Rip van Winkle, but it looks as though he is an Alice in Wonderland as well. The report suggests that a lack of positive Government policies and a failure to adopt greater versatility and assistance measures has resulted in uncertainty and insecurity in the manufacturing industry. That is just one example. There are a whole host of these sorts of comments. The Australian Industries Development Association annual report for 1981-not 1975, the year upon which the Minister seems to have a fixation, the year he went to sleep-states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has wrongly assumed that the strength of investment expenditure in the first half of 1981-82 indicated a permanent upturn . . . Australia remains at a serious competitive disadvantage relative to our major overseas competitors and trading partners, and recent budgetary action, flying as it does in the teeth of overseas trends, has been a serious setback to reforms in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for the confidence of industry in this Government. The balance of payments figure for the first three months of 1981-82 indicates a trade deficit of $845m compared with $68m for the same period last year. Let us dismiss the man. In February 1979, amid the usual well-orchestrated brouhaha typical of the lumbering Liberal governments of Victoria and Canberra, ICI announced that it would proceed with the plant at Point Wilson, near Geelong. The complex, which was to have manufactured caustic soda, chlorine, ethylene, et cetera, was to have cost $500m. One of the saleable features of the plant was its assistance to the sagging building industry during the construction phase. The Government, of course, does not accept that there is a sagging building industry. Bearing in mind that the Geelong region, like the adjacent Ballarat region, has an unemployment rate somewhere between 9 and 10 per cent, the lamentable state of the building industry needed this shot in the arm. What has happened, however, is more akin to a shot in the head. </PARA>
<PARA> As we know, ICI yesterday announced that it had deferred the development of the plant at Point Wilson. The reasons given by ICI's chairman, Mr Milton Bridgland, for the decision were attributed to three factors-high costs in Australia, the appreciation of the Australian dollar, and uncertainties about the Federal Government's future support for the manufacturing industry. Our Minister did not mention that. Oh no. It is typical of that man. He avoids the truth and always has done. In passing, it must be said that after considerable agitation from concerned citizens-I give due credit not to the Government but to the industry itself-an area of 100 hectares of the 766 hectares was set aside to be added to the adjacent fauna and flora reserve. This is quite a satisfactory result as the location is one of the few mainland habitats of the rare orange-bellied parrot which nests in Tasmania-God bless it-and migrates to the mainland. No wonder!</PARA>
<PARA> However, the initial plans and expectations of the company and the people of Geelong have now received this major setback. It was expected that construction jobs would have averaged about 700 and would have peaked at 1,000. The company estimated that 700 jobs would have been available on site by 1985. These jobs will no longer be available and the effects will be greater in terms of lost opportunities in job creation in the Geelong area as a result of this lost development. </PARA>
<PARA> Just recently I received a letter from the Geelong Chamber of Commerce and the Geelong branch of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures. These two organisations, representing 500 employers employing 20,000 workers stated that it was essential for the Government to recognise the extent of economic dependence of the Geelong region on manufacturing industry, especially the motor vehicle and component industries. They asked the Government to consider fully the impact of any proposed measures on the economy and the community of Geelong. They asked the Government to consult with the Geelong community on the specific impact on Geelong of any proposed measures. That this consultation has obviously been inadequate can be seen by the decision of ICI. The view of these bodies parallels that of similar groups in my electorate of Ballarat. I do not think that I need to remind the House of the fragile nature of the economy in places such as Ballarat, Maryborough, Kyneton, Daylesford and similar towns that are distant from the metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA> These bodies to which I have just referred have called for the removal of any uncertainty over the future of manufacturing industry which is currently being generated by the Government's various comments. They have stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This includes uncertainty in the motor vehicle industry, truck, tractor and agricultural machinery manufacture and textiles and clothing manufacture. </PARA>
<PARA> These activities must be given a secure future until at least 1990 and the Government must do all within its power to ensure that capital and infra-structure is made available to existing manufacturers at competitive rates to that being directed to natural resource projects. </PARA>
<PARA>To demonstrate that there are signs of a growing coalition of support from non-traditional sources, Mr Bernie D'Arcy, Secretary of the Geelong Trades Hall Council, recently stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Not only should the IAC recommendations be rejected but the Governments, both State and Federal, have a moral obligation to honour their election promises--</PARA>
<PARA>We will have a moment's silence so that we can reflect upon that-</PARA>
<PARA>on decentralization, and offer genuine incentives to labour intensive industries to establish in Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to defer construction at Point Wilson comes at a time when Alcoa is still putting pressure on the Victorian Government to give it more favourable State Electricity Commission power rates. The hapless and inept Victorian Government, under its accident prone and confused Premier, Lindsay Thompson, lurches from crisis to crisis, as we know. There appears to be no solution to that State's immediate problems other than to replace the tired, fractured and worn out rump of Government there with a dynamic Labor government led by John Cain. I think honourable members would all agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bridgland in his statement mentioned the high cost of labour in this country. This in itself is not the insuperable financial burden which this Government alleges it to be to distract attention from its own misdeeds. The Government should recognise that it has created the conditions in which workers must strive to gain their just slice of the cake. If the pattern appears immutable to the Government it should look closely at the characteristics of the system which its increasingly failing measures aim to shore up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Mildren) cannot so easily dismiss the arguments put by the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch). The shelving of the $500m chemical and petrochemical plant at Point Wilson by ICI Australia Ltd is certainly a matter of importance and worthy of discussion in this place. But the charge that it is as a result of this Government's policies is quite false. As the Minister said, it is ironic and, as I said the other day, it is rather hollow coming from that side of the House which, when last in government, presided over such a massive boost to inflation and costs. Under the Labor Government we saw the cutting of tariffs. In particular, I refer to the across the board tariff cut of July 1973. We saw a halving of the then prevailing export incentives, we saw the removal of the investment allowance; and, over most of the period, we saw a significant upvaluation in the Australian dollar. All of this led to a disastrous fall in the Australian manufacturing industry and the emergence of very high levels of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In point of fact, the ICI project to which we are now referring has been shelved for some very important, powerful and fundamental reasons. As Ian Perkins, the Financial Editor of the Australian newspaper wrote today, it was always a razor's edge proposition. Its competitive prospect was marginal. As the Minister said, it was not included by the Department last June in the list of development projects in the committed or final feasibility stage. Such projects in Victoria totalled some $3.5 billion. In fact, as I said, the ICI project has been shelved for some very powerful reasons. The first reason, and the first mentioned by Mr Bridgland, the Managing Director of ICI, is the high and mounting cost structure in Australia. There is an alarming prospect for accelerating costs, associated with claims now being made for large wage increases in the wake of the abandonment of wage indexation, associated with the push to the 35-hour week and associated with the prospect of a national wage decision next February. I say in passing that if at the next wage hearing a significant general increase is proposed there must be a way of offsetting against it these increases now being won. If not, there will be the prospect of the abandonment of not only this rather marginal project, but other development projects in Australia which would have created widespread employment opportunities. It was envisaged that this project in its construction phase would provide in the order of 1,000 jobs and, thereafter, 200 jobs for management and production employees. In general it needs to be appreciated that it is such projects, albeit not of this marginal character but more soundly based projects, which provide the continuing thrust to economic growth and more jobs in the economy over the coming years. It is critical that the basic condition, the containment of increasing costs, be achieved. In that context I can only urge that those unionists in employment should have regard to the effect of excessive demands on the prospects for the employment of others. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the first cause of the shelving of this project. The second cause was the appreciation, the upvaluation, of the Australian dollar up to a month or so ago, a matter which I will come back to. Thirdly, there were undoubtedly increased financing costs because of the current higher interest rates as compared with those prevailing when the project was first mooted. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, and doubtless most importantly, are the conditions of demand and capacity in the chemical industry not only in Australia but also world wide, in the international chemical industry. There is on the one hand the circumstance that capacity is being greatly expanded overseas, as the Minister set out, and creating circumstances in which there can be quite fierce import competition in other markets. At the same time the demand growth for polyvinyl chloride in particular-a principal output of the proposed plant-has significantly declined in this country. In the early 1970s demand growth was of the order of 18 per cent per annum. By 1975, following the increase in oil prices, it had fallen to the order of 12 per cent per annum. Following the further increase in oil prices in 1979 it has fallen to the order of 5 per cent per annum. In all these circumstances, as the Minister put it, the competitive prospects for the proposed plant were marginal indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the question of the exchange rate. There is no doubt that the order of appreciation of just short of 10 per cent over the past 12 months until a month or so ago is of great significance to an industry such as the chemical industry which is subject to significant import competition. It would be correct to say, as the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) said, that this could amount to an erosion of the order of 40 per cent of the nominal protection afforded the industry. The point I make in that connection is that the impact of this factor on export and import competing Australian industries has not escaped the Government's attention. The upvaluation of the Australian dollar was stopped and in the last month or so to some extent it has been reversed. Although it is not proper to speculate about the course of the exchange rate, perhaps one can say that it has now been stabilised. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the Government has not been unmindful of the impact of this factor on the export and import competing goods sector but it was judged necessary to respond to the then favourable overall balance of payments situation and the requirements of anti-inflation policy with the upvaluation of the Australian dollar that has taken place until recently. The role of that upvaluation as a restraint on inflation is itself important for industry. As I said, the rate presently has stabilised. It is undoubtedly a factor which the Government will take into account in its response to the Industries Assistance Commission's report on the references that have been sent to it on possible approaches to lower protection and on budgetary assistance to industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only assert that this Government's policy for industry-a wide ranging one covering the general economic environment and hence the Government's overall economic policy, its specific measures of industry policy and its tariffs, subsidy and assistance structure-is one which, contrary to the charge levelled by the Opposition, has been supportive of industry and which has led to a significant expansion in output and production. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Bill and the Television Stations Licence Fees Bill which I will introduce to the House shortly propose to amend the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Act and the Television Licence Fees Act 1964 to vary the basis on which commercial broadcasting and television stations are charged for their use of a limited public resource. Honourable members will be aware that those Acts impose fees in the nature of a royalty charge, thus following the practice common to all governments of ensuring that the public gains some benefit from the commercial utilisation of public resources. The present Acts provide for a lump sum payment on the original grant of a licence and for a lump sum and a percentage of the gross earnings of the station in respect of each year after the grant. The Bills propose an increased fee of $500 on the grant of a licence and tying the annual fee simply to a revised percentage of gross earnings. That percentage varies in relation to increases in gross earnings, subject to specified upper limits. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that Bills to give effect to those measures, which were announced in the Budget, have previously been considered by the House. The present Bills differ from the earlier ones only in imposing an upper limit on the proposed percentage of a station's gross earnings. The reason for their introduction is that while there will be no reduction in the amount of money received as a result of the Bills, there will be a variation in that henceforth the rate of escalation of contribution is to be limited. That limitation is to be applied because each of the stations enjoying a licence will contribute significantly more each year, according to their gross earnings which, of course, are predicted on the extent of the market on which they operate, up to a point where the acceleration in the amount paid rises to a very considerable percentage, and it is not felt justifiable that the fees should forever increase at that percentage rate. The proposed limits are: Five per cent of gross earnings in the case of broadcasting stations and 7.5 per cent of gross earnings in the case of television stations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has examined these measures in the light of representations from the broadcasting and television industry on the effect of the measures, not in the short term but in the long term. It is the long term effect of the measures and the fact that there would continue to be a very marked increase in the amount of fees required to be paid that the Government believes it appropriate that a maximum level be set which will not lead to any reduction in the amount budgeted for in this financial year but will lead to a continued ceiling which will ensure that, while the principles of the measure continue, the percentage required to be paid is not excessive. </PARA>
<PARA> Licence fees are calculated on the basis of gross earnings of stations. Of course, the gross earnings of stations relate very much to the area that the station serves and the area of the licence is a product of the licensing procedures. The area of the licence determines the size of the market and, to a large degree, the gross earnings. It was felt, therefore, that that criterion has a very real relevance to the extent to which an individual station can be called on to pay a higher fee. We are talking about the air waves which are a restricted or limited public resource and, being a restricted or limited public resource, require licensing. The availability of that licensing, of course, should in return both pay for the amount of use and also have some relationship to the extent to which there is a wider or smaller market. Honourable members will be aware that the effects of inflation will inevitably lead to an increase in gross earnings of stations without necessarily a corresponding increase in disposable income. To impose an open ended obligation would steadily increase stations' real expenses. Those expenses will have to be recovered from advertising revenues which will increase the costs to advertisers using medium and larger sized stations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government feels that it is equitable to fix upper limits on the percentages applicable. This allows stations to budget with reasonable assurance and requires that the Government take a positive decision to increase the rate of this taxation, thereby giving the Parliament the opportunity to debate the matter on its merits. The overall level of licence fees and their impact on stations will, however, be kept under review. The Government has decided to re-examine the whole question by 1984 to ensure that the levels of licence fees remain appropriate. The variations will not substantially alter the position of stations in the short term. Stations with gross earnings of less than $2 1/2m will still pay lower fees than under the current provisions and estimated revenue from this source in 1981-82 remains at $31.5m. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is true that over the period to 1984 those stations which are not at the ceiling will be called on to pay an increased amount according to the schedule of fees up to the ceiling now to be imposed. The estimated revenue, the licence fees and the changed scale provide a modification to the present system and this modification now being introduced will benefit approximately 120 of the 130 commercial broadcasting stations and 20 of the 50 commercial television stations. The Government hopes that this will enable stations benefiting by these changes to improve programming and services to the public. It does not believe that these aspects will suffer in the bigger stations. Advertising revenue is the life-blood of commercial broadcasting and television. It is directly related to the audience share of a particular station and obviously this relates to the programming appeal of the station to the general public. No station can, therefore, afford to lower its programming standards. The details of the proposed rates are clearly shown in the Bills. The changes will take effect, as they are in fact a repeat of the earlier legislation, on 1 September 1981. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address my remarks to the estimates of the Attorney-General's Department. I am the spokesman in this House for the shadow Attorney-General. Following a discussion in the Estimates Committee I want to discuss several matters which I think are extremely important. They relate to two cases, the first of which is known as the Greek conspiracy case or the social security conspiracy case. I must say that the word 'conspiracy' is now a misnomer because all the charges relating to conspiracy have been dropped; some charges are proceeding in respect of other matters. I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that these cases have been proceeding for over three years now. At the time we were first alerted to them the Commonwealth police officer concerned-I think he was now retired-announced with a great deal of fanfare that 183 people had been charged and promised that 1,000 more would be charged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the sorry record of what I would say is the Government's crass stupidity in this matter. We must bear in mind that the charges related basically to whether the people concerned were entitled to pensions. It was a question of medical assessment. It would have been far wiser and more beneficial, particularly from the taxpayers' point of view, perhaps to have refused the pension to those concerned on the basis that medical evidence did not support their present entitlement, rather than charge a large number of people with offences and not be able to prove them. Now not one person faces a conspiracy charge. The court hearing the matter in Sydney was told that the conspiracy charges against the original batch of 21 defendants would proceed. But in November 1980, which I think is very significant bearing in mind that there was an election in October 1980, the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) advised the Parliament, through the Senate and after consulting with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), that these charges would be dropped and new charges laid. I think that was a little out of order because the Attorney-General, as the Minister responsible, is surely entitled to make up his own mind. Honourable members will recall that a former Attorney-General resigned on the basis that he was not going to be told what to do by the Prime Minister. But this Attorney-General said, after consulting with the Prime Minister, that these charges would be dropped and new charges laid. </PARA>
<PARA> We have spent, I think, about $7m of taxpayers' money in trying to prove this case. This must go down as a record in Western democracy, to say the least. The case has many disquieting features-illegal phone tapping, improper use of listening devices, lack of ministerial responsibility and misleading of Parliament in answers given by Ministers. If one looks at the answers given in the Committee as to who is being paid we see that $2m has now been spent on fees for counsel for the Commonwealth. I make the point that it is significant to consider the gentlemen who are undertaking that case for the Commonwealth. Prior to the last election I announced that the Opposition would have a good look at the issue on the basis of whether the case should be terminated, because it seemed that it was becoming a playground for enrichment-not on any unjustifiable basis except that of the Government's ineptitude. Having said that, I think one of the counsel took umbrage and thought I was suggesting that he was getting money that he was not entitled to. I withdrew any suggestion of that; I never even made the suggestion. But it was significant that the solicitor who wrote to me on his behalf was the same solicitor who prosecuted Mr Whitlam and others. I make the point that there seems to be some interweaving of the whole problem if one looks at the point I have just made. The sum of $2m was spent on counsel for the Commonwealth and another $1m by way of legal aid was spent on counsel for the unfortunates who were trying to defend themselves. It can all be seen in the estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the estimates supplied to us? At page 481 of Hansard it is stated that costs of $7,000 have been awarded against the Crown in respect of unsuccessful prosecutions. Yet it is on record on 14 November last year that Mr Brown, S.M. awarded costs of $22,000 against the Crown when no evidence was offered against 38 defendants. As the magistrate pointed out at the time, it is a fundamental principle of the British system of justice that such people are presumed innocent. In fact, 110 persons arrested in March and April of 1978 must be presumed innocent. This case is going on, and it is going to cost more. A prosecution witness who was granted both a pardon and an immunity was offered sums of up to $200,000 for evidence which he might give in court. That is unprecedented anywhere. In my view, there has been an infringement of civil liberties and harassment of innocent people. The Opposition has said that the charges are ludicrous. We have seen consistent evasion and ministerial incompetence in an attempt to cover up the real fraud and conspiracy, that is, the maligning of the Greek people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the separate question of a prosecution in Greece under Greek law on charges of fraud against the Australian Government. The Greek Government has been encouraged to lay charges because a fraud has been perpetrated against the Australian Government. It is incredible to think that this could happen and that the charges rely on the same evidence of the police officer concerned. We were told consistently that this action was taken wholly on the initiative of the Greek authorities, yet the evidence against these nine people is the sworn evidence of the same detective involved in the Australian prosecution. The behaviour is inexcusable. I doubt that a worthwhile assessment has been made of whether any of the remaining 73 charges still before the courts have any chance of success. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to deal with another matter. We are well aware that the Sankey v. Whitlam case had no chance of success. It failed but it cost the taxpayers an enormous amount of money. They had to supply legal aid for the defendants. Costs of $75,000 were awarded against Mr Sankey. When they were paid they were to be reimbursed to the taxpayers of Australia. Of course, the costs of the whole case were much more than that. Mr Sankey, understandably, said that he did not have any money-that is another matter for comment-that he could not pay the $75,000, and that he would go to gaol. I raised this matter in the Estimates committee. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) said that if I could produce some evidence something would be done about investigating the matter I had raised. As Mr Sankey was not able to pay the $75,000 and as it looked as though he would go to gaol, how remarkable it was that a dear old lady-that was the expression used in the Press-walked into the Queanbeyan Court and paid the $75,000 for him with a bank cheque. It was a remarkable act of charity that saved Mr Sankey from going to gaol. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue underlying this is where the $75,000 came from. I said in the committee that if I could produce evidence the Australian Federal Police should pursue the matter further. The evidence is that the $75,000 came from the ANZ Bank at Burwood by way of a bank cheque. There is the chance for the government to get the Federal Police to go to the ANZ Bank and find out from whose account the $75,000 was withdrawn. As honourable members know, if a person gives funds to somebody else to lay a prosecution, two issues arise on the question of maintenance of an action. One is civil maintenance and the other is criminal maintenance. There are all the elements of criminal maintenance in this matter. In other words, a criminal offence could be established. If it is shown that this money came from somebody else's account, particularly that of a member of parliament, it is a matter with which we can deal in this place. It is certainly a matter on which we need a report. I am not satisfied that the matter can be ignored. I urge the Government to get the Federal Police to investigate the account and give information to the Parliament as to the source of these funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to take the opportunity to speak on the estimates for the Department of Science and Technology. Australia faces a long term disaster if we fail to recognise that our greatest single resource is not mineral wealth but people. When Australians are asked to name the greatest resource of this country they invariably reply that it is uranium, coal, iron ore, bauxite or something else dug out of the ground. When the Japanese, Norwegians or Swedes are asked to name their greatest resource they invariably reply that it is people. It follows that if we see people as our primary resource we have to put more money and greater priority into research and development, into upgrading education and the whole intellectual base. The Fraser Government is content to follow a policy in which we rely for this country's future on the exploitation of physical resources, sell an increasing proportion of our manufacturing capacity into foreign hands, let research and development stagnate, and wind down our educational system and our intellectual capacity. I repeat the words of President Mitterrand:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> France's future lies in the development of hitherto unsuspected layers of intelligence. </PARA>
<PARA>That could not be said of Australia. In terms of technology transfer we have the most adverse balance of payments of any technologically advanced nation. The commanding heights of our economy-motor manufacturing, electronics, computers, plastics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and many major metals-are entirely under foreign ownership. Australia may turn into the 'poor little rich country'. Instead of following the examples of Sweden, Norway and Switzerland, we have adopted the colonial economic model and we see our labour force as the mere wood and water joeys of the Third World. I draw the attention of the House to the Government's belated and welcome but inadequate change on the issue of biotechnology. As recently as 31 March this year I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) this question without notice:</PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government recognises the enormous economic significance of biotechnology which appears likely to be the greatest area of industrial growth in the 1980s. If so, what specific steps is the Government taking to promote biotechnology in Australia and to study the major associated ethical problems . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister, as everyone in the House will recall, shrugged off the question and looked desperately at the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) to see whether he could give an answer. It was finally passed on to that man for all seasons, the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch). </PARA>

<PARA> Information was requested on the Organization's involvement in biotechnology including details of projects and their location together with aggregate figures of expenditure and staff numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO sub-programs involving biotechnology are listed below by Institutes and Divisions. Activities concerned specifically with biotechnology within these sub-programs involved 112 staff and a total expenditure of around $4.5m in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent developments in biotechnology within CSIRO include a review of the use of recombinant DNA techniques in 1979 and a broader review of biotechnology carried out in mid-1981. The findings of the latter review are under present examination by the Executive and decisions will be announced in the near future. However, consequent upon the high priority accorded to biotechnology, the Executive has decided to form a new Industrial Microbiology Unit within the Institute of Industrial Technology with effect from early 1982. The new Unit is to be concerned with industrial, as distinct form agricultural, applications of biotechnology and will undertake research on microbial genetics, gene technology, and industrial fermentations in relation to the utilisation of renewable materials and the treatment of wastes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. I point out that the total estimated expenditure in biotechnology is around $4.5m for the year 1980-81. No estimates are given for 1981-82. I point out what is happening in Canada, a country with an economy very comparable to that of Australia. Canada plans to spend $483m on developing biotechnology in the next decade. John Roberts, the Canadian Minister of State for Science and Technology, said this after receiving, according to the New Scientist of 16 April 1981, a 'hard-hitting report from a ministerial task force'. One does not need to alter much the remarks of that publication to apply them to Australia. The article stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report says Canada has a practically non-existent biotechnological industrial base, a rapidly shrinking federal government research capability and a highly fragmented and unfocussed university effort. </PARA>
<PARA>It sounds just like home. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It calls for a 10-year national plan to develop biotechnology. This would require $33m in its first year and $50m a year for the remaining nine years . . . The Ministry of State for Science and Technology took about a month to approve the task force's report--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Canadian task force-</PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, the British government took over a year to respond-negatively-to the Spinks report on biotechnology. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the article from the New Scientist in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>CANADA WANTS TO SPEND $500M ON BIOTECHNOLOGY</PARA>
<PARA> Canada should spend $483m on biotechnology in the next decade said John Roberts, Canadian Minister of State for Science and Technology, last week after receiving a hard-hitting report from a ministerial task force. </PARA>
<PARA> The report says Canada has 'a practically non-existent biotechnological industrial base, a rapidly shrinking federal government research capability and a highly fragmented and unfocused university effort'. It calls for a 10-year national plan to develop biotechnology. This would require $33m in its first year and $50m a year for the remaining nine years. </PARA>
<PARA> The task force's report selects key areas of biotechnology particularly suited to Canada. It calls for Canada to make better use of its forestry resources, which already bring in $12 billion a year. It says: 'the forestry industry in particular is in danger of losing its world competitive position because of its slow pace of innovation stemming from a comparatively low investment in research'. Much of the money in the 10-year plan will probably finance research on ways of turning wood cellulose into sugars and starches-the new feedstocks for biological processes. Canada should also concentrate on discovering how to make the best use of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of cellulose wastes from its pulp and paper mills. </PARA>
<PARA> The strength of Canada's agriculture prompted two other recommendations that the task force made-for more research on nitrogen fixation and plant breeding. Canada alone in the Western world has no antibiotics industry, so it is no surprise that the task force wants more money on this kind of research. Rather more puzzling, however, is its suggestion for research into microbes for mining awkward seams of mineral such as copper. This is surprising because most of the processes of this kind tried in Canada have proved unprofitable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ministry of State for Science and Technology took about a month to approve the task force's report. By contrast, the British government took over a year to respond-negatively-to the Spinks report on biotechnology. But then John Roberts is personally very keen on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the science ministry has no money of its own to spend and must go cap in hand to other departments, such as the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Resources. Eminent biotechnologists, such as Murray Moo-Young, professor of chemical engineering at the University of Waterloo, are sceptical that the government will ever stump up more than the initial $33m for the proposed program. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile the provincial government in Ontario has set up a biotechnology company with the help of Canada's biggest brewer, Labatt's. The firm has $105m to spend over the next 10 years. It will, however, face a keen shortage of qualified manpower. Last week, for example, the company issued a press release recruiting staff at the European Congress on Biotechnology in Eastbourne. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The Government is taking some steps towards this but the steps are essentially faltering ones. A symposium is being organised on the subject of commercial opportunities in Australia. It will be held between 18 and 20 November 1981 at the Hyatt Kingsgate Hotel in Sydney. It is being jointly sponsored by the Bank of New South Wales and the Australian Institute of Management. I am grateful for the invitation from the Minister for Science and Technology so that I can attend, if not, indeed, participate. But I still say that it must not be thought that that is a satisfactory response. That is not the end of the story. I point out to the House what has happened in Canada and I suggest that that is the model that we ought to be following.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia potentially has very great strengths in biotechnology. We are capable of providing biological feedstock, if we really want to, for the world. We are very strong in plant genetics. We have great expertise in many medical and paramedical areas. Australia could really lead towards the commanding heights of biotechnology. </PARA>
<PARA> We are persistently winding down our intellectual base in Australia. That is the tragedy. However, the central element in the economies of the nations with the highest living standards is education. In Australia we have come to accept the fallacy that education reached its peak in the early 1970s and is now in decline. As a result, many misinformed people in the community have come to accept the propaganda line that we have too many teachers, too many university students and too many graduates and to accept that numbers in secondary schools and tertiary institutions can and should fall in the 1980s. This involves making the assumption, which many administrators, politicians and policy-makers are all too ready to do, that the working classes are largely ineducable, that migrants should be left to do the dirty jobs, that too many women are pursuing higher education and that education is essentially a cost to the community-an economic liability, in fact-rather than the most important single element in creating a better society. </PARA>
<PARA> In Japan, the most productive society per capita, and Sweden, which boasts the highest per capita income, education is recognised as still being the most important single factor in growth. In Japan more than half the process workers in the Honda plant have university degrees, mostly-but not necessarily-in engineering. The Honda workers have discovered that having a degree is no hardship personally-quite the reverse. It adds to their potential for mobility and promotion and adds incentives to product improvement. In Australia, Great Britain and New Zealand the cultural context of industrial employment is entirely different from that of Japan. The idea of process workers in factories having degrees would be rejected out of hand as an absurdity. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with one observation. I refer to an article in the New Scientist of 6 November 1980 called 'Japan stakes its future on research'. Japan is a nation with no raw materials whatever and Sweden-a country to compare it with-has very limited raw materials. We find from the article that Japan in 1980 spent 1.7 per cent of its gross national product on research and development. This amount will be three per cent by 1990. President Mitterrand, starting from a base of 1.8 per cent in France expects to triple this by the end of his seven-year term. I point out to the Minister for Science and Technology and particularly to the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) a comment by MITI-the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry-which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> We reject the view that we can buy--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, technology but specifically-</PARA>
<PARA>chips from abroad. We must create the technology from the beginning to reap the benefits of using it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister in an uncharacteristic slip in a speech last week commented that if other people invent the wheel we in Australia do not need to invent the wheel all over again. With respect, I think that is profoundly wrong. I think that in many ways we have to think through the whole idea of product innovation, right from the start; that we virtually have to re-invent the wheel in many cases. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In these discussions on the estimates for the Department of Science and Technology, I wish to emphasise fundamental points which we in this House ignore to the grave harm of the community. First, our capacity to make our way in the coming era of sophisticated industrial technology depends on the support we invest now in research and development. Second, this support over the past few years has been unpredictable and deficient. Third, our industry-and our community as a whole-is receiving too little of the benefit of modern technology, and paying too much of its costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Professor Ron Johnston of Wollongong University described our dilemma bluntly and succinctly last year in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Manufacturing industry is running down its innovative capability to such an extent that it is unlikely to be able to respond to or take advantage of new technological developments. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, technological innovation in manufacturing industry is not a competitive proposition. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the problem staring us in the face. In the view of the Opposition, the problem is actually aggravated by the 1981-82 Budget as it concerns support for science and technology. Since 1975-76, the level of funding under the Industrial Research and Development Grants Act 1967 and the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976 has fluctuated in a manner that makes no sense. Having declined to a trough in 1977-78, it then rose to a peak in 1980-81. In the 1981-82 appropriation it has been pulled down again. In fact, the appropriation for this year-in real terms-is down by nearly 13 per cent. In this respect I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table showing the funding provided under these two Acts for industrial research and development annually since 1974-75. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This kind of support for research and development is unstable and unreliable. Moreover, as I have already said, the level of funding by both government and private sources is quite inadequate. Between 1976-77 and 1978-79, general government spending on research and development, not counting spending by government business enterprises, fell by 5 per cent in real terms. In addition, there was no change in expenditure on research and development by private enterprise either. Australia has slipped in the world league of research and development expenditure from the 'medium' category to the category described as 'low'. We find ourselves in this league alongside Iceland, Ireland, Finland and New Zealand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table shows very clearly that our national research effort is declining. We now spend less than one per cent of our national income in this field and the percentage is still falling. The unhappy fact is that funding even at the highest level reached over the past six years, and certainly at the level envisaged in these estimates, is most unlikely to achieve the central objective of the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act in any case. That objective is 'to promote and improve the efficiency of Australian industry.' The reasons are that funding is being swamped by the effects of other government attitudes and actions which restrict the access of Australian firms to modern technology, which discourage international competitiveness in Australian industry and which encourage foreign control of Australian industry. For example, the Government's open door policy on foreign investment, especially in the minerals area, places no obligation on foreign investors to transfer technology and skills to Australians. The most debilitated of post-colonial regimes insist on such obligations: This Government is too craven.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) and honourable members opposite examine carefully the operation of the patents system as a case study of how foreign-owned corporations are handed on a plate dominance in the capital-intensive sectors of Australian-based industry. Most payments for technical know-how-85 per cent, in fact-go to related enterprises overseas; that is, to the parent transnationals of firms operating in Australia. Payments by Australian companies to foreign enterprises for technical know-how, including patent licence fees and royalties, totalled $130m in 1978-79. In return, the same payments to Australian firms totalled only $14m. All this occurred at exactly the time when the net deficit in our technological balance of payments was getting steadily worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1976-77 and 1978-79, in fact, the deficit had doubled, from $56m to $116m. This is the cumulative effect of the long period of foreign domination of Australian based industry. Among comparable industrialised nations, only Canada is as badly off. Canada introduced laws and restrictions to screen technology transfer agreements back in 1976. By contrast, what we have is a system that actually subverts the development of an independent, competitive, Australian manufacturing industry. The reality is that industry is hesitant to invest in our future through research and development. Judging by its record, the Government will not, or cannot, or does not, know how to encourage and support this absolutely vital investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me state what Australian industry needs in place of this cringing attitude by the Fraser Government and what the Australian Labor Government elected in 1983 will provide under the administration of the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). First, a national research, development and innovation corporation will: Administer grants for industrial research and development; co-ordinate government supported research and development programs for manufacturing industry; advise the Government on ways to improve Australian industry through technological innovation; and direct the Government's support to programs which increase the ability of Australian owned firms to capitalise on new industrial technologies, which increase employment in new fields and which improve indigenous capacity in selected industries, especially those based on natural resources and those with a high skill content. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the incoming Labor Government will ensure that the development of our mineral and energy resources will bring lasting benefits to Australia's economy. To this end, we will take effective steps to ensure that foreign resource investors will maximise local downstream processing and manufacturing, transfer their technologies to local control and establish local research and development capability. Thirdly, a Labor government will not allow this administration's open door policy on foreign ownership and control of Australian industry to continue. We believe that Australia's place in the coming technological age depends on our traditional capacity for innovation and initiative. We believe that this capacity should be nurtured, not neglected as it has been for the past six years and as it is in this Budget. We believe that it needs, not the reluctant and erratic way of this Government, but encouragement through a responsible and systematic policy of the kind that will be set in train by a Labor government in two years' time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a few words about the operations of the Department of Communications. In the course of the Estimates Committee hearings I asked the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) a couple of questions. One referred to the provision of television services to the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia which has been a perennial for quite a number of years. In the reply the Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The estimated cost of Stage 2 of the project to provide television services for the Eyre Peninsula is $0.7m in Year 1 and $1.1m in Year 2. Further field studies are required before this project can proceed and the proposed appropriation of $150,000 this financial year is for such studies on this and several other major projects. The timing for commencement of the necessary capital works will be the subject of separate consideration in the normal budget context. </PARA>
<PARA>Since then I have received a letter from the Minister in which he says that the program will be completed in 1983-84 which is about six or seven years after this project was actually promised. Just prior to the elections in 1977 I made Press statements attacking the Government for its lack of action in the provision of these television services. A Liberal senator who claims responsibility for that area in South Australia queried what I said, accused me of being mischievous and a few other things. I will read that Press statement that was released at that time. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Don Jessop (Liberal, South Australia) said today that he had just received a definite undertaking from the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, Mr Eric Robinson, that a satisfactory television service would be operating on Eyre Peninsula and the West Coast within the next twelve months. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jessop said it was not possible to give a firm date when the service would commence, but it would be within the new year. </PARA>
<PARA> Specific details are in the final stages of preparation which includes the location of the installations. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a definite public undertaking and providing the present Government is returned, the people of Eyre Peninsula will be able to enjoy a decent television service at long last, Senator Jessop said. </PARA>
<PARA>That Press statement is dated 2 December 1977. Since then I have continually pressed the Government to try to get something definite on what it intended to do. One could never get anything positive. The replies from the various Ministers as to what was going to happen were always airy-fairy. In May 1978 I asked the Minister a question on this matter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Broadly speaking, however, it is envisaged that the project will include a high-power national station on Mount Cooper to provide a wide coverage service to the rural population in the western section of the Peninsula, subsidiary low-power national translators to serve Streaky Bay, Smoky Bay-Haslam, Wudinna and Kimba, a medium-power translator to serve the farming area in the central Eyre Peninsula, including the towns of Cleve and Lock, a translator at Port Augusta and an additional translator at Port Lincoln. In addition, upgrading of the existing national translators at Mount Olinthus and Brothwicks Hill is envisaged to provide improved coverage along the west coast of Spencer Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA>We have kept asking the various Ministers these questions to try to get something definite from them. Over the years we have never been able to get anything quite definite. On 9 November 1979 the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, who was then Mr Staley, in answer to a question I asked, said:</PARA>
<PARA> While the plan has not as yet been finalised nor submitted to me in final form for approval, officers of my Department have advised me that they expect to commence acquisition of sites on the Eyre Peninsula by the middle of next year. This would allow the necessary facilities to be progressively constructed and completed by the end of 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>The present Minister for Communications, in his latest letter, refers to 1983-84. I give the previous Minister, Mr Staley, credit in that he did endeavour to speed up the matter. He realised that the Government's record in the provision of these services was pretty abysmal which was how I described it in a question I asked the Minister last March. He wrote to the Acting General Manager of Telecom in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> I write to seek your personal consideration of a difficult problem of project scheduling in the capital works program to extend the national broadcasting system. This is, as you know, administered by my Department with Telecom Australia acting as construction agent. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular project is to extend and upgrade national television services in the Eyre Peninsula region of South Australia. This has had a most unfortunate history of unmet commitments, and I am determined to commence actual installation of these facilities as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on further to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I have given a personal commitment to the residents of these areas to complete this part of the overall project as quickly as possible. My specific undertaking was to commence installation of these sites before the end of this year so that actual transmission could begin early next year. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, early this year 1981. We now find in the latest information from the Minister that it is now to be in 1983-84. The good senator who claims that he represents my electorate came out with another statement at the same time. It is in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Don Jessop announced today that he had received further information on progress to extend national television services to the west coast of Eyre Peninsula. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jessop had previously announced that facilities to bring ABC television to this area would be commenced at Wirrula, Streaky Bay and Kongwirra before the end of this year so that actual transmission could commence early next year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister had today approved technical operating conditions for these three projects. As it is intended that they all be installed on sites owned by the Commonwealth there will be no difficulties in site acquisition. Therefore the Minister expects that installation will commence immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case the Minister had advised me Senator Jessop said, that he would be personally taking the matter up with the Acting Chairman of Telecom Australia, who act as the construction agents, to ensure that Telecom understands the Minister's desire to move immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made in August 1980, just over 12 months ago. Honourable members will note that it states that television services to the west coast of Eyre Peninsula would open earlier that year. Since that time one small station, with limited range and using the Intelsat satellite, has been opened. It was only by sheer luck that it could be installed. Apparently the dish that was to receive the signal from the satellite was to go to a place in Western Australia. People sent petitions which stated that they did not want this because of possible interference with commercial television. It saved the Government a bit of embarrassment. It took the dish that was to go to Western Australia and placed it at Streaky Bay. Of all those projects about which there have been promises concerning when they would come on air, only Streaky Bay has a small station. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite obvious from what the Minister has said in his latest letter to me that it will be 1983-84 before this project is completed. So much for the earlier statements that were made that Eyre Peninsula would have television within 12 months; that is, in 1978. There has been a list of broken promises and broken commitments. Even the previous Minister responsible described the situation as such. I mentioned when speaking on this matter that I expected that the previous Minister, Mr Staley, would not be the Minister for Post and Telecommunications by the time television reached Eyre Peninsula. I hazard a guess that the present Minister will not be Minister for Communications when those installations finally arrive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I relate my remarks about the report of Estimates Committee C to the Department of Administrative Services, particularly the property section of that Department. If honourable members examine the important role of this Department they can see that if they use their influence in a planned way they could have an enormous influence over the pattern and development of the major cities in our country. At present there seems to be a free market forces approach to the role of the Department of Administrative Services. There also seems to be very little planning regarding the location of Commonwealth employees. In a study the Whitlam Government carried out in 1974-75 we found that each year half a million square feet of floor space was rented by the Department of Administrative Services and another half a million square feet was needed to upgrade the conditions under which the people accommodated worked. But it goes far beyond that because apart from accommodating Commonwealth departments the Department also accommodates statutory authorities such as Qantas Airways Ltd, Trans Australia Airlines, Australia Post, Telecom Australia and the Commonwealth Bank, just to name a few. Those organisations, as well as Commonwealth public servants, should be located in areas which are in the best interests of planned development of the metropolis as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will briefly refer to two cities which had programs set out by the then Australian Labor Government in 1972-75. Sydney and Melbourne worked in co-operation with both a conservative government in New South Wales and a conservative government in Victoria on planning and development. Under the McMahon Government, which had been the government of the day, the property section of the Department of Administrative Services-or whatever its name was at that time; it has varied from time to time-was in favour of developing a Commonwealth Offices site at Woolloomooloo in Sydney. That site could have housed 15,000 Commonwealth public servants. The Labor Party was supported with information which convinced even a conservative member of the Joint Committee on Public Works that we should not then proceed with the Woolloomooloo site. The project was deferred. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Labor Government came to government it made it clear that we would not proceed with the Woolloomooloo development. The 15,000 Commonwealth public servants would be located at sub-metropolitan centres throughout metropolitan Sydney. On gaining office we immediately acquired the first site at Meggitt's in Parramatta. We decided that we would develop that site to house between 4,500 and 5,000 Commonwealth public servants. We decided that in developing Meggitt's site and similar areas no longer would we build just office blocks for public servants; other human environment would be there as well. At Meggitt's two theatres, art galleries and child minding centres would be built. We would have social, recreation and retail facilities for people living in that building. Also we would be able to create cultural and artistic facilities for the communities of the western suburbs which had been so badly treated for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only would Commonwealth public servants have been located at Parramatta but also we would have located them at places such as Blacktown, Penrith, Liverpool, Campbelltown and probably Hurstville or Sutherland on the southern end of Sydney. The reason for that was two-fold. It is necessary that jobs are located where people live. Also, if a Commonwealth government supports its State counterparts in upgrading urban public transport we should not encourage transport systems being geared to a peak load-in other words all the jobs being created in the central business district of, for example, Sydney or Melbourne. We want to see jobs and social amenities created out in the fringes of the cities. </PARA>
<PARA> If the property section of the Department of Administrative Services had people with foresight to plan we could create a much more balanced metropolis. When we were in government we carried out a study with the Victorian Liberal Government of the day. It was found that 18,000 too many Commonwealth public servants were located in the central business district of Melbourne. It was agreed, again by jointly planning with the Victorian Government, that we should develop sub-metropolitan centres in places such as Sunshine in the west, Broadmeadows in the north, Dandenong in the south-east and Epping-Watsonia in the north-east. Those places would have been built up in a similar pattern to what I have talked about in relation to Sydney. It distresses me that again the market forces are allowed to take over. Most of the space rented by the property section of the Department of Administrative Services is in the central business districts of Melbourne and Sydney. This is not in the best interests of employees. For example, Sydney stretches 50 kilometres west, 50 kilometres south-west, about 35 kilometres north and 35 kilometres south. Most people who live in the area are forced to travel to their employment in or near the central business district of Sydney. What we need to do when developing and planning a metropolis is to make sure that the Commonwealth gives the lead, in co-operation with the States and local government, in developing the sub-metropolitan centres as I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given examples only of Sydney and Melbourne but examples can be given of other places as well. It is important at all times that the Commonwealth does not withdraw from its responsibilities or allow market forces to determine these issues; it should start to locate its huge work force in a proper way. I believe that, if the Government works in co-operation with the State governments and local government on the location of both Commonwealth and State public servants and people employed in statutory authorities, it will have an enormous influence on the future pattern of development in our cities. At a time when there is an energy crisis, people should not be forced to travel 100 kilometres a day to go to and from work. They should be given jobs and opportunities where they live. During our period in government we created a branch office of the Australian Taxation Office at Macarthur House in Parramatta. Volunteers were sought to fill the 1,000 positions created there. In fact 1,500 Commonwealth public servants from within the Taxation Office volunteered to work at the Taxation Office in Parramatta. I am quite sure that if a centre were built at Penrith, in the area represented by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Free), public servants living in areas of the lower Blue Mountains, in the St Mary's, Mount Druitt and Seven Hills areas, would move, both from west to east and from east to west, to a place such as Penrith for their employment. If we are to upgrade a transport system, we need to ensure that people move in both directions in the mornings, instead of having the present peak load situation. I give notice that, when we are in government in 1983, we will implement this policy in co-operation with the State and local government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, under this Government the environment portfolio has received a very low priority indeed. In the six years of the Fraser Government it has been shuffled through at least four multiple departments. Equally unfortunately, in this year's Budget expenditure on very important environmental programs has been severely cut. A mere $16m in total has been made available. That is a reduction of 17.2 per cent in real terms over the last year. What is more there is an indication that it is the Government's intention to cut staff levels by 6 per cent over the next financial year. I will give some of the worst examples of the cuts. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has had its funds cut by 16.2 per cent. That is not surprising because in the razor gang proposals it was made very clear that Federal interest in national parks in the Northern Territory was to be scaled down. I forewarn the House that the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, which I think will be released in the next week may have something very interesting to say about that proposal. Similarly, grants to voluntary conservation organisations have been severely cut. They have been cut by almost 50 per cent since 1976-by almost 10 per cent in the last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tragedy of this is that these groups do an excellent job. The Government refuses to order environmental impact statements on major projects. Since 1976 only 18 have been ordered to cover projects under the auspices of the Department of Trade and Resources or the Department of National Development and Energy. Similarly, the Government has refused to order public inquiries under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. Because of these two facts the role of voluntary conservation groups is most crucial indeed. The Government must reconsider its miserly attitude to the voluntary environmental groups throughout Australia. When the Government is very tardy about ordering public inquiries and environmental impact statements, in effect these groups are doing the Government's work and clearly they ought to be funded. Funding that has been cut over the last five or six years should be reinstated in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to an area in which funding was increased in this Budget. I refer to the 21 per cent increase, in real terms, in funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. However, strangely, its staff has been cut by five positions. The implication of this is that that reduction in staff will be made in the section responsible for preparing zoning plans for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. There is little wonder at that because over the last seven years only 2.4 per cent of the park has been declared, including only 0.008 per cent of the Cairns section. This Government has been guilty of both cowardice and capitulation to the Queensland Premier and of lying to the environmental and reef protection groups in Queensland about this matter. I will explain that. In 1975, when we introduced the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Act, we thought that over the subsequent eight or 10 years the whole of the Barrier Reef would be declared as park, that is, the whole area from the low water mark on the west to Torres Strait in the north and to south of Gladstone. However, as I have said, after six years, only 2.5 per cent of the park has been declared. This has been the fault of the Government in not standing up to the Government of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The ministerial council responsible, which comprises two Federal Ministers and two State Ministers, is a body which is supposed to consider the recommendations of the Authority, yet it did not meet for 13 months, until 28 September 1981. We were told that the Cairns section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park would be declared by Christmas last year. What have we seen? Since the previous ministerial council meeting less than 0.01 per cent has been declared. Why is this so? It is so because the Queensland Government and the Queensland Premier wish to allow oil drilling in or near the Barrier Reef, and so does this Government. Why else does this Government not use its power under the Act to declare the park? Why did it amend the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act to allow oil drilling within 30 miles of the reef on the eastern side?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) must accept one simple and fundamental fact: He is being heavied and bullied and stood over by Bjelke-Petersen, the Queensland Government and the Queensland bureaucrats on this very important matter. The Minister submitted eight proposals to the recent ministerial council meeting and the Queensland Government submitted none. All the Federal proposals were knocked over, yet the Queensland Government submitted none. Why does the Minister accept this humiliation? It is humiliation not only of himself but also of the Government. I will tell the House what is going on. I will quote from an article in the Canberra Times of 15 October 1981 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Publicly, federal officials are loath to criticise the Queensland Government because that could upset the delicate relationship between the governments and the snail's-pace negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> However, one Federal official said the position was similar to the Yom Kippur war and (mixing his metaphors) that some of the Queensland techniques of propaganda were 'straight out of Hitler's Germany-very frightening and hard to overcome'. </PARA>
<PARA> In turn, Queensland officials responded by called the Marine Park Authority 'a mob of egg-heads' and Federal Ministers 'weak to ridiculous'. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> State officials also leaked out stories that declaration of a total marine park 'could cause the resources boom to come to a grinding bloody halt'. </PARA>
<PARA> The officials told deliberate lies that the marine park would mean ships might not be able to move through reef waters . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So the sorry story goes on. Why is the Minister allowing bureaucrats to mislead him and to obstruct the stated intention of the Federal Government to declare by Christmas last year the Cairns section of the Barrier Reef below the high water mark? We have seen no action except that at the last meeting only 0.008 per cent of the Cairns section was declared, making a total of 2.5 per cent declared over the last seven years. What a sorry record that is. The World Heritage Committee will meet in Sydney next week. This Government has nominated the Great Barrier Reef for inclusion on the World Heritage list, yet it has declared only 2.5 per cent of it as a marine park. Australia, as well as the Minister, will be seen by an international environmental organisation to be, as those Queensland officials described the two Federal Ministers, weak and ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA> In the closing minutes of the time available to me, I wish to deplore the fact that no funds were allocated this financial year to conduct public inquiries under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. The Minister has supplied information to me which purports to say that as it cannot be anticipated at the time of preparation of the estimates whether there will be an inquiry no money is allocated, but if there is any inquiry money will be allocated during the financial year. I sincerely hope this course is followed. Over the last seven years there have been only two public inquiries, one into Ranger and one into Fraser Island, both of which were instigated by the previous Whitlam Labor Government, and on which this Government to some degree has acted, particularly in the case of Fraser Island. That is two inquiries in seven years, both instigated by the Federal Labor Government of the time. When will this Government accept its responsibilities and start to order some public inquiries into great environmental issues, into areas of national significance that are included in the National Estate, issues such as sand mining on Moreton Island? In regard to South West Tasmania, we have moved in this Parliament to challenge the Federal Government to set up an inquiry, and that is what should be done with regard to hydro-electric developments. It should also be noted that all the people of Brisbane, Queensland, including the City Council, the Opposition shadow Minister, and the State Opposition are in favour of a public inquiry and are not in favour of sand mining on Moreton Island. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to the report of Estimates Committee C relating to the Department of Communications. The two matters with which I would like to deal are the Government's attack on the role of Telecom Australia as the common carrier, and the campaign that is being waged to hand over the more lucrative elements of Telecom's activities. In the first instance, it is a fundamental right of every Australian to participate in the common carrier philosophy, and the right to proper communications is fundamental to that philosophy. Everything this Government has done over the last few years has led to the basis being laid for an attack on that principle. Unfortunately, we as a party declined to oppose what might be the modus operandi for giving effect to that attack when we did not oppose the Overseas Telecommunications Amendment Act in 1981. That Act breaks down the monopoly of Telecom and lays the basis for an attack on that principle. The real issue here is not whether we want to maintain a monopoly on employees in a department or in a particular industry, it is a fundamental principle that applies to every Australian. It is not a question of whether we can afford communications. We have a fundamental right to communications. The obvious manoeuvre of the Government is in that direction and believe me, it will move in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Referring to the handing over of the more lucrative areas of Telecom's activities, the basis for that was laid when the late Mr Eric Robinson and the then Minister, Mr Staley, came to grips on the issue. An argument ensued and the matter was taken to Cabinet by Mr Robinson. A decision was made that private enterprise would not only participate but also would participate to a large extent. When the communications satellite was mooted, Mr Robinson indicated that, as far as he was concerned, there would be participation by private enterprise in the consortium that would run it. In 1980 it was said that there should be private participation in that satellite, otherwise there would be a great drain on the funds of Telecom, which should be used for the extension of the system. That is a complete hoax, because it did not extend the system. The fact is that deferred applications during 1980-81 are higher now than they ever have been. </PARA>
<PARA> By draining the funds of Telecom the Government is in fact limiting the capacity of Telecom to provide a service to everybody in Australia. The Government gave to the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) the job of telling Telecom how to run its affairs. He could not organise the running of a penny-in-the-slot lavatory; he is in no position to be able to advise Telecom on how it should run its business. Telecom is a very efficient organisation. It developed its workshops and entered into research, leading up to the time when the satellite communications system was handed over to the consortium. It has carried out research related to the viewdata and other processes, which will be lucrative areas of operation in the future. It has carried out all those investigations and is in a position economically to put them into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the great carve-up. The Government is helping big business at the expense of every communications consumer in this country. It is selectively applying favours to private companies such as the Myer Emporium Ltd and others. The Myer Emporium enters into nothing which will not be lucrative. I worked with that company for a number of years, and the number of people it squeezes to death is nobody's business. It is in the market to skim the cream off the top. It will not participate in communications in the country areas, where losses will be incurred; it will be scooping off the cream. One of the areas where the cream will be is the viewdata processing area. In all the add-on connections that will be made in the communications areas, Myer will be right in on the ground floor. It was to be part of the consortium set up to run the satellite system. Peter Holmes a'Court indicated on its behalf, and on behalf of others, that they were not interested in the non-profit areas that would be provided by the satellite; they were interested only in the fact that when it did get under way it would be subsidised by every consumer of communications in this country. When the appropriate time came the consortium would move in and rent the transponders, after everything was set in train and the communications system was in order. </PARA>
<PARA> The installation and maintenance of PABXs-private automatic branch exchanges-is a lucrative area based on business usage. Telecom's attempts to be the supplier of PABXs have been rejected by the Minister for Communications. Potential Telecom profits have been denied once again and handed over to private enterprise. The most dramatic growth in communications in the 1980s will be in business data via computer communications, viewdata and other areas of that nature. The same technology applies in many areas. Private industry has created one of the most powerful consortiums this country has seen. With Government support, the stage is set to remove Telecom as a competitor in a whole range of areas. It is after a blatant handover of profits from the Australian people to a few private communications giants. </PARA>
<PARA> Telephone answering machines are increasing in number mainly in small businesses. Telecom is not allowed to supply these machines, or facsimile machines-a growing demand and profit area. The Government has given exclusive rights for supply to private industry. Most of those machines are now imported. The Government has cut Telecom right out of the research and design and the provision of that equipment. Telecom would insist on local content if it were able to proceed with the program that it had laid out in the first instance. It developed its workshops for the purpose of research and design in many areas. But what did this Government do? Instead of supplying young people with jobs, enabling them to be trained in the development of the techniques that will be necessary in the communications area, it shut down vast sections of Telecom's workshops. Once again Telecom has been obliged to hand over to other people what would have been the wherewithal to train its technicians. </PARA>
<PARA> Technicians in Australia, whether in research, design or maintenance are top class by world standards. In fact, what they are doing now and have been doing for some time is modifying the equipment bought from companies overseas and applying it to the Australian system. This Government's policy is clear and concise. It is determined to do away with the common carrier principle and crucify the proper participation of people in the communications area. It will take the cream off the more lucrative areas of Telecom, hand them over to private enterprise, and put at risk the economic viability of Telecom in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to a matter which I raised in the Estimates Committee concerning the negative role of the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) and his lack of support for measures ensuring that the Australian environment and human health are protected from the danger of hazardous chemicals. Specifically, the Minister has failed to support recent international efforts by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to develop principles and standardised guidelines for the testing of chemicals, backed away from any commitment to making such procedures compulsory for companies introducing new chemicals, and opted for the introduction of a voluntary interim notification scheme from 1 October this year, but provided no staff resources to the hazardous chemicals sections of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment to administer the scheme. I understand that that section of the Department employs five or six people. Clearly, that is quite inadequate to manage any kind of internal section in a department dealing with hazardous chemicals. Clearly, it is quite inadequate to deal with a major new scheme for which the Government is making some claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some 50,000 chemicals are in commercial use in Western industrial economies but very few have been tested for their long term effects on the environment and human health. The public has increasingly become aware of public health disasters associated with chemical spills, explosions and accidents such as the notorious incident at Love Canal in Upper Niagara in the United States of America, where the dumping of toxic wastes led to birth defects and spontaneous abortion among residents for 20 to 30 years later. Australia has not been entirely free of such accidents. I mention the collision on the Pacific Highway near Port Macquarie involving a truck carrying chemicals. This case was recently highlighted on the Australian Broadcasting Commission's Nationwide program. The whole question of agent orange also has been a matter of considerable concern to some honourable members in this House. I do not intend to canvass the matter, although it represents an example of the hazards associated with chemicals in common use within this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Hazardous chemicals also provide a major threat to the health of workers exposed to them in key industries. Workers' health is being endangered not by high dosages but by long term exposure to low levels of chemicals. Chemicals used in the work place can cause cancer, birth defects and diseases of the kidney, heart and liver. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has recently said that such incidents have constituted industrial tragedies. Examples of such tragedies include bladder cancer among workers handling dyestuffs in rubber industries and cancer and lung disease. The latter have taken a heavy toll among workers in the asbestos industries, for example, the workers at Wittenoom Gorge in Western Australia. Two out of three workers with exposure of more than five years have contracted asbestosis. Acro osteolysis, or clubbing of the fingers, occurs from exposure to vinyl chloride monamer in the PVC plastics industries located in various cities around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> While these are the most well-known examples, my concern is that grossly inadequate regulatory mechanisms have allowed many more potentially hazardous chemicals to be introduced without adequate safeguards. This was of relevance to this Committee. As a result of questioning the Committee heard of the initiatives being taken, within the OECD. Mr Crawford, a former member of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment has been very closely associated with these initiatives. These moves have been towards developing standardised agreements so that chemical companies are requested to pre-test chemicals before they are released. The OECD's chemical program has been working towards international collaboration on the management of hazardous chemicals. The program aims to harmonise national systems to test chemicals, foster information exchanges, and develop common approaches to the assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> In May 1980 the OECD convened a high level meeting to consider principles of international harmonisation on the testing of chemicals. At that meeting four draft resolutions were framed for formal adoption by the OECD Council. The four resolutions referred to standardised guidelines for the testing of chemicals, principles of laboratory practice for chemicals testing, acceptance of test data on chemicals between OECD countries, and the use of a minimum pre-marketing set of data for initial assessment of new chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> In May 1981, the OECD Council adopted three resolutions on the mutual acceptance of data. The resolutions mean an agreed set of guidelines for testing and standard practices for running laboratories. Australia asbstained from voting on the three resolutions adopted by the OECD Council. The fourth resolution called for the compulsory compliance of companies that wished to introduce new chemicals. The OECD Council is planning to adopt a formal position on this question this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government claims, as it did before the Committee, that it has no official position on this question. But of course, it is hiding behind constitutional difficulties with the States. Indeed it may be that the Committee was misled when it was told that the Commonwealth had no official position. I believe the Commonwealth's position is negative rather than neutral. In fact the Commonwealth has very clear-cut powers in this area. Nearly all the new chemicals introduced in Australia came from overseas. The Commonwealth Government has clear powers to control the import of new materials. In the related areas of new drugs, pesticides and food additives, the Commonwealth Government exercises firm control and uses clearance schemes of the kind needed for general chemicals. Instead, the Commonwealth has opted to introduce a voluntary notification scheme through the Australian Environment Council. Through this scheme, manufacturers and importers will be asked to notify government authorities voluntarily of the identity of new chemicals. This voluntary notification scheme cannot possibly work in the long run. It places too much onus on private interests to provide information which could be prejudicial to them. Worse, the Federal Government is not really serious in ensuring that even this half-baked scheme will work. </PARA>
<PARA> The hazardous chemicals section of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment has no resources to support the Australian Environment Council's interim notification scheme. For this job to be performed the section would require a staff of some 13 people. In fact, as I have pointed out, and as was confirmed at the Committee meeting, no additional staff has been provided. The Minister is so serious about this new voluntary notification scheme that he has made no attempt to secure the necessary staff!</PARA>
<PARA> The technical requirements of these positions require a majority of them to be filled by people with scientific backgrounds-for example, chemists and biochemists. Such staff cannot be found from other sections of the Department. We have to compare this parlous situation with the assessment and notification procedures for industrial chemicals used in other countries. For example, the United States Toxic Substances Control Act is administered by some 1,000 people in the United States Environment Protection Authority. In Australia the Department of Home Affairs and Environment has no staff to administer its recently introduced prenotification scheme. This scheme was commenced on only 1 October this year and already it appears to be doomed to failure. I wanted to raise these matters which I raised within the Committee to confirm that Australia is well behind other countries within the OECD. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my remarks to the Estimates Committee report on the Attorney-General's Department. Firstly I wish to raise the question of grants to community legal aid centres. The total amount being provided to such centres for the next financial year is $400,000, of which the two largest amounts are $50,000 to the Redfern Legal Centre and $60,000 to the Fitzroy Legal Service. One service of which I have personal knowledge is the Doveton Legal Service which operates from the Doveton-Hallam Community Health Centre. It provides an excellent service but it is expected to operate on a miserable allocation of $16,000. These legal service centres are extremely important as they provide community level legal services. This is particularly significant now that the Australian Legal Aid Office has been dismantled by this Government. The centres are extremely cost effective because of the system of legal aid delivery. The voluntary nature of the schemes allows them to deliver services extremely cheaply with voluntary workers, including solicitors. But they are not charities. Frankly, $400,000 is a pathetic figure for all the community legal aid centres in Australia. I hope that in the next Budget we will see a significant advance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter with which I wish to deal is the related matter of financial assistance in special circumstances. This matter concerns rights to pursue various matters of Commonwealth law such as environmental legislation, trade practices legislation, administrative appeals and matters relating to conciliation and arbitration Acts. There seem to be significant problems in this area. Firstly the rate of processing the applications is inordinately slow. Of the 261 applications received last year, 187 are not yet decided. The general rate of approval to refusal is about 60 per cent. One would hope that the reason for the high rate of undecided cases is not simply to keep the expenditure within the rather arbitrary figure provided in the Budget of $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA> There would also seem to be significant differences in the approval rate in different areas of aid. Although the general rate of approval is about 60 per cent, the approval rate varies greatly in different areas. For example, 38 out of 51 applications in trade practices matters were refused and five out of six in environmental matters were refused. The argument used to justify this is that the chances of success were not reasonable. It also must be stated that these cases often have political overtones. It is hoped that political considerations are not entering into the judgment of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was directing my remarks to the Estimates Committee report on the Attorney-General's Department. I had dealt with the inadequate funding of community legal aid centres, the delays in processing applications for special financial assistance and the fact that applications for assistance in special circumstances in the areas of trade practices and environmental matters have a very high refusal rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another matter which I wish to raise concerns the delays occurring in the family law area. The Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act recommended that a study be undertaken to ascertain whether there was a need for the appointment of more deputy registrars. There is clearly an urgent need for appointments in that area. I agree with the Joint Select Committee that the emphasis should be on pre-trial conferences rather than on the adversary situation which arises when so many family law matters reach the stage of the actual proceedings. Of course, there is probably a need for more judges to be appointed, which would also have an effect with respect to delays. But the really urgent area, in my view, is pre-trial conferences. In Victoria at present the delay for uncontested matters is around five months and the delay for contested matters in many cases is more than a year. Family law matters are urgent and this sort of delay is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> In the family law area there is also the problem of the split jurisdiction. Some matters within that area fall within Commonwealth jurisdiction while others remain within the jurisdiction of the States. At present two States, New South Wales and, surprisingly, the normally extremely conservative State of Victoria, are prepared to make the necessary reference of power. Queensland and Western Australia remain the stumbling blocks. I acknowledge that the Western Australian Family Court is working well, but ultimately the problem of split jurisdiction can be solved only by the States referring their powers in family law matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter which I wish to raise with regard to this Estimates Committee relates to a question asked by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). In answer to that question given to members of the Committee on 24 September we were told that the answer was awaiting clearance by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). The question referred to reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Was the Government aware of or was it consulted about the appearance before the National Press Club earlier this month of the former Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, Mr Justice Woodward? Does the Government believe that this is a desirable practice? In view of that practice will the Government consider allowing the Director-General of ASIO to appear in future before Senate and House of Representatives Estimates Committees in order to give information at his discretion concerning the financial administration of ASIO?</PARA>
<PARA>It is my view that the ridiculous practice in relation to ASIO of the only information given to Parliament being a one-line appropriation should be abandoned. The responsible Minister should use his discretion in determining what information will be given to the Parliament, but certain information such as the number of telephone tappings and warrants should be required by statute and the Director-General of ASIO should appear before the Estimates committees of both Houses in order that the information that should be made available to this Parliament can be made available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Deputy Whip, I am sorry. I do not wish to delay the House. I know that there is a lot of business to be transacted tonight, but I would like to say a word or two about sport, which comes under the responsibility of the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson). My complaint really emanates from the Confederation of Australian Sport, which is a body comprising almost every sporting body of any significance in Australia. My request to the Minister, funnily enough, has been fulfilled today. Nevertheless, I think the point is well worth making. The 1981-82 Budget included in its rather niggardly allocation of about $12m to sport an amount of $2.885m for the Sports Development Program. That works out to less than a dollar per head for the people of Australia, who are popularly assessed around the world to be sports mad. This program is directed towards national sporting federations to enable them to obtain financial assistance for such things as the appointment of full-time coaches and experts and travel to international meetings and competitions. The 1981-82 allocation, I am sad to report in a year when inflation is generally believed to be around the 10 per cent mark, shows not a one cent increase on the niggardly allocation of 1980-81. That in itself is obviously a matter for discontent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, that is not the matter of urgent concern. The matter which concerned the Confederation of Australian Sport was the fact that the allocations, which are normally made by the end of August, had not been made up until yesterday. In other words, the various sporting bodies around Australia that were expecting even a small crumb to fall from the table of this niggardly Government did not know which sport was to get the crumb and how small the crumb might be. However, I note that the Minister announced today exactly which sports are to get what amounts of money. So, while my complaint might be 12 hours late, it is well worth making, I believe. </PARA>
<PARA> The image that Australia has around the world of being a sports loving nation and of being composed of a great mass of sunburned, tall and bronzed Anzacs is suddenly and rapidly disappearing under this Government because of its absolute disregard for sport. I have made once before the observation-I think it is worth making again-that if somebody bothered to take in Australia a poll of the 10 most popular Australians, living or dead, we would find on the list Don Bradman, Betty Cuthbert, Dawn Fraser-perhaps even Ray Groom-and various other sporting characters. We would probably find even Phar Lap, a dead horse, before we would find the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I am pleased to see the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) sitting here. I know that he was formerly an amateur boxing official. I think he probably had one fight too many, were the truth known. But I have no doubt that he shares my view that this Government's allocation of finance to sport is absolutely ridiculous in view of our reputation around the world of being a nation of sports nuts. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that complaint is well worth making. Although the amount of money is very small, the fact that the allocations have been made today means that it is much too late for many of the sporting bodies which, having found out how much money they are going to get, want to arrange trips for their teams or representatives to various sporting functions around the world. If they do not get advice early they are not able to get such things as reduced air fares by booking early. I admonish the Government to that extent. The amount is very small. The allocation is too late. It is a matter of too little too late. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my remarks to the appropriations for the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Trade and Resources. I took part in the deliberations of Estimates Committee F on those two departments and also, due to the temporary absence of the shadow Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown), who has just spoken, for a short time in its deliberations on the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. I know that he will deliver some remarks and thoughts in relation to that Department in a moment. The two departments on which I am focusing together employ about 2,660 people and spend over $500m per year in providing advice to the Government on trade and industry issues and on operational activities in each of these areas, including the promotion of exports. Clearly, there is a very major commitment of resources and personnel to these very important purposes. Accordingly, I believe we should expect a clear indication that appropriate benefits are accruing from this commitment. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that adequate benefits are being enjoyed by the Australian community. As I was able to indicate in a debate today on a matter of public importance relating to the very sad and tragic decision of ICI (Australia) Ltd, due to inadequate Government policies, not to go ahead with its investment at Point Wilson, I do not believe that adequate benefits are being enjoyed by the Australian community from the efforts of these two departments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not criticise the departments directly for this. Rather, I believe the current mismanagement of trade and industry and the general economic policy by the Fraser Government is to blame. In the past 12 months there has been a marked shift in Government thinking back to the ideological roots of its long-standing rhetoric. Whilst some of the better elements of the Jackson and Crawford inquiries filtered through to form part of the Government's approach in the period from 1976 to 1980, we have now witnessed their eclipse by the hard line monetarism which is favoured by the most ideologically motivated of the Government's ranks. As such, the future of Australian industry and trade now rests more in the hands of the Treasury and the Prime Minister's Department than with the two departments on which I am focusing, which are formally charged with responsibility in these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This return to fundamentalism and the consequent rejection of a creative government role in industry and trade development arises for a variety of reasons. All these reasons are political and ideological. They are just as ideological as stupid remarks that are occasionally made about the reason for the ICI closure being related to wages only. That is extraordinarily narrow thinking. It is just ideological thinking when one takes into account all the other factors which are responsible for increases in costs and prices in this community. The Government's arguments are not economic. They do not reflect a reasonable assessment of the needs of industry in this country at this stage of our history. The reasons include the need of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to maintain his support with the dries of the Liberal Party back bench and the encouragement he has taken from his mentors in the Reagan and Thatcher camps. They also arise from the Government's blind acceptance of market forces, even when they result in such disruptive experiences as the recent up-valuation of the Australian dollar. As the annoucement of the deferral of the $500m ICI petrochemical plant shows, such blind faith will lead us to lose many developmental opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> The list of failures of this Government in relation to trade and industry policy grows longer every day. In the brief time available I will list just a few of them. Firstly, there has been a sharp increase in the degree of uncertainty in the manufacturing sector as a result of the Government's vacillating tariff policies for Australian industry. Business has become completely disillusioned with this Government because of its failure to provide a stable environment for manufacturing investment decisions. Secondly, industry consultation has been dramatically downgraded. In 1978 there were 37 meetings of the industry advisory councils. Last year there were only 24 meetings. This year has been even worse. There have been only nine meetings in the first nine months of the year of the dozen or so industry advisory councils. The Government is no longer listening to industry, and industry is wondering whether there is any future for it under the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, programs of assistance to industry and for export promotion have been cut. The Regional Economic Development Scheme has been scrapped. Fourteen companies on the verge of having their projects approved were left with nothing. Other incentives have been reduced, but there is no clear statement of Government policy on any of them. The same applies to the virtually unexplained decision to abolish government procurement preferences for locally produced goods. Fourthly, the financial environment for business has sharply deteriorated. Interest rates are at a record level. A virtual credit squeeze has been applied in recent months. The small business sector has suffered from a lack of finance of various kinds. This has been confirmed again this week by the Bureau of Industry Economics. We in the Australian Labor Party, together with small business organisations, have been pointing out these factors for several years. The response of the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) has been perpetual procrastination. </PARA>
<PARA> The four weaknesses I have outlined are just some of the weaknesses of the present Government's trade and industry policies. Under these policies Australia now faces a massive trade deficit. Our exports of manufactured goods are stagnant. During 1981 there has been a decline in our exports of the higher technology goods, the so-called elaborately transformed manufactures. The bankruptcy level is at an all time high. Our economic growth has averaged only 2 1/2 per cent over the past six years and unemployment has increased by over 150,000 people since the Fraser Government took office. Quite clearly, the trade and industry policies of this Government are an abysmal failure. Six years after the Government took office virtually every economic indicator shows that there is no recovery. Unemployment is rising again. Under the current trend of the return to monetarist fundamentalism the sad truth is that the indicators are likely to get even worse. </PARA>
<PARA> What is needed in Australia today is an entirely different approach to trade and industry policies. The departments of Industry and Commerce and Trade and Resources should be directed to develop a policy package based on an expansionary macro-economic strategy instead of a contractionary one. This requires the preparation, in consultation with industry and trade unions-that consultation is reducing at this time-of an economic plan on a national scale comprising a series of objectives and targets within which business can confidently invest. Such planning in the current context would include at least a medium term commitment to a stable exchange rate and a stable level of tariff protection for industry. At the same time, a more creative program of positive industry assistance is needed. Key elements which are needed in this area and which have not been developed adequately by the current Government include expanded industrial research and development programs; the creation or adaption of financial institutions for the provision of venture capital; the development of a program of equalisation of regional economic development opportunities to provide security in the employment prospects of our provincial and regional cities; the creation of trading companies and other institutions for the direct promotion of Australian exports, particularly manufactured goods; and, the last in my list, which is by no means comprehensive, the overhaul of depreciation schedules in the manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I willingly acknowledge that a package of this type involves greater government intervention and initiative but it is directed at creating greater entrepreneurial effort in Australia. The vast resources of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Trade and Resources, which I have been focusing on, are available to make this effort. They should be directed to do so. Business in Australia has become disillusioned with monetarism. Investment projects are being deferred. Internationally we can expect the next few years to witness the demise of the fundamentalist policies of people such as Thatcher, Reagan and Fraser. That process has already begun in Europe. Similarly in Australia real hope for sustainable economic recovery lies in planned and co-operatively determined growth strategies rather than the confrontation and restriction practised by the current Administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I reject some of the tired old cliches that we have just heard from the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). Without putting too fine a point on it, what we are seeing now in 1981 is a far cry from what we saw a few brief years ago when businesses in droves were planning to leave this country if the Australian Labor Party were returned to office. We cannot say that business confidence in this country, whilst it can be better, is not at a much higher level than it was when this Government took over in 1975, and is increasing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I speak briefly on an aspect of business which I believe needs attention and where some improvements can be made. I speak about the compulsory distribution of the profits of private companies. In this country at the moment the best figures that are available to me show that some 66,000 private companies paid tax in the last financial year. Something like 130,000 private companies did not pay tax but, presumably, they are hoping in due course to move into the tax bracket as their businesses become more successful. The state of affairs at present is that under division 7 of the tax Act some 30 per cent of the profit of private companies must be distributed back to the shareholders. If they are not, then that 30 per cent of profit attracts an undistributed profits tax of some 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> There may be some historical reasons for this penalty on undistributed profits. There was a time when there was a differential tax on private and public companies. It can be argued that it is better now to have a tax on 30 per cent of the undistributed profits than the situation a couple of years ago when it was 50 per cent. But that is a fairly weak argument in my view. We should be moving to providing no penalty at all on the undistributed profits of private companies. I acknowledge that this tax provides a certain amount of revenue to the Government. Of course, this is not to be lightly dismissed at a time when the Government is trying to restrain its spending. This does not, in my view, outweigh the factors in support of abolishing the requirement of taxing undistributed profits. </PARA>
<PARA> In the main, there are two arguments that I put forward in support of the abolition of the tax on undistributed profits. The first is that this tax discriminates against private companies compared with public companies. Public companies are not required to distribute their profits. If they do not they are not subjected to a tax. They are in the hands of the shareholders. So, we have discrimination against private companies. A second main reason for the abolition of this tax is that it is preventing the development and expansion of the very people whom we should be encouraging-the small companies and the family companies which are establishing themselves and trying desperately to forge a business, to expand and to get on with the business of making Australia strong. Private companies find it very difficult to expand under the present climate, particularly at a time of high interest rates. The 30 per cent that goes to the shareholders under a forced distribution is further taxed. This taxing may be at whatever level the recipient pays tax-at 60 per cent, 46 per cent or 32 per cent. Once those people get the money in their hands they are taxed on it. Even if they wish to return the money to the company to which they belong there is very little left. It would seem to me that it is much better-if it is the shareholders' wish-for the money to be left in a company which is trying to expand. </PARA>
<PARA> This tax is a discriminatory provision. I have failed to find anyone in government or out, in the Public Service or in the private sector who believes that it is in any way justified and should be retained. I ask the Government to take note of this inconsistency. I believe that what I have suggested is very much in the interests of encouraging a stronger free enterprise economy. I ask the Government to move in the next Budget so that this provision is totally removed. The latest release of the Bureau of Industry Economics Research Report No. 10 entitled 'Finance for Small Business Growth and Development' states:</PARA>
<PARA> The investigation, based on data obtained from more than 4,000 firms, was the most extensive and detailed yet conducted on the availability of capital for small firms in Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA> 'While many small firms are successful in obtaining the funds needed to finance growth, the report reveals a number of apparent weaknesses in existing arrangements for financing small manufacturing and service enterprises' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Most of these enterprises are private companies. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA> 'These include a shortage of equity capital, inadequate sources of venture capital, particularly for product-innovative firms, and possibly a scarcity of start-up capital for new enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The report also explains why small firms may not benefit from the interest rate ceiling on bank loans of less than $100,000'. </PARA>
<PARA>I make the plea that as soon as possible this discriminatory provision be removed. It is one option that I am putting forward in a constructive way to help small business in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will direct the bulk of my remarks on the report of Estimates Committee F to the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. Let me say at the outset that the chief concern of the Opposition in reporting on the Estimates Committee proceedings relating to that Department is to emphasise the Government's total lack of credibility in this area. Although it probably would be more pleasant to report that the divergence of views between the Opposition and the Government on the running of this Department centres mainly on matters of detail, it has become increasingly plain over the last 12 months that this Government has no coherent strategy for promoting business activity in this country and has only a cursory and unsubstantial interest in consumer affairs. We cannot support that approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We adopt the view that the people who support us-the working class-have never been able to defend themselves adequately against shady business practices and shonky traders. The old caveat emptor saying has always reacted against the sort of people who support the Australian Labor Party. We cannot support the Government's refusal to accept any responsibility in the area of consumer affairs. In fact, we consider that the Government's lack of interest in this area is a national disgrace. Consumer protection under this Government is being methodically and mercilessly dismantled. There is now an inexorable trend of retardation towards the law of the jungle in this important area of consumer protection. Consumers have become practically defenceless against the highly complex, often invisible and increasingly sophisticated manipulation of corporate enterprise. I have chosen those words very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's conflict of interest in this area seems to stem from the Federal portfolio itself. It is almost a contradiction in terms for one Minister to be running the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs because, surely anybody with half a wit would realise that those interests are almost diametrically opposed. How can the Minister who is in charge of running the business of this country be charged with looking after the consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> No one, not even someone in fairyland, would consider that business is there to protect the consumer; it is there to make a profit. Thereby lies the conflict of interest. A snippet which appeared in the National Times dated 13 September stated that the Minister, Mr John Colinton Moore, admitted that his latest strait-jacketing of the Trade Practices Commission is 'principally because of philosophy, not to save money'. Such philosophy unashamedly asserts the right of business to operate without hindrance from consumer protection legislation. We in the Labor Party find this almost borders on levels of obscenity. </PARA>
<PARA> On each occasion that the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), the Labor spokesman on industry and commerce-he preceded me in this debate-with whom I share joint parliamentary responsibility for this Department, and I have raised questions either relating to industry policy, business affairs or consumer protection, we have been met with little more than blank looks and a lot of meaningless and unfulfilled rhetoric about so-called smaller government. Sound micro-economic policy and the degree of planning and Government involvement which of necessity go with it, have been left wanting because this administration is incapable of providing the sort of macro-economic environment in which all sectors of the business community can grow and prosper. If businesses are to succeed we must have a more adventurous policy on the part of government. No amount of special assistance to small businesses will curb the present bankruptcy rate of well in excess of 5,000 per annum-that is 100 bankruptcies a week throughout Australia; a figure which represents a 250 per cent leap on the prevailing rate in the mid-1970s-if enterprises are compelled to conduct their trade in conditions of economic recession, an avoidable economic recession which is being promoted by high interest rates and contractionary fiscal policies of a government afraid of growth and economic recovery because it knows it cannot put together a sensible pricing and incomes policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1981 we have seen the final abolition of the Prices Justification Tribunal after a long process of dismemberment and disembowelment. It may be argued that what was left of the PJT at the time that the Lynch razor gang finally wielded the knife probably was not worth saving. In terms of promoting this sensible prices and incomes policy that this country needs so badly, the PJT, as it stood after continued hatchet jobs by the Fraser Government on its powers and staffing, left it with little or no industrial relations role to play. Between 1975-76 when this Government came to power and the beginning of 1981 staff numbers of the PJT were reduced by about 50 per cent and its powers cut back to where it was commonly seen in industry and in the trade union movement as being a mere supervisor of inevitable price flow-ons to consumers. The facts are that this Government never gave the PJT a chance. It never provided it with adequate staff, resources, legislative power, or moral backing. It certainly never provided it with the sort of general economic backdrop of growth with stability that would have enabled the PJT to fulfil even a limited role in selectively bearing down on unjustified and unfair pricing practices. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we have the Petroleum Pricing Authority in its place. The fate of the PJT will no doubt serve as a warning to the PPA to ensure that it keeps not only to the letter of its legislative powers but also well within the unwritten ideological confines set by this Government. That is a pretty straight and narrow area. The PPA will have a staff of approximately 14-one for every million persons in Australia. This represents yet another drastic reduction of government commitment to this area on top of the reductions that I have noted earlier. Yet we will be told all this is presumably in the name of efficiency. Let me ask the Minister: How efficient is it to conduct substantial work on pricing in the aluminium industry because the Government suspects there is a massive rip-off going on and then refuse to make use of the results? Despite recent claims about lack of profitability in the industry it must be noted, as my colleague the honourable member for Adelaide has done on a number of occasions, that the price for Australian aluminium-a commodity in which everybody would agree we have a comparative advantage-has, despite the recent price cuts, remained relatively stable whilst the price of aluminium on the London Metals Exchange and the free market prices has plunged by at least 40 per cent since January 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is a substantial user of aluminium and aluminium products, yet it is even unwilling to provide the information which it has gleaned at great expense to satisfy the Australian taxpayer that he or she is getting value for money in government purchasing. Yet it would be wrong to suggest that the PJT has been the only area to suffer in the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. Both the Trade Practices Commission and the Industries Assistance Commission have suffered greater staff cuts than the overall 3 per cent lowering of staff ceiling to be implemented in the Public Service by 1982. The TPC does not even have a final staff figure set for June 1982. According to the Public Service Board annual report it is the only department or departmental authority not to have at least the dubious benefit of such a target to set its priorities over the next 12 months. Questioning by Opposition members at the Estimates Committee hearing produced responses from the Minister which served to emphasise the comments made in both the Trade Practices Commission and the Industries Assistance Commission annual reports that both those bodies were unable to fulfil the full scope of their charters because of government interference in their staffing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not overburdened with time so I will pass to another matter about which I questioned the Minister. It is related to another area of the Department of Industry and Commerce. I noted in the estimates that an amount of $750,000 was set down over a two-year period to alert the Australian public to the heinous results or the disastrous effects on the Australian economy of a move to a shorter working week in the metal trade industry. It appeared that this huge advertising campaign set out, with this large amount of money, to convince the Australian people what a disastrous situation it would be if working hours were reduced from 40 hours. Upon questioning the Minister he told me that the staff who have the job of implementing this advertising campaign and spending this $750,000 work 36 1/4 hours a week with flexitime. What a ridiculous situation it is that people working 36 1/4 hours have $750,000 to spend to tell the Australian people what a disastrous effect it would have on our economy if the metal workers got their week reduced from 40 hours. I think that fully sums up the attitude of this Government to most things, particularly in the business area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer very briefly to the estimates for the Department of National Development and Energy, that part of the estimates that allocates some $35m to water resource programs throughout Australia. I refer in particular to the salinity problems of the River Murray. Over the past few weeks and as a result of the tabling in this House yesterday of the new River Murray Waters Agreement we realise that constitutional difficulties have hampered and caused major indecision in the development of our national incentives affecting the long term well-being of Australia's greatest national resource, the Murray-Darling Basin. This is because, under the Constitution, States have a pre-eminent role in all aspects of water resources. The Commonwealth has become involved in these problems only at the request of the States or in response to Commonwealth initiatives but always-I emphasise 'always'-in co-operation with the States. I, and others in this House, have, to the point of frustration, put forward suggestions that national authorities be created to manage and monitor Australia's inland waters. A recent Senate select committee proposed the setting up of a national water commission, but all State governments have opposed this. A national authority for the Murray-Darling system, if it were to work effectively, would require the surrender by at least three States of practically all matters in the Murray-Darling catchment which affect water quantity and quality; that is, not only water regulation and allocation but also policy on irrigation development, land use for agriculture, forestry and industrial development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To date no State has agreed to cede or even to share these responsibilities with a national authority. At the outset I referred to the recent River Murray Waters Agreement. It has taken five years of negotiation for a new agreement which only gives the River Murray Commission responsibility to manage river quality. This new arrangement, which does place new responsibilities on the River Murray Commission, particularly formulates water quality objectives and standards for any part of the River Murray. It will also allow assessments of the implications of new developments which could have significant impact on water quality in the river and representations on any proposals which might adversely affect water quality. The new agreement will also allow further development of strategies to reduce salinity and other water quality problems in the river to manageable proportions. </PARA>
<PARA> There has already been too much parochialism, selfishness and political unawareness that has stopped effective and prompt action on Australian water research and control. I do not wish to add to that. We all know of the reasons why various States held off signing this agreement over the years and everyone must make his own political judgment on this. This case simply emphasises the difficulties. This new agreement only gives the River Murray Commission an advisory role in matters affecting water quality. It does not give it a managerial or enforcement role which would be necessary for a national water authority to be effective. While this parochialism is perhaps understandable, I believe that long term national development and research must be carried out by professionals without any restrictions, be they either financial or political. We should be able to develop a program of hydrological research and management over all these waters. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are many options that can be put forward for an expanded Commonwealth water research presence. They could, of course, include some of the arrangements laid out in the Bill which has been presented in this Parliament. More appropriately perhaps, we could expand existing organisations such as an institute within the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation or a division of water research within CSIRO. We could develop a bureau of water research within a Commonwealth department or have the option of having an expanded water research focus in the Department of National Development and Energy. I am personally fed up with the continuing waste of political and community energy and expertise on point scoring and squabbling. Courageous decisions have to be taken following credible unrestrictive research of programs of national importance. Obviously the Commonwealth has an important role to play in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently some 30 projects are either in progress or completed to mitigate salinity along the Murray River. But the question I pose is whether any will be adequate to stop further deterioration of our river system. For example, some $35m was provided by the Commonwealth for the construction of Dartmouth Dam and over $26m in loan funds has been provided to the three States to help them meet their respective shares of the cost of this project. Also some $36m has already been spent on major new salinity control projects in the Murray Valley since July 1978. The Commonwealth has provided $18m of this as it matches contributions by the States. I think some heart can be taken about the problems that exist in the Murray-Darling basin from River Murray Commission figures that show that while last year had the second lowest river flow in 15 years, salinity levels were better than those in the 1967-68 drought, indicating that existing works have had some impact. </PARA>
<PARA> I am extremely concerned about a project that is presently under way and which the Commonwealth has shared in the funding. That is a project in my electorate called the mineral reserves scheme. I make it quite clear that the responsibility for the decision to establish this scheme was the State Government's. Whilst the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission and back bench public works committee in Victoria recommended the scheme, the final decision must lie with the Victorian Government. There are a number of questions that I would like to have answered about this scheme before it proceeds. Why has there not been full consideration or a research program to develop a major pipeline to the sea? Why was this not considered? How long are we to tolerate the disposal of one region's problems to another area? How long can we continue to create unsightly expanses of saline wasteland or brine lakes, sometimes flooding natural flood plains, wildlife habitats or productive farming lands? How long can we guarantee that new projects will not expand the enormous problem of dry land salinity that is developing in the Mallee region? As desalination technology improves, are we fully capable of monitoring these techniques and considering them as feasible alternatives?</PARA>
<PARA> I will give some examples of my reason for questioning the effectiveness of this scheme. It has been estimated by the Victorian State Rivers and Water Supply Commission that the benefits of the mineral reserves basin schemes are a reduction of only 11EC units at Mildura and 7EC units at Morgan, South Australia, at a cost of some $5,500,000. The benefits of the Mildura-Merbein-Buronga interception scheme that is presently operating is a reduction of 9EC units in river saline quality. I also note that the estimated reduction in EC units of the Lake Tyrell proposal that is anticipated to follow the mineral reserves scheme is some 35EC units. I ask the House to relate these figures to the 1.3 million tonnes of salt that enters the River Murray annually over its full length. Thirty six per cent of this salt intake occurs along the South Australian section of the river. To emphasise further the immensity of this salt load, it is the equivalent of some 350 ten-tonne trucks each tipping a full load of salt into the river every day. I believe that no issue is of more importance to this House or to the Australian community than the future viability of the River Murray. I urge all States to give up their parochial interests and urge the Commonwealth to indicate its total and unrestricted support to ensuring the preservation of our nation's most valuable resource. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will address my remarks on the report of Estimates Commitee F to the appropriation for the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. I am sorry that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) is not in the House tonight when his Department's appropriation is being debated. I remind the Minister of two speeches I made in this House concerning the tariff on imported wheel-chairs. On 29 April I explained how the House put some imported wheel-chairs beyond the range of the average disabled person who is struggling to buy one. Again, on 2 June I joined my colleague the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) in calling for the tariff arrangements to be replaced with a bounty scheme to local producers. In this International Year of Disabled Persons I again urge the Government to introduce a bounty and to get rid of the tariff. If a bounty is good enough to help farmers buy tractors and superphosphates, it is good enough to help disabled people buy wheel-chairs. It is interesting to read the debate in Hansard of 2 June, page 2966 and to find that after the debate concluded the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs gave notice that he would introduce a Bill for an Act to provide for the payment of a bounty on the production of certain printed fabrics. Also he was to present a Bill for an Act to provide for the payment of a bounty on the production of certain textile yarns. While not opposing the introduction of either bounty, which cost the taxpayer approximately $75m, I ask the Minister: What do he and his Government have against the disabled? Why superphosphate, tractors, textile yarns and printed fabrics? Why not wheel-chairs for the disabled?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Disabled people are currently paying a tariff of 34 per cent on imported electric wheel-chairs. That is equivalent to approximately $1,000 on a chair. This is an enormous burden to place on people who are already disadvantaged by the necessity to have a wheel-chair. On top of the cost of $3,000 for an electric wheel-chair, it costs a disabled person $20 to $30 a week to maintain it. A wheel-chair in constant use lasts only a few years. The Government has indicated that the tariff will reduce to 20 per cent over two years, but I point out to the Minister that this is still 5 per cent higher than the tariff which existed prior to 1 January 1980. The decision on the tariff ignores the fact that there was a thriving wheel-chair industry in Australia when the tariff was only 15 per cent. It is obvious that the Government does not understand the problems faced by disabled people in obtaining aids for daily living. The Executive Director of the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled said that the Government had ignored the views of disabled people. ACROD, in its submission to the Industries Assistance Commission in 1980, indicated the massive cost of being disabled and recommended a bounty of 20 per cent on wheel-chairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia does manufacture a great variety of wheel-chairs, but mostly they are manufactured on a one-off basis. The Australian wheel-chairs are powered by two ordinary wet cell batteries. They are very heavy and many of them are not capable of being transported in the boot of a car. In contrast, the Omega chair, which looks more like a golf buggy than a conventional wheel-chair, is highly mobile, can be turned in limited areas such as in a lift, and its seat resembles that of a normal office chair. It can be rotated through 360 degrees so that it can be backed up to a table. The user can turn the seat through 180 degrees to sit at a table in a chair which looks very little different from a dining or conference chair. Furthermore, it is powered by a battery called a gel cell, which requires no maintenance, contains no acids and is the only battery which under international aircraft regulations can be carried aboard passenger aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> The Omega wheel-chair is designed for use inside buildings. It is designed for persons who have some limited mobility. It is useful for travelling in hospitals, libraries, factories, large offices or outdoors in the garden. The heavier Australian wheel-chair is designed largely for outdoor use. It is heavier, sturdier and far less easy to transport. No similar or equivalent wheel-chair to the Omega is manufactured in Australia. Therefore, if the tariff were removed and a bounty substituted, we would not be creating unfair competition for Australian manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> In this International Year of Disabled Persons, about which Government members have spoken so much and done so very little, the removal of the tariff from these wheel-chairs would be a gesture appreciated by all Australians, not just by the disabled. The cost to the Government would be negligible. The wheel-chair industry would not suffer from the introduction of a bounty. I urge the Minister, even at this late date, to introduce a bounty for the wheel-chair industry. I point out to the Minister and Government members that disability is defined as the loss of bodily function. Handicap is man-made through our legislative, environmental and social barriers. Why does the Government not back up those disabled people who are wanting to import a wheel-chair? Why does it not support those people, introduce a bounty, remove the tariff and let disabled people choose whether they want an Australian manufactured wheel-chair or an imported wheel-chair, with no loss to either the disabled person or to the industry?</PARA>
<PARA> The two basic convictions on which the Government should have approached this matter are: Firstly, the needs of the wheel-chair user are of primary importance as a wheel-chair is a necessity, not a luxury; and, secondly, the existence of a viable Australian wheel-chair manufacturing industry is necessary to supply both standard and non-standard units to cater for specific disabilities. We also need an efficient, viable Australian wheel-chair manufacturing industry to provide an efficient maintenance and parts supply service. A bounty would attend to this and would also give some relief to disabled people. I think the Minister is unaware that the majority of disabled people, particularly young paraplegics, live on invalid pensions. One cannot buy very many imported wheel-chairs on an invalid pension. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe it is appropriate for disabled people to have to bear the cost of protecting the local industry. I believe it is a community and therefore a Government responsibility. The Government responsible for this is the Government that is introducing taxes on newspapers, books and pet food. It is the Government that is introducing taxes on clothing, building requirements and the screenings, bitumen, tar and other necessities of road construction. I suggest that it is about to go down in history as the Government that taxes wheel-chairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words relating to a matter which concerns the Department of National Development and Energy. I follow more or less what was said tonight by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher), who dealt with the Murray River area. My main concern is water resources throughout Australia. I do not think that the need for a water resources program can be overemphasised or that any resource is in greater need of development than are water resources within Australia. The honourable member for Mallee pointed out tonight, and it certainly has been pointed out in the House previously in recent days and weeks, that there is a very great problem with the Murray River. We can learn a lot from what has occurred over a century with the Murray. We have to appreciate that it takes in about one-seventh of Australia, draining not only areas of Victoria and New South Wales but also a part of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The area through which the river flows was settled in 1824 and ever since the river has been used for the purposes of irrigation, pleasure, generation of power and supplying water for domestic use. It has reached the stage at which it is basically worn out. We should learn a lesson from that. The Commonwealth and the States have a great responsibility to research and over the years to adopt a suitable program for water resources development in Australia. Possibly, there is no drier continent on earth. The rainfall around the continent is very varied indeed. Much of Australia is desert land, much is semi-arid land and, of course, we have agricultural land around the seaboard. We often hear people say that they are fed up with seeing so many millions of tonnes of water flowing daily into the sea. Most of the water resources development in Australia is basically a State responsibility. However I do not want to pin that responsibility entirely upon the States because I believe that the Commonwealth has a responsibility to co-ordinate the States so that over the years sufficient money will be set aside to look after the natural water resources throughout Australia. I am concerned that most of the States have in the works being undertaken by them no great regard for the consequences of those works in a national context. In my electorate of Lyne, on the New South Wales coastline and in the Hunter Valley area, often the need is emphasised for water for industry, water for domestic purposes and water for irrigation. Over many years many thousands of acres within the Hunter Valley have been irrigated by water from the Hunter River. Those farmers today are running short of water simply because of the demand by industry. How do we develop a general program covering all the river valleys within Australia which have a high concentration of agriculture, a growing concentration of industry and an increasing population? I advocate that we should accept our national responsibility for water resources and, with the States, try over the years to adopt a program that will meet the environmental demands of the people and the countryside, that will meet the demand for water for domestic, industrial and farming purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> In this country we are very dependent on the export of our primary industry products and the sale of our natural resources, such as coal and other minerals, is growing in importance. These industries require a great amount of water. I hope that, as we approach Australia's bicentenary, we will all place particular emphasis on improving Australia by protecting our important natural resources of water, soil and trees by undertaking a program of water management, soil conservation and tree planting throughout the continent. It is appropriate to look at this matter in the bicentenary year and accept some definite responsibilities for it. Water resource programs do return money to the people of Australia. In other words, they are a sound investment of public funds. This has been proved over the years in the returns so far as labour on the farms and in the industry are concerned, in the general profits that bring about the development of our countryside, and certainly in improving the standard of living of the Australian people. I often wonder whether we ought to take a page out of the book of America, or the other countries of the world who over the years have encouraged private enterprise to develop the water resources. </PARA>
<PARA> From the public point of view, in California and other American States one finds that over the years governments have encouraged private people and private companies to put many millions of dollars into water resource development around the countryside. One has only to go to the Westlands water district of California to see what can be done with the harnessing of snow waters, to see the tremendous production that has taken place in desert lands along the coast and inland over the years. If we are to meet our responsibilities in the years to come to feed not only our own people but also the people of the world, and particularly the Third World, we have to measure up now and do something about our water resources generally within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1980s is the appropriate time-due to the growth of the population, the growth in demand for goods produced in Australia, and the need to keep our standards of living high-to look upon water as gold. We cannot continue to let water flow into the sea. We cannot continue to allow our agricultural lands in dry farming areas to be affected by drought, in many instances not only without water for irrigation but also without water for stock and domestic purposes. I strongly urge the Government to join with the States to encourage, financially and in every way possible, the proper planning of water resources, to recognise the importance of water generally to Australia, to recognise that development is essential, to recognise that there is a very good return for the investment made, and at the same time to ensure the water supplies that are necessary today for all forms of industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, it worries me that not only in the Budgets of the Commonwealth but also in the Budgets of all the States of Australia the emphasis on the productivity side of our industries is diminishing. We should encourage, financially and otherwise, development on the farms and in the mineral industries of Australia. We should encourage private enterprise to expand. There is a responsibility, I believe, for governments to look at the direction of the general funding in the Budgets and to see that a greater percentage of the taxpayers' money is spent on the sorts of development I have spoken about tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Estimates Committee F, which covered the Department of National Development and Energy, I raised the matter of the National Energy Office, and quoted from the Department's annual report, which described the role of the National Energy Office in relation to Loan Council approvals and the approval of infrastructure grants to the States for electricity authorities. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The National Energy Office is involved in the review of State proposals submitted for Loan Council approval and the provision of advice on future capital requirements and financing of electricity systems within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest tonight that the Government, particularly through the Department of National Development and Energy, has now placed the country in a very serious situation with respect to electricity supply and particularly with respect to the pricing of electricity in this country, which in turn reflects the difficulties in terms of the cost structure of the electricity industry. I believe that this situation has arisen very much as a product of the enthusiasm-I think one would say the over-zealous enthusiasm-of the Government to get into the business of resource-based development and resource-based recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> What resource-based means, in effect, is that Australia's energy resources are to be exploited in various ways to enable exports of energy to take place and, it is hoped, through that process to improve the national income. In that enthusiasm the Government has been rather insensitive to some of the difficulties that might be involved. When one is talking about energy policy, or indeed any other aspect of policy, one has to recognise relationships. One of the industries that has been quite central to the Government's thinking and the Government's enthusiasm is the aluminium industry. As we all know, that industry has been taken on in this country as a major area of investment because the international companies believe that Australia will be able to supply cheap energy. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have had two parallel developments, one in the private sector and the other in the public sector, and they are both very closely related. In the private sector, a number of commitments have been made to establish aluminium smelters in particular in various sites around the country. Indeed, at the beginning of this year it was estimated that aluminium production would move from its current level of capacity of something like 369,000 tonnes per annum to a capacity by 1984 of 1,398,000 tonnes, or nearly 1.4 million tonnes. There was going to be a dramatic increase in aluminium production. Because aluminium is an energy-intensive industry which makes use of electricity power, there would also need to be a massive expansion of electricity generation across the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last few years the Government has been encouraging the States to get into a dramatic increase in capital works in the electricity area and to build power stations around the country. Simultaneously, we had an increase in private investment in the aluminium industry, and we had the Commonwealth Government encouraging the States to move into the very rapid expansion of capital facilities for electricity generation right down the eastern coast of Australia and even extending to Western Australia, where smelters are also proposed. Clearly the Commonwealth Government has had a central role in this whole area. The Commonwealth Government is the Government that said recovery would be based on resources and on energy. It was the Commonwealth Government that went to the Loan Council in 1978 and encouraged the States to take out increased loans. We have had a dramatic increase over that period in infrastructure loans from the Commonwealth over and above the normal loan capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give some figures. From 1978 until this year we have moved from $150m to a figure very much higher than that-something like $800m. There has been a dramatic increase in the infrastructure loans that the States have been encouraged to get into over and above the considerable loan capacity that they have in general terms. I was surprised to find out in the Committee hearing that this has all taken place without any effective assessment by the Federal Government. I had the opportunity to question the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) about the basis on which the National Energy Office assessed the viability of the various projects to which loans were being directed. I was told both by an officer of the Department and by the Minister that our assessments, to quote Mr Ives, 'are related to the nature of the particular project that is proposed'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The question of its ultimate financial viability is a matter for the State Government which has put the proposal forward. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Trade and Resources said:</PARA>
<PARA> We just accept a total figure-not a feasibility operation, but just a total capital figure for the program; that is what is presented to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Commonwealth in its enthusiasm for aluminium and electricity generation is encouraging the States to get into billions of dollars of investment for electricity generation. It has not done any assessment of the financial viability of the various projects. It has not, for example, even sought or tried to compel the States to reveal basic data such as the prices to be charged to the various companies which are seeking to secure access to Australian power. I think that has produced what is now a very critical situation. Since the beginning of this year we have seen a dramatic decline in the expected expansion of the aluminium industry. Whereas at the beginning of this year it was estimated that it would expand to 1.4 million tonnes by 1984, the revised forecast, if we remove Alcan at Bundaberg, take out Lochinvar, which was Alumax and now BHP, and take out Alcan expansion at Kurri Kurri, the figure comes down to 817,000 tonnes in 1984. The Portland smelter proposed by Alcoa has to be seen now as being in very considerable doubt. On the other hand, the electricity authorities have been grinding away getting into the most massive capital works projects in this country's history on the assumption that there will be a dramatic increase in aluminium production up to the kinds of figures that were being spoken about only 12 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> This year the Commonwealth has got cold feet. It has said to the States: 'We really think that you are rushing into this electricity generation which a little while ago we were encouraging you to rush into. You will have to cut back on your loan programs. Indeed you will have to finance these capital works from your own revenues rather than through a loan'. What does that mean? According to a consultant report to which I referred earlier today, it means that if 50 per cent of the funds which it is necessary for these authorities to raise each year are raised internally then we can expect to see on top of the 40 per cent increase power prices in Victoria and New South Wales over the last 18 months another 50 per cent increase in electricity tariffs. That is all a result of the failure of the Federal Government, in my view, to plan effectively in an area of energy in which clearly it has a direct interest and in which, through the Loan Council, it has considerable powers. We are moving very dramatically into a situation where not only the motorist will be paying record high prices for petrol but also ordinary domestic consumers will be paying very high prices for electricity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to confine my remarks this evening to the Department of Industry and Commerce. In particular, I would like to speak on behalf of several thousand constituents in my electorate of Isaacs who will be affected by decisions that will be taken by this Government in the near future in regard to the motor vehicle industry. I have received several thousand open letters from workers in my electorate, mainly in the automotive component parts side of the motor vehicle industry. The overall number of people affected in the bayside region of Melbourne could be around 7,000, that is, taking families into account. All of those people are concerned about their future and the future of their families. They have requested my assistance to urge the Government to keep the Australian motor vehicle industry strong and viable, to safeguard job opportunities for Australians and to encourage new investment in the industry. These letters have come from people who work for companies in my electorate and from others who reside in the electorate. Companies such as Yazaki, Lucas Industries, Nylex, Kaufmann, Dorman, Repco, Patons Brake Replacements and Bosch have also been in touch with me in regard to this vital question of tariff protection for the industry. Of course, all of these companies are component parts manufacturers in the bayside region of Melbourne. I sincerely hope that the Government will take heed of these petitions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On behalf of all of my constituents, I now put forward a few points for consideration. Australia needs to continue with the existing 80-20 quota system or replace it only with a system that ensures 80 per cent of the market for Australian production. Australia's local content plan must also continue. At present this represents 85 per cent of the market. Australia's automotive component parts industry employs many tens of thousands of people. They cannot be pushed aside by the thrust of an increasing amount of imports into the country. However, we on this side of the House believe that a rationalisation of the industry over a number of years must take place. It must take place in consultation with the industry because we must strive to become more competitive. This can occur through research, technology, better planning, better management and greater productivity. Standardisation of parts is another likely step that would help the industry and make it more economic and competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> However, one thing which troubles me is the number of vehicle manufacturers. Five vehicle manufacturers are too many. I believe a country the size of Australia in population and economy can find room for only three at the most. However, above all else, the changes that I have mentioned must be part of a co-ordinated, managed change to benefit the Australian motor vehicle industry and the tens of thousands of people who work in that industry. The human and social elements of any decision that the Government may make must be very carefully considered. When one stands in front of hundreds of people to tell them that their jobs and their futures are at stake one suddenly realises the real human tragedy that could occur if the Government was to pander to one section of the industry or to foreign corporations at the expense of thousands whose whole futures may be put at risk by such a decision. The motor vehicle industry is the base of our manufacturing industry. We need to strengthen it, not dismantle it. Our manufacturing industry needs to be strengthened in order to assist with the massive task of supplying jobs for Australians in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> During a debate on a matter of public importance on 15 September this year the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) estimated that Australia would require two and a half million jobs in the 1980s to keep pace with the expanding work force and ease the unemployment situation in the country. However, although our manufacturing industry will not be able to supply all of those jobs, a strong and viable industry is needed to create its share of employment for the future. I wish to quote from that debate on 15 September. In proposing the matter of public importance regarding the motor vehicle industry the honourable member for Adelaide said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is the future of scores of component parts manufacturers and the tens of thousands of workers they employ whose livelihoods are in jeopardy. It goes beyond this. There is the steel industry, the glass industry, the tyre rubber industry, the forging industry-the list is endless. </PARA>
<PARA>Any reasonable Australian can see that the motor vehicle industry and the component parts manufacturers in that industry are very important to this country. I strongly urge the Government to take up and consider very carefully the points that I have raised tonight. I urge the Government to consider the future of the motor vehicle industry and the tens of thousands of people who form a very important part of that industry when making its final decision in the near future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take up the matters raised by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe) concerning the restrictions and constraints on State infrastructure as a result of the so-called acceleration in the resource development program or resource development boom. Very great constraints are being made on public infrastructure. I am of the opinion that some State governments and even sections of the Labor movement do not seem to realise that economic benefits and disadvantages are involved in all of this. For instance, it is well known that the present Government and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) decided at the last Loan Council meeting in June to restrain the infrastructure borrowing program for this financial year. However, power developments alone in three States already have a committed borrowing capacity over the next five to six years of some $9,000m, not taking into account projects that have been rejected at this stage, such as the Bunbury coal-fired power station in Western Australia at a cost of $700m or projects that might yet be submitted, such as the hydro-electric schemes in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very concerned that as the infrastructure borrowing program blows out to service this so-called resource development boom the disadvantage will be seen as follows: The borrowing programs and the State semi-government authorities and larger authorities have increased over the last three years by some 15 per cent, yet the general purpose capital borrowing programs have declined by some 30 per cent over the same period and the local government borrowing programs have declined by at least 10 per cent. So there is the disadvantage there. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very concerned also with two other aspects. The first relates to employment. We on the Opposition benches are not at all convinced that the employment prospects in this area about which the Government talks are anywhere near as rosy as they are purported to be. For instance, the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs says that to 1986 only 60,000 permanent jobs will be available in this mining and minerals processing area. The Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research of the University of Melbourne gives an even lower figure of 40,000. Even if we are very generous, applying a multiplier factor of some three to one, we can see that no more than 180,000 permanent jobs will be provided in this area up to 1986. The Department of Employment and Youth Affairs estimates that we would need to create up to 130,000 jobs a year until 1986 just to keep unemployment at its present level. That is 650,000 new jobs. The Government is to provide 180,000 jobs from resource development. I invite the House to draw its own conclusions as to the contribution towards total employment that we can expect from resource development. This is not to put an argument against per se; we need rationalised development not only to cater for minerals processing and mining but also to preserve, expand and service the manufacturing sector and to preserve jobs in the export rural competing sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to turn to a question directed by me to the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) at the Estimates Committee hearing. It related to the Imhausen study into coal to oil technology. It is self-explanatory. I said to the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA> These projects will require large water resources, electricity resources, and coal resources. Given the present state of competition between the States in their attempts to attract such projects with the connotations for capital requirements and possible damage to the environment and so on, if we get too far down this track by allowing this State competition situation to continue, will the Federal Government be concerned to determine an order for the development of the projects, particularly in environmentally sensitive areas, such as the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, or will it simply take a sort of free market approach and let State governments and the companies and consortiums concerned run the state of play, at least up to the assessment stage?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA> We will be leaving it entirely to the States to determine the priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked why that was so in light of the resources that are going to be used, financial and material. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> You tell me what authority the Commonwealth has to do otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA>I said:</PARA>
<PARA> You have other instruments. </PARA>
<PARA>He replied:</PARA>
<PARA> You tell me. </PARA>
<PARA>He did not know. I ask the House: What sort of reaction is that from a Federal Minister and a Federal Government? A coal to oil plant producing 50,000 barrels of oil a day, using 10 million tonnes of coal at a cost of $1 billion would consume a very large quantity of electricity. If we were to produce from coal as much oil as we now get from Bass Strait we would need to double Australian black coal production-that is if we used black coal for feedstock. What I am getting at is that, despite the vast demands on financial and material resources that these projects and other resource development projects will make, the Minister is really saying that the Commonwealth will leave it up to the companies, both national and transnational, and to State governments to make the decisions and then we will have to live with the economic consequences. That is what it is saying. That is the sort of irrational economic behaviour that is leading us into the problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members opposite were talking about a blow-out of the Loan Council borrowing program. I remind them that their own Prime Minister rejected the application by the Court Government in Western Australia for borrowing approval to obtain funds to build a $600m coal-fired station at Bunbury in Western Australia to service the Reynolds aluminium smelter that now does not look like going ahead. I am simply putting to this Parliament an argument for rationalisation and sanity in these matters. There is only so much money in the economic washbasin, so to speak, to go around and if we put it all into this area it will be the social areas that will be disadvantaged. I turn now to a situation that I think is scandalous. Despite the fact that this financial year we are getting $3.3 billion in oil revenue, only $15m has been allocated for research into alternative liquid fuels. Over the last three years the Government, despite vast sums from oil revenue, has invested only $4.2 billion in ethanol research and $536,000 in research into obtaining methanol from natural gas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude by drawing to the attention of the House the continuing scandal of the Fortescue oil field. There are 280 million barrels of oil in this field in Bass Strait. On the advice of the Bureau of Mineral Resources the Government classified it as new oil-that is, oil discovered after 1975. The Bureau of Mineral Resources made that recommendation on the advice of Esso-BHP. I wish to put on record that that is not a new field at all, but part of the old Halibut-Cobia field. By classifying it as new oil this Government is forgoing between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in revenue which could be gained through resource rent taxation or by application of the present oil levy policy. Out of the payment of all expenses, including operating costs, royalties and depreciation, the company will get $412m per annum in gross profit, or $7.2 billion gross profit over the 17.5 year life of the field. After paying $3.3 billion in company tax it will be left with almost $4 billion, and this should clearly be subject to a levy just as old oil is at present. This figure should be subject to a resources tax or the current oil levy policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the prime piece of legislation we are debating is the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill which provides funds for the next triennium to universities, colleges of advanced education and technical and further education institutions around Australia. However, there are some major new provisions included in that legislation. The first of those is the attempt by the Government to impose tertiary tuition fees in respect of students studying for second or higher degrees. The other major new part of this legislation is to effect the amalgamations of certain colleges of advanced education which flow from the report of the razor gang. However, neither this legislation nor any of its major initiatives do anything to solve the serious problems besetting tertiary education in this country. There are some consequential Bills which flow from the decision of the Government to impose tertiary tuition fees. They are the Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Bill to amend the CCAE Act and the Australian National University Amendment Bill (No. 2) to amend the ANU Act. The major provisions of those two Bills give the governing bodies of those two institutions the power to impose fees in accordance with the determination made by the Minister for Education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to indicate from the outset what the Opposition intends to do in respect of this legislation. In the first instance, I will at a later time be moving an amendment to the motion for the second reading of this Bill in terms which I will refer to later. Secondly, we will be opposing outright clause 6 of the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill, that being the clause which seeks to give power to the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) to determine fees for certain classes of students in universities and the colleges of advanced education. We will oppose outright the CCAE Amendment Bill because that Bill simply seeks to give to that institution power to charge and collect fees. In relation to the ANU Amendment Bill we will be opposing those clauses which seek to give power to the governing body in respect of the charging of fees in relation to certain students. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is not our intention to hold up the passage of this legislation. We are as concerned as anyone to see that the money which will be appropriated by the States grants legislation flows through to the universities, colleges and TAFE institutions around Australia. However, the point that we make and will continue to make both here and in another place is that it is vitally important that clause 6 of the States grants legislation and any consequential pieces of legislation be vigorously opposed. The reasons for opposing them are quite simply these: The Minister for Education (Mr Fife) said specifically before the last Federal election that the Government was not considering any proposals in relation to the reintroduction of tertiary tuition fees. There is no doubt what the Minister meant by that. There is no doubt what the Minister intended people to understand by that remark. He wanted to assure people who were concerned about the question of tertiary tuition fees that the Liberal-National Country Party, if re-elected, would not reintroduce tertiary tuition fees. However, a few months later the Government took a decision to reintroduce tertiary tuition fees in respect of certain classes of students. It is a direct breach of a promise. That is why we will be opposing that particular legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe we have every right to use any legislative or parliamentary mechanism to oppose any provision which breaches an undertaking given by the Government prior to an election. Of course, the Minister could take the view taken by his representative at a meeting at the ANU a few days ago. Senator Teague said then that he was empowered by the Minister for Education to give an undertaking to the gathering that the Government had no intention of reintroducing fees for first degree students. When somebody in the audience interjected to the effect that that was what the Minister and the Government had said in respect of all tertiary tuition fees prior to the last election, Senator Teague simply said: 'Oh, but that was an undertaking given in the context of an election campaign'. That is, Senator Teague was saying that it is quite all right to tell lies during an election campaign. Nobody expects any undertaking or promise given by this Government to be honoured. We will ensure that we keep the Government to its promise and that it is not able to reintroduce tertiary tuition fees in any respect as a result of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has to recognise that the fate of this legislation is absolutely in its hands. If it is sufficiently intransigent not to accept any amendments which might be passed in another place, amendments designed to keep this Government honest, to keep it to its election promises, it will be entirely on its head if the funds appropriated for universities and CAEs dry up at the end of this year, as they will unless this legislation is passed in the near future. It will not be our fault. It will not be Senate's fault. It will be this Government's intransigence, its refusal to be kept to an election undertaking given prior to the general election last year. The Minister has to realise that he is now considered to be an unreliable Minister. People now recognise that they cannot trust him because the undertaking he gave before the last election has been breached. It does not matter what he says about his intentions and those of the Government in relation to fees in the future for other classes of students. No one will believe him. No one should believe him because he is unreliable, he has been caught out, and he has told a lie. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point that has to be made is that the Government is intent with this legislation on re-establishing the principle of tertiary tuition fees. It is intent on re-establishing a fee collecting mechanism. That is what this legislation is all about. That is why we are intent on opposing it. If this Government were successful in re-establishing the principle of fees for students studying for second or higher degrees and if it were successful in forcing universities and CAEs to re-establish a fee collecting network, it would be a quite simple matter for it in the future, without much fuss or bother, to extend the application of fees to include a vast array of other classes of students. That reason, if no other, is sufficient for us to oppose vigorously the reintroduction of fees. It is not just a question of the impact of fees on the admittedly relatively small group of students to whom they apply; it is the question of preventing the re-establishment of a principle which this Government would have no hesitation in extending to include other groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government and this Minister are simply playing up to a small rump on the back bench which believes fervently in the idea that tertiary tuition fees should be charged universally. The honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) is probably the ringleader of this group, but there are plenty of others whom one could name and with whom I have debated this matter both in and out of the House. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) is one of them. Those honourable members take the view that it is important to re-establish tertiary tuition fees for everybody. They believe that there is at the moment a bias in favour of the sons and daughters of the rich amongst those who are currently attending universities and CAEs. That goes without saying. The social composition of the student population of tertiary institutes is heavily biased in favour of the sons and daughters of the rich. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Casey points to the fact that one of the prime reasons why the Labor Government at the beginning of the 1974 academic year abolished tertiary tuition fees and introduced a means-tested living allowance was to produce, in the words of the then Minister, ' a revolution of access'. In a small way that occurred. One of the ways in which it occurred, which the honourable member for Casey probably does not realise, is that there has been in the intervening period a vast explosion in the number of mature age students who have either returned to or commenced tertiary studies mainly because of the absence of tertiary fees. It is my suggestion that many of those people would not have had the opportunity to attend universities or CAEs at the age when it is normal to do so simply because of the existence of fees. For that group at least there has been a substantial opening of opportunities for tertiary education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another thing which I dare say the honourable member for Casey overlooks is that there have been vastly changed economic circumstances between 1974 and the present. Nobody knows what would have happened to tertiary enrolments or to the social composition of tertiary institutions had fees remained. My suggestion is that had fees remained during times of much more stringent economic circumstances very many fewer children from poorer and middle income families would have been able to make it to universities or CAEs. I think it goes without saying that the abolition of fees from the beginning of the 1974 academic year has had a substantial effect in opening up educational opportunities for a vast number of people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> What the proponents of fees cannot indicate is that the imposition of fees would in any way assist in opening up opportunities in this area. Certainly, in the short term it would not. My guess is that in the short term it would have a very deleterious effect and the net result would be to scare off a vast number of potential enrolments. Their theory, of course, is that if fees are charged to those students whose parents can afford to pay them we can use the revenue so gained to make it easier for the kids from lower and middle income families to get to universities or CAEs. But if they do their sums and work out how much revenue actually would be gained from the imposition of fees at the level at which they are now proposed they will see that it would be insufficient to improve the opportunities for most of the people whom they, if we can take them at face value, seek to help. Already we know that the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance is so insufficient as to deter a number of would-be entrants into tertiary education. The first objective which has to be satisfied is the improvement of the financial support available to students. I do not hear any of the proponents of the reintroduction of fees talking of improving the TEAS allowance and the availability of financial support to students. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the first matter that has to be addressed. Another is that the proponents of tertiary education fees seem to ignore the fact that the main reason why we do not get enough people into tertiary institutions and the main reason why the social mix is so biased is that so few children get to the end of secondary school. That is another problem which they fail to address, a problem that simply would not be solved by the reintroduction of tertiary tuition fees. We ought to be implementing the sorts of policies which would encourage more and more of the kids who enter secondary schools to complete secondary schooling, meet the conditions for tertiary admission and proceed to some sort of tertiary study. Under this Government the exact reverse has happened. For the first time in over 25 years there has been an increasing dropout rate amongst people in secondary school. Fewer are getting to the end, and of those who get to the end fewer are going on directly to some form of full time tertiary study. </PARA>
<PARA> None of those serious problems which confront us in terms of the policy for tertiary education are in any way alleviated-I suggest that they are greatly exacerbated-by the imposition of tertiary tuition fees generally. It is not just that we are interested in opposing these fees for the group of students who will have to pay them. We are opposed to the re-establishment of the principle of tertiary tuition fees in general. That, I repeat, is what the Government is really interested in. It is not interested in the relatively small amount which it will get, which the institutions will get, as a result of the imposition of fees. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1981-82 intends to appropriate something like $1,865m for colleges, universities and technical and further education institutions around Australia. The Government says that in the next calendar year it will get no more than $8m as a result of the imposition of fees. Even that, I suggest, is an extraordinarily optimistic estimate. The Government has said that before June next year the institutions will get $4m from the fees and that they would get another $4m in the second half of the calendar year 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) was struck with a bout of honesty this afternoon. He said in the Senate this afternoon that only 4,000 students would be paying fees next year. As the maximum fee which it is proposed will be payable under this legislation is $1,000, that suggests that a maximum of $4m would be gained in the whole of next year as a result of the imposition of these fees. I suspect that Senator Carrick is far closer to the mark. I suspect that the Government, as I said, has probably doubled the amount it is likely to get as a result of the imposition of a $1,000 fee on students. Perhaps there is another reason for Senator Carrick's candour. Senator Carrick has always been an opponent of tertiary tuition fees. When the reintroduction of fees was first suggested in 1976 he went to battle to prevent the reintroduction of tertiary tuition fees in any form. Perhaps his revised estimate of the revenue from this proposal is simply an acknowledgement of his overall opposition to the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other reasons why the fee proposal ought to be opposed. It is an attempt quite selectively to penalise those students who are least able to pay. Let us look particularly at the plight of post-graduate students. A small number of post-graduate students receive Commonwealth or university awards. The amounts that they receive are very stingy indeed. They are scarcely enough to keep body and soul together. Yet those are the ones who are exempt from fees. The ones who receive nothing-the post-graduate students who are supporting themselves-are to be singled out for a selective $1,000 a year penalty because they want to proceed with some form of post-graduate studies. </PARA>
<PARA> This is grossly unfair. It take no account of the needs of those studients or their ability to pay. It overlooks entirely the enormous contribution which post-graduate students are making to the vital research effort which is being made, particularly in universities around this country. It also ignores the fact that, over the last few years, opportunities for employment of post-graduate students have declined substantially. There are far fewer part time or full time tutorships and part time demonstrator or full time demonstrator positions available in universities and colleges. That is largely because of the substantial cutbacks in recurrent funding which have been visited upon these institutions. Those have been the areas in which the most drastic cutbacks in staff numbers have occurred in recent times. I now seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard two tables from the Tertiary Education Commission's report relating to student numbers in higher education and participation rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other issue which is raised quite directly by this legislation is the question of amalgamations. The House will remember that, as a result of the decision of the razor gang and the Government's acceptance of its report, something like 30 colleges were earmarked for closure by the beginning of next year. Rather I should say that they were to have their funding discontinued unless they were able to come forward or unless State governments were able to come forward with acceptable amalgamation proposals in respect of those colleges. I think that we are entitled to suspect that some sort of conspiracy is being waged against advanced education. During the last decade there was an enormous expansion in the advanced education sector. The future of many of those colleges is certainly under a cloud; that is, the darlings of the 1970s-the CAEs-have become the demons of the 1980s. I think that either we put that down to a conspiracy being waged against the advanced education sector or we put it down to incompetence on the part of this Government. The latter explanation is probably the more likely, especially when one considers the role of the razor gang in bringing about this reversal of the fortunes of these colleges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Who in their right mind, after all, would put the future of education, or anything else for that matter, in the hands of two titled accountants, two half-smart lawyers and a farmer? Their decisions may well have been applauded by titled accountants, half-smart lawyers and farmers but they have offended almost everyone else. It was the razor gang which decided that 30 colleges should cease to exist. Of couse, it was responsible also for decisions in relation to tertiary tuition fees. It is likely that most people who were involved in the college sector recognised that some form of reorganisation was not only inevitable but desirable. In 1973, when 43 teacher colleges achieved CAE status, pressures were unleashed which were clearly going to impact upon the whole sector. With the emergence of a surplus of teachers in the mid-1970s and the subsequent reduced intake in teacher education courses the call for reorganisation became more persistent. </PARA>
<PARA> In the event this process of reorganisation has been clearly botched by this Government. It is hard to imagine how this could have been done in a worse way. Any reorganisation or consolidation, to use the Government's expression, in the college sector should aim to achieve beneficial educational objectives which would include, at least, the maintenance of overall educational opportunities, an increase in the diversity of courses and the recognition of the separate educational approaches pursued by different colleges. As well, there was a need to recognise the sensitive questions of morale and interpersonal relationships which are essential to the success of any educational activity. Of course, there is the related question of employment security which has so far received little, if any, attention from the Federal Government. Indeed, the Minister is on record as saying that he is not the least bit concerned about the problem of redundancy which will result in colleges as a result of the consolidation. He has said in an Estimates Committee that this is clearly a problem for State governments and for the institutions themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of educational objectives could not have been further from the mind of the Minister or the Government in respect of the current exercise. The starting point, apparently, was the notion that if there were fewer colleges some savings would be made in recurrent expenditure. Even in the view of the TEC these savings may be illusory. The Commission has said that 'significant economies are unlikely in the short to medium term'. In its most recent report the TEC has gone even further to say that it fails to see where the sorts of savings which the Government is demanding can, in fact, be made without substantial reductions in the quality of offerings in those colleges and in other colleges and, indeed, in universities around the country. The Commission believes that there may be economies of scale to be gained from the establishment of larger institutions. This is based clearly on unreliable evidence, to say the least. However, having established that fewer CAEs was a desirable end in itself, the razor gang and the Government--</PARA>

<PARA>It is the view of the Opposition that the whole question of the amalgamation of colleges has been badly botched by this Government and, more importantly, an opportunity to do something creatively in the advanced education sector has been clearly squandered. I suspect that it will take years and years for those colleges which have been subjected to these amalgamations ever to recover. We say that we do not oppose amalgamations in respect of those colleges where appropriate arrangements have been made. But, where the whole problem has become as intractable as it has in respect of those four regional centres and in respect of a number of CAEs in New South Wales and Victoria, those amalgamations should not proceed in advance of the participants to the amalgamation proposals being happy about them. If they are forced into unsatisfactory kinds of amalgamations, inappropriate amalgamations, the consequences will create permanent damage to the advanced education sector in those colleges and, I would say, to the whole system throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other matters which I briefly refer to. One relates to the overall inadequacy of the level of funds which have been made available by the Government. I wish to quote briefly from the TEC. I have been fairly critical of the TEC in respect of the way in which it has embraced some of the more irrational of the Government's ideas, particularly in relation to the consolidation question. The TEC has been fairly vociferous in pointing out the inadequacy of the funding arrangements, not only for next year but for the following two years. It points to the fact that it will be quite impossible to maintain the levels of activity and quality in higher education throughout Australia with those levels of funds. One of the main reasons for the inadequacy of the funding is that the Government not only has refused to accept the recommendations of the TEC, in total, but also has imposed many of its own decisions which have to be funded from the existing levels of recurrent funds made available by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After years of massive injections of funds into education-the taxpayer now spends $20m a day on all forms of education in Australia-and especially the injection of funds into tertiary education, it is ironic that the result has been the mixture of sometimes repellant and shameless self-interest and of frequent bad argument from academic circles and their parliamentary allies that we have heard in criticism of these Bills in the past couple of weeks and supported tonight by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins). Let us take the argument over the consolidation of resources in higher education and, in particular, the decision to close the engineering school at Deakin University. In the propaganda associated with the National Day of Protest, which would be better called the National Day of Absurdity or the National Day of Academic Betrayal of Academic Values, we read the Federation of Australian Universities Staff Associations' statement which appeared in the Canberra Times of 13 October. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concept of university autonomy-the independence of universities from day-to-day political interference-is an important one which safeguards the role of a university in a democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA>Who would disagree with that? It continues by saying that universities expect that 'they will be left to make the academic decisions-such as what is taught, and by whom'. Then, of course, in the decision to close the engineering school at Deakin University this principle is fundamentally breached. The fact is that, obviously and plainly-it is almost quaint to have to mention it-there is not the slightest, faintest shadow of a suggestion that engineering be not taught. It is taught, need one say, in various colleges and universities in Victoria and in the other States. There is not the faintest, slightest shadow of a suggestion by government as to how it should be taught. There is not the faintest, slightest shadow of a suggestion by government as to who should teach it. These are academic decisions. What is suggested is that where public money is used, government has a right and a duty to see that it is not wasted and that there is not a wasteful proliferation of engineering schools. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Federation of Australian Universities Staff Associations' principle, any college at all which does not have an engineering school, or any other school, should be entitled to set one up and have it financed by increased taxes simply because the college decides it wants it. Even to say that indicates that we all accept that government representing taxpayers, the financers of academic institutions, must have a say, not in what or how or by whom a subject is taught-these are all academic matters-but where in the total system a subject is taught when there is a risk or a fact of wasteful duplication. The Universities Council recognised this. This is stated on page 24 of Volume 2 Part 2 of the Tertiary Education Commission report for the 1982-84 triennium. To save time at this hour I will not read the full passage. The Advanced Education Council is quoted on this point in Volume 2 Part 1 on page 189 of the same report. </PARA>
<PARA> The general position is exactly comparable with hospitals and surgeries. Government does not want to say what operations should be conducted by hospitals in Australia or how they should be operated or by whom. But it cannot be expected simply to agree to set up a hospital or a hospital unit everywhere and every time the medical profession says so. Since the whole question is part of the fight against inflation, one might have expected centres of learning to have set a better example, just as one might have expected a better level of argument. Of course, the Federation case is comparatively mild, however intellectually feeble, compared with some of the other arguments put forward; for example, those advanced by the Vice-Chancellor of Deakin University who had to refer to Hitler and Stalin in order to find figures comparable with the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) who is sitting at the table. It is interesting to read the editorial in the Australian Financial Review of 14 October. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Instead the university staff are conducting themselves with the indifference to rational argument one would expect of a highly inefficient, protected and declining industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As a trade union, involved in adversary politics and bargaining with their employer, the Government, this is understandable enough as far as the university staff associations are concerned. They have for a long time put sectional interest above intellectual principle. In this they reflect the worst features of the Australian community of which they are a part. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor does it much matter when the Senate of the University of Sydney declares itself 'unwilling' to collect fees as proposed by the Federal Government. All the Government has to do is to cut the university's funding by a corresponding sum. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is a very serious matter when the Vice-Chancellors, who represent the pinnacle of university administration and who are responsible for the protection of genuine academic independence, are unable to distinguish between this and a sordid squabble over funds. </PARA>

<PARA>The decline of the universities</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The deterioration in the standard of intellectual honesty in Australian universities could hardly have been better demonstrated than by yesterday's National Day of Protest against the Federal Government's spending cuts in the tertiary sector and in particular the decision to close the engineering school at Victoria's Deakin University. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a decline in academic standards was, of course, predicted by the late Professor John Anderson, of the University of Sydney, who frequently during his long and unpopular career there as Professor of Philosophy warned that the increasing dependence of the universities on public funding, and their consequent assimilation into the public sector would determine their intellectual integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now clear that the universities in their approach to the question of public funding have no longer any integrity to defend. They act purely as a special interest lobby, ignoring any considerations of principle. This was immediately apparent when the last Federal Budget proposed to levy fees for some (not all) tertiary students, already in possession of first degrees. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time two of the members of the select group of Vice-Chancellors (unique among public servants in that their salaries are not public knowledge) were trained economists of considerable reputation. These two were both well acquainted with the economic arguments for charging fees, and yet at no time did they express any disagreement with the abusive approach of the Vice-Chancellors to what was a relatively unimportant, but economically justifiable, proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the non-economist members of the brotherhood of Vice-Chancellors could be forgiven for not understanding the economic issues. But to the extent that they endorse the advertisement of the Federation on of Australian University Staff Associations they justify all of John Anderson's worst fears.</PARA>
<PARA> This advertisement was headed ''Political interference in universities.'' Far from dealing with any attempt by any government to sponsor or censor any particular view in the universities the matter in question is whether the Federal Government should continue to finance a school of engineering at Deakin University. The maintenance of a school of engineering at the fourth university in the Melbourne-Geelong area, which would involve wasteful duplication of facilities, has nothing to do with any genuine concept of academic freedom. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one is proposing that engineering should not be taught; it is taught at the tertiary level in a number of institutions in the area. No one is proposing that the way engineering should be taught should be interfered with, nor that the teaching personnel should be influenced. The issue is whether it makes any sense to have a number of small, fragmented engineering schools. It is obviously to the advantage of academics that there should be a proliferation of schools, but it is not obviously to the benefit of the community. It is positively deleterious to genuine scholarship. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, in fact, not a very strong case to be made for the existence of Deakin University at all. It was a marginal proposition even in the days of lavish expenditure on tertiary education, and could today well be amalgamated with other tertiary institutions or simply abolished. Far from being political interference in any real sense this would be simply a rational economising on government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The universities should never forget that they are spending funds extracted from the community as a whole. Only a minor part of their expenditure comes from revenue deriving from their own property, and even this is subsidised by the way of taxation concessions by the Government. As such the universities do not have, and cannot have, autonomy when it comes to their demands upon public funds, nor do they have an unqualified right to decide that a little bit of engineering is preferable to, say, more philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA> The university argument on academic freedom when it comes to public funds is a phony one. There are too many material interests, too much personal interests, as against the abstract principle of free inquiry, involved. It is clear, for example, that university libraries have been starved in recent years to maintain academic salary progression, establishments and study leave. But the library, far more than idividual staff members, is the core of a university. If any economies are needed they should come first on the teaching staff side and last of all on the library. Yet the reverse has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> There is considerable scope for argument on the academic priorities which should prevail within a university. These arugments can be conducted partly in economic terms and partly in terms of the importance of free, unfettered intellectual endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is of interest that neither the economists nor the philosophers are being much consulted in the present noisy political campaign against the Government. Instead the university staff are conducting themselves with the indifference to rational argument one would expect of a highly inefficient, protected and declining industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As a trade union, involved in adversary politics and bargaining with their employer, the Government, this is understandable enough as far as the university staff associations are concerned. They have for a long time put sectional interest above intellectual principle. In this they reflect the worst features of the Australian community of which they are a part. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor does it much matter when the Senate of the University of Sydney declares itself ''unwilling'' to collect fees as proposed by the Federal Government. All the Government has to do is to cut the university's funding by a corresponding sum. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is a very serious matter when the Vice-Chancellors, who represent the pinnacle of university administration and who are responsible for the protection of genuine academic independence, are unable to distinguish between this and a sordid squabble over funds. But John Anderson would not have been surprised-Vice Chancellors were not much better in his day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle, who isolated the principal issues of the Bill. A principal issue in these Bills, which has also been put into controversy, is fees for post-graduate degrees. We all know that fees were abolished to encourage students from poorer families to attend universities and that it has not had this result. On the whole, students from better-off families are still the main ones attending universities but now they are funded by the taxes of lower paid workers. Nevertheless that system is to remain and will be modified only in a small way by the reintroduction of fees for post-graduate students enrolling next year, excluding students who will be doing a recognised double degree and students receiving post-graduate awards. Obviously those who are not now receiving awards, who cannot afford to pay fees, must have arrangements made so that by scholarships or loans they are not prevented from doing post-graduate degrees, if that is their wish and if they have the capacity to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sooner these arrangements are announced the better. But it is an entirely different thing to say that people who can afford to contribute a small amount-less than 20 per cent-to the cost of their post-graduate education and who are moving into well-paid professions should be funded into those jobs by the taxes of everyone else, including those of the lower paid workers. The argument against post-graduate fees is one for taxing the poor to benefit the rich. I think the honourable member for Fremantle recognises that although, for reasons that I cannot understand, he quibbled about accepting the simple facts. This has been recognised and stated for years by economists and commentators of all kinds. In Australia one can refer for brevity to the 1977 report of the Butcher Committee on Student Loans or the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education, Training and Employment. But again we get specious arguments from the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations and others in the coalition of militant and selfish vested interests. In its statement of 12 October the Federation said that there should not be any fees or any small contribution, not even 20 per cent, toward the costs of post-graduate students because:</PARA>
<PARA> Society at large benefits from a better-educated population and a diversity of interests and skills within the community. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course that is true. Society does benefit from a better educated population. That is why it spends $20m of taxes a day on education. The point is we would be justified in spending public money on these post-graduate students to the extent that the benefit to society they bring is greater than is indicated by their earnings. Obviously the rewards to doctors, lawyers, engineers and senior public servants with specialist post-graduate degrees are very great. No case is made that they are not more than adequate. If this is not the case, as it may not be with, for example, teachers or clergymen, there is a case for scholarships or loans for students who are working towards these positions, but not for taxing the poor to enrich the rich even further, as the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations, the honourable member for Fremantle, the Labor Party and even some vice-chancellors maintain. I say some, but not all, because it is well known that vice-chancellors who are economists tend to take a different view from other vice-chancellors. Professor Bruce Williams was well known for his view that universities are better off when they live on fees rather than government grants because living off fees enhances the atmosphere and the fact of independence. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the reintroduction of fees on this very limited scale is accompanied soon by announcements of a new system of post-graduate scholarships for those in need and/or a system of student loans. Student loans are not part of this Bill but they are inevitably associated with the reintroduction of fees for post-graduate students. This idea has certainly been in the air and investigated for many years past. One of the problems that always comes up is that of finding a workable scheme in a sense of one that will ensure repayment, one that deals with defaulting. It does not take much acquaintance with the apostles of the new morality developed in the 'Me Decade' to understand that many of them would make a virtue of dodging repayment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States I understand that under one of the loan schemes-National Direct Student Loans-the default rate is a shocking 11.9 per cent. In other schemes it is far lower. Of course in any scheme one has to allow for difficult- ies of repayment by graduates who, for example, are unemployed or married. In this respect I draw the House's attention to the solution offered in the submission by Professor Richard Blandy to the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education, Training and Employment. His submission was published as Appendix E to the Committee's report. He advocated an Australian Student Finance Scheme to administer student loans and recommended that repayment be made through a surcharge on income tax payable by graduates up to the total amount of the loan. If a former student is unemployed or without income for some reason, he does not begin repayments. If employed and paying income tax he begins repayments, the instalments being administered by the Commissioner of Taxation. This seems a simple solution worthy of consideration. In any case, I hope that a new scholarship scheme and a student loan scheme for those who need them will soon be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, since I want to be brief at this hour, I quickly welcome the additional funding of 6 per cent in this legislation for technical and further education. TAFE enrolments are rising and TAFE has new responsibilities in the important School to Work Transition Program and a greater role to play in the educational system of Australia. It has been the poor relation for too long and something now is being done to remedy this and this is good news. With the qualifications made, I welcome these Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seconded the amendment moved by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) but I shall concentrate on the question dealt with by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) in the last part of his speech; that is, the introduction of fees for second degree new enrolees after 1982. I do so both on the grounds of a personal analysis of the effects of that legislation and out of a small degree of what I consider affilial duty as the reforms in the area of tertiary education and fee charging were introduced in the course of the Labor Government by a Minister who is my father. I think that this proposal can be criticised at several levels. The first is that it is a breach of an electoral promise. Electoral promises have a degree of flexibility these days which defies even the depredations of principle that were inflicted at the turn of the century by characters such as William Morris Hughes. Nevertheless there ought to be sufficient interest in this Parliament in the value of the democratic process, and the assumption that when people go to the polls at election time they basically have a reasonable idea of what they can expect from the various contestants, that when specific undertakings are made, unless there is really excellent reason, those undertakings are in fact held to. There were, of course, very good reasons why, for example, Franklin Delano Roosevelt did not hold to his promises in the 1940 election campaign that he would not involve American forces in Europe. The reason of course was the survival of the democratic liberties of all the United States allies and the bulk of the rest of the world. In those circumstances it was probably a reasonable electoral promise to break.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are probably two circumstances in which certain economic promises are made, when crises occur in the international economic system or the domestic economy which do not permit a tax reform or some other proposition put forward by a successful party at election time to be carried out. However, by no stretch of the imagination could those categories be seen to apply to this broken promise. This broken promise will produce absolutely nothing for the Treasury. The broken promise is not brought about by an urgent situation requiring the attention of the Government that could not be dealt with, if the Government wished to deal with it, at a subsequent election when an alternative promise to that put forward could be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The breach of electoral trust involved in the failure by the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) to stick to commitments that he made during his election campaign, albeit a small matter, is nevertheless one contribution to the production of an even higher level of cynicism about politicians and political promises and, ultimately, the democratic system, which seems to be increasingly prevalent in the Australian community today. The Bill also represents a step away from an important principle, namely, that in a humane and democratic community the only criterion for access to any level of education should be the capacity to pursue the qualifications sought. This principle should irrespective of the social composition of the student body at any point in time and at any level of the educational process. </PARA>
<PARA> When we introduced free tertiary education in this country, we talked of a revolution in access. Speakers on both sides of this House have conceded that no revolution in access has occurred. After all, it is only six or seven years since free tertiary education was introduced. In terms of changing the social composition of major educational institutions, such a scheme should be given longer than six or seven years in which to work. There is evidence that the process which it was claimed, would be revolutionary is nevertheless occurring at an evolutionary rate in the social statistics of tertiary education students now. There is no question that, whilst universities and colleges of advanced education remain the preserve of the middle classes, dents are being made in that preserve because of this legislation and the accompanying legislation on the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are being made especially by mature age students. If we are talking about revolutions of access, it is probably more justifiable to talk of it in these terms: A dramatic change has taken place in the sex composition of the student bodies in tertiary institutions, both universities and colleges of advanced education. In particular, there has been a substantial increase in the numbers of women attending universities. In the late 1960s I attended a university in Western Australia, the student body population of which comprised 66 per cent men and 34 per cent women. Before coming to this place I taught in a new university in the same State, where the student body comprised 50 per cent men and 50 per cent women. That is a substantial change, a change not to be sneezed at and a change which is a direct product of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The argument has been put forward by the honourable member for Wentworth and other honourable members opposite that students ought to be charged fees because universities and colleges of advanced education are essentially composed of middle class students and the burden of tax in this country falls on low income groups. The burden of tax falls on low income groups largely as a result of the policies of this Government. However, I will leave that aside at the moment and examine the validity of that argument per se. No honourable member on this side of the House questions the accuracy of that statement. We merely point out, first, that the situation is changing and, secondly, that the solution to the problem that is sought by this Government will not produce the sort of change that one might expect persons expressing that sort of objection would want to see brought about. </PARA>
<PARA> No suggestion has been made by this Government, or by any Government supporter that I am aware of, that the entirety of the cost of tertiary education should be borne by students. The suggestion that I have seen is that this charge now to be levied on second degree students should be levied on students across the board; in other words, that students across the board on an average basis, should pay 20 per cent of their education costs. What will be the result of this legislation? It will not make a dime of difference to the fact that the low income earners in Australia bear a heavy burden of education expenditure by virtue of the fact that they pay the bulk of the taxes and they do not attend universities. All it means is that, via their taxes they will continue to pay for 80 per cent of university education. If a few of them actually get into a situation in which they might be able to benefit from a university education, they will be hit with a charge currently of $1,000 a year for the privilege of being able to do so. Therefore, having been excluded by all the many social factors from opportunities for tertiary education, when they actually arrive at the point at which they could take advantage of tertiary education they will be denied access to it. </PARA>
<PARA> If we take the user pays principle even further, if we take it aside from, say, an arts course for which the average cost per student might be $3,000 or $4,000 a year, and through to the average cost of a medical student at $15,000 a year, the situation is even more ludicrous. In those circumstances that working class person would be paying for $14,000 worth of a $15,000 education and would then be obliged to confront a further charge of $1,000 upon attending a university. This wringing of hands and mourning the fate of the working class compelled to bear this colossal burden of tertiary education in Australia via the taxation system ought to be exposed for the ludicrous argument that it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable gentleman said, it is disgraceful. Neverthelesss, it is a typical case of the conservative argument that we see on a whole range of issues. If the honourable member for Wentworth is sincere, I look forward to his taking a very firm stand when substantial cuts are next proposed in real and absolute terms in funds going to government schools or to poor needy schools in the private sector. I look forward to his standing up in absolute rage in his party room and saying: 'I have taken this stand on tertiary education which I believe is a principled stand. What I want to see you do is provide the type of education that places a working class child within range of a university and permits that working class child to remain within the school process to the point at which he is likely to qualify to enter a university'. I do not really expect that the name of the honourable member for Wentworth will be seen in the Liberal Party lists on this issue. He will take the same attitude as that of all his colleagues, which is to hammer the lower income earner right down the line in every aspect of that person's life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been talking generally about the principle of the introduction of second degree fees in tertiary education. I wish to look specifically at the case that we are presented with tonight, although I think the broader debate is legitimate as clearly the measure before us is the thin end of the wedge. I refer to the question of what is to happen to second degree students now. The fact is that about 85 per cent of persons undertaking second degrees or second qualifications are not covered by scholarships which pay fees. Only 15 per cent receive scholarships to cover those fees. It might be said that the able person will always get a scholarship. The question of whether one gets a scholarship for a second degree is in fact no longer dependent upon whether one has the ability to do the particular course chosen. When I was an undergraduate student about 11 or 12 years ago, if one gained in the faculty of arts an upper second class honours degree one was assured of a scholarship to do a master's post-graduate course afterwards. I take that as a small example; there are many others I could use. </PARA>
<PARA> When I left university teaching last year one was extraordinarily lucky if one obtained a scholarship with a first class degree at an undergraduate level, yet the qualifications for entries into masters' degrees and Ph.Ds were such that one was still entitled to do those courses, as indeed one should, be entitled, if one was judged successful in obtaining a second class honours degree. As a result, a very substantial number of persons were seeking to go on to do additional studies without the benefit of any financial assistance from the State. They were grateful, nevertheless, that they did not have to pay fees. Those people, and there are many of them in tertiary institutions, are eking out a living by taking part time tutorials, taking waitressing jobs at night, and so on, in order to be able to undertake those studies. They will find the burden of an extra $1,000 virtually impossible to bear and, as a result, there will be a substantial reduction in the number of people undertaking those qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I cite from personal experience that in the classes I taught, the bulk of the student population at Murdoch University, for example, were persons who were not immediate school leavers. In fact, they comprised something like 80 per cent of the student body. The bulk of those persons in my classes were from one of several backgrounds. They were persons who had become dissatisfied with their careers and wanted effectively to drop out and do something else. Perhaps those persons are not the sorts of persons we necessarily ought to subsidise, but that was only one type. A second type, and this was very prevalent, was a housewife seeking qualifications to enter the work force. Included in that group were a number of supporting mothers on supporting mother's benefits who, as a result either of the death of their husband or a divorce, were trying to place themselves in a situation where they were no longer dependent on the State, but could undertake valuable work in the work force. That group will be hit heavily. </PARA>
<PARA> A third group, and they were not insubstantial, were persons who came from work in factories or other areas of employment which normally are classed as blue collar employment who wanted to take advantage of the educational opportunities permitted when no fees are payable. They were not a substantial number, but they will definitely be excluded by the application of this legislation, not from the first degree, but definitely from the prospects of taking up work later on. The qualification now is effectively a first class honours degree to be certain of a scholarship. Any university teacher will be able to confirm that first class honours degrees go, by and large, to the bright-eyed types who go through happily straight from school. I have in mind the smart-alick little 20-year olds and the rest of them-with all due respect to them-who have that extra intellectual edge that has not been dulled by years of responsibility. The people in the category I am talking about hardly ever find themselves in a situation where they are going to obtain first class honours degrees, but their fitness for post-graduate work is undoubted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is attacking these people for no purpose. This is not shifting the burden of the cost of tertiary education away from the working class. This is not introducing a wholesale user-pays principle. This is not removing the general burden from the taxpayer by producing a considerable amount for the Treasury. In fact, its collection will probably cost more than it pays. It is just a nasty, snide, deceitful breach of an electoral promise that will damage a number of people in this community who are using their very best efforts both to better themselves and to make a serious contribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is debating certain tertiary education measures, including the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill and the Tertiary Education Commission report and summary of recommendations for the triennium 1982-84. The tertiary education assistance Bill affects certain reallocations in the financial assistance granted to various sectors of tertiary education. In brief, in the university sphere funds have been held at roughly the same real levels as last year, with some adjustment between universities according to the growth rates experienced in individual universities. There are reallocations in funding levels in that there have been reductions in the college of advanced education sector, and there has been a real increase of about 6 per cent for the technical and further education sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the principal reasons for changes in the nature of colleges of advanced education in recent years has been the decline in the need for large numbers of teachers. In many parts of Australia in recent years we have experienced a glut of teachers, together with the beginning of reductions in pupil numbers, and that is likely to be the case in the next few years. There has also been a proliferation of courses offered by various colleges of advanced education as they have competed with each other, it would appear, in trying to attract students. I want to refer to something I had to say in March 1976 when the States grants Bills were under debate. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> However, there are developments in the colleges of advanced education which I believe give cause for some concern. There seems to be an increasing desire on the part of many of the colleges to develop a wide range of courses and a wide range of faculties which would turn them into copies of universities. I think we have to evaluate this trend and consider the extent to which we are getting value for our money in this development. It seems that many of the colleges of advanced education want to become universities. They want to offer a wide range of degrees or diplomas in the liberal arts or general studies. I fear that in seeking to staff these courses the colleges are spreading their resources too thinly and may not get the appropriate staff to develop courses of an adequate standard. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to claim that I had any enormous foresight that was not available to a number of other people at the time. However, I suggest that they are the problems that have been identified in the advanced education sector and which the measures before us are seeking to correct in large degree. So there has been an effort to require a rationalisation of facilities in the advanced education sector. The Government has taken steps to ensure that amalgamations take place where those amalgamations would lead to a better use of resources. Some of those studies into possible amalgamations have been resolved. For example, the Caulfield Institute of Technology in Victoria will take over the State College of Victoria campus at Frankston. That is a very good example of the need for better use of resources because the State College of Victoria at Frankston has substantial resources in relation to the student population. It has not attracted the student population that was projected for it, and so better use ought to be made of the resources available there. </PARA>
<PARA> Other matters are still in the course of study. I refer to the study to be made into health sciences training in Victoria, which will look at the services offered by the Lincoln Institute of Health Sciences and the Pharmacy College. I want to refer to a couple of other colleges where I think there are substantial cases for allowing the colleges to remain as separate institutions or, at the very least, to ensure that any amalgamation does not damage the very particular and unique contribution that they have to make to educational advancement in Victoria. I refer to the State College of Victoria at Hawthorn and to the Institute of Early Childhood Development. The State College of Victoria at Hawthorn is a little different from the other teacher training institutions in the State in that it concentrates on turning tradesmen into teachers. By and large it does not take people directly from school or from other educational institutions and put them through a teacher training course. It seeks to make practical teachers out of expert practical tradesmen. The point that I make is that it would be a pity if this characteristic of this institution became a secondary characteristic in a larger institution, if it was amalgamated in a way that required it to be submerged by a larger institution. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is a particular reason to ensure that the very desirable aspect of turning tradesmen into teachers ought to be preserved. After all, the emphasis of this college accords very much with the emphasis of statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and, I think, by the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) in recent times about the need to ensure that education prepares people better for the work force, about the need to ensure that there is a proper transition of people from the education system into the work force. I can think of no better way of doing it than the manner in which this institution is seeking to do it in the emphasis of its teacher training courses. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the Institute of Early Childhood Development I think there is also a case for at least ensuring that the emphasis on early childhood development, as distinct from the older ages in the primary education process, is not submerged in some other institution. There is evidence in a number of other teacher training institutions overseas that where early childhood development becomes one small part of a broader teacher training institution the early childhood development aspects are pushed into the background, are not given the emphasis that they should have and, therefore, there is a very great pressure on those institutions to turn out teachers with an interest in the later years of primary education and not the very early formative years. It may still be that there is a case for some amalgamation and some rationalisation of facilities, but I would want to ensure that where any such amalgamation or rationalisation takes place there is a very strong emphasis still in one institution on early childhood development which can then provide a basis of expertise for other courses that may need to be run throughout the State. I mentioned earlier the State College of Victoria at Frankston. That has been offering a course in early childhood development but it has relied for its staffing, to a large extent, on people coming from the Institute of Early Childhood Development in Kew on a part time basis to run the courses at Frankston. Without that basic institution specialising in the early childhood area there would not have been the expert staff available to run the courses in another institution. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal also with some of the allegations that have been made about the way in which this Government has handled the amalgamations and rationalisation of facilities in the advanced education sector. I suppose it is always possible to say with hindsight that something could have been done better and more efficiently with less cause for complaint by those directly affected. One of the problems that this Government faces-in fact, that any government faces-with respect to changes in education policy in seeking to assess the needs of the community and to evolve policies which are appropriate is the very great difficulty in getting proper advice from the education sector itself. As a number of other speakers have already noted, a great deal of self-interest and self-serving goes on in the sorts of proposals that are put to governments by various organisations involved in education. I say that whether they be vice chancellors committees, staff associations or other supposedly expert and professional bodies in the education industry. I think the term 'the education industry' is one we ought to use from time to time. In this respect I refer to a speech that was made in 1976. Indeed, it was a speech that followed my speech from which I quoted earlier. It was made by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), who had some interesting views on the subject of education. I regret that it appears that he will not be speaking in this debate as I had expected he would do. I quote from the House of Representatives Hansard of 24 March 1976. In referring to education expenditure, he said--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6A7">Mr FALCONER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This was the honourable member for Prospect from the Opposition side of the House. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a danger that the most vocal groups in the community, the groups in the community best able to express their point of view, are able to get away with what I call a rip-off in education. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been these huge increases in expenditure on education. I am sure they have been of benefit to many students individually, but I am not so sure that they can be justified at a time when huge economies are contemplated in other areas of expenditure. We pamper university staffs and other staffs. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I come back to my original point. Education, especially tertiary education, has become a holy cow in this country. People do not attack it or criticise it and, what is much worse, they do not question it. </PARA>
<PARA>We need to examine carefully the claims that are made upon governments and in turn upon the taxpayers in the general community by various interest groups in the community. We should not necessarily accept their assertions that they are acting in the best interests of educational development in this country and in the best interests of students. There is a degree of self-interest in the propositions that are put forward. I do not say that that is necessarily reprehensible. It is to be expected to a large extent. But we should subject it to the same sceptical criticism which we use when we examine proposals by industry groups or any other interest groups that put propositions to a government favouring their industry or their interest in some way or another. That needs to be done a little more in the education debates that we have in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to some aspects of the Tertiary Education Commission report which is also being considered. The report contains some discussion of the reasons for the decline in numbers in enrolments in the tertiary sector. The decline in full time students commenced in 1978 and has continued each year since. It has been accompanied by larger increases in the numbers of part time and external students. In fact, as a percentage of school leavers, the numbers entering tertiary study has declined each year from 17.9 per cent of the previous year's 17-year-old population in 1974 to 14.6 per cent in 1981. The reasons offered in the report are twofold. Firstly, young people are not convinced of the value of higher education. Secondly, the decline in the availability of financial support for students is alleged to be a factor. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the report does not discuss the first reason mentioned; that is, that young people are not convinced of the value of higher education. It appears to me that that is a significant matter which ought to be the subject of more examination and analysis. My impression has always been that the original purpose of the Commonwealth's abolition of fees and the provision of assistance to tertiary students was designed to help the children of low income families to obtain a tertiary education. As a number of people on both sides of the House have already noted in this debate, it appears that the participation rate of such children in the tertiary education sector has not changed noticeably as a result. But that situation is not discussed in the report. We are grateful to the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman), who earlier in this debate discussed that aspect. The first reason offered-that is, that of disenchantment with higher education-is potentially very serious. It is a major failing of the report that it virtually ignored it beyond asserting the point. Apparently, this disenchantment with higher education has occurred in the face of various tertiary institutions touting courses around in some cases and, in other cases, easing entry requirements in order to encourage more students. I hope that in a future report there will be a greater examination of that factor. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish also to raise the point that I think we have one very great difficulty in this country with respect to tertiary education in that it involves a sector of the community which is almost entirely dependent on funding from the taxpayer through the Commonwealth Government. I think that poses the difficulty that whenever a government seeks to make a change in expenditure we face as a result attacks from various interest groups along the lines that the Government is in some way stifling academic freedom and in some way is launching an attack on education and the quality of education in this country. I think it would be a very good thing if a number of these interest groups in the education area in our country, such as the vice-chancellor's committee, the various staff associations and so on, turned their attention to how the education sector can broaden its financial base. I would have thought that it would be in their interests to raise a discussion about how fees could be levied in a way that would not disadvantage needy students, about how educational institutions could raise fees in a way that would assist them to develop at their discretion other courses that they felt could make a worthwhile contribution to the development of education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately we do not have in Australia the number of private foundations that exist in, say, the United States of America which can offer substantial funding to various educational institutions. Perhaps institutions of higher learning should be talking to private industry and to other potential sources of funds in our community with a view to setting up foundations and various mechanisms which can provide them with alternative sources of funds with the result that the institutions would not be entirely dependent on the Commonwealth government and on the good will of the taxpayers every year for their continued existence. I think a great many false cries of academic freedom are raised in the context of funding of higher education. I think it would be good for all concerned if there were greater co-operation in the private areas of our economy in a way that enabled institutions of higher learning to have more long term private sources of funding which would ensure that they had a broader base for their continuing activities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981 faithfully incorporates the recommendations of the Review of Commonwealth Functions which, for the sake of brevity and aptness, I will refer to under its well known title of the razor gang. This gang of five Ministers had no experience or professional competence to make snap decisions on tertiary education. Nevertheless, the Government, over the heads of its own expert Tertiary Education Commission, has incorporated in the Bill those recommendations and in particular the reintroduction of fees for second and higher degree qualifications in universities and colleges of advanced education. The razor gang recommendations indicated an ad hoc approach to the problems of tertiary education which makes a mockery of the well formulated reports of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The post-graduate education of Australians is an investment in the future of Australia and is particularly vital in the training of scientists and technologists. Unlike many other countries in our region we are fortunate in having a large pool of educated young people from which we can draw to undertake research activities. Previous governments have recognised that the imposition of fees for tertiary study means that many potential students are deterred from undertaking post-graduate courses. The result of the decision to introduce fees for second and higher degree studies means that potential post-graduate students, many of whom support themselves with part time work, will be unable because of economic circumstances, to undertake post-graduate study. At a time when the Tertiary Education Comission has advised the Government that universities must strengthen their involvement and commitment to research activities, it is entirely irresponsible for the Government to introduce the proposed fees. Not only is it irresponsible but also it is ludicrous when considered in relation to the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) when introducing the razor gang's report. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Review's starting point is that Australia's greatest resource is the Australian people and thus the role of Government is to enable people to exercise their abilities, their skills, their imaginations and their enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>When this statement is considered in relation to another of the razor gang's recommendations, namely, the introduction of a loans scheme for needy undergraduates to offset the tertiary education allowance, it is veritably dishonest. The Government pays lip-service to the concept of equal opportunity for education for all and then requires students to seek loans instead of providing adequate student allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that I wish to draw to the attention of honourable members is the run-down in research funds provided through the Australian Research Grants Scheme. This Scheme provides the largest single source of funds for basic research in Australia. Despite a growing national awareness that we must direct more attention to the development of our research potential, present funding for the ARGS is little more than half of the allocation made in 1966, when it was first initiated, as a proportion of total government spending. At 1966 price levels, individual ARGS grants have been reduced from $9,800 to $2,200 in 1981. This means that research projects which have great potential for the future of Australia are not being funded by the ARGS. In 1966 the allocation for the ARGS represented 0.09 per cent of the Government's outlay for all purposes. In 1981 the allocation represented 0.05 per cent of that outlay. When an international comparison was made of the spending on research and development as a percentage of gross domestic product for the year 1979-80, Australia ranked thirteenth, equal with Finland, Iceland and Italy and far below the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Japan, Belgium and Canada. I call on the Government to reconsider the recommendation of the razor gang and to increase the funds provided through the ARGS so that the balance of education and research in Australia may not be irrevocably eroded. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the provisions of the Bill in general and its impact on the tertiary education community. Tuesday, 13 October 1981 was indeed a black day for the Federal Government. That was the day when hundreds of university academics in universities all over Australia joined in rallies and demonstrations of protest against the Federal Government's policies on higher education. For the information of the Government, I might add, as part of this unprecedented show of unity, many vice-chancellors indicated active support for the demonstrations. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) is rather fond of quoting newspaper editorials. He ignored the editorials which I now wish to quote. The editorial comments in the Sydney Morning Herald of 14 October stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Vice-Chancellors are among the least militant members of the community. Traditionally they prefer to lobby behind the scenes. By going public they have put on notice not only their disagreement with the Federal Government over a number of issues. The message is clear that the Government's interest in preserving academic autonomy is under suspicion. </PARA>
<PARA>Even the conservative Australian editorial of the same day indicated a similar view. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There is little doubt that the Government-and particularly the Minister for Education-has bungled the whole affair. Had any measure of political acumen been shown, had any genuine consultation taken place, had there been any overall national educational policy, defining principles on which to base sensible economies, then the universities would have had no cause to resort to the unprecedented action of a National Day of Protest. </PARA>
<PARA>Why did the honourable member for Wentworth not quote those editorials? I wish to look more specifically at the provisions of this Bill. Clause 6 deals with the introduction of tuition fees for second and higher degrees. A number of universities have indicated their unwillingness to collect fees. The University of Adelaide, the Griffith University and the University of Sydney have all indicated that they are unwilling to implement the collection of fees. This open defiance by a number of the leading universities in Australia is unprecedented and is evidence of the complete irresponsibility of the Government in this matter. Initially the Government announced that $8m would be received in revenue in 1982 and that $20m would be received in 1983-84, the first full year of the imposition of the fees. More informed sources now estimate that the revenue for 1982 will amount to only $3m. The imposition of fees is another of those election promises which the Government has blatantly broken. I quote the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) who made the following commitment just before the last federal election:</PARA>
<PARA> I have given an assurance publicly and I repeat that assurance, that no proposals are being considered by the Government for the possible reintroduction of tertiary fees. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister is sitting at the table. I wonder what he has to say in answer to that quotation from what he had to say as an election promise which has been broken by this Government. What an empty promise this was. It is small wonder that when Government Ministers make assurances in the House, we on the Opposition side interject and deride their statements. This Government is the most prevaricative and dishonest of any government since Federation and we are rapidly approaching the stage where any statement from the Prime Minister or his Ministers is treated by everybody, including all members of the Parliament, as mere window dressing or as speaking as their bellies guide them, which expresses perfectly to me the contempt which this Government and its Ministers have towards anybody who seeks to criticise or oppose their policies. Surely the Government must realise that it is alienating many of its supporters by this arbitary imposition of fees which for universities can mean only an unwelcome additional administrative load which will result in a loss of perhaps two-thirds of the 1982 potential graduate student population at a time when a developing Australia desperately needs to improve its supply of skilled personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to turn to clause 5, which empowers the Commission to disapprove for funding purposes the introduction of new teaching developments. When a similar provision was introduced in the 1978 Act there was considerable opposition to a provision which imposed an arbitrary dictate by the Federal Government on what should or should not be taught in an Australian university. As has been stated on many occasions the concept of university autonomy is an important concept which safeguards the role of universities in a democratic society. It guarantees the indpendence of universities from the day-to-day political interference of autocratic government. Contrary to the views of some members of this House, universities do not expect to receive an unlimited share of taxpayers' money, certainly not at a time when many other areas of public spending are being restricted. However, they do expect, when that money is available, to make the academic decisions regarding what is to be taught and by whom. Universities are subject to both government and community influence in the representation on their councils and senates. They are subject to overseeing by the Tertiary Education Commission and by various State and tertiary co-ordination bodies. In these circumstances this clause is included for reasons which in my opinion envisage the imposition of a political philosophy of conservatism. Why is it necessary to include this particular clause? As I said before, it is my view that if the Federal Government has any interest in preserving the independence and the scholastic excellence of universities, this clause should be removed from the Bill. Again I quote the Sydney Morning Herald of 14 October:</PARA>
<PARA> Fuelling the academic fear have been a series of Federal Government initiatives, all seen as part of a policy to bring tertiary institutions to Canberra's heel. The recurrent income of universities has been reduced; the means test on TEAS for undergraduates has been tightened; there has been talk about reviewing tenure; and a fee has been levied on those doing second or higher degrees next year. </PARA>
<PARA>The inclusion of clause 6 will be opposed by the Opposition. I hope that the Government will also see the light and take the opportunity to remove clause 5 from the Bill. By taking this action it may be able to restore some of the lost confidence which university staff and students feel towards a government which has indicated by its actions that it is hostile to the independence of academic thought in this country. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the face of overwhelming opposition the Federal Government is forging ahead with its plan to impose tuition fees for students undertaking second and higher degrees. Public statements condemning the decision have come from the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee, the Federation of College Academics, the Australian Union of Students and the governing bodies of many colleges and universities, as well as the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations. The reduction in the number of post-graduate students which will result from the imposition of fees can only diminish our research effort which is already dismally inadequate by international standards. Australians may have cause to regret this short-sighted approach in years to come when we are forced to import both our technology and our workers. It is interesting to look at the Government's about-turn on this. On 3 July the Federal Government estimated that $8m would be netted from fees in 1982 and $20m in 1983-84, the first full year of the scheme's operation. Six weeks later in the 1981-82 Federal Budget Statements, at page 76, the Government had changed its mind and stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has decided to re-introduce fees on a limited basis for students commencing second and higher degrees from 1982 (except for recognised combined degrees and diplomas). The revenue in 1982 is estimated to be $4m; this is expected to rise to $20m in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet it has already halved its estimate a mere seven weeks since the original announcement. Irrationally this Government will still stick to its belief that $20m will be netted from fees in the third year of the scheme. Unless fees double or higher degree students double in number such a figure seems wildly optimistic. My main worry about these changes is that they may work to exclude students from working class backgrounds from the tertiary education system. For many years it was extremely difficult for working class students to enter university or to undertake other forms of tertiary education unless they were able to obtain scholarships. The abolition of tertiary fees by the Whitlam Government opened the door of our tertiary institutions to many thousands of young men and women who otherwise would have had little opportunity to pursue higher education and take advantage of their academic skills. Surely we do not want to turn the clock back to the days when advanced education was an exclusive preserve for the privileged. I well remember the days pre-1972 when one per cent of the kids who entered high schools north of the Yarra actually went on to tertiary education. Honourable members cannot tell me that that meant that brains stopped at the Yarra. What stopped was opportunity. I think this Government is bent on bringing that situation back again. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told that a loans scheme may be introduced, supposedly to assist poorer students to finance their education. Apart from the overseas experience which suggests that such schemes are highly complex and expensive to operate, they can act as a deterrent to poorer students undertaking higher studies because of the potential financial burden involved. Here is the government which preaches that people should not live beyond their means telling young Australians that they can obtain a higher education only by putting themselves into hock up to the eyeballs. A responsible government would implement drastic changes to our education system only after long study and extensive consultation and would ensure that such changes were not made until adequate notice had been given. This Government implements policies thought up in secrecy by a group of Ministers with no expertise in the field. Meanwhile recommendations from expert bodies get filed in the rubbish bin. The present situation creates great dangers for the Australian education system. It can only be hoped that the Government will retreat from its current proposal before too much damage is caused. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tertiary Education Commission has been advocating for the past couple of years a redirection of effort away from teacher education and has said that the amalgamation of some colleges could assist in this process. It certainly did not say that 30 colleges of advanced education had to merge. The TEC also stated that the colleges involved would need three years to adjust to the amalgamation. While some rationalisation of the college sector, I believe, is both necessary and desirable, these heavy-handed threats by the Government are quite unjustified. Colleges faced with mergers need time to plan and reorganise in order to achieve education improvements, and several of these mergers simply should not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with every other member of parliament I have received submissions from colleges, from student bodies and from other interested people concerned with education. It is not just the Labor Party which opposes what the razor gang has announced. For instance, I refer to a document circulated by the Liberal Minister for Education in Victoria, the Honourable A. J. Hunt, on 21 July, in which he said that the Victorian Government expressed surprise that the razor gang's announcement gave, for the first time, an indication that the State College of Victoria at Hawthorn, the Institute of Catholic Education, and the Institute of Early Childhood Development should somehow, for some unstated reason, be merged with some other unspecified institution or institutions. He pointed out that this had never previously been suggested to the Victorian Government by the Commonwealth and that the Victorian Government had been unable, since this surprise announcement, to ascertain any rational basis for those requirements. Mr Hunt further stated that the Victorian Government remained convinced that the names of these three institutions were included in error. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is noteworthy that the requirements for the Institute of Catholic Education to merge with some other body, a most obvious error, has now been withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA>Everyone with experience of the workings of government had forecast that it assuredly would. The educational logic for the continued separate existence of the Institute of Early Childhood Development is precisely the same as that existing for the Institute of Catholic Education. I suggest that it is about time the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) based his recommendations on sound educational logic instead of fairy tales dreamed up by bureaucrats in Canberra to suit the political strategies of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Tertiary education in the colleges of advanced education is being pushed down a dead end road against the tide of reason on the pretence that this will save the country money. If it will save the country money, the Minister is certainly not telling us anything about costing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party is strongly opposed to the reimposition of fees and will move to abolish any fees introduced as soon as possible. The last Labor Government introduced free tertiary education and the next Labor Government will restore it. Whilst recognising that there is some need for rationalisation in colleges, the worst aspect of college amalgamations or closures is the implication that the number of student places will be reduced. This is the only way in which savings will result as the colleges move to cut staff. The Labor Party is strongly opposed to any overall reduction in student places in colleges. I support my colleague, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), who said that the mature women who are attempting to enter the work force will suffer the most. Australia needs more students in full time education, not fewer. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest criticism of the Government's actions and possibly the hardest to rebut comes from the Tertiary Education Commission itself. The Commission, in its annual report tabled in the House on 23 September, warns of a short term drop in the standards of some institutions. This is because the Government has cut back funds for universities and colleges of advanced education. In fact, between 1981 and 1984 funds for existing activities will be reduced by about $18m a year. The Government doggedly sticks to the line that the forced amalgamations of institutions will bring about substantial savings to make up for this shortfall. As the Commission points out in its report, it has advised the Government that the amalgamations will save little in the short to medium term. Not surprisingly, the Commission seems genuinely puzzled that the Government perseveres with an obviously fallacious line of argument in the face of expert advice. The Commission also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In the longer term, this decline can only be avoided by increased Government financial assistance or by cutting back activities. </PARA>
<PARA>Only the most starry-eyed optimist could imagine this miserable Government providing additional funds, so only one outcome is possible. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I say that this Government has completely failed to respond to the urgent needs of tertiary education. I predict that if it continues with its policies they will result in fewer full time students, a further decline in student financial support, tertiary education becoming more and more a preserve of the wealthy, and the very quick return of a Labor government to Canberra. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Under current arrangements, pensioners and beneficiaries who are public housing tenants and who receive supplementary assistance generally also receive a rent rebate or similar concession from the public housing authority. The value of the State housing authority rent rebates generally has been estimated at an average of $16 a week per recipent in 1979-80.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. The change in the method of cost adjustment for university grants, involving a change from retrospective to prospective supplementation, cannot be said to prejudice the outcome of Mr Justice Ludeke's review of academic salaries. The new arrangement has been adopted to provide a more rigorous approach towards cost adjustment of tertiary grants which in the past has provided additional funds automatically and which has consequently had a tendency to insulate educational institutions from the effects of inflation.</PARA>
<PARA> In this way it is designed to encourage greater efficiency in institutions. The Government does not believe that this change in the method of cost adjustment of grants affects the role of the Academic Salaries Tribunal as specified in Section 12C of the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In accepting the prospective arrangements for adjusting the 1982 program from estimated December 1980 prices to outturn prices, the Government agreed to a total package based on a number of assumptions relating to the timing and quantum of salary and non-salary increases, the program mix and the rate of cash flow during the year. The final outcome of each of these components may be different from the prospective allowance. The Government is not in a position to indicate a response to hypothetical variations from the assumptions involved in individual components in isolation from the total package.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes. The sums, as set out in the paper provided to Estimates Committees, are as quoted.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The amount which the Australian National Commission for UNESCO has budgeted in 1981-82 for Commission and Committee fares and travel allowance has increased steeply largely because of the rises in domestic airfares, eg 50 per cent on flights to Canberra from Sydney to Melbourne over the past twelve months, higher rates of travelling allowances (approximately 15 per cent from May 1980) and the cost of meetings carried over from the previous financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the Government's Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Australian National Commission for Unesco re-examined its priorities within the funds available for 1981/82. It decided to maintain the frequency of meetings of the Commission and its Executive in order to fulfil its major role, which is to provide advice to the Government on the Unesco international program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Full details of the information sought in respect of the years 1965 to 1973 are not readily available. However, prior to 1973 fees in universities ranged from 17 to 19 per cent of recurrent grants. Concerning colleges of advanced education, virtually no fees were charged in most teachers colleges as students were generally trainees of State Education Departments. Institutes of technology and other CAEs charged fees at rates which were significantly lower than those for universities; they represented around 10 per cent of grants.</PARA>
<PARA> For 1982, using 1980 enrolment figures and calculating from recurrent grants expressed on an outturn basis, it is estimated that fees revenue would represent approximately 0.5 per cent of the recurrent grants to universities and CAE's. Since fees will only be paid in 1982 by students commencing second and higher degrees, this percentage would increase in subsequent years.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) No. As appropriate the submission of the Department's Industrial Division indicated to the Committee of Reference a view as to the intended coverage of the reference dated 22 July 1980.</PARA>

<PARA> (5) The Industrial Division's submission was concerned to see that the principles established by Kerr/Woodward should be before the Committee of Reference during its deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The essence of the Industrial Division submission is that salary rates should reflect the highest function regularly performed, that payment for lateral skills or acquisition of military skills by 'trades' is not a valid factor in salary assessment; otherwise cumulative financial recognition of military skills acquired by 'trades' personnel would considerably disadvantage personnel who only possess military skills.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) No. On the contrary, the Deparment's Industrial Division submission suggested to the Committee of Reference that any change in work value which it determined for Defence Force members, should find expression both in the normal salary for the member as well as the work value segment of any allowances. This view was specifically invoked in relation to Service Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The main conern of the Department's Industrial Division in its submission was to see that the Committee of Reference had before it all relevant facts relating to its reference and to offer comment and views on particular aspects of the reference.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his statement to Parliament on 30 April this year concerning results of the Review of Commonwealth Functions the Prime Minister indicated the Government's intention of introducing a tertiary student loans scheme in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements for the introduction of the loans scheme are proceeding. Useful discussions have been held between Commonwealth officials and representatives of the Australian Bankers Association and the Commonwealth Bank. There are some aspects of the scheme which have still to be settled and which may not permit the scheme commencing from the beginning of 1982. Full details of the scheme will be announced as soon as these are finalised.</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to emphasise that the Government is firm in its intention to introduce a loans scheme as a supplement to existing forms of student assistance including the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) My attention has been drawn to a media release issued by the Newcastle College of Advanced Education which refers to the level of recurrent grants for the College in 1981 in relation to enrolments. Funding for the College for the 1979-81 triennium was based on a planned student load level of 2,345 equivalent full-time students for 1981. Actual student load, as reported by the College in statistical returns to the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, was 2,037 equivalent full-time students. The planned student load was thus 15 per cent higher than the student load actually achieved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of the article on page 22 of 'The Ugly Side of Australian Business' by T. Hall which refers to the accidental destruction of toxicological records by Industrial Biotest Laboratories (IBT).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is true that senior employees have IBT have been charged with devising and intending to devise a scheme to defraud clients and United States Government agencies by writing and distributing false and fraudulent study reports and false and fraudulent explanations of studies and study reports.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not aware however, that reports were deliberately destroyed as suggested by Mr Hall.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Approximately 100 chemicals (pesticides and drugs) have been supported in part by toxicological studies carried out by IBT. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NH &amp; MRC) and the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) have approved most of these chemicals for use in Australia. It is known, however that many IBT studies have since been validated and, in most cases, formed only part of the overall toxicological evaluation of the chemicals of concern. In addition, the bulk of the toxicological assessment for each chemical was undertaken by other independent laboratories and there has therefore been sufficient toxicological evaluation overall on which to assess human safety considerations.</PARA>
<PARA> For this reason the NH and MRC and the ADEC, as with the U.S. and Canadian Governments, have not banned any of the chemicals concerned. This action, especially by the U.S. Environmental Agency, further highlights the fact that there is little reason to believe any human hazard exists.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Official requirements to have IBT data validated have been in effect in the U.S.A. and Canada since 1977. In this connection there is a Canadian/U.S.A. collaborative program of validation and Canadian health authorities have announced that it will take at least another year to complete the task. The Canadian and U.S. Governments have been approached to ensure that Australian authorities are kept informed as IBT studies are validated or as new studies which are being undertaken are evaluated.</PARA>
