<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen those reports. I hope it is wrong, but I have been advised that the reports came from Mr Wran's office. Of course, the reports are a total absurdity. Honourable members might be interested in the history of this matter. In the middle of last year the Premiers indicated that they wanted to hold meetings amongst themselves to discuss tax sharing arrangements to apply from 30 June this year. They held a meeting in September. I thought we would receive a submission from the Premiers very shortly after that which could be put to study by my colleagues before a meeting with the Premiers was held. In the event, the Premiers were not able to give us an agreed submission before 12 February this year. It took them from September to some time in February to agree to a submission to put to us. I think that even the Premiers would understand that we need some little time to examine a document which took them so much time to put together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 20 February I telexed Premiers suggesting 15 and 16 April as the dates for holding a conference to discuss their submission. I think it is worth noting that 15 April is only one of the dates on which His Royal Highness is to be in Sydney. On 16 April His Royal Highness is to be in Melbourne, Victoria. In that sense, the meeting, if held on those dates, would cut across His Royal Highness's visit to both New South Wales and Victoria. But the telex stated also:</PARA>
<PARA> I should be grateful for your early advice on whether these dates are acceptable to you.</PARA>
<PARA>At this stage only three Premiers have responded. One of them finds the dates difficult. As a result, the Government is looking at alternative dates. I have not heard from Mr Wran; I have only seen what has appeared in the newspapers. Apparently, he prefers to communicate by that means rather than by telex. The conference is unlikely to be held earlier than those dates because Mr Tonkin is going overseas and will be overseas for a large part of March and April. I do not think it would be possible to hold the meeting before he is due to leave in March. I am looking at dates beyond 15 and 16 April. If it is possible to accommodate the Premiers on dates which are more acceptable to them, the Treasurer and I will be very happy to do so. I really think that Mr Wran's suggestion, if it is his suggestion, is childish and absurd. I am disappointed that he should seek to play politics in that way.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The procedure for deregis- tration of a union is covered by both section 143 and section 143A of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I stated previously that the Government will be acting under the provisions of section 143 of that Act. In essence, the first step is to obtain an order calling on the union to show cause why its registration should not be cancelled. The Government is determined that this legal process should be undertaken. We are confident that our application will be successful. We are confident that in that climate of success it will be a significant step towards achieving a long term improvement in industrial relations in the building industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are taking the action because of the continuing and blatant denial of the normal industrial processes by this union. The nature and frequency of the challenges to governments, State and Federal, industry and workers by the Builders Labourers Federation will not be tolerated by this Government. The nature and frequency of the violence, stoppages, bans, pickets and various forms of intimidation will not be tolerated. The industrial guerrilla tactics of the type employed by the Builders Labourers Federation are outside the law. That can be said firmly and unequivocally. No union or anybody in this land is above the law. The Government will ensure that the flagrant abuses by the Builders Labourers Federation simply do not continue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs to his speech at the National Press Club on 3 February 1981 when he stated that a free flow of information about Asia is important to Australian foreign policy. In view of these admirable sentiments, I ask the Minister why he is reluctant to reject specifically the actions of the Indonesian Government in killing and, more recently, expelling Australian journalists. Does he regard the low key measure of issuing a statement of regret about the expulsion of Mr Peter Rodgers as sufficient response for this calculated attempt to manipulate the Australian media? Will he at least summon the Indonesian Ambassador and deliver the strongest protest, making clear that good relations cannot flourish in an atmosphere of censorship and intimidation against Australian journalists?</PARA></TALK.START>

I hope that Indonesian journalists will come here to report freely to their countrymen on events in Australia. As I have already indicated, I very much regret that the same attitude is not taken by the Indonesian Government. The honourable member is not correct in identifying the sort of response that I gave to that Government on the expulsion of Mr Rodgers. It did not amount merely to the issuing of a statement. I did that, but also I gave instructions to our Embassy in Jakarta to make my concerns known and to ask the Indonesian Government to reconsider its decision. I further made the point, and I think it does need to be made, that every country has the sovereign right to decide who resides therein, but it remains my view that a free interchange of media representatives between all countries, including Indonesia, is desirable.</PARA></TALK.START>

In order to avoid the appearance of tilting even further towards China in its long-standing ideological, territorial and security disputes with Moscow, will Australia also exchange defence attaches with the Soviet Union, as do all North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries? Do the shared strategic perceptions to which the Minister referred at the National Press Club extend to supporting the Chinese view that a third world war is inevitable?

In fact, the last estimate is that this strike has cost Qantas no less than $9m. Qantas is a company owned by the people of Australia; they are the shareholders of this national airline. I think it is an outrageous state of affairs that Qantas should be singled out by the ACTU in spite of the fact that the stewards have been able to resolve their difficulties with the Qantas board in an orderly manner. The situation of Qantas at present is very bad indeed. There is no way that this Government will sell Qantas but there is every possibility that, if this strike continues, Qantas will have no alternative but to close down. I think the Australian people and the 13,000 employees of Qantas need to know that, because there is no way that this airline can limp around the way it is expected to at the present time.

Matters of this kind plainly are utterly different from determinations in relation to wages and other conditions of work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Commonwealth Government is prepared to introduce into this Parliament legislation which offers very real inducements and benefits to Commonwealth employees by way of early retirement, at their own choice and discretion, it is fair enough that management should have some additional capacity to redeploy and to improve the efficiency of the Service by management-initiated early retirement. Indeed the provisions that are in the Act are already so circumscribed by appeals provisions and processes designed to protect the rights of individual public servants that I doubt that they will be used very much. The voluntary early retirement provisions probably will be used quite considerably by members of the Service. That is a very real benefit for them.</PARA>
<PARA> But when we are making decisions about the prerogatives of management, of the Public Service Board-matters that need to be decided by government-we then clearly need to have in mind also the privileged position of the Public Service in comparison to other employees around this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to get some figures on the first part of the honourable gentleman's question and provide them to him. I should say to the honourable gentleman that the levy-I will not make any observation at this stage as to the circumstances surrounding whether it has to be paid by individual developers in Sydney-is, as I understand it, something that could be properly deductible by developers under section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The question of whether there would be any ultimate cost to the revenue would depend in very large measure on whether the cost of the levy was passed on by the individual developers and there was thus some recoupment of it insofar as their own income is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make the general observation to the honourable gentleman that it has long been a fact that the Commonwealth has no control over the extent to which its revenues are affected in respect of business deductions incurred by companies in earning their assessable income. Obviously the situation could never be anything other than that because, provided a deduction or an expenditure comes within the concept of earning assessable income, provided it is an outgoing earning assessable income, it is something that can be deductible. I think the honourable gentleman's question raises a number of interesting considerations. I will try to provide to him and the House some estimate of what is involved and generally to assist his inquiries.</PARA>

In view of the fact that the total tax bill at national government level is the highest ever, however one calculates it, and that four out of five taxpayers are paying more tax than they did five years ago relatively speaking, is his statement by implication a clear confession that the Government has failed to establish its fiercely declared objective of restraint in national government expenditure?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Prime Minister a question which is supplementary to the question I asked him a few seconds ago. Is it a fact that today someone on average weekly earnings supporting a spouse and two children is paying $158 a year more in tax than he or she was paying in 1975-76? Is it also a fact that today someone on the sort of income that the Prime Minister enjoys-in excess of $82,000 a year-is paying $2,950 less tax than he or she was paying in 1975-76? In what circumstances then can the Prime Minister claim that there has been a substantial reduction in the tax burden for the bulk of taxpayers? Why has he brought about a change in the tax burden distribution which benefits the wealthy, like himself, and disadvantages four out of five taxpayers, who are now paying more tax?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman glossed over the fact that somebody on average weekly earnings today is earning very much more than he would have been earning five years ago. That obviously has an implication for the tax that would be payable. People on high levels of income, as the honourable gentleman would know, pay about 60 cents in the dollar. Many expert inquiries have believed that the highest level of tax that ought to be payable by any person is about 50 cents in the dollar. In Australia the highest level is 60 cents in the dollar. Quite plainly, that is a very significant tax level and a much higher level of tax than for people on lower levels of income. It seems quite clear from the thrust of the honourable gentleman's question that basically he is in favour of higher taxes, and that point was made yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate has been prompted by the emerging fiasco in the payment of nursing home benefits. The source of that problem lies in the Medi-muddle that has characterised the Fraser Government's policies in health care over the last five years. There is no need to repeat here the innumerable changes in insurance but they are at the source of the fiasco that is now emerging. It is interesting to note that in the rather soft nosed and fuzzy Jamison report even the Commissioners could make the following comment about the changes of the last five years:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the Commission does not agree that the changes have been beneficial, indeed they have done nothing to improve the efficiency of the health system. </PARA>
<PARA>In many ways that is a rather pathetic understatement of the position. The Commission said that the changes have done nothing to improve the efficiency of the health care system. I much prefer the response of the West Australian to the same set of problems. That newspaper called the comment by the Jamison Committee a gross understatement. On the changes to which I have referred the West Australian stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It would be more accurate to say that practically every piece of surgery performed on the system since the Fraser Government came to office (with a promise to maintain the Medibank scheme) has weakened it and compounded public confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> Although it has never been admitted by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) this public confusion is at the heart of the problem of nursing home benefit payments. This problem comes a year after the overpayment of $235m to pharmacists. That, of course, was blamed on a computer. Apparently some computer kept on regurgitating a false formula for five years. Now we are seeing the revelations of the Health Department's audit into nursing homes. The audit has been completed in South Australia. We have to try to draw national conclusions from the South Australian data. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of these revelations is that over the past four years in South Australia alone $1.9m has been paid incorrectly by the Government in nursing home benefits for patients who are privately insured and who, therefore, were the responsibility of their private funds. The Minister has conceded that figure and the source of the error. That is about all he has conceded and confessed to. The human and institutional ramifications that flow from these errors seem scarcely to concern him. </PARA>
<PARA> I want now to try to explore the vague, evasive and shallow responses from the Minister both in this House and in the media, contrast that with what little evidence we have and see whether we can tease out some truth from this sorry affair. Firstly, what is the likely national sum involved in this error? For the moment the Minister refuses to speculate on the total cost of the error although he is prepared to say that any of Labor's figures are exaggerated. The error in South Australia is $1.9m. South Australia has somewhat under 10 per cent of all nursing home beds in Australia. Therefore a national figure of approximately $20m seems to be a reasonable extrapolation. But the Minister told us yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not correct to extrapolate the South Australian situation throughout the Australian continent. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore I ask him, in the interests of reasonable and rational debate and understanding, to explain to us-it is incumbent upon him to explain-why we cannot draw those conclusions from the South Australian figures. Why are the figures atypical in South Australia by contrast with the remainder of the States? Since yesterday we have a further source, that is, the report of the Auditor-General on an efficiency audit of the Commonwealth's administration of nursing home programs. That suggests that a minimum national figure of $4m per annum is involved which over the 3 1/2 year period from October 1977, would suggest that, at a minimum, $14m has been incorrectly paid to nursing homes. So we have an average figure of $20m and a minimum figure of $14m. Of course, if South Australia is atypical in the other direction and the errors are greater in some of the other States-as is certainly possible in relation to Victoria-it may be above the $20m figure. But the sort of range we are talking about is from a minimum of about $14m to a maximum of about $25m. Until we are provided with more precision by the Minister we are left with that range. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting, too, that the report of the Auditor-General helps us with what I can only take to have been a humorous aside on the part of the Minister yesterday when, in answering a question, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I think that the Department of Health is to be congratulated on its good administration in finding out this problem and recovering the money incorrectly paid. </PARA>
<PARA>It is fortunate that the audit report came out yesterday, because it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst recognising the skills, diligence and good-will of men and women engaged in nursing homes program management, the Report reveals a number of weaknesses in program administration. These weaknesses have led to unnecessary expenditure and a lack of consistency in the distribution of Commonwealth assistance to the aged and infirm. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also goes on to show quite clearly that for the past four years the Department has had no formal procedures for determining the insurance status of patients in nursing homes. So, not having had proper monitoring procedures, the Department is now praised for finding the errors that derive from the lack of these adequate formal controls. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to a more important question: What is the source of the errors? Certainly it is not this time a computer. We have to find out the source of these errors. For the Minister the source is obvious. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Those payments--</PARA>
<PARA>In error-</PARA>
<PARA>were made on the advice of nursing home proprietors. It is up to the nursing home proprietors to provide the correct advice to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a very simplistic solution: The nursing home proprietors are to blame for giving the Department the wrong advice. That is simply not good enough. It is simply not good enough for the Minister blandly to state that it is the nursing home proprietors' responsibility to ascertain the status of a patient and then correctly claim. The source of the problem, of the confusion about the status of the nursing home patients, is the Government itself, in its confused, confusing and continuous changes to health insurance. Let us remember when we look at the particular errors involved that most of them stem from the period 1976-77. In those years massive changes occurred in the health cover system in this country. There were also major changes in nursing home charges and benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind honourable members of the changes that took place in the period 1976-77. This was the period in which we saw the introduction of a public levy system, plus an alternative private insurance system, with a complex of choices. Secondly, it was the period in which the public Medibank organisation, which people associated with a public provision, became a purveyor of private health insurance. It was also the period in which the nursing home benefits ceased to be fully public benefits and were shared between the public and private sectors. An enormous number of confusing changes were made in that 12-month period. To magnify the inevitable confusion which resulted for the whole community, we are here dealing with aged people. Many of the aged and their relatives just did not know whether they were insured. Many believed that they were uninsured when, in fact, they were insured. Vice versa, many no doubt believed that they were insured when in fact they were uninsured. That is the real and basic source of the error that has now been discovered. The nursing homes are the victims of half a decade of maladministration of health by this Government. The production of confusion is the chief achievement of the Fraser Government in the health field. </PARA>
<PARA> The health funds themselves, even though they seem to have escaped the criticisms of the Minister to date in this matter, are not blameless because they added to the confusion. For example, when the Government introduced the policy whereby private funds had to pay the nursing home benefits of privately insured members, some funds actively sought pensioner patients in the mistaken belief that their benefits from the reinsurance pool would be greater. When they discovered their error they actively sought to offload the pensioners, mostly back to Medibank Private. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Government must shoulder most of the blame for the confusion. Health Department directives in 1977 told the funds that they must actively recruit pensioner patients in the same proportion as the rest of the community, even though it was pointed out that in effect pensioners were being urged to pay money for private insurance benefits which were their right, free of charge from the Government, if they were uninsured. This sleazy attempt to bolster private insurance undoubtedly added further to the confusion amongst pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The present fiasco is the direct result of these past policies. Today we have a mess, with funds refusing to pay, the Government and funds putting pressure on nursing homes, the Government threatening to withdraw legitimate subsidies from nursing homes as repayments, and some funds boasting that they will have to be taken to court by the nursing homes before they will repay the money. The Minister seems quite prepared to squeeze the nursing homes until the pips squeak. Recoupment procedures are already under way in South Australia, with nursing homes having deductions made from their monthly payments. But on the subject of the reimbursement of the nursing homes by the private funds, the other side of the picture, the Minister seems quite blase. Yesterday he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have no reason to believe that they will not accept those obligations. </PARA>
<PARA>But there is every reason to suspect that they will not accept their obligations, and much of that evidence is already before the Minister. For example, in 1978 the Government sought to recoup $9.5m from the funds with respect to payments which all agreed were mistaken. The Minister of the day made exactly the same noises as the Minister at the table is now making about the funds observing their obligations. In the event, the Government surrendered to the funds and never recovered the $9.5m. Today the nursing homes have no confidence that the funds will meet their obligations and have told the Minister so. I wish to quote at length from a letter from the convenor of the Australian Affiliation of Voluntary Care Associations written to the Minister a fortnight ago:</PARA>
<PARA> When your Department sent out notices of recoupment to all Nursing Homes concerned, and courteously notified the S.A. Voluntary Care Association of this action, a meeting was sought with the Health Funds Association in Adelaide. A representative of the Private Hospitals Association was also present as was a representative of your Department. The presence of your officer was extremely helpful as the Health Funds representatives had been quite adamant that you had earlier informed their representative in Canberra that pressure would not be brought to bear for repayment. When faced with irrefutable evidence that Organisations were being pressed for payment, they had to withdraw their earlier 'bluff'. </PARA>
<PARA> Around the table, the Health Fund representatives who were present clearly indicated that they had no intention of making payment for these claims at this time or in the near future. It was also stated that they were even questioning the legality of the requirement to pay. When informed that our Organisations were in no position to stand the financial losses involved and consequently would have no alternative but to take legal action against the Funds concerned, they literally laughed in our faces and said that would be fairly futile as such action could be extended over a long time. </PARA>
<PARA>There is clear evidence before the Minister that he can have no confidence whatsoever that the funds will meet their obligations in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The fiasco is the result of the medi-muddle in this country. It derives in fact from the confused and confusing changes in health insurance that are characteristic of the Fraser Government. This Government must accept responsibility for the fiasco, and ensure that nursing homes and nursing home patients do not suffer as a result of the confusion created by the Government. It is quite insufficient for the Minister to claim blandly that the health funds will accept their obligations. He has to use the powers under the National Health Act to ensure that they do. </PARA>
<PARA> A second nursing home problem to which I will refer briefly seems to have been revealed by the audit. It is the problem of nursing home proprietors claiming benefits either from the Government or from insurance funds for patients during days when the patients are not in the nursing homes. Clearly this is a case where the nursing home proprietor is at fault for claiming a benefit he is not entitled to receive. Under the law, recovery of these moneys from the nursing home is justified. However, I wish to ask the Minister whether it is just that a nursing home proprietor, having claimed for years benefits on days when the patient was absent, should then seek to recover from the patient the moneys he had to repay? In most cases, the patient is not aware of the improper claim. For instance, I have a bill for $3,353, extending back over four years, which was received by a patient in a nursing home. The old lady was fortunate in that her relatives over the past four years had been able to look after her a couple of weekends in every month and occasionally had been able to take her home for a week. The result of that is a bill for $3,353. I am told by the welfare agencies that this is not an uncommon problem. It raises also the general issue of the coherence of the Government's policy towards the aged. The structure of nursing home benefits imposes a direct financial penalty on the family which seeks to play a role in the care of an old or invalid relative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I think we are becoming quite used to the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) approaching problems and subjects like this with a degree of exaggeration which I think is regrettable. In various Press statements we have seen the figure of $25m bandied about. I have refuted that figure and the honourable member has now described me as being vague, evasive and shallow. But he has not substantiated at all the figures that he has cited. That is regrettable. If we are to have a sound and reasonable argument or discussion about questions of very great concern to a large number of people throughout Australia, all those taking part in the debate must as far as possible stick to the known facts. I believe that would advance a debate which is, as I have said, of immense importance to us all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bonython raised two major issues. Unfortunately, he dealt with the second matter very quickly at the end of his speech. I will deal with that first and then move to the major portion of the case presented by the honourable member. In the last part of the honourable member's speech, he talked about the payment of benefits during a patient's absence from a nursing home. He detailed one particular case of which he is aware where an individual patient is being required to pay a considerable amount of money. I will outline to the honourable member and to the House the background to this situation. It is a fact that Commonwealth nursing home benefits are not payable during a patient's absence from a nursing home. That policy was not brought in by the present Government. In fact, it was introduced in 1973 by the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). It has continued to apply since that time. All proprietors were made aware of the policy in 1973 and again in 1977, so there is no excuse for their not knowing about it. Since 1973, proprietors have been able to charge a bed retention fee during a patient's absence from a nursing home when the patient requests that the bed be retained. The fee is determined by the proprietor but it cannot exceed the approved daily fee. Proprietors are responsible for advising patients of the fee when a patient wishes to have that bed retained. </PARA>
<PARA> One can see the difficulties in this area. Obviously from time to time patients will wish to leave the nursing home and that, of course, will leave beds unoccupied. That will cost the proprietor of a nursing home money. If he moves someone in, that bed is lost to the original patient. Because of the difficulties in the system, representations have been received from a number of patients, both uninsured and insured, who have been asked by the proprietors to repay amounts which the proprietor incorrectly claimed as Commonwealth and fund benefits in respect of periods when the patient was absent from the home. I think it is quite a responsible attitude on the part of the Government not to pay benefits when the patient is not occupying the bed for which the benefit is being paid. It seems from the number of days and amounts involved that the patients may not have been advised by the proprietor that benefits were not payable for periods of absence. The amounts of Commonwealth benefits involved have been recovered. Of course, the recovery of fund benefits is a matter between the proprietor and the fund. There are numbers of matters of concern in relation to this subject; it is not a simple problem. As a matter of urgency the Government is reviewing the position by looking at a number of options which will overcome some of the difficulties. I state quite clearly that there are difficulties. They were recognised by the Labor Government which brought in the original conditions, and they are recognised by myself. </PARA>
<PARA> I now return to the original debate, which is in relation to nursing homes and their administration, and the allegation by the honourable member for Bonython that $25m is involved. As I have already stated, I view with concern these sorts of accusations. I think it is fair to say that certain nursing home proprietors have incorrectly made claims on the Government for nursing home benefits. Obviously it is fair to say that, because it has occurred. But to say that this has been caused by confusion on the part of the Federal Department of Health or the government of the day is very far from the truth. The background to the proposition is that, in March 1980, the Department of Health-my Department-commenced an audit to see whether incorrect claims had been lodged with the Department from nursing home proprietors in relation to insured patients. Nothing could be said to be irresponsible about that action. The Department set about auditing the returns to make sure that moneys paid out were correctly paid out. That audit uncovered the fact that some nursing home proprietors had incorrectly made claims on the Department for insured patients. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the honourable gentleman and to the House that the guidelines for the operation of nursing homes are very clear. Proprietors have been made aware of their responsibilities to use all reasonable endeavours to ascertain the insurance status of patients. Therefore, I believe it is very unfortunate that some proprietors made little or no attempt to find out this information and just billed the Government for these insured patients when the claim should have been made on the private health insurance funds. As I have pointed out, the Government must rely on nursing home proprietors to provide this information correctly. The honourable member for Bonython believes that we should not rely on the proprietors; but, if we did not, we would face a massive expansion in the number of public servants required. We would need an army of public servants roaming around the country checking the insurance status of patients. That result might be dear to the heart of the Opposition, but it is not dear to this Government. We have to look in all of these matters at a form of cost benefit analysis, and the employment of vast numbers of additional public servants is of great concern to the Australian community, and it costs the Australian community a lot of money. We prefer to believe that we can rely upon the proprietors of the nursing homes to work more assiduously to provide the correct information to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Once the matter was unearthed and it was shown that the nursing home proprietors had not been fulfilling the requirements laid down by the Government, as a Minister of the Crown I had no option but to set in train recovery action because I believe strongly-and I am sure that the honourable member for Bonython would agree with me-that the Government must protect taxpayers' funds. Unfortunately, it is becoming more usual in this sort of matter for the Opposition to start spreading stories about the situation. It brings through this activity undue worry to the occupants of nursing homes and to their families. Let me assure this House that I have instructed my Department to take into account the financial circumstances of individual nursing homes in relation to the timing of the repayments to ensure that recovery action does not jeopardise their viability. All this talk of the Government bringing about the closing down of nursing homes is sheer scaremongery and I believe is not helpful--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard it mentioned around the place. I point out to the House that nursing homes are entitled to submit a claim to the patient's health insurance fund for the payment of benefits. The health insurance funds have an obligation to pay these benefits. I am taking appropriate action to ensure that they do. The honourable member for Bonython has a jaundiced view of the response of the health insurance organisations. Perhaps I am filled with more of the milk of human kindness and charity than he is, but I believe they will accept their obligations when they are clearly pointed out to them, as they have been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to lay to rest the rumour perpetuated by the Opposition as to the actual amount incorrectly paid. As we have heard today, the Opposition has claimed that the amount is $25m. I can assure all honourable members that the figures presented to date to me show that the final figure will be significantly less. On what do I base that statement? I base it simply on this information from my Department. We have heard about South Australia. In New South Wales, 74 out of 492 nursing homes have been checked and amounts totalling $131,327 were identified as owing by health funds. The check is proceeding. In Victoria about 50 per cent of current nursing home patients have been partially checked and amounts totalling $210,000 have been identified as owing by the funds. Recovery action is proceeding as the checks are made. Checks have been completed for all the major funds in Queensland. There are three small funds remaining to be checked and an amount of approximately $910,000 has been identified as owing. In Western Australia, 32 out of 121 homes have been checked and an amount of $117,790 is owing. The checking in Tasmania is almost complete and to date $16,740 is owed. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the figures on which I based my statement that the total figure is considerably less than the $25m that the honourable member for Bonython has been trumpeting around the place. I hope that in the future when I make these statements the honourable member will treat them as I believe they should be treated, that is, as being honest responses to questions. Until the final checks have been completed-I have mentioned this in relation to these last figures-I believe that it would be quite unreal and unfair for anybody to make further statements as to what the final figure will actually be. We must rely upon proper audited figures. To speculate, particularly in the exaggerated way which has been done, about that final figure I do not think is at all helpful. The report of the Auditor-General, which was tabled in the House yesterday, recommended that audits of nursing home benefits payments be undertaken. Of course, we are already doing this. The report was tabled only yesterday and therefore I cannot comment on the various statements made in it. However, it has raised a number of points which must and will be considered by the Government as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> In its usual fashion the Opposition criticises the Government's achievements in the area of assistance for the aged. The Government is committed to looking after the aged. It is part of its general philosophy of looking after those sections of the community that are least able to look after their own needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's critics claim that the Liberal Party is uncaring because it firmly believes that people should be more responsible for their own needs and that governments cannot and should not meet all of the demands that individuals or groups in the community may make upon it. The community knows that the Liberal Party is committed to these philosophical views because it does not believe that governments should be able to tax away peoples' incentive, initiative and drive. We believe very strongly that those who are able to make a contribution should make that contribution. I believe that the community also knows at the same time that the Government believes it has a responsibility for those groups of people who cannot look after themselves. The community knows that only by ensuring that government actions promote a strong and thriving economy based on a viable private sector, will that economy grow. It is only in this way that there will be a growing economic cake that will allow the Government responsibility to provide greater assistance for those in need. If we are to look after those in genuine need, we must have a thriving economy. That is the base from which all resources or benefits can flow. If we do not have that strong economic base, we can have the best policies in the world but we will not be able to put them into effect because we simply will not have the community resources so to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a clear cut policy towards the aged, which is aimed at assisting them. In the health area special arrangements apply for pensioners. For instance, the Commonwealth will meet their medical bills at a cost of over $300m this year. In addition, free public hospital treatment and free pharmaceuticals under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for pensioners and their dependants are to be provided costing about $195m annually. Contrary to the views of the honourable member for Bonython, the Government has acted in the area of nursing homes particularly. It controls nursing home fee increases to ensure that only justifiable cost increases are passed on to the patients. We have formalised the nursing home benefit arrangements to ensure that benefits are updated annually and set at a level to cover nursing home costs sufficiently for 70 per cent of beds throughout Australia. The benefits were increased in November last year. The Government also meets the approved operating deficits of eligible private, non-profit nursing homes. Considerable assistance is provided by the Commonwealth towards the capital costs of accommodation for the aged. I could go on giving examples. The Commonwealth also provides assistance in the area of home care for the aged such as housekeeping and other domestic assistance, paramedical services, meals on wheels and domiciliary nursing care benefits which, as honourable members will recall, the Government increased from 4 September last year from $2 to $3 a day. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's concern for the aged is, I guess, very well demonstrated by its record in the area of pensions. Pensions are now at record levels in relation to average weekly earnings. We have been able to achieve this result while at the same time adopting a responsible economic policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) for raising this matter of Government policy and the application of Government policy in connection with aged people and particularly in connection with nursing homes. I find one of the most depressing aspects of this Government's record in its general approach to welfare to be its approach to the aged. Despite the platitudes that we have just heard from the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar), this Government attempted to repudiate the undertaking it gave to maintain the material standard of aged people in Australia. In that approach it capitulated only in the face of the fact that the community at large was more socially responsible and responsive and had a greater social conscience. Not only aged people but also the community at large indicated that it simply would not tolerate a government which would repudiate the undertaking it had given in relation to the indexation of age pensions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whatever the Minister may say now about the increases that have taken place in age pensions in comparison with average weekly earnings, the fact remains that those increases have come about simply because the Government has been locked into an approach which it had previously taken. I am sure that had the Government been aware of the results of that policy it would not have adopted it in the first place. The Government policy generally towards the aged has been incoherent in its conception. It has been incomprehensible in its purposes and it has been inept in its application. The Minister claimed that this issue had been exaggerated by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett). If this issue has been exaggerated I wonder very seriously where this Government is going and where government responsibility generally is going. The total amount reflected in the two significant bungles to which the honourable member for Bonython made reference possibly represents about $40m or an amount in excess of that. Added to that is the bungle made by the Minister's Department relating to the overpayment of pharmacists. The list continues. It is all very well for the Minister to try to smooth over this matter with cliches and platitudes but he is responsible in this Parliament-he is the responsible member of the Government-for the operations of the Department of Health and for the very serious deficiencies that exist within that Department. The Opposition and the Opposition spokesman on health matters will permit neither the Minister nor the Government to smooth over the issues that are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister was critical of the estimates made by the honourable member for Bonython in relation to the most recent bungle. The honourable member for Bonython gave three estimates. He explained the basis of their preparation and indicated quite clearly that they have been determined on the basis of information which currently is available to him as a private member of this Parliament. He gave an estimate at the lowest level of $14m, perhaps rising to $25m with a middle figure of $20m. It is all very well for the Minister to criticise the honourable member for Bonython for the responsible and necessary action which he took in attempting to assess, on the basis of the information which was available to him, a sensible figure in relation to the amount that was involved. The Minister himself, with the total resources of the Department available to him, has refused to provide an alternative assessment. All the Minister says is that the final result will be 'significantly less'. Will it be significantly less than $25m, $20m or $14m? The Minister has given some preliminary results from the investigations that have been undertaken in each of the States. On the basis of those results he has still failed to provide an alternative assessment to the one which has been provided by the honourable member for Bonython. </PARA>
<PARA> This continuing and compounding confusion commenced in 1976 with the dismantling of Medibank. As I have said it is the second most serious bungle in the health insurance area. I think it reflects on the part of the Government a complete incapacity not only to devise equitable and coherent programs but also to administer the programs which it has devised. On the radio program AM on 17 February this year, when challenged on the wrong payment of millions of dollars to nursing homes which the interviewer referred to as a 'bungle', the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Well you can say we paid out the money wrongly. We were acting on information which was given to us and we, in fact, paid out the money on that information.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> To say that this is a bungle I think is really over-stressing the situation because, in fact, it was the Department that found out about the situation and the Department which has for some time been involved in correcting it. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is an incredible comment by the Minister responsible in this area. The Minister may well adopt that attitude but it is not the attitude which has been adopted by other responsible people in the areas of nursing homes and health welfare. It is not the attitude which has been adopted by spokesmen responsible for interests in these areas. I refer to some comments made by the Australian Affiliation of Voluntary Care Associations. In part, in its approach to the Minister, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Although the number of individuals concerned is not great, the sum of money which is involved is very considerable since the period of time concerned is a long one. </PARA>
<PARA>I should like to emphasise the words: 'The period of time concerned is a long one'. It stated further:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe, however, that unless the situation here--</PARA>
<PARA>It was referring to South Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>is clarified, the same chaos will be produced in other States later. </PARA>
<PARA>Just where is the Government going? The Association to which I have just referred said that that situation has been continuing over a long period. This responsible body referred to the situation as one of chaos. In these cases there is a possible overpayment of an amount up to or in excess of $20m. The situation is that it will be extremely difficult for the Department of Health to recoup the funds. This situation has been referred to as one of chaos yet the Minister has the effrontery in this Parliament and publicly to refer to this as some difficulty which he chooses not to identify as a bungle and one, presumably, which could not have been anticipated. I refer briefly to some of the comments in the report of the Auditor-General in relation to the administration of nursing home programs which was tabled in this Parliament yesterday. In its overview of audit conclusions, the report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of its investigations, my Office--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Office of the Auditor-General-</PARA>
<PARA>has formed the view that whilst the Commonwealth Department of Health has, consistent with Government policy, actively sought to identify and cater for community requirements for nursing home accommodation and financial support, its existing systems of management control exhibit weaknesses that give rise to a lack of economy in Commonwealth expenditure and lack of consistency in administration between patients and between proprietors. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department's control over numbers of nursing home beds is deficient in some respects. </PARA>
<PARA>It states further:</PARA>
<PARA> Effective interaction between Commonwealth departments . . . in the planning and evaluation of related programs of care for the aged and the infirm is largely absent . . . Better value for the Commonwealth's health and welfare expenditure on the aged and the infirm could be obtained if related services were planned for and evaluated jointly. </PARA>
<PARA>So it goes on. Despite the position which the Government and the Minister have adopted in relation to this question I think it reflects the Government's approach which typically has been unresponsive in these important areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is seeking to lay on the Government an allegation that there is a general incoherence in its policy towards the aged. That is what this debate is all about. The Opposition is endeavouring to pin this accusation with the alleged induced confusion over nursing home benefits which has been receiving some publicity in recent times. In other words the basis on which it claims that there is a general incoherence-whatever that means; it seems a fairly incoherent way of criticising the Government-is in fact established by an overpayment to nursing homes. This overpayment naturally relates to the Government department involved taking the word of the proprietors of nursing homes about which patients were in fact insured and which were not insured. If it is a heinous sin to accept the word of these proprietors who may well have been misinformed-perhaps that is a charitable view-then the Government is wickedly guilty. It has in fact taken the word of people in the payment of these benefits. Then, quite properly, the auditor-in other words, in the proper functioning of government-has established that what was said to the Government was not in fact reality. If, as the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) said, the Labor Opposition really wants a horde of Public Service inspectors knocking on the doors or looking in the beds of every nursing home in Australia then its criticsim of the procedures that have been adopted is meaningful. The fact is that it would add massive costs to the provision of nursing home care-it would involve more than the few million dollars referred to today-in Public Service inspectors' wages every year, without fail. In fact what we have here is the proper resolution of a problem. The Government is not pretending that the problem does not exist. The Government in fact has pointed it out. This audit inquiry was commenced in March of last year because the Government in fact was concerned. This is the proper way in which to resolve the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition pretends that this demonstrates that there is some massive incoherence. What is the meaning of the word 'incoherence', which has been used as a fairly smart aleck component of the ridiculous matter of public importance before the House today? I understand that it means inconsequential, inconsistent and not easy to be followed. Let me demonstrate what in fact has happened to the whole area of nursing home activity under this Federal Government. The report of the Auditor-General to which the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) referred so enthusiastically contains a table which shows Commonwealth expenditures on the aged as a percentage of gross domestic product. I must concede that I have not had much time to look at this report because it was released only yesterday. The table shows the position in 1973-74 under the Labor Government, as we all bitterly remember, and the position in 1978-79 under the present Government. According to the table Commonwealth expenditure on the aged as a percentage of gross domestic product has gone up from 2.9 per cent to 4.2 per cent-a massive vote of incoherence. Here we have evidence of a very nice increase in Commonwealth expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product under the present Government. If that is a matter for us to be criticised about, let the Opposition criticise us. However, this Government has increased the proportion very significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth expenditure on the aged as a percentage of total government outlays has gone up from 12.2 per cent to 14.6 per cent. We do not hear those sorts of figures honestly presented by the Opposition when it criticises our efforts in relation to the aged. These are achievements of which I think this Government ought to be proud and which the people of Australia should recognise. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table from the report showing the number of nursing home beds in each State as at June 1973 and June 1980. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table shows that the Australian total of nursing home beds has gone from 53,416 to 65,289, a significant increase in the number of nursing home beds available. The number of beds per thousand persons aged 65 or over has been maintained at around 46.7 per cent of the population of 65 or over. So, in effect, the nursing home situation has at least been keeping pace with the requirements of an aged population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recognise that some points of criticism were made in the Auditor-General's report and I think they should be discussed. However, it is interesting to see the dramatic difference in the performance of the States in the provision of nursing home beds. For example, in New South Wales the number of nursing beds per thousand head of population is 52.79 compared with only 37.25 in Victoria. In other words, there are clear differences between the States for a set of reasons which relate to the independent roles of the States themselves. The Victorian Government very sensibly adopts the view that the best way of providing assistance to aged people is in fact to keep them in their own homes. In other words, it supports the concept of home help which is funded on a fifty-fifty basis by the State and Federal governments. Home help is recognised to be far more significant in Victoria than it is in New South Wales, where the State Labor Government would much prefer to shovel the responsibility entirely onto the Federal Government. There is a much more responsible approach in Victoria. The Auditor-General had this to say in his report:</PARA>
<PARA> Professional medical and sociological opinion seems to support the view that the aged and the infirm should not be institutionalised except as a last resort, that their general well being, their ability to be self directive and to function effectively is enhanced by a familiar domestic environment. </PARA>
<PARA>Some very interesting sections of the report deal with this subject and I commend them to the House. I certainly commend them to the New South Wales Labor Government, which not only generally provides less for home help than the Victorian Government but also, in its latest Budget, reduced the agreed contribution to home help on which it had given the Federal Government an undertaking. The Federal Government had in fact provided a considerable amount; the New South Wales Government originally failed to match it. It had to be pushed screaming to a situation where it eventually matched it. The simple reality of the situation is that it would rather the Federal Government pick up the whole bill for nursing homes than contribute to what I believe is a much better system of home help. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless I am concerned that there are some matters in the nursing home care area which need to be fixed up. For example according to the report of the Auditor-General, in the Illawarra region, an area which I represent in part, there were only 24.68 beds per thousand head of population aged 65 and over as at 31 August 1979. Compare that with the figure of 80.75 per thousand head of population in the western metropolitan area of Sydney. I do not believe it is right that my area, which is very much a retirement area, should be disadvantaged in this way. The Auditor-General referred in his report to the methods that are used by the joint Commonwealth-State co-ordinating committee. I want to stress that it is a joint Commonwealth-State committee. There is a degree of integration and co-operation. However, I feel that the methods often adopted by that committee do need improvement. Despite the very low ratio of nursing home beds per thousand head of population in the Illawarra region various applications from the area have been rejected by that joint committee. I believe it is unfortunate that an area already disadvantaged should be further disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> No one on this side of the House will pretend that there are no problems in the nursing home area. There certainly are and this is clearly evidenced by the fact that some States have a different awareness of the needs and the importance of nursing homes. The Federal Government has done its job well in providing support for nursing homes. Certainly there are problem areas. I believe these are being solved. Let us recognise that this Government has supported the integrated retirement village concept of a nursing home, a hostel and units. I admit that the concept was initiated by the Opposition when it was in government. However, this Government has supported that principle as well. It seems to me that when we look across the whole structure of assistance for the aged we find that this Government has a record of which it should be proud. It is a record from which no one should seek to withdraw. I suggest that the figures I have used to demonstrate the big increases by this Government in outlays as a proportion of gross domestic product to help the aged is something of which we ought to be proud. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Dairying Research Act 1972 in recognition of changing circumstances in the dairy industry and to conform with current practice in other similar rural research legislation. The Dairying Research Act established the Dairying Research Trust Account and the Dairying Research Committee. The Research Account receives income from the industry research levy, Commonwealth Government matching contributions and other minor sources. Expenditure on research is approved by the Minister on the recommendation of the Research Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Three of the amendments proposed in the Bill have been sought by the Dairying Research Committee and the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation. These changes are expressed in clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill. The Dairying Research Committee is frequently referred to by name in international journals and research papers. Renaming it as the Australian Dairy Research Committee will clearly establish its national identity. </PARA>
<PARA> At present three members of the Research Committee represent producers of milk for manufacturing purposes and one member represents producers for the liquid milk market. In view of changed circumstances in the industry this distinction is no longer appropriate and the Bill provides for the four producer members to represent all dairy farmers. To allow casual vacancies on the Research Committee to be filled for the remainder of the term of the member being replaced, the mandatory three-year term will be changed to a period not exceeding three years. Further consequential amendments are necessary to accommodate these changes. Clause 12 provides for transitional arrangements in respect of the renamed Research Committee and its members and their deputies. Clause 11 will amend the Dairying Industry Research and Promotion Levy Act 1972 to reflect the change in the Research Committee's name. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments have been drafted to bring the Dairying Research Act into conformity with recent rural research legislation and Government policy. Clause 3 will have the effect of bringing the wording of the provisions for payments into the Research Account into line with similar recent legislation. The original intent of the Act is not changed. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with established practice Clause 7 amends the arrangements for removal and resignation of Committee members and deputies, while Clause 9 provides for the Remuneration Tribunal to determine the remuneration of members and deputies. Clause 10 will enable the Minister to approve fees, et cetera, payable to persons appointed to advise the Committee. Finally Clause 8 of the Bill introduces the requirement that Research Committee members and their deputies shall disclose direct or indirect pecuniary interests. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to terminate the operation of the present Dried Vine Fruits Stabilisation Scheme. The scheme, which applies to dried sultanas produced in the three seasons 1978, 1979 and 1980, provides for grower contributions to a stabilisation fund if the average return received by growers in a season is above the established seasonal base price plus $10 a tonne. If the average return for a season is more than $10 a tonne below the base price, payments are to be made out of the fund to growers. </PARA>
<PARA> Growers contributed approximately $1.2m to the fund in respect of the 1978 season, and it has been assessed that further significant payments would also be the ultimate result of the 1979 and 1980 seasons accounting if the scheme were permitted to run its full course. This would be of no advantage to the industry, and would in fact deny growers the use of substantial moneys, which under the legislation would have to be collected from them in due course for these two seasons, as grower contributions to the fund. Growers would then have to wait for the winding up of the fund at the end of the stabilisation term before these moneys could be refunded to them. Such refunds could probably not be made before well into 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has therefore accepted a request from the industry that legislation be introduced to terminate the scheme and to authorise refund to the contributing growers of the moneys presently in the sultanas stabilisation fund. The moneys contributed by growers in respect of the 1978 season have been invested, the last maturity date of such investments being 1 October 1981. After consultation with the growers' organisation-the Australian Dried Fruits Association-the Government has made provision in the Bill for the investments to continue until their maturity. In this way a considerable amount of interest will be earned, and no risk will be incurred of loss of capital value through early redemption. After all investments have matured, all moneys standing to the credit of the fund are to be distributed among growers in proportion to each grower's share of the total contributed by growers. A formula is set out in the Bill for the purpose of establishing the amount payable to each grower. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes provision to enable the payments to growers to be made through the system already established for the making of stabilisation payments. I expect that payments to growers will be completed about the end of 1981. In anticipation of inquiry by honourable members as to possible on-going price support arrangements for this industry, I point out that discussions are proceeding with the industry designed to conclude mutually acceptable provisions for an underwriting scheme commencing with the 1982 season. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides for the underwriting of returns from all export market sales of apples and pears over the five seasons 1981 to 1985. The Bill, together with the associated Apple and Pear Stabilisation Amendment Bill 1981 and the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Amendment Bill 1981 implement the Government's decision to vary the market support arrangements for export apples and pears following the inquiry last year by the Industries Assistance Commission into the assistance needs of the apple and pear industry beyond 1980. The Government accepted the IAC's recommendation that continuing price support assistance for apple and pear exports should in future be related to actual price experience on export markets, but that the existing cost of production based price support under the stabilisation scheme for apple exports be phased out gradually to avoid undue disruption in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that the existing Apple and Pear Stabilisation Scheme was introduced in 1971. The then Minister for Primary Industry's second reading speech indicated that the intention of the stabilisation scheme was to give a measure of stability to the industry to assist it to examine and take steps to meet the adjustment problems then confronting it. In the ten years that the scheme has operated, payments to growers have totalled $22.6m of which the Commonwealth contributed $22.3m. Nearly all the assistance has been paid in respect of apples. It has always been acknowledged that the stabilisation scheme would not provide solutions to all the industry's problems. Honourable members will also be aware that the industry had the advantage of the Fruitgrowing Reconstruction Scheme which operated from 1973 to 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> During the 1970s the industry has gone a long way to meeting its adjustment needs. Total Australian apple and pear production has declined by about 30 and 40 per cent respectively; exports now account for some 15 per cent of production instead of about 30 per cent; a bigger share of the exports go to the more profitable 'forward sale' markets in South East Asia and the Middle East; and there is less dependence on the relatively unprofitable 'at risk' markets in Europe. Further adjustment is expected to take place in the next few years. However, with the development of alternative export outlets outside Europe, continued growth in domestic demand and the development of processing outlets, future adjustment is unlikely to be as great or of the same nature as the adjustment of the past ten years. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking back, I can confidently state that the stabilisation scheme has met its objective of providing a measure of 'breathing space' to growers facing difficult adjustment problems. However, as observed by the IAC, the stabilisation scheme has also had the effect of distorting market signals for export fruit and continuation of the scheme on an unchanged basis could now prejudice the successful completion of the necessary adjustment process. The changes which the Government will be introducing to the existing stabilisation scheme will be dealt with in more detail in my second reading speech on the Associated Apple and Pear Stabilisation Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one further aspect of the package of assistance arrangements which will apply to the apple and pear industry to which I should refer. In addition to the underwriting arrangements for apples and pears and continuance of the stabilisation scheme for apples on a phasing-out basis for four years to 1984 the Commonwealth is to continue to provide supplementary assistance on a dollar for dollar basis with participating States over that 4-year period. The Commonwealth commitment is for a maximum of $3m to be provided over this period in respect of apples and $800,000 for pears. The use of the assistance is to be flexible and available to fund orchard reconstruction and related adjustment measures for growers particularly affected by the changed market support arrangements for 'at risk' exports. It may also be used to provide additional 'at risk' export price support assistance for apples but not for pears. The Government has placed a ceiling of $750,000 of Commonwealth funds and a maximum pay-out per box of $2.20 that may be used to supplement export price support for apples in 1981, these maxima to be reduced by one-quarter in each of the three succeeding years. The Commonwealth is currently discussing with the States proposals on the form and the amount of supplementary assistance to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> I should now like to deal briefly with the specific provisions of the Export Underwriting Bill. For each of the 1981 to 1985 export seasons, separate guaranteed minimum return levels will be established by this Bill for apple exports and for pear exports. The guaranteed minimum returns will be determined by calculating 95 per cent of the weighted average per box free on board return for all apple exports, and for all pear exports, over the immediately preceding four export seasons. At the close of each export season, the Bill provides for the determination of the average per box f.o.b. export return for all apple exports in that season, and another for pears. In the event that either of these average per box f.o.b. returns falls below the relevant guaranteed minimum return, then this Bill provides that an underwriting payment is made, such payment being the difference between the guaranteed minimum return and the relevant average per box f.o.b. return. Underwriting payments shall be made, in the case of fruit exported 'at risk', to the owner of the fruit at the time of export, and in the case of fruit sold before export, to the owners of the fruit prior to that sale. Unlike the stabilization legislation, this Bill does not provide for payments into the scheme by growers; the underwriting arrangements are to be financed solely by the Commonwealth. As with the stabilization scheme, assistance payments under the underwriting scheme will be made through the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation. The package of market support measures decided upon by the Government will provide a good basis on which the industry can develop to meet the changing marketing circumstances confronting it. As part of that package I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill introduces amendments to the Apple and Pear Stabilization Act 1971 as part of the package of market support measures for the industry that I have just outlined in my speech on the Apple and Pear Export Underwriting Bill 1981. The principal stabilisation Act is extended by this Bill to cover apple exports for the four export seasons 1981 to 1984. The stabilisation scheme for pears is not to be extended. Stabilisation assistance for apples will continue to apply only to exports shipped at some degree of risk to markets in Europe, including the United Kingdom. The maximum rate of stabilisation assistance for apples for the 1981 export season is to be $2.20 per box, the same as applied in both the 1979 and 1980 export seasons. In 1982 the maximum is to be reduced to $1.65 per box, in 1983 to $1.10 and in 1984 to 55c. This maximum rate is to be payable on a maximum of 1.5 million boxes of apples in each season. In the event that more than 1.5 million boxes of apples are exported 'at risk' to Europe in any year then the maximum per box payout is to be reduced proportionately. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides that in the event that both a stabilisation payment and an underwriting payment become payable then the stabilisation payment is reduced by the amount of the underwriting payment. The principal stabilisation Act is further amended to terminate the grower 'pay-in' provisions and to allow for winding up the varietal trust funds. The Bill also provides for the updating of the levels of penalties provided under the Act so as to bring them into line with those provided under the Apple and Pear Export Underwriting Bill 1981. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Currency Act 1965 to empower the Treasurer to issue a $10 silver coin. On 2 May 1980, the then Acting Treasurer announced that the Government had decided to issue three coins with special designs to commemorate the occasion of the XII Commonwealth Games to be held in Brisbane in 1982. He further stated that the 1982 commemorative coins would be a $200 face value 'collector' gold coin, a 50 cent cupro-nickel coin, and, subject to the passage of necessary authorising legislation, a $10 cupro-nickel coin. </PARA>
<PARA> It has now been decided that the proposed $10 Commonwealth Games coin be struck in 92.5 per cent silver, that is, sterling silver. The Commonwealth Games Foundation had originally proposed that the $10 coin be in silver. At the time the very high and volatile price of silver suggested that a $10 silver coin would not be practicable and it was then proposed that the coin be in cupro-nickel. Since the announcement last May, the extreme speculative influences on the price of silver have been removed. In addition, the practice has been established with the $200 collector gold coin of setting the price of a collector coin well above its face value. It is intended that this practice will be followed in the case of the silver coin. It is envisaged that the $10 silver coin will have a diameter of about 34 millimetres-that is, slightly larger than the 50 cent coin-and that it will weigh about 20 grams. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Bill is enacted in the current sittings of Parliament, it is expected that the Royal Australian Mint will commence minting the $10 Commonwealth Games coin in the second half of this year. The special designs for the reverse sides of the three Commonwealth Games coins have not yet been selected. Further details of these coins, including arrangements for their release, will be announced at a later date. In view of the ever-present legislative burden on Parliament, the opportunity is also being taken to provide in this Bill for greater flexibility in the types of coins that can be issued in the future without the need for additional legislation. Accordingly, the Bill provides for the issue of new denominations of coins and their standard compositions to be prescribed by regulation and will authorise the Treasurer of the day to cause any such coins to be made and issued. These amendments do not, of course, affect the Parliament's power to veto any such regulations that may be brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA> I now outline the main provisions of the Bill. Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill will amend sections 13 and 14 of the Currency Act to provide for the composition of existing coins to be varied by regulation and for the denominations and composition of new coins to be prescribed by regulation. At present the denominations and standard compositions of coins are specified in the Act. These amendments will avoid the need to amend the Act each time a new denomination of coin is to be introduced or the composition of an existing coin is to be varied. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 will amend section 14A of the Act to allow the issue price of the proposed $10 coin that is to be issued in the first instance as a silver commemorative coin for the 1982 Commonwealth Games to be determined by the Treasurer in the same way as he is at present authorised to determine the issue price for gold coins. Because of the potential volatility in the price of silver and production and marketing factors it is not practicable to set in advance of the legislation the price at which the $10 coin is to be issued. For similar reasons, this amendment will also empower the Treasurer to determine the issue price of any new coins of a denomination exceeding $10 that may be prescribed. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 16 of the present Act provides that the tender of coins up to certain values is a legal tender in discharge of a debt. Clause 6 will amend that section to place a limit of $100 on the legal tendering of coins of the proposed denomination of $10 and, in the case of any new coin of a denomination exceeding 50c but under $10, a limit of 10 times the face value of the coin. Any new coin of a denomination exceeding $10 will be a legal tender for payment of any amount. This clause complements the proposed amendment of section 14 by providing for appropriate legal tender values to be accorded coins of any new denomination that may be prescribed by regulation without the need for a further amendment of the Act. Clause 7 will amend the Schedule to the Principal Act to provide for the introduction of the $10 coin and to specify its standard composition as 92.5 per cent silver and 7.5 per cent other metal. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>On 22 May last I introduced the Shipping Registration Bill 1980 and proposed that it lie on the table of the House for comment. That Bill of course lapsed but many submissions were received in relation to it and these have resulted in the preparation of a revised Bill which I now introduce. In view of the fact that the Shipping Registration Bill is an important step forward in the development of Australia's status as an independent nation I propose to reiterate many of the points made when introducing the legislation in the previous Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The right of a country to determine the conditions for the grant of its nationality to ships is fundamental to its national sovereignty. In international law the nationality of ships is determined by the flag they are entitled to fly. It is also customary to require at least the larger ships to be registered in order to secure the right to fly the national flag. The present law governing the registration of ships in Australia was enacted by the Parliament at Westminster 87 years ago. Indeed, it is contained in Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. Originally that law applied throughout the British Empire on the basis that a ship was a British ship if it was owned by a British subject or corporation in any part of the Empire. The Act required all British ships to be registered except certain small ships of less than 15 tons carrying capacity. Registration could be effected at any British port of registry throughout the Empire and this entailed the entry of particulars of the ship and of its owners and mortgagees in the register at the port. The registrar at the port was required to transmit returns at regular intervals to the Registrar-General of Shipping and Seamen at Cardiff and in that way a complete record of all British ships was built up. However this procedure has been abandoned in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> From the commencement of the Statute of Westminster 1931, the various member countries of the British Commonwealth were free to repeal the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 and to establish their own shipping registers. However, under an agreement negotiated in 1931 the laws of each country were required to adopt a common status of 'British ship' and to follow closely the provisions of Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. By mutual agreement in 1978 the British Commonwealth Merchant Shipping Agreement 1931 was rescinded by all member countries. Australia is the only major independent member of the Commonwealth, other than Britain itself, to have continued to operate under the Merchant Shipping Act system. The stage has now been reached where it is essential that we put an end to this anachronism. The Commonwealth countries have recently agreed on common principles for the future operation of their own shipping registers. In accordance with those principles the United Kingdom is expected to confine the Merchant Shipping Act system to Britain, to ships more than 50 per cent owned by residents of Britain or companies based in Britain. It is understood that the adoption by Australia of its own national system will simplify the task being undertaken by the British authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The principles underlying the present Bill have been the subject of extensive discussion with the States and the Northern Territory in the Marine and Ports Council of Australia. Their views were taken into account in the framing of the legislation. In recent discussions in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, agreement has been reached on the form of the clause relating to the preservation of State and Territory laws and that revised clause relating to the preservation of State and Territory laws appears in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a description of the main features of the Bill. Firstly, the Bill repeals Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 insofar as it is part of the law of Australia, thus terminating Australia's reliance on the British legislation and clearing the way for the adoption of an appropriate Australian system. Secondly, the provisions spell out the ships that are eligible for Australian registration, either on a compulsory or on a voluntary basis. The main elements are: Defence Force ships are excluded and registration is compulsory only for Australian-owned commercial ships of 12 metres or more in length, other than certain government ships, fishing vessels and pleasure craft; Australian-owned ships for which registration is not compulsory may be registered on a voluntary basis and also ships under 12 metres in length that are owned or operated by Australian citizens or residents may be registered; and registration is also permitted in the case of foreign-owned ships that are demise chartered to Australian interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The procedures for registration, including the evidence of ownership required, the division of property in the ship into 64 shares, issuing of registration certificates and of provisional certificates, and the naming and marking of the ship have been made broadly comparable with the British system to ensure that the changeover from that system to the Australian system can be effected with a minimum of inconvenience for shipowners. The same can be said of the provisions of Part III of the Bill which deal with transfer and transmission of title and the registration and priority of mortgages. </PARA>
<PARA> The flag proposals for Australian ships were arrived at after considerable public discussion. In the Australian Merchant Navy there was strong support for the continued use of the Australian Red Ensign. Therefore it is proposed to declare the Australian Red Ensign the national colours for Australian merchant ships. Regarding other ships the general opinion was that they should be allowed to fly either the Australian National Flag or the Australian Red Ensign. This was accepted on the condition that the two flags would not be flown simultaneously. Complementary amendments to the Flags Act 1953 and the Navigation Act 1912 are necessary. The Flags Amendment Bill and the Navigation Amendment Bill are being introduced for that purpose. Apart from these flags, which until now have been covered by a mixture of British and Australian laws, the British Admiralty has issued individual warrants to certain members of some 16 yacht clubs in Australia, authorising them to wear the British Blue Ensign, either undefaced or in a defaced form. The British Blue Ensign is similar to the Australian National Flag but without the stars. Approximately 400 Australian yacht owners have been issued with such warrants. This causes some difficulty as under the Geneva Convention on the High Seas 1958, to which Australia is a party, ships have the nationality of the country whose flag they are entitled to fly. </PARA>
<PARA> These international requirements apply particularly to the high seas. It is possible to permit departure from the Convention requirement in the Australian territorial sea and internal waters. In view of the concern expressed by yacht owners who presently have Blue Ensign warrants, the Bill will allow them to continue to fly that flag in Australian waters so long as British law allows them to fly the flag. The Bill also preserves the use of the flag of a State or Territory in Australian waters and contains provisions in respect of flag rights for unregistered Australian ships. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of Parts IV and V of the Bill set out the broad administrative arrangements for the establishment and operation of the Australian Register of Ships. In this area there are some significant departures from the present system. The proposed Australian system is basically a centralised system in that there will be only one register. The Bill provides that the Register and copies of the Register or such part or parts of the Register as the Minister directs shall be kept at such places as the Minister directs. It also provides that there shall be, at such a place in Australia as the Minister determines, an Australian Shipping Registration Office and such number of branch registration offices as the Minister determines. This is a flexible arrangement and it enables a certain amount of decentralisation. However, it does not suffer from the disadvantage of the present system in Australia under which there is a separate register at each of 20 ports of registry and the complete record of all ships registered in Australia is not available at any one place. One consequence of that change is that there will be no ports of registry as such. However, because of the importance of the port of registry concept for legal and other purposes, the Bill makes provision for the adoption of a concept of home port for each ship and the regulations will spell this out in greater detail including the practice of continuing to mark the port on the ship's stern. </PARA>
<PARA> Part VI of the Bill contains a number of miscellaneous provisions including power to remove unqualified ships from the Register and the provision of penalties for offences. It also includes the clauses relating to the preservation of State and Territory laws and the review of decisions of the Minister or the Registrar by the courts or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Finally, the Bill contains transitional provisions that have been framed in such a way as to minimise any inconvenience to the owners and mortgagees of ships registered in Australia under the Merchant Shipping Act. On the commencement date the existing registers will be deemed to form part of the Australian Register and no further action will be required of owners or mortgagees in order to effect the transition to the Australian Register. The Australian Register will of course make use of modern procedures, equipment and documentation and ships will be progressively transferred over to the new documentation after the commencement date. As I mentioned, this Bill is an important step forward in the development of our status as an independent nation. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Flags Amendment Bill is a small Bill to complement the Shipping Registration Bill 1981 and the Navigation Amendment Bill 1981. The only amendment of substance is made to Schedule 1 of the Flags Act 1953, which contains the description of the Australian National Flag. The new wording to be inserted in that Schedule will describe both the Australian National Flag and the Australian Red Ensign. This is necessary because at present the description of the Australian Red Ensign is partly contained in section 406 of the Navigation Act 1912, which is being repealed by the Navigation Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> One consequence of this adjustment is that the present reference to the British Blue Ensign in describing the Australian National Flag is removed. This means that the description of the Australian flags stands on its own and does not rely on reference to the flag of another country. Other changes proposed in the amending Bill are of a drafting nature only. I refer honourable members also to the remarks I made in my second reading speech on the Shipping Registration Bill on the question of flags to be worn by Australian ships. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The principal purpose of the Navigation Amendment Bill 1981 is to amend the Navigation Act so as to accord with the proposed Shipping Registration Act. The Shipping Registration Bill which I have just introduced provides for the prescribing of the national colours to be flown by Australian ships and therefore the Navigation Amendment Bill repeals an overlapping provision in the Navigation Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Many provisions of the Navigation Act refer to British ships and, in particular, the whole of Part II is expressed to apply only to British ships except where a contrary intention appears. These references to British ships are being replaced with references to ships registered in Australia under the Shipping Registration Act or otherwise having a close connection with Australia. Schedule 2 to the Bill contains many of these consequential amendments. Australia's withdrawal from the British Commonwealth Merchant Shipping Agreement 1931, which took effect in 1979, is an added reason for making these changes. Provisions of the Navigation Act relating to the tonnage measurement of ships refer to ships registered in Australia under the Merchant Shipping Act. There is a similar reference in section 411 of the Act. These provisions are being replaced with references to the Shipping Registration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> A second purpose of the Bill is to update the offence provisions of the Navigation Act and to ensure that the penalties prescribed are appropriate to present-day conditions. These amendments are made by clause 44 and Schedule 3 to the Bill. Some of the amendments affect sections of the principal Act introduced in 1979 or 1980 that are not yet in force. Special commencement arrangements are required for these provisions and are contained in sub-clause 2(5) and Schedule 1 to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The general purpose of these amendments is to update the level of pecuniary penalties in line with present money values. At the same time opportunity has been taken to repeal offences that are not relevant to present-day conditions or that are now covered by the general criminal law. Other improvements are the provision of higher pecuniary penalties for offences by corporations and the provision of indictable offences that can be dealt with summarily if the parties and the court all agree. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes a number of minor adjustments that are considered to be appropriate at this time. An example of this is contained in clause 6, which adjusts the Minister's power of delegation. Another example is in paragraph 3 (2) (c) of the Bill, which adjusts the definition of 'ship' in relation to off-shore industry mobile units that are not self-propelled. Finally, the Bill proposes to insert into the Act a power to exempt ships from one or more of the provisions of the Act where the ships come within the jurisdiction of the Act only infrequently-for example, where they have to undergo a single interstate voyage. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is always a privilege to participate in the Address-in-Reply debate in this House. Equally, it is a privilege to represent the electorate of Franklin. Franklin is an average electorate that could be regarded as reflecting across the board the problems facing people in all Australian electorates today. I was particularly interested in the remarks of the Governor-General when he said in his Speech that the Government is committed to a range of social security and welfare measures which will strengthen the family and through it the basic social fabric of this country. Already the Government has introduced a number of measures designed to assist the family. There are many others that need to be introduced. I can understand that the Treasury dollar can go only so far. Therefore, as a member of this House, one must fight tenaciously to make absolutely certain that the people in need in the community are the ones who receive assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said on many occasions that the Department of Social Security has many grave problems to combat. The care of the sick and the aged and the protection of the welfare of the needy in the community are becoming extremely complex. One can argue the political point, but far too many arguments are based on political points. We find that we get ourselves locked into a situation in which all we do is talk and fight. I am afraid that a great number of people in the community who have problems suffer as a result of the form of those arguments. During times of high inflation, people on fixed incomes have been adversely affected. The backlash of that has been spelt out over and over again in this House. Admittedly, although inflation is decreasing we still have a difficult situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The unfortunate aspect of high unemployment already has been mentioned in this debate. Regrettably when people cannot get jobs the social implications flow right back through the family unit and thus many people are affected adversely. Over the years I have been involved in politics it has been sad to find that the parents of young people who cannot find employment suffer also. The young people are affected psychologically, but the parents also suffer. Unfortunately it has been one of the gravest problems tearing at the social fabric of Australia for many decades. It is only natural that when children cannot find employment there are problems. Those problems have flowed right through the family. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has introduced many measures to overcome this situation but, unfortunately, there are reasons-and they are fairly well known-why we have not been able to overcome those problems completely. It saddens me to think that there are so many elderly and sick people in the community who are unable to afford repairs to their homes or are unable to afford people to assist when they need assistance. A very simple example is that of mowing lawns. Yet, on the other hand, there are many young people who would love to do something constructive but unfortunately they cannot be harnessed in such a way as to overcome those sorts of problems. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two schools of thought about this matter. One school of thought suggests we should not introduce compulsory national service or compulsory schemes where people would be paid to do certain work, and the other believes they should be involved in community affairs to a degree and not get paid. We all know those arguments; we have discussed them many times in this House. Unfortunately, we are never able to come to a consensus about the matter. Consequently, sometimes the young people of Australia head in a direction that we can only term as being down the path of self destruction. We need to do more about it; we need to talk more about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night I listened with interest to my colleague the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr) who talked about restructuring government. He talked about more participation by members, et cetera. I agreed with some of the sentiments that he expressed but I did not agree with others because I thought he was taking the easy way out. It is very easy for a backbencher to say that if he does not toe the line he will not get all the little bits and pieces. I do not think that is relevant because, in this arena, one has to fight for what one believes in. If a backbencher fights and believes he has been defeated on a certain point, he should come back for more. He does not look for the easy way out, because there is no easy way out in this political arena. Therefore, in regard to the unemployment problem we need to work together to a degree and not to try to take political points off each other when this matter is discussed. We should not use certain statistics from our own areas to embarrass someone else who is earnestly trying to overcome the problem, because, as we all know, the electorates of Australia vary considerably. Each electorate is different. Some we term 'blue ribbon' electorates, where unemployment is not so high, and others, such as my own, are ordinary electorates in comparison and have all those sorts of problems. I am glad my friend the honourable member for Wilmot has come into the House. All the electorates are different, so we need to start to talk together. I hope we may be able to overcome those problems and stop some of the bitterness that occurs when we start talking about one of those subjects. </PARA>

We are all aware of the millions of dollars that have been misused as a result of certain social security activities and of how the Government searches out those who abuse the system and thus decrease the benefits that could and should flow to others who are genuinely in need. I suppose we have to live with it because not everybody is fair, not everybody cares for his neighbour, and not everybody cares for the needy. They pretend to; they talk about it; and they use it as a platform for themselves: But that is all they do. When it comes to getting their hands dirty and trying to overcome a problem, they are left wanting. I am afraid that there are far too many like that in Australia. I would like to direct a little barb at some of the social welfare workers with whom I get involved. All they can do is talk and, when they are put to the real test, they cannot measure up to it. They cannot overcome the problems and they are afraid to work in some of the areas in which I have to work. I am afraid we have far too many talkers and not enough workers. It is up to the politicians to do a tremendous amount more than merely give lip service. They should fight on a political level to overcome some of the problems I have mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have fought hard.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XD4">Mr GOODLUCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have fought hard. I thank my colleague, the honourable member for Braddon. He is a genuine fellow and he knows a genuine attempt to overcome these problems. Like most politicians, to a certain degree I have been involved with the problems of the elderly pensioners in my community. Unfortunately, some live in sub-standard homes which are structurally inferior and to some degree are infested with pests and vermin. That statement has been echoed by many reports. It is estimated that over 100,000 persons living in Australia are in a difficult situation. It is estimated that 24,000 people over the age of 60 are living in houses or flats that are completely beyond repair. I think one can derive from those figures the fact that we have a massive job to do and that continual political arguing will not overcome the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I plead again with people who, for one reason or another, derive social welfare benefits unlawfully to think carefully of those elderly people who live in what can only be termed shocking conditions. In some cases it can be argued that those conditions are partly their own fault and, of course, all people are not the same. However, in the majority of cases, the result has been determined by circumstances. I repeat that it could have resulted from their having reared large families, from sickness or from ill-luck that they are in such difficult straits today. We cannot continue to use as an example that that person did something or other and therefore deserves what he or she gets. We have to look more deeply at that problem, be more compassionate and not use the same rule for everybody. It is up to every politician in this Parliament to realise the needs of those people and help them to overcome their problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, we are faced with the problems of those people living in nursing homes. It is estimated that approximately 56,000 people live in such institutions. I have mentioned on many occasions that Australia has a greater number of nursing home beds per 1,000 head of population than any other country. It shows an extraordinary weakness in our civilisation that we have so many selfish people-I use the word 'selfish' deliberately-who unfortunately cannot wait to get rid of their elderly relatives and put them into nursing homes. That problem could be argued but we must realise that if we are to maintain the strong family unit we must be absolutely certain and be very careful about what we do with our elderly parents. </PARA>
<PARA> Like all other politicians, I visit senior citizens' homes, nursing homes, et cetera, and it saddens me to see some of those lonely people who are young really and who have been placed in those homes. I am afraid that some of their families should hide their faces in shame. This is not the case on all occasions because I know that some elderly people cannot be looked after by their families; so they have to go to a certain place to be looked after properly. But some families are selfish. Consequently, we as a government are faced with the massive problem of trying to direct funds to the people who really need them when, in fact, funds are sometimes being wasted by other people. </PARA>
<PARA> The elderly become sick, difficult to handle and, of course, create many problems for the children; so the children have no alternative and many of them are very sad indeed to place their mothers or fathers in nursing homes. I am sure that the standard in most nursing homes is good. Most of the staff realise that it is a difficult job and that it requires compassion and, of course, time. But growing old can have many grave problems. Therefore I ask everybody to consider carefully the problems of the aged to make absolutely certain that we do all within our power to direct the necessary funds and make the necessary commitment to overcome some of their problems because those problems are real. We have to search for them and make certain that we understand them. </PARA>
<PARA> It saddens me when I go to many senior citizen functions to find that there is a predominance of ladies who have lost their husbands through death. They have been left alone. All the males in Australia must consider not only that the ladies are living a lot longer but also that they are being faced with massive problems when their husbands go. They cannot look after their homes or do the normal things their husbands would have done for them. Therefore, we have to be very careful to make sure that we understand what is occurring in our community and make certain that we overcome these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many fine lobby groups which represent the elderly people. Their publicity machines are permanently primed, they respond with quickness to Press inquiries, they can quickly submit evidence to a government inquiry and they co-operate and know exactly what to do and where to strike on a critical point. I think they realise that the only way they can overcome the massive problems of the aged in this country is to fight on a political basis. Of course, at times we are plagued and inundated with people trying to make us provide funds. I know that Ministers are plagued in this way. But we have to be very careful to make sure that the people who receive the funds are those who deserve them. We have to make sure that some of the worthy organisations hiding in the backwoods receive those funds. As politicians we must make certain that Ministers are aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the family. After being personally involved with single parent families, and to a degree with others in this House in campaigning for payments to lone fathers, I became even more aware of some of the disadvantages suffered by many children of single parent families. The difficulties of raising a family today are increasing, as is the incidence of family breakdown. The children of one parent families are becoming increasingly more vulnerable, although in most cases through no fault of the parent. In many cases the children are obliged to be left alone for long periods. I have found instances of poor diet, lack of warm clothing and emotional problems largely created by the unhappiness or loss of morale of the parent as a result of the breakdown of the marriage. Children need a great deal of personal care and attention if they are to grow up as adults willing and able to contribute to this society. Security and stability are, therefore, essential. There is a strong link between the experiencing of such problems and the high incidence of unemployment or employment difficulties among some young people. </PARA>
<PARA> In many cases lone parent families suffer a high degree of social and economic disadvantage. As a country, we need to be more aware of family breakups. We need to re-educate the general public and to alert the people of Australia to the fact that this continual breakdown of marriages is having a disastrous effect not only on the young and the parents but also it is unfortunately having a grave effect on the economy of this country. The economy can only stand a certain amount of disruption. When we have these continual breakdowns every day, somebody has to pay somebody to help somebody else. If it is a breakdown between the mother and the father usually she is left with the children and needs assistance from the Government. Now there is a benefit which can be paid also to the lone father. The problem goes on and on and it is becoming more and more dangerous to our economy as each year goes by. Therefore, I am a great advocate of the need to increase family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> It is argued that the Government cannot afford to do so. Of course, there is a reason for that argument. But if we increase family allowances, we may be able to get the mothers to stay at home and look after their children a little more, which may help to keep the family together. I know that situation is not perfect and that some honourable members on the other side of the House can smile about it. I know that it is not a Utopian situation but at least this is a thrust which we should try. As the family structure is breaking down we, as a Government, are beginning to argue about all the things occurring but we are not achieving anything. By directing increased family allowances to the family, we might be able to overcome the problems that I have mentioned. I and many other members in this House know that there are grave problems. If we apply more funds in that direction we may be able to overcome these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that I am a great advocate of increased family allowances. Many honourable members on my side of the House may disagree or agree with me, but I believe that if we are to overcome the problems we need to analyse carefully what some people are saying, namely, that we should not increase family allowances because that will have an adverse effect on the economy. We must look more deeply at the problem and realise that many people are affected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to begin by thanking all the people in the electorate of Burke who supported me and assisted in my election. I am grateful to all the members of the Australian Labor Party in Burke and to the people at the Melbourne head office who worked very hard during the campaign. I would also like to pay tribute to my predecessor, Mr Keith Johnson who, as Deputy Whip, made a considerable contribution to the Labor Party in Parliament. I wish to begin my speech in the Address-in-Reply debate by reminding honourable members of the concluding words in the Governor-General's Speech, when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My Government believes that this-an explanation to the Australian people of the ideas, principles and values in terms of which the Government of the day shapes its policies-is something which has been somewhat neglected in Australia and that this neglect has diminished the quality of political life of the country. It believes that this should be remedied. During the life of this Parliament, therefore, my Government will be making a serious and sustained effort to explain to the Australian people the philosophy on which it bases its approach to governing. </PARA>
<PARA>My occupation before coming to this place was that of lecturer in political philosophy and political science, so I welcome the Government's intention to debate the deeper philosophical issues determining policy and the long term goals of our society. Certainly, we on the Labor side have nothing to fear from a debate on ideas, principles and values, for our party, the Australian Labor Party, has always represented the values of equality and justice. The intention expressed in the Governor-General's Speech to explain the philosophy on which the Liberal and National Country parties base their policies seems to have led to certain peculiar developments in the staff of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). It appears that we are witnessing the invasion of the right wing academics. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are to be spent paying these individuals supposedly to illuminate ordinary Australians who, it is said, do not understand Mr Fraser's actions. </PARA>
<PARA> The ancient Greek philosophers, with whom I have some affinity, coined the word 'sophistry'. By this they meant the use of philosophical arguments, which appear to illuminate but which in fact lead one to completely false conclusions. Unfortunately, the Governor-General's Speech, plus other statements on philosophy by the Prime Minister, are nothing more than attempted sophistry. For clearly, it is sophistry to speak of the policies of the present government as based on a small 'l' liberal philosophy. Indeed, the vast majority of Australia's political theorists believe that the Fraser Government's past policies have nothing to do with liberalism, in any meaningful sense of that term. Of course, if there had been a change of policies, if indeed Mr Fraser had learnt something from the dramatic--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Prime Minister had learnt something from the dramatic swing against the Government it may have been possible to call his program liberalism. But no, we are told that the Government will maintain the basic thrust of the policies which have been followed over the past five years. It appears that the Australian people are to have more of the same medicine, the only change being what Mr Laurie Oakes described as 'the selling of a government', that is, the use of liberal principles as propaganda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind honourable members opposite that the liberal tradition was based on maximising the liberty of the individual through opposition to oppressive power structures. These structures included not only the State, but also other organisations, including major corporations that control the lives of many thousands of people. The father of modern liberalism, John Stuart Mill, believed that the State could only interfere with the freedom of the individual in order to prevent harm to others. Mill envisaged a society in which each person's needs would be met, while at the same time maximising human liberty. This true liberalism is so far removed from the present policies of the Government that one can only conclude either that it is totally ignorant of that philosophy or is blatantly misusing it to deceive the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the present policies of the Fraser Government, far from being liberal-humanist, are based on an extreme, somewhat frightening, form of conservatism. By his own confession, the Prime Minister's real philosophy is based on the half-baked ideas of people like Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman, both of whom have explicitly rejected liberalism. According to this new conservatism, the present crisis situation in Western economies is to be resolved by imposing severe burdens on the working people of those countries. These policies involve an intervention by the Government on behalf of the rich against the poor. In Australia, these policies have reduced real wages and standards of living. They have done real harm to the average Australian family and have dramatically increased the number of people in poverty. Yet the outrageous thing about this is that the Government seeks to sell this exercise in turning back the clock to nineteenth century economics by appeals to the noble concept of liberty. To be poor and needy is not freedom; it is oppression, and tyranny. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two general slogans which are repeated ad nauseam by the Government in this propaganda exercise. The first one is described thus by the Governor-General:</PARA>
<PARA> My Government does believe profoundly that it is vitally important that the powers and functions of the State should be limited and contained. </PARA>
<PARA>Hardly anyone would disagree with this general principle, but again it is the way the Government manipulates it that concerns us. For the Government uses this principle to justify its brutal attack on the Public Service, its attempt to reduce not only the size of various departments but also to cut out some departments altogether. The argument here seems to be: The smaller the public sector and the State, the more free individuals in a society will be. This argument is manifestly absurd. It is based on failure to differentiate between those activities of the Government which actually harm individuals and those activities which help and support them, those activities which increase freedom and those activities which reduce it. This Government's actions clearly show that it will increase activities that harm Australians, as in its support for mining corporations against the Aboriginal people. Its actions show too that it will reduce the liberties of our people. An example of this is the legislation to attack unions and the right to strike. On this point, contrast the present Government's views with what John Stuart Mill said about unions over 100 years ago. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I pass to another kind of government interference, in which the end and the means are alike odious . . . I mean the laws against combinations of workmen to raise wages; laws enacted and maintained for the declared purpose of keeping wages low . . . If it were possible for the working classes, by combining among themselves, to raise or keep up the general rate of wages, it needs hardly be said that this would be a thing not to be punished but to be welcomed and rejoiced at. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that when the Fraser Government speaks of reducing the size of the State, it attacks those departments whose function it is to provide services to the Australian people, especially the poor, the disadvantaged, the migrants, the unemployed and the sick. Indeed the Government was strongly attacked by the Young Liberals on this very point. The present policies and the ministerial inquiry are designed to do nothing more than reduce that sector of the state which is providing for human needs. Yet if the Government were genuine in what it says about caring for people, let it strengthen-not weaken-this sector of the state. Let it provide decent social security for the millions of Australians who are in need so that they might at least live at the level of the poverty line, instead of well below it. Of course, the Government will not take up this proposal because, as the Governor-General told us, it believes: '. . . that the State is likely to be in many ways an inefficient and wasteful provider and that many services can be better supplied in other ways'. Yet are we to suppose from this statement that health, education, transport, welfare, environmental protection and a host of other State services can be better provided by the so-called free enterprise sector? If this is so, why then do most Western societies maintain these services through the public sector? The answer clearly is because the capitalist system-especially the large corporations-will not provide them. We forget that prior to the development of the human needs sector of the state, people were left to starve by the huge corporations which cared nought for their welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> The second slogan of Fraserism is the glorification of so-called free enterprise. According to the Prime Minister's December speech, capitalism is said to be, firstly, responsible for improvements in standards of living in the twentieth century and, secondly, a necessary condition for political freedom. However, it is at least arguable that it is not capitalism, but rather the democratic welfare state and the development of trade unions, which have been responsible for the increases in living standards of workers. Yet as the Prime Minister concedes, both these latter factors are not essential elements of the capitalist economy as such. The claim that only capitalism is compatible with political freedom is dogmatic, and few political philosophers would entertain it. Even Mill believed that it was possible that some form of socialism would allow for greater freedom. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there is reference to 'imperfections' in capitalism, the Prime Minister shows no recognition of the fundamental evils which are essential elements of a rampant private enterprise system, namely, the savage inequalities between the rich and the poor and an ethic of greed and materialism. As His Holiness, Pope John Paul, said two months ago about modern capitalism:</PARA>
<PARA> Side by side with those who are wealthy and living in plenty, there exist those who are living in want, suffering misery . . . It is obvious that a fundamental defect, or rather a series of defects, indeed a defective machinery, is at the root of contemporary economics and materialistic civilisation which does not allow the human family to break free from such radically unjust situations. </PARA>
<PARA>More seriously, the Fraser speech confuses modern monopoly capitalism with the ideal free enterprise system, which no longer exists, if it ever did. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not deny that in any modern society there is room for a private sector, consisting of small companies in genuine competition with each other. However, what democratic socialists do not, and will not, accept is the way in which modern capitalism has historically developed-with power and wealth increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small number of multinational corporations which control not only the resources but also the destiny of the nation and its people. In Australia, this excessive ownership and control by foreign corporations has been well documented by people such as Professor Wheelwright. This development in the capitalist system-the increasing monopolisation of power and wealth-is actively supported by the Fraser Government, notwithstanding its denials. As evidence for this, witness the Government's actions in overriding its own advisers in Treasury and refusing to impose a resources tax so that the Australian people might gain some benefit from the exploitation of their own mineral resources. </PARA>
<PARA> This intervention by the state on behalf of big business is not a peripheral feature of modern private enterprise-it has now become an essential feature of the system. Whilst the Government talks about reducing the power of the state, it has in fact intervened to an increasing degree to stifle competition and to support increasing control of vast areas of our economy by a small number of corporations, as in its actions to emasculate the Trade Practices Commission, thus ensuring that price fixing and other forms of conspiracy are not prevented. Yet the liberal economist, Adam Smith, warned that if capitalists are allowed to follow their general tendencies and reduce competition, they 'levy for their own benefit an absurd tax on the rest of their fellow citizens'. John Stuart Mill recognised that such state-created monopolies would increase prices and that people have to pay what is demanded for basic necessities of life. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a fact of economic life which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) conveniently chooses to ignore. He has sought to blame workers' wage increases for inflation and other economic ills. This is putting the cart before the horse, for workers merely seek to keep up with artificially inflated price increases imposed by the power of big business, a power which is not responsive to the will of the people. The capacity of these corporations to fix prices as they wish is the major cause of inflation and until the Government faces this fact its monetary policies will fail. They will merely place further burdens on the majority of Australian workers, as with the recent rises in interest rates on homes. Yet the power of these corporations is not limited to increasing prices. They can-again without reference to the democratic will-dismiss hundreds or even thousands of workers and thus dramatically increase unemployment. This was clearly demonstrated by the callous action of General Motors-Holden's Ltd at its Pagewood plant. They can also, without notice, remove their capital and investments from the country and thereby create serious economic problems for any government. These developments of monopolistic capitalism are extremely disturbing and dangerous. They have nothing to do with freedom- quite the contrary. The very sovereignty and legitimacy of our democratic society is being threatened, as I have argued in my book. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Liberals are genuinely concerned with individual liberty, with the improvement of the people and with providing for human needs, they need radically to re-evaluate their program and change direction. They need to support the public interest against foreign private interest; they need to introduce a Bill of rights; they need to break up monopolies and ensure genuine competition in the private sector; and they need to protect the individual against the excessive power of corporations and to provide for his or her welfare when the private economy fails to do so. If the Liberal Party fails to do this, the judgment of history on it will be harsh. It will be remembered as a reactionary group which sold out the interests of the Australian people and which created poverty and unemployment unparalleled since the Great Depression. It is because of the two million Australians in poverty, the vast social inequalities and the record levels of unemployment, that we believe that one must go beyond the principles of liberalism. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the Fraser conservatives, the Labor Party does not wish to obscure its real philosophy; we are proud of our belief in democratic socialism and stand ready to defend it, both in the Parliament and throughout the nation. Since 1921, our socialisation objective has provided the basic philosophical direction for the party. Although the wording has changed from time to time the essence has remained the same. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange to the extent necessary to eradicate exploitation and other anti-social features.</PARA>
<PARA>This objective determines a long term program of transformation of Australian society, especially in the economic area. We are concerned to eradicate the evils of advanced monopolistic capitalism that I referred to earlier. Although there may be disagreements between us on the strategy and pace of change, we are united in our long term goals, which include the following: Firstly, the redistribution of wealth to reduce inequalities and provide everyone with a guaranteed minimum income. The obscenity of the richest 10 per cent owning 59 per cent of the wealth while the poorest 10 per cent own only 0.27 per cent must be eradicated. As Mr Hayden said in 1979:</PARA>
<PARA> If resources cannot be found through growth then they must be diverted away from those who have them in overabundance and directed to the fulfilment of urgent human needs. </PARA>
<PARA>Our second goal is for dramatic increases in the level of public ownership and control of major resources, especially in the mining and energy areas. The wealth generated from such productive enterprises would go to achieve our third general goal-increases in the quality and quantity of human needs services provided by the state, including better education, health, welfare and public transport. </PARA>
<PARA> Our fourth goal is the introduction of more industrial democracy and worker participation, especially in public enterprises and partly socialised industries. Our fifth goal is the establishment of new productive areas of the state, in the form of public companies which will both compete with private firms and create many more jobs for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The general philosophy of the Labor Party has never been more relevant than it is today, for together with other countries of the Western world we are faced with an economic crisis of substantial proportions. Indeed, it can plausibly be argued that, if it were not for the happy accident that we have many natural resources, the Australian economy would be in a similar crisis to that of the United Kingdom. Certainly, as Peter Robinson has argued in his book, The Crisis of Australian Capitalism, our manufacturing and service industries are facing severe difficulties. Furthermore, as Mr Keith Windschuttle has shown in his book, Unemployment, this economic crisis has translated itself into a social crisis. In the last five years we have had massive increases in violent crimes, suicide rates, marital breakdown, drug addiction and other social ills-all of which are tearing the fabric of society apart. Yet the Government has no real program to solve these problems-it does not even recognise the real causes. </PARA>
<PARA> The ancient Greeks-who had hundreds of years of democratic experience-believed that democracy can survive only if the people are well informed about the values and philosophies by which they are governed. We in the Labor Party believe that our democratic socialist philosophy provides the basis for a more just and egalitarian society. As Bill Hayden commented recently: 'We must return to our socialist heritage . . . and not try to sneak in through the back door as a low key, pale imitation of the conservatives'. In the next three years, we shall endeavour to explain our philosophy, because we believe that our values are the same as those of the Australian people themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to speak in this Address-in-Reply debate. I congratulate the Government on its performance. The Governor-General said in his speech that the Government's economic policies have considerably improved Australian international competitiveness and enhanced export opportunities for Australian industries. The Australian economy is in good shape. The recent consumer price index figure of 9.3 per cent inflation in the last financial year shows that our policies are working. Recent retail sales figures show that the consumer is spending. There are a number of other encouraging favourable economic indices. It is important that we concentrate on creating wealth in the community and a healthy private sector does just this. The wealth so created benefits the community by the creation of jobs, opportunities for further investment and tax revenue for government expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think all honourable members will agree that there is an unacceptably high number of people unemployed at the present time but there are more people in jobs in Australia now than at any other time in our history. This trend will continue as, in the next few years, new resource and manufacturing development projects will create tens of thousands of jobs. The Government's policies on development and economic growth are in stark contrast to the Opposition's attitude to the developmental decade ahead. The Australian Labor Party says that it is in favour of development but actually it is hard to find a project that has its support. The Labor Party's attitude to uranium mining is well known. It is against the important aluminium development project in Portland, Victoria. Essentially, when all is boiled down and analysed, the only industries which the Australian Labor Party supports in Australia are reafforestation, housing and solar energy. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish the committee of senior Ministers reviewing the functions of all Commonwealth departments and associated agencies-the so-called Lynch committee or razor gang-success in its task. As the Governor-General said, that review will recommend which functions might be reduced, eliminated or altered so as to achieve a more efficient and economic administration. It will also examine areas where Commonwealth activities overlap with those of the States or intrude into the private sector. I am encouraged by this morning's Press reports that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is to widen the scope of the committee and enlarge the committee's responsibilities by giving it new directions. Perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) might consider having a phone-in similar to that of the Minister for Economic Development in Victoria. I would certainly commend to the Minister that he consider taking the advice of independent, outside consultants-independent of Government-in reviewing the functions of government departments. There is a real risk, when one gets Ministers and departments making recommendations about their own reductions, of almost attempting the impossible, in that bureaucrats are hardly likely to recommend to Ministers their own abolition. This review provides a great opportunity to get rid of a large number of bodies advising government. Additionally there is a broad range of government functions that could be better carried out by the private sector. Auditing, accounting and computing come quickly to mind. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's recent decision not to impose any form of indirect taxation has put more pressure on the need for this committee's recommendations to be successful as government expenditure must be significantly cut to give the urgent tax relief necessary to those thousands of Australians who need it. The committee has one of the most important tasks in the history of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of taxation relief, it is urgently necessary to increase the amount of discretionary or disposable income available to Australian families to increase the freedom of choice of taxpayers in spending their own incomes as was mentioned in the Speech by His Excellency the Governor-General. One option to be seriously considered is to allow single income families to split their incomes. The policy objective to restrain public expenditure is now more important than it was at the time the Governor-General spoke because of the Government's subsequent decision not to alter the tax mix by introducing indirect taxation. The strain on personal income tax payers must be relieved. The Government deserves credit for establishing a three-tiered standard rate tax scale system and for the reductions in personal taxation already achieved. There is, however, still a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking of the Public Service, I must state to the House that I believe one of the great challenges of the decade is control over the bureaucracy, the growth, nature and function of the Public Service. The Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act is a start in this direction, but only a start. Public servants cannot have security of tenure on the one hand and the unfettered right to strike at the whim and will of union officials on the other. The public is sick and tired of being inconvenienced. Public servants must accept that they really are so much better off than many thousands of Australians in the private sector and that, by continually striking, they have abused their preferential position. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of industrial relations, trade unions and the role of organised labour is one of the keys to where Australia is going in the decade ahead. Undoubtedly, a number of union officials are abusing the trust of their members in wielding power at times to bring selective industries to a standstill. Look at the harm the Australian Council of Trade Unions-backed Qantas Airways Ltd strike is doing to Australia and its overseas reputation at this time. This is one of Australia's tragedies and we have to look towards improving industrial relations. The poor state of affairs is a challenge for managers and management. I consider that there is a need for Australian employers to improve their handling of Australia's industrial relations matters. Managers at all levels, whether chief executive, plant, or divisional, need to be trained to be more skilled in dealing with industrial relations problems, preferably as to prevention of them. We live in the era of the wildcat strike and we need to achieve mechanisms for resolving confrontation between management and labour. There is a need for greater communication between management and the shop floor. I believe the effect of ever increasing wage demands and union activity causing unemployment is well understood in the community. We need to develop a consensus among government, unions, employers and the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area to which I refer is the orderly development of Australia in the 1980s. We need to have a clear overall idea of the country's industries that will be successful in the decade. I see the need for greater co-ordination between the States, as I believe the States have a vital and important role to play in resource development. We need to look towards setting up and establishing a set of guidelines in consultation and co-operation with the States to see that development is co-ordinated in an orderly way. The Australian Loan Council and the Foreign Investment Review Board have important roles to play, as have State and Federal taxation and royalty policies. The Foreign Investment Review Board alone cannot be the arbiter of new projects, nor can the Australian Loan Council. A framework needs to be developed. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia at present there is undoubtedly a trend of transfer of ownership from individuals to financial institutions and, to some extent, overseas investors. The need for capital for new projects in the 1980s is one of the greatest challenges to the economy. In the last five years, $2.5 billion has been raised through Australian stock exchanges as new equity capital. One billion dollars of this amount was raised in the most recent financial year and comes largely from mining companies' capital raisings. This has to be compared with the predicted $33.4 billion in capital required for projects either committed or in the final stage of feasibility for the next five years. Enormous amounts of local equity capital will be required. My figures do not include investment projects of less than $5m, which would include the majority of manufacturing industry investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The disincentives to individuals investing through the stock exchanges must be reviewed. Individuals must be encouraged to buy shares in corporations. Questions to be examined include double taxation of the income of public companies by way of dividends in the hands of individuals, the 30-20 rule obligating certain life and pensions funds to purchase government securities, the special taxation treatment of life companies, and the rates and nature of commissions charged by stockbrokers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that individual Australians identify with the development of Australia, and have ownership of it. It is important that shareholdings in resource development projects be as widely spread as possible throughout the community, especially amongst those who work for particular corporations. The capacity for individuals who work for corporations to participate in their ownership may be one of the ways in which we can improve Australia's poor industrial relations. At Grand Central Station in New York, a leading firm of stockbrokers has an office. I look forward to the day when an Australian stock and share broker has an office on Flinders Street Station. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge is all the greater for individuals to participate in the decade ahead in the ownership of enterprises because in the past fund raising has coincided with a period of low investment in the commercial property market. There is evidence that this trend will not continue and that the commercial property market will be competing for funds with the development projects to which I have referred. While talking of Australian participation in resource development, I would raise what I consider to be a loophole in the foreign investment guidelines that needs examination. This loophole, I believe, allows overseas engineers and consulting firms to get too large a share of work in resource development projects. There needs to be more Australian participation in firms servicing the resource construction industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the position of homeless people in Australia today-an apparently increasing problem in the community. The Government has pledged $10m for a 3-year homeless persons assistance program, with special priority for young people. The Government is currently considering matters which require determination before the policy commitment can be implemented. One issue is to make sure that assistance is directed fairly to meet the need of client groups. I have received a copy of a report on homeless youth from a group in Malvern, in my electorate in Victoria, prepared by project officers at the Malvern Self Help Employment Exchange. I think this is a valuable document in analysing the problems and causes of young homeless people being adrift in the community. I have forwarded a copy of the report to Senator Chaney, the Minister for Social Security, as I believe it has a wider application than just in the municipality of Malvern and could assist in implementing the policy promise. The development of these policies is urgent. We have restored opportunity through economic growth. The Government's policies are succeeding. However, we still have a way to go. We are taxing working savings, work and initiatives beyond reasonable limits. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to philosophy before I conclude. We have just been treated by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous), to an unbelievable, incredible and ridiculous attempt to analyse Liberal Party philosophy. All the honourable member did was to make an attempt that failed to destroy the philosophy of the Liberal Party. That shows that the Australian Labor Party is destructive; it is not constructive. The honourable member said that he was proud of his belief in socialism. I reiterate that he said he was proud of his belief in socialism. He reaffirmed it. He said that the socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange to the extent necessary to eradicate exploitation and other anti-social features is still the belief of the Australian Labor Party. He said that this objective remains a long term program for the transformation of Australian society. That is what the Labor Party is about. It wants to transform Australian society by socialisation, by increased ownership by government of activities in the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are interjecting on the other side of the House because I have hit the raw nerve. The Labor Party is about socialisation. The previous speaker's words were about socialising the means of production, distribution and exchange. That is what the previous speaker, a member of the Labor Party, reaffirmed. What does this mean? It means increased taxation to finance the growth of the public sector to transform, as they call it, Australian society. It means increases in public expenditure. It means increases in the number of public servants. It means more and more bureaucrats. It means the growth of the bureaucracy. That is what the Labor Party is about today, and it has just been reaffirmed in this House. I want to bring that fact to the attention of those people listening today to this debate. The Governor-General in his Speech stated:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by expressing my delight in being sent here to represent the electorate of Macquarie, and I thank the electors for their trust. I have come to this House on my third attempt, that is, after three elections. I should particularly like to thank my family-my wife, Margaret, and my three sons-for all that they have put up with for a very long time indeed. I should also like to thank the local organisation of the Australian Labor Party, the party's New South Wales and national offices, and the members of the parliamentary Labor Party for their constant support and encouragement over a long and at times difficult road. I should also like to extend good wishes for a long and happy retirement to my immediate predecessor, the former Liberal member for this seat, and to his wife. I congratulate him on his recent endorsement as a State candidate, and I repeat my desire that his retirement should be a long and undisturbed one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The electorate I represent, the seat of Macquarie, was one of the original seats in the Parliament. Its face was changed, however, with the 1977 redistribution, and the historic centres of Labor's country support-the cities of Bathurst and Lithgow-were removed from the traditional seat. Instead, Macquarie has become an electorate based on outer western Sydney. It covers the bulk of the cities of St Marys and Penrith, and the 20 towns and villages in the Blue Mountains. The electorate stretches across the Cumberland Plain. It takes in the Nepean River, the spectacular sandstone scenery of the Blue Mountains, down to the limestone formations of the Jenolan Caves. It is a district rich in history, from the early days of the settlement west, through the crossing in 1813 of the Blue Mountains. It was the path taken by the diggers to the Hill End gold rush. It was a district populated and settled by battlers, and it is still a district populated by battlers. </PARA>
<PARA> Macquarie is now one of Sydney's fastest growing areas. At the time of the election in October last year there were over 85,000 electors on the roll, making it the largest electorate in Australia. The recent growth has been a direct result of the rapidly rising prices of land and homes in Sydney. People have moved out to my part of the world to find places at a price that they can afford. This process, of course, will continue to accelerate with the movements in interest rates. It is an electorate of home buyers. According to the last census, over 75 per cent of homes in the district were owned or were being purchased. In this respect I must commend the activity of the New South Wales Government. Through the Land Commission of New South Wales and the Housing Commission of New South Wales, it has made available in this district accommodation within the reach of ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA> Macquarie is an electorate of young people. Again, in the latest census the electorate was ranked fifth in Australia on the percentage of pre-schoolers it contained. Almost one in eight of the total population then was under five years. All of these kids now are at school, placing enormous strains locally on the education system. I must say that in that time there has been precious little help from the Federal Government to the local education system. I recall hearing the Minister for Education (Mr Fife), who is at the table, refer late last year to the role of federal funding in education as topping up what the States had to offer. In fact, federal funds made available to New South Wales schools have declined by over 11 per cent in real terms since 1975. If a decline of over 11 per cent in real terms is defined by the Minister as 'topping up', I await with bated breath his definition of a funding cut. These children, the pre-schoolers who come after them and their brothers and sisters at the 14 local secondary schools, all deserve a better deal from this Government. There is also an urgent need for childcare facilities in the district I represent, especially in the new estates. Those further needs are not being met by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an urgent need for the level of support for all schools in the district to be raised, particularly in the newer areas. It is not that the schools are not doing their job. Last night I listened to the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) blame the education system for youth unemployment. I put it to the House that that is utter nonsense. If we compare the number of jobs available with the number of young people out of work, it is obvious that no education system on earth could create the jobs necessary to put the youth of Australia back to work. It is simply a fallacy to blame the education system for that situation. I have worked in schools for 15 years and I can say with complete confidence that kids today have a better education and schools are doing a better job than ever before. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members do not have to take my word for that. Objective evidence is published in the latest issue of the journal Education, which contains an article by Graham Little in which he examines the objective criteria in literacy and numeracy. That provides evidence that the products of our schools are better educated today than ever before. But schools are operating under enormous difficulties. The demands being placed on them are ever increasing and they can carry on only if they receive the increased assistance which they need so urgently from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> My district is also a popular area for retirement. It contains high concentrations of aged pensioners. It also has many single parent families and a great many of that endangered species under this Government, namely, invalid pensioners. They also are people who are not getting a fair deal from this Government. Their needs are not being met; consequently their living standards are declining. The services they are receiving from government departments are inadequate. As I have indicated, it is a district with problems which affect individual groups of people. I am not suggesting that the area is unique; it is experiencing difficulties common to growth areas relatively distant from our large cities. The district suffers because services are lagging behind population growth-the people come to the area and the necessary services come far too late. In the period 1972 to 1975 a great deal was done to provide those services. Prior to 1972 a great proportion of the district was not sewered. That was largely remedied in those years. Problems are being experienced with water supply at the moment and those problems are being remedied by the New South Wales Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Problems are being experienced in the field of transport. It might interest honourable members to know that many people-the vast majority of working people-in my electorate commute for up to two hours each way each day to and from the city. Again, I commend the New South Wales Government for the improvement it has made in commuter services in that district. It is also a district in which people rely a great deal on the family car. A family car is much more necessary for them than it is for city people. Because they are relatively distant from local services, the car must be used. These people in recent years have borne the brunt of this Government's petrol pricing policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Also it is a district which has an urgent need for better and cheaper communication facilities. I refer particularly to the local telephone service in the 047 telephone district. At present over 2,000 people are awaiting connection to the telephone service; people who have paid their money and made their applications perhaps six months ago or more and still are waiting for the service, with no clear indication of when they will get it. The people who are connected to the telephone service have an additional problem: They might have a telephone service but for a large part of the day the telephone performs a purely ornamental service. When they pick up the receiver it is most unlikely that they will get a dial tone and be able to ring anybody. This is as a result of country-type equipment-inappropriate and inadequate equipment-being provided to meet the needs of the district. It is obvious that if the district is to have the communication facilities it needs there is a need for a massive commitment of federal funds to provide equipment to get the job done. Also, clearly there is a need to lift staff ceilings in the Australian Telecommunications Commission to provide staff to do the job. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the people who are lucky enough to get a dial tone and dial a number are forced to pay through the nose for that kind of telephone service because, although districts such as Penrith are rightly considered to be part of the Sydney city area, for telephone charging purposes they are not so considered and the subscribers must pay trunk rates for telephone calls to Sydney. That has been a bone of contention with local councils, local organisations and local business for many years. I can assure the Government that the fight will go on until at last places such as Penrith and the Blue Mountains are given a fair go and are provided with local call access to Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also an area which frequently is prone to natural disaster. I am sure that honourable members would recall the disastrous bushfires which swept through the Blue Mountains in 1968 and 1977. It is certain that we will have those kinds of disasters in the future. It is equally certain that action on a national basis is needed to avert such disasters. When a fire occurs all the assistance in the world is available: The Army comes in and help is provided for the victims by way of accommodation and money. But clearly there is a need for preventative action before a disaster occurs. In that respect I commend the Government for taking the step of instituting, through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, experiments on the effectiveness of water bombing and the use of fire retarding chemicals. I am sure that will assist. It has come a little too late. The Federal Government could be doing other things to assist the volunteer bushfire brigade movement with vehicles and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a district which is experiencing a disastrous level of unemployment, especially among young people. At the three Commonwealth Employment Service offices which cover my electorate, the number of registered unemployed as at the end of 1980-these are the most recent figures I have-total some 7,500 people. Let us consider the ratio of applicants for jobs to vacancies in December, which was a relatively good month because the bulk of the school leavers had not yet been included in the figures. In Penrith 23 people were out of work for every job vacancy available. In Mount Druitt, which covers part of my electorate, again 23 people were out of work for every job vacancy available. </PARA>
<PARA> In Katoomba 53 people were out of work for every job vacancy available. For the 339 youngsters registered as unemployed in Katoomba, four job vacancies were available. I anticipate that the situation will peak in the January-February period this year, when we will see the figures mirroring the performance of last year. We will have applicant to vacancy ratios like the disastrous Mount Druitt ratios we had last year. In the early part of last year in Mount Druitt and St Marys for six job vacancies for young people, 2,773 youngsters were out of work. Those are the kinds of odds those young people are facing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that we count the social and economic costs of that situation because sooner or later society will pay the price. The correct responses are not to be found in punitive expeditions against the unemployed or by juggling the figures, this month preferring the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures or the Commonwealth Employment Service figures; nor are they to be found in talking about the number of people employed compared with the number unemployed. The solutions will not be found in appeals to incentive, initiative or motivation. Clearly, the solutions will be found only in providing jobs for those people who so desperately need them. That kind of realisation must begin with a basic change in the attitudes of the people in power in this country. When we consider those attitudes we can see how badly and desperately they need to be changed. I refer to a talk by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) to the National Young Liberals Convention in 1979. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> To make work and work generating initiative fashionable for them a real impact will have to be made on the cool young to whom dole-bludging is a bit of a joke rather than something to be overcome if humanly possible. </PARA>
<PARA>I also refer to a statement by another member of the conservative forces in this country expressing the point of view which all too often is expressed that work is available if only people look hard enough for it. The statement read:</PARA>
<PARA> For those who work hard there are rewards. Therefore, even though the unemployment market is at this moment difficult, I believe if you really want to find work and you are sincere about it you will. </PARA>
<PARA>The author of that statement was the Premier of Queensland-the recently elected and, I hope, soon to be redistributed, Premier of Queensland. He is something of an authority on finding jobs. He has the best job creation scheme in Australia. He is the man who obtained 41 per cent of the seats in the Queensland Parliament with just 27 per cent of the vote. I turn to the question of electoral reform, having just spoken of the vote in Queensland and the allocation of parliamentary seats. It is an area in which I have been interested for many years. My interest has been heightened by my representing more electors in this place than anybody else. It has been heightened by the Queensland situation in which one National Party vote is worth four Labor Party votes in another seat. It has been heightened by looking at the result of the October Federal election in New South Wales. The ALP gained 50.4 per cent of the two-party preferred vote. The Liberal and National Country parties gained 49.6 per cent of the two-party preferred vote. Yet those parties gained seven seats more than the Labor Party. With almost 1 per cent less of the vote they finished up with seven more seats. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, fundamental to any democratic system, if votes are to mean anything, is the principle of one vote, one value. We must enshrine that principle in our system. If votes are to have equal value, it must follow that they should have an equal chance of being counted and rendered formal. Therefore, there should be a draw for positions on ballot papers. Party affiliations should be shown on ballot papers. Party how-to-vote information should be displayed in polling booths and the optional preferential system should prevail. We should no longer put up with the situation in this country in which the exhaustive preferential system renders upwards of 10 per cent of votes informal. We should also guarantee equal access to information and allow parties a fair go in its distribution. This means that we should have public funding of political campaigns at a national level. The public funding of political parties is a fact of life in very many Western democracies such as West Germany, Sweden, Denmark and in Norway from 1920. It will soon be a fact in New South Wales and when that State adopts the practice I sincerely hope that the nation will follow. </PARA>
<PARA> Before concluding, I will pay tribute to two distinguished former members for Macquarie. The first is Anthony Sylvester Luchetti, or Tony to his friends. There are many of them in this place. He gave 24 years of distinguished service to the Parliament and the electorate. I fought with Tony in six campaigns, three as his campaign director and three in which he campaigned for me. I thank him for his friendship and support. I was very pleased that he and his wife, May, were able to come to Canberra for the opening of Parliament last year. The second former member for Macquarie of whom I speak was Joseph Benedict Chifley, a great and good Australian. There may be some argument about who was our greatest Prime Minister but there is no argument about who was our most loved. I can think of no better way of finishing my maiden speech in this House than by repeating some of the words that Ben used towards the end of his career. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I try to think of the Labour movement, not as putting an extra sixpence into somebody's pocket, or making somebody Prime Minister or Premier, but as a movement bringing something better to the people, better standards of living, greater happiness to the mass of the people. We have a great objective-the light on the hill-which we aim to reach by working for the betterment of mankind not only here but anywhere we may give a helping hand. If it were not for that the Labour movement would not be worth fighting for. If the movement can make someone more comfortable, give to some father or mother a greater feeling of security for their children, a feeling that if a depression comes there will be work . . . then the Labour movement will be completely justified. These things are really worth fighting for. </PARA>
<PARA>I am proud to be part of that fight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the speech that has just been made. I can well see a love-hate relationship growing up between me and my attitude towards what the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Free) has said. I disagree with much of what he said but I believe that he said it most impressively and sincerely. I make that comment without apology. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am pleased that you are presiding when I make my contribution. I believe that I will receive a degree of tolerance. We have just heard a reference to the great Ben Chifley. Another person who fits into that category was the giant towering figure of John McEwen. A statement he made has often been quoted. He said that he did not mind what was happening in the land provided that everything was right in the bush.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will devote the first part of my contribution today to what is happening and what may happen in the bush. After 15 years in the Parliament I have sought and groped for a definition of the bush. I think the best way of finding a definition is to consider, as an example, how quickly a person gets into the bush. At the moment something that is occupying the minds of all Australians is petrol prices. We are inclined to overlook the fact that we are probably still enjoying the lowest petrol prices in the Western world. I do not know what happens on the other side of the Iron Curtain and I have no particular desire to know. If a person drives out of the city of Brisbane-I use my own State as an example-he will not drive 100 kilometres before he has to pay 41 or 42 cents a litre for petrol. We are in the bush very promptly when we consider the effects of the disadvantages and penalties of existence. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred to petrol pricing but the results of the disadvantages flow very quickly to almost everything with which people in remote areas have to contend. Another example which we all come up against is the price of services, such as electricity which affects just about everything. The effects flow on from the prices of such commodities as fuel, building materials and so on. God must have had a worrying sense of humour when he planted his treasures, whether they be gold, silver, lead or zinc. He seemed to put them in very remote areas. With a pure and, I suppose, admirable sense of decentralisation, he decreed that his animals would best thrive in isolated and remote areas. He provided the basis for the establishment of the resources industries, the agricultural industries and the grazing industries in disadvantaged areas. Human beings have to live in those areas and produce. Because they do so two things happen. They will fill the treasury of this nation and they provide its basic wealth. But they do it under the most lamentable conditions, both physically and financially. What do we do about it? We make speeches year after year. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing that John McEwen said was: 'When you come down here you are going to find that most of the cases you put appear to fall on deaf ears'. I thought that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) spoke words of wisdom when he said today: 'You must keep trying'. I have been a Minister and have sat in the Cabinet room. We would like to provide everything that everyone asks for. Would it not be wonderful if one, or all, of the back benchers could have everything that he or they sought; what a wonderful world it would be. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I could have all of our problems in regard to road safety solved overnight. We would be delighted. But it just does not happen that way. As the honourable member for Franklin intimated, you have to get your teeth in like an old blue heeler and hang on. Those are my words, of course. I do not think that the honourable member would know very much about blue heelers. People think that we who live out in that part of the world are a lot of miserable clots; we are not. We live under very serious disadvantages. However, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has provided an opportunity to remedy that. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the proposed reassessment of concessional taxation zones. Those concessions are not of great significance these days. Incomes are so high that the particular concession one may get may be of little significance. As one who has spent a lifetime in these areas, as one who to the extent of his capacity tries to emphasise in Canberra the tremendous disadvantages suffered because of the penalties of distance, I am trying to get a message across to my people. I hope that it flows on. I am sure that every member, whatever his party, is trying to do the same. The opportunity to obtain new taxation zone allowances must be grasped. In any case, because of doubts as to constitutional validity, it is a dubious quantity these days. My message is: Do not concentrate so much on getting an increased advantage in a particular taxation zone. For heaven's sake, having squealed about it, having worried your member and yourselves until you are sick at heart, having sat and sympathised with yourselves for years, seize the opportunity to bring before the Treasurer, before the Government, before the Executive, before the men who sit around a table and make these decisions, the disadvantages that are already so obvious to people who live in remote areas. Prepare your case and present it forcibly and with cohesion. For God's sake forget your politics and put forward a case to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to get another message through to the Treasurer. I hope to do so personally as soon as possible. If this is to be a meaningful inquiry-and I have no doubt as to his intentions in that regard-designed to obtain evidence of the disadvantages suffered by people beyond metropolitan areas, hearings will have to be held in strategic centres of the north-west of Queensland and the north of South Australia, areas from which the wealth is flowing but people must live under tremendous penalties. I am putting in a plug for the areas with which I am most concerned and I do hope that the message gets across and that the inquiry will be a meaningful operation. </PARA>
<PARA> I made an attempt earlier today to bring into public focus what I regard as a terrible tragedy, one that I feel a little more intensely than most because my father was one of the 12 or 13 men who decided that they may be able to get a little old aeroplane and start an airline between Cloncurry and Longreach and Charleville. They got in an old buggy, or something of the sort, went down to Winton and started a company. I am absolutely confident that there is not one honourable member opposite who is not immensely proud of the way in which that small airline has since grown into the flag carrier of this nation. I have never been a union basher. I have been on the executive of three unions and have worked on the wharves. I hope that I can see both sides of the question fairly. But there is nothing to sustain an argument that would ground these aircraft and would prevent people who apparently want to go back to work from doing so. I cannot understand the attitude of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Over the years we have all had a great deal of respect for that organisation. What could activate an attitude which would bring an airline to a standstill, and as a result of which people who might be planning to come to this country would say: 'It is not much use making a booking there because you just do not know when that aircraft is going to travel. We may be grounded. God knows what may happen'. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, we are caught up in a wave of criticism that has swept across the world. We who have been overseas know that Australia has that unenviable reputation, one that represents an exaggeration. It could well operate to the serious disadvantage of the whole operation of Qantas Airways Ltd. There is talk now of ceasing operations altogether. That is a disgraceful situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have the advantage of living in a city which has a wonderful industrial climate. I refer to the city of Mount Isa, the biggest industrial city in Australia, with the exception perhaps of your own city of Newcastle, Mr Deputy Speaker. We have a group of unions which have set an excellent example of responsibility; I mean that. The same sort of atmosphere seems to prevail in Newcastle. Over the years, having been an active unionist myself, one learns to gauge the feelings of the great body of unionists. They do not want the Qantas disaster to continue. They could not possible do so. No decent, fair-minded Australian could want it to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a bipartisan matter which is of great concern to Australia, that of Australia's defence. Australia's ultimate capacity to deter a potential aggressor is dependent upon perceiving the development of a potential enemy's capability and intention to mount a direct attack and matching that capability within the period of warning with forces that would impose an unacceptable degree of risk on the enemy. I continue to have some reservations as to whether our present Defence Force can be expanded to the required size within the period of likely warning for several contingencies. Those doubts are based on a good deal of experience gained in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter to which I wish to draw attention today is the expansion capacity of our forces. It would seem that, despite the absence of a clearly definable threat, greater attention needs to be given to planning for a possible mobilisation. That is a real possibility, given the way the world is today. This requires an interdepartmental or national approach to determine the industrial and manpower support which would be available during a defence emergency. I always have the feeling that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) keeps a very close watch on this situation. I would feel that such a co-ordinating body would operate under his eye, but we would like to see that concept exposed a little more, to know a little more about it. It may be worth considering whether the wider aspects of our national defence should be co-ordinated by a separate national security division which would, of course, be under the Prime Minister's own jurisdiction and scrutiny. Military aspects and requirements on mobilisation could then be co-ordinated with the wide array of industrial and manpower resources which are encompassed by other Ministers' portfolios, but the enhancement of which is not normally reflected in the defence vote in peacetime. One just cannot see it. </PARA>
<PARA> A substantial ingredient of any expanded Defence Force is the current Army Reserve. The Government has announced its intention to expand the Army Reserve from 22,000 to 30,000 by 1 July 1981. It is gratifying to see how successful the campaign has been to date. I am delighted to indicate that the number has already reached 26,000 and that it appears that, despite gloomy predictions to the contrary, the target will be reached. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem that the Army Reserve needs to overcome its low retention rates as, in the past, 58 per cent of recruits have not served for more than two years. I hope that that is remedied. There have been signs of improvement in recent years but there is still a requirement for additional inducements for reservists to serve longer periods. Australia expects them to give up their leisure time in the national interest over a protracted period. Last September, the Government promised to make provision for adequate financial compensation for those reservists who are injured while on military duty. This is happening. It is important that the fine details of the new arrangements be announced as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish also to draw attention to the question of whether there is a need for legislation to enable the call-out of the Army Reserve in a situation short of a defence emergency. Not only would such legislation cater for the eventuality of a more rapid expansion of the Army beyond its present 32,500 regulars as a possible threat is gradually perceived, but from time to time it would enable deployment of Army reservists during civil emergencies such as natural disasters. I stress that any strengthening of the Army Reserve and enhancement of its role would obviate any need for national service. I support firmly the build-up of the Reserve even for this reason. Due to the exigencies of service life, it is essential for the retention and morale of servicemen and their wives that there be a continuing improvement in their housing situation. The willingness of service personnel and their families to endure harsh living conditions in time of war should not be taken advantage of in time of peace by denying them pay and conditions at least on a par with those of their peers in civilian life. I understand those difficulties. As Minister for the Army, I used to ask for so many million dollars, and hope I might get half of that, to provide more adequate housing for my troops. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to talk a little about the defence of northern Australia. There is little doubt that Australians living in the North feel, and are, more vulnerable than those living in the more populous south-eastern parts of Australia. This is accentuated because of inadequate communications in the North. Already these communications leave a lot to be desired, particularly during times of national disaster. These limited communication links with southern Australia give no cause for confidence in the event of a defence emergency. Improvements in communication facilities are in prospect for northern Australia. I know there is a lot happening but I emphasise the fact that these improvements are needed now and any action to expedite the plans of Telecom Australia for the region would be greatly appreciated by the people of the North. </PARA>
<PARA> The feeling of vulnerability in the north-west is not lessened by the fact that there is not even an Army Reserve unit in the vast region between Geraldton and Darwin. One way of providing a military presence in the Kimberley region would be to raise an Army Reserve sub-unit based on towns such as Broome, Derby and Kununurra. No doubt a similar pattern could be developed in the Pilbara. Supported by good regular Army cadre, including specialists, such Reserve units with local knowledge of the terrain could form the basis of a land surveillance force in north-western Australia. There has been considerable criticism of the current system of aerial surveillance by civil contractors in northern Australia because the contractors' flying pattern is far too predictable and is limited to conditions of good daylight visibility. The ability to respond to unauthorised landings in remote areas may be regarded as inadequate. Significant problems of co-ordination have also to be overcome in the absence of a single law enforcement agency operating under its own Act of Parliament. This has an inherent disability. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to comment on the construction of the Darwin-Alice Springs standard guage railway, and express the hope that we may also see at the planning stage in the not too distant future a Darwin-Mount Isa rail link. But I refer now to the Darwin-Alice Springs link. Such an enhancement of the national infrastructure, linking Darwin with the national rail system, undoubtedly will serve the defence interests of this nation. There is also a need to make greater use of the skills of the Aborigines for surveillance work and a need to give more opportunities to Aborigines to serve in the Army, including the Reserve, through the provision of appropriate pre-enlistment training. It is not good enough merely to say: 'If they meet our standards we will take them'. That means no Aborigines would ever serve. That is not the sort of attitude that would encourage these programs. Positive programs must be implemented to enable them to reach pre-enlistment standards. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that a committee of the Parliament takes a continuing interest in defence matters, and the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence through its Sub-committee on Defence Matters has an important role to play in this respect. It is my hope that the work of the sub-committee will promote a better informed, rational and bipartisan debate in this Parliament on defence matters. I speak today as an individual, not as the chairman of that sub-committee. The Sub-committee on Defence Matters plans to hear further evidence on a number of important issues during the life of this Parliament, and of course will then report to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In this, my first speech in the House, I have the dubious privilege of being the first person to represent the electorate of La Trobe with a seat on the opposition benches. My four predecessors-Lord Casey, Mr John Jess, Mr Tony Lamb and Mr Marshall Baillieu-were all members who sat on the government benches. I thank the people of La Trobe for their confidence in electing me as their member and assure them that being in opposition will make me even more diligent in pursuing their interests which, it is clear from the Governor-General's Speech, will not be served by the announced Government policies for the next three years. I will elaborate on that matter later in my speech. In the first speech in this House of my predecessor, Mr Baillieu, he referred to his member's gold medallion being presented to him by Mr Tony Lamb on loan from the Australian Labor Party. It is gratifying that the loan has now been repaid but I regret that it has been at great cost to the people of La Trobe who have suffered a drastic lowering in their standard of living over the past five years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will now describe some of the features of my electorate and point to the serious problems the people are facing. A large part of the electorate encompasses the Dandenong Ranges, which include the Ferntree Gully National Park and Sherbrooke Forest. They are areas of outstanding beauty and contain preserved fragments of the original forest which once covered the whole of the ranges. It is a place of splendid scenic landscapes and it includes many picnic spots and recreation reserves to which thousands of visitors, mainly from Melbourne but also from interstate and overseas, come each year. The people who live in the ranges are keen conservationists and strongly resent continuing attempts by land developers to encroach on the area by indiscriminate land subdivision. It is tragic that the aspirations of the Upper Yarra Valley and Dandenong Ranges Authority, which has been set up to conserve the environment and its natural resources, could be frustrated as a result of the unpreparedness of Federal and State governments to provide appropriate funding for conservation purposes. The population has grown rapidly in the past decade and now comprises some 125,000 people, 40 per cent of whom are of pre-school or school age. For most of these people Government policy over the past five years has been deficient, particularly in the areas of employment, health, education and housing. To make matters worse, these deficiencies have been accentuated by an acute lack of public transport facilities. Future Government policy, as outlined in the Governor-General's Speech, will do nothing to remedy these deficiencies. Indeed, the Speech is nothing more than a verbal facade designed to hide a lack of Government economic planning. It is the lack of such planning which is the predominant cause of the difficulties which the people of La Trobe face in their day to day living. </PARA>
<PARA> In August 1980, 4,175 people were registered as unemployed at the Boronia and Lilydale Commonwealth Employment Service offices, but there were only 126 job vacancies. The latest local unemployment figures are not available but, with the flood of school leavers on to the job market, unemployment has reached serious proportions, particularly for young people. By cynically manipulating the use of selective statistics, the Government attempts to delude the public into believing that job opportunities are growing. But what are the facts? The Government pays lip service to job creation but in the past seven years the number of jobs available in Australia has increased at approximately one-third the rate of increase of the recorded labour force. Six hundred thousand new jobs will have to be found over the next five years to prevent unemployment rising higher than the present unacceptable level. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget that a large part of the growth in available jobs, which the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) so proudly trumpeted during the October election, represents part time, unskilled teenage labour. There is little permanency or job satisfaction in such dead-end work. Manpower training programs, career counselling and an additional year at school may improve job skills for the young unemployed but they do not provide them with new, permanent full time jobs. The Government has set its sights on mineral development involving overseas investments of thousands of millions of dollars which it is claimed will produce new jobs. But, for example, capital invested in manufacturing industry would produce 25 times as many jobs as an equivalent investment in uranium mining. Let us also not forget the hidden cost to the community of uranium mining with its accompanying dangers of nuclear weapons proliferation and the ever expanding dumps of nuclear waste. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference was also made in the Governor-General's Speech to the encouragement of growth in the private sector, yet small business, which provides up to half Australia's jobs, is being hit by a shortage of available finance, high interest rates and inequitable taxation structures as a result of Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> After five years of continual and confusing changes to the health insurance system and the complete destruction of Medibank, health care is now in complete chaos. The cost of health insurance is too high for many low and middle income earners. In consequence, they are not taking out health insurance but are relying on keeping healthy and on using the public hospitals for treatment of unexpected illness. The health care of the nation should not be subjected to a Liberal philosophy which categorises illness as a personal responsibility and which encourages profit seeking at the expense of the sick. How else could one describe, for example, the growth of overseas multinational hospital corporations in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> Two public hospitals and one community health centre provide public health facilities for the people of La Trobe. The Maroondah Hospital and the Maroondah Social Health Centre, are both situated in Ringwood in the neighbouring electorate of Casey. Both institutions are suffering financial difficulties. The William Angliss Hospital is the only public hospital which is located in my electorate and it is undergoing a severe financial crisis which must result in a restriction of services. It is also an appalling fact that it will be at least two years before a casualty department will be available at the William Angliss Hospital. In consequence, major casualty patients, including many road accident victims, occuring in Knox and Sherbrooke have to face a long, 20 kilometre drive to either Box Hill or Dandenong hospitals before they can receive treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> With the last available statistics indicating a ratio of 2,239 people to every medical practitioner in the electoral sub-division of Knox, compared to 580 people to every medical practitioner in Melbourne and its inner suburbs, it is a disgrace that funds are not made available to support the community health centres in La Trobe. It is even more reprehensible that the Government, by cutting the funding for existing community health centres, is causing a severe restriction of their much needed services. The lack of health care in my electorate is a direct consequence of the emasculation by the Government of Medibank, the failure to provide funds for health development programs and a cutback in the provision of State government funds for public hospitals. The latest cutback involves the removal of vitamins, laxatives and pain relieving drugs from the free list for pensioners. This bureaucratic decision is causing great distress for elderly pensioners as they cannot afford to purchase the drugs and the recommended substitutes are inappropriate and inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> Education is another issue of great concern. Since 1976 the share of the gross national product devoted to education has been reduced from 9 per cent to 8 per cent. At the same time, funds have been disproportionately allocated to private schools at the expense of public schools. This disparity has been particularly evident in La Trobe where two-fifths of the population are of pre-school or school age and where funds for school building programs have been drastically curtailed. It is sometimes argued that the funding of education is primarily a State matter but for me that view represents an abrogation of Commonwealth responsibility. The plain fact is that the Government's new federalism policy, with its devolution of financial and political accountability to State and local governments, is a device to cut back funds for education, health and social welfare. In real terms the States have been starved of funds, none worse than the State of Victoria. The tax sharing arrangements are so inequitable that even the Liberal State Government has been forced to mount a campaign against the Federal Government with which it is normally in sympathy. The lack of funds for education is also causing confrontation between teachers and the State education authorities. The confrontation is being fuelled by the implementation by the Victorian Minister of Education of limited tenure employment and teacher-in-excess policies, which are being used as a means of pruning running costs. Such policies involve considerable personal hardship for teachers and result in a lack of teaching continuity for pupils. </PARA>
<PARA> Another serious problem is housing. Two-thirds of home occupiers in La Trobe are paying off housing loans and the ever increasing interest rates are making large holes in family budgets. Each one per cent rise in interest rates as a result of government policy can cost a home buyer an additional $5 a week. The typical home buyer is now paying $16 a week more in interest than one year ago. With the average cost of a house being around $43,000, it is generally only two income families which can now afford to buy their own home. The new Home Savings Grant Scheme introduced by the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) provides no help for those people already buying their homes. For home seekers, the required deposits remain unobtainably high and borrowing capacity is unrealistically low. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to comment on the severe lack of public transport in my electorate. We have a rail service which is inadequate for the regular train travellers. For the many people who live in locations which are isolated from the rail network, the bus services are infrequent, unreliable and badly co-ordinated. For young families, the aged, the handicapped and the unemployed, the lack of transport facilities causes depression and loneliness. Honourable members on this side of the House have drawn attention to the government cuts in State government grants for public transport. This apparent saving in costs is no real saving. A greater use of public transport would provide energy conservation and reduce traffic congestion, road accidents and pollution. What is even more important, an increase in funds for public transport facilities would improve the quality of life for many of the people.</PARA>
<PARA> I have dealt at length with the problems of my electorate because I believe it is important for Government members to appreciate how the policies of their Government have affected my constituents. It is equally important to bear in mind that my electorate is, in many respects, a microcosm of urban Australia and our problems are reflected in every metropolitan city in Australia. It has been a disastrous five years and government policy, so briefly sketched in the Governor-General's Speech, makes it clear that the position will become worse. The strategy of the Government is a continuation of the policies which have resulted in a transfer of resources from the public sector to the private sector. Put in another way, this means a redistribution of resources away from wages, salaries and government expenditure towards corporate profit. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing abstract, specialised or rarefied-to paraphrase an extract from the Governor-General's Speech-about what the Government has been doing in the name of the people. Real wages have been reduced by plateau and partial indexation. The social wage has been cut. The unemployment pool has been maintained and expanded to discipline the work force. The national income has been redistributed towards corporate profits. The Government's role in economic management has been reduced and last, but not least, so far as Victoria is concerned, there has been a forced decline in the domestic manufacturing and construction industries in favour of overseas owned, monopoly corporations. All of these actions have been made under the mantle of Liberal philosophy and they have resulted in a decline in the standard of living of the majority of Australians. It is hypocritical for the Government to express concern for people when policies are being followed which will cause a deterioration in the lives of those people. The Governor-General's Speech referred to the policy speech which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) delivered to the nation on 30 September of last year. That speech indicated a need for a broad-based and responsible program of national development and mentioned prospective investments of $29,000m. It is not difficult to envisage how this investment will take place because it is already pouring in from overseas. It will be neither broad-based nor responsible for it will be used predominantly to exploit our mineral resources. Such development will benefit Western Australia and Queensland, and to a lesser extent, New South Wales, but Victoria and Tasmania will be largely neglected. Nor is it the people of Australia who will gain the primary benefit from these developments, but overseas investors and mining entrepreneurs. Manufacturing industry will decline still further as cheap imports flood into the country in exchange for our mineral exports. Government planning and control could prevent the resultant dislocation of our economy but Liberal philosophy believes in the free flow of market forces, unhindered by government regulation. The Government's blind adherence to this doctrinaire obsession was indicated in the Governor-General's Speech when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> A sustained lift in exports and a higher level of capital inflow will increase Australia's capacity to import and to undergo the structural changes which will allow economic growth to build upon itself as resources move to areas of higher profitability. My Government will encourage this process . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Make no mistake about it. The process which will be encouraged is one which will involve the loss of employment for many thousands of workers, particularly in Victoria. Some honourable members on the Government benches appear to gain satisfaction from their description of Opposition members as socialists. Apparently they believe that this description is in some way derogatory. The democratic socialist tradition of the Australian Labor Party envisages a greater participation by Australians in making the policy decisions which shape their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> In his admirable speech the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous) indicated the framework of democratic socialism. However, since the views of ALP parliamentarians are often misrepresented I will emphasise some of the practical aspects. In practical terms it means the introduction of industrial democracy and an expansion of public enterprise. It involves a complete restructuring of our taxation system so that wealthy individuals and corporations contribute equitably to government revenue as opposed to the present blatant and unscrupulous use of tax avoidance schemes. Above all, it envisages a public planning framework within which development plans would be formulated, guided not by the vagaries of profit-seeking but by the community need of all Australians. To be part of such a tradition is in no way derogatory. It embraces policies which the Australian people will increasingly come to accept as a viable alternative to the conservative philosophy and policies of the present Government. I strongly urge honourable members to support the amendment moved to the Address-in-Reply by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent), an amendment which succinctly highlights the abysmal failures of government policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is both an honour and a pleasure to represent in this place the people of Chisholm, an area I know very well. I have worked and lived in that area virtually the whole of my life. The seat of Chisholm has had three representatives, Sir Wilfred Kent-Hughes, Tony Staley and myself. Sir Wilfred served the Chisholm area in the Victorian and Federal Parliaments for 43 years-22 years in the State Parliament and 21 years in the Federal Parliament. He was a Minister in both Parliaments. He was a veteran of two world wars, a Rhodes scholar, and an Olympic representative. He continued to serve the people of Chisholm until his death in 1970. He was then aged 75. His remarkable life is amply testified to in the many speeches made by honourable members of this House on the occasion of the motion of condolence, including speeches made by the present Speaker, the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) and the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tony Staley was in terms of parliamentary time a dramatic contrast to Sir Wilfred. He served in the House for 10 years and retired at the early age of 41. His career none the less was a distinguished one. Prior to his election he was a senior lecturer at Melbourne University. He was from 1968 to 1970 a member of the Victorian State Executive of the Liberal Party. He was elected to this Parliament in September 1970. From April 1973 to November 1975 he was Parliamentary Secretary and subsequently Parliamentary Assistant to the Leader of the Opposition. For nearly five of his 10 years in Parliament he was a Minister. He was first appointed Minister for the Capital Territory in February 1976, a portfolio he held until his appointment as Minister for Post and Telecommunications in December 1977. He held this portfolio until his retirement in October 1980. He was also for a time Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in the Arts. The various areas of the arts have always been of particular interest to Tony Staley. Honourable members may recall his liking for poetry. </PARA>
<PARA> Tony Staley worked hard at his job. In common with many honourable members he saw less of his family than he would have liked. Perhaps I should report to the House that he now presents a re- laxed advertisement of the benefits of early retirement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The electorate of Chisholm is an urban seat. It is part of the eastern Melbourne metropolitan area. It covers the city of Box Hill, and parts of the cities of Camberwell, Waverley and Nunawading. Some sections of the present electorate of Chisholm were in the past represented by Mr Speaker and the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Jarman). Chisholm is essentially a residential area. There are some limited areas of industry. In parts there has been flat, or home unit development. But the dominant feature of the electorate is that it is almost uniformly an area of houses, of family homes. Chisholm can quite accurately be described as a family residential area. In saying this I do not ignore, indeed I include, the significant numbers of people who are of or who are approaching pensionable age. They are, typically, people whose families have grown up but who continue to live in the family home. The interests and the concerns of the ordinary Australian family are very much those of the people of Chisholm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The welfare of the family is and must remain an important objective of this Government. It was good to see that in His Excellency's Speech this commitment was plainly stated. In the words of the Governor-General the Government: 'Will be looking at its policies with the objective of further enhancing the position of Australian families'. As the Governor-General said in his speech, this will strengthen the basic social fabric of this country. Families involve the concept of dependence. They require a long term commitment to persons. They provide stability and perform valuable functions in caring for children, the sick and the aged who otherwise would have to be looked after by the state. The family unit can carry out these roles best and at least cost. It is the most cost effective way of providing many social services. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government looks at the various ways in which it can assist Australian families I encourage it to look at the family allowance. The development of the present system of family allowances was an initiative of this Government and one of which it can be proud. The replacement of the previous system by the family allowance took place several years ago. Since that date the amount payable has not been altered. I accept that the necessity to control inflation and to limit expenditure has imposed restraints on this and other programs. But following upon the stated objective of enhancing the position of Australian families I hope that action can now be taken to increase the amount payable by way of family allowance. It is not just a question of allowing for inflation over the period since the amounts paid were last fixed. I believe that the Government should consciously and deliberately benefit those who have the responsibility of bringing up and supporting families. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is prepared to make the family allowance taxable, it will be able to provide for a substantial increase while at the same time containing the net cost of such a measure. When, as I hope, the question of an increase in the family allowance is being considered, I would ask that some thought be given to making a proportionately greater provision for the first child. At present the provision for the first child is $3.50 per week, for the second $5 per week, for the third $6 per week and so on. I would have thought that it is the experience of most parents that the first child involves the greatest cost. It is the child who occasions the setting up expenses; it is the child for whom there are no hand-me-downs. Perhaps more significantly, these days the arrival of the first child is the circumstance which causes the wife-the mother-to cease employment. It is a time when an income supplement can be of real use. A number of methods have been put forward as a means of assisting families, but it seems to me that the system of family allowances is of particular value because, being in the form of a direct payment, it is of greatest value to those who need it most. </PARA>
<PARA> The next topic I would like to turn to also bears upon the well-being of Australian families-that is, family law in Australia. The Commonwealth Family Law Act is in a sense misnamed. It should be called the 'some of the family law' Act. Many facets of family activity are not covered by the Act. I would like to bring out the kind of complications that exist as a result of the incomplete jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Constitution only gives to this Parliament power over 'marriages', 'divorce and matrimonial causes and, in relation thereto, parental rights and the custody and guardianship of infants'. Before the enactment of the 1959 Matrimonial Causes Act the Commonwealth had sought to exercise its powers in only very limited areas. By that Act the Commonwealth established a single divorce law for the whole of Australia and provided for the determination of custody, maintenance and property proceedings. However, if no divorce proceedings were on foot, these disputes, as with all other matters of family law, remained subject to the different laws of the various States. Under the 1959 Act no family court was set up and the Act was administered through the State courts. Although this Act was an improvement it was still limited in its application. Further, being administered through the different State courts, there were differences of approach and problems of enforcement. It was demonstrated to be inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA> When the 1975 Family Law Act was introduced it was hoped to bring within Commonwealth jurisdiction not only custody, property and maintenance disputes when ancillary to divorce proceedings but also all proceedings relating to custody access and maintenance of children of the marriage, maintenance of either party to a marriage, and property of the parties or either of them. Experience and the High Court have shown that this hope cannot yet be fulfilled. High Court rulings and subsequent amendments to the Act have imposed limitations on the operation of Commonwealth family law. This limited power has meant that disputes over property or over custody of children may have to be brought in some instances in a State court and in other instances in the Family Court. Worse, in some cases litigation may ensue in both jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA> I will show by example what this can mean. A dispute between a married or divorced couple over a child who is or was a member of the household but who is not the natural or adopted child of both parents-for example, a stepchild-is within the jurisdiction of the States. At the same time, that same husband and wife may well be in dispute over children who are their natural children. This dispute would have to be handled in the Family Court. This kind of example is not uncommon. With the increasing number of divorces there has also been an increasing number of second marriages. In consequence, there are more families consisting of both natural children of the parties and stepchildren. This situation can lead to real difficulties for the courts. The State and Federal courts can each be faced with the problem of dealing with some children of a household where they would prefer to treat them all as one family unit but they can deal only with those children before them. Again, where a third party-most often a grandparent or an aunt-makes a claim for custody of a child, a State court is the appropriate venue. With a greater number of marriages breaking down an increasing number of relatives are being asked to care for children and this promotes this very kind of litigation. However, if an order has previously been made for custody, guardianship or access in proceedings between the parents, proceedings between a third party and a parent may take place in the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, property disputes between a husband and a wife remain within the determination of State courts until divorce proceedings are instituted, which means 12 months after the parties have commenced to live apart. This can lead to various manoeuvres in the State court with one party trying to get the case on while the other stonewalls until the 12 months are up. Meantime, the Family Court may well be hesitant about making a final determination regarding the custody of children because it does not know what accommodation will be ultimately available for them. The end result of this fragmentation of jurisdiction is additional costs, inconvenience, delays and emotional trauma. The emotional content in this jurisdiction should not be overlooked. It is said that justice delayed is justice denied. That is true no doubt. In the context of family law, where feelings are often strained, justice delayed is bitterness exacerbated. The price paid for all this is not just a matter of human hurt; nor are the costs left just with the parties. The additional legal aid, the provision of social security payments and the employment of various kinds of social workers are a charge on the whole community. They are an inevitable consequence of the circumstances of family law in this country at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of solutions have been put forward to resolve this unhappy set of circumstances. The Federal Government can begin by ensuring that it uses its legislative powers to the fullest extent. There are two areas in particular where the extent of Commonwealth power is worth exploring. Firstly, we should re-enact the earlier definition of child of the marriage. It also included any child adopted by either party since the marriage, with the consent of the other party, and a child of either party if at the relevant time the child was ordinarily a member of the household of the marriage. The High Court has ruled that proceedings should be limited to children who are the natural or adopted children of parties to a marriage. However when this ruling was made, no reasons were given in support of such a limited definition. Further, a very similar definition had existed for a long time in the previous Matrimonial Causes Act without challenge. It is not possible to be sure that the broader definition will not again run into difficulties with the High Court, but because of the problems existing at the moment in custody matters I believe it ought to be tested. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area where legislation may be worth while is the area of matrimonial property. An examination of High Court judgments would suggest that the Commonwealth, relying on the marriage power, may be able to legislate in respect of property which has been acquired or is used in the business of the marriage. If this is so, at least these kinds of assets would not need to be tied to property proceedings ancillary to the divorce power. Neither of these solutions would completely solve the problem I have described. They would both have to tread the constitutional minefield. To achieve finally an end to the fragmentation of jurisdiction, one of four solutions will have to be accepted. The first is a reference by the States to the Commonwealth of the relevant power. The second is the establishment of a State family court system along the lines of that operating in Western Australia. The third is the issue of dual commissions to judges of the Family Court to permit them to exercise power under State law. The fourth solution is to amend the Constitution by referendum to give the Commonwealth power to deal with these matters. None of those four avenues of reform is without its problems. To be achieved they will, in each instance, have to be supported by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at what has occurred to date it is hard to be confident that co-operation will be forthcoming from all of the States. The reference of powers by the States to the Commonwealth clearly is the best of the four courses of action. In saying this, I acknowledge that the State Family Court in Western Australia has worked well but that approach has its problems. For example, appeals go to the State Supreme Court where the court has exercised State jurisdiction and to the Full Court of the Family Court where it has exercised Federal jurisdiction. A similar situation would arise if the solution of dual commissions were to be tried. I need hardly tell any honourable member in this place that referendums have a high failure rate especially when they are subject to opposition. This course should be viewed very much as a last resort. </PARA>
<PARA> There may be some argument about how best to resolve the problems that have risen as a result of the split jurisdiction but there surely can be no dispute as to the need to achieve a resolution. I hope that the State governments will have regard to the continuing cost, the inconvenience and the hurt suffered by their residents at present. I urge the Federal Government to press on and to use its legislative power to the fullest extent, while at the same time seeking an accommodation with the States to obtain a reference to the relevant powers. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, while listening the other day to the speeches on a motion of condolence, I was very much struck by the way in which all of the speakers in this place from whichever side referred to the fact that Eric Robinson was able to fight and fight hard but still retain their friendship. I expect that while we are here we will have many disagreements. It would be disappointing if we did not. I hope in the end that we will still retain regard for one another. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Chisholm (Mr Harris) on his maiden speech and on the points of substantial importance which he made. I wish him well in this Parliament while he represents his party and his electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the elections behind us, the start of a new parliament is a proper and necessary time to take stock, to offer observations and to make commitments for the conduct of the nation's affairs for the next three years. We, in the Australian Labor Party, strongly dispute the actions and policies of the Government coalition parties. We dispute vigorously what we see as their preference for sectional privilege. But we do not dispute the fact that the Australian people have made their choice and that they have given our political opponents opposite a mandate for the new term ahead. It will be our role in the next three years to assist, where possible, and to criticise when necessary. We will be neither obstructive nor compliant. It is the Government's role to govern within the terms of the people's mandate. It is our role to seek to ensure that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his colleagues do so as fairly, as justly, and as efficiently as possible for the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Within those parameters, the Government will receive our support, for whilst we all represent various diverse electorates throughout the country, and whilst we come to this Parliament representing different political parties, all honourable members on both sides of the House should first and foremost represent Australia. The people who sent us here expect fair and proper conduct, and fair and proper administration. They expect their national parliament to uphold the national interest and to carry out policy, in the day to day affairs of public life, that fairly looks after all sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> We discredit ourselves, and we damage our nation's potential if we allow this place, this Parliament and our conduct as parliamentarians to become remote from, or aloof to, the hopes, the needs, and the aspirations of the Australian people. I cannot stress too strongly that I refer to all Australians, wherever they live and whatever their social and economic circumstances. It is this theme that I want to develop more broadly today-the theme of the absolute need for national government to recognise at all times that it is elected to govern on behalf of the people; not institutions, narrow sectional interests, overseas mining companies, or privileged groups of great and powerful friends, but people and-I stress-all the people. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that the Governor-General's Speech refers to policies developed over the last five years. I quote from that Speech where it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> These policies are designed to work for the well-being of all Australians, to develop a society which maximises the reward of individual effort and initiative, and which also respects the rights of individuals to shape their own lives. </PARA>
<PARA>These are fine words and admirable sentiments. Unfortunately, they have no relevance at all for a very large section of the Australian community who so far, under this Government's policies, have reaped no rewards of any kind, nor been given any reasonable opportunity to shape their own lives. I talk, of course, about the 480,000 Australians who cannot find jobs. I talk of the two million Australians-I stress the figure of two million-who now live in poverty, a total which has doubled over the past five years. I talk of our black Australians, the most disadvantaged and neglected group of people in our society. I talk also of a great proportion of our new settler Australians. Lastly, I talk of the many pensioner Australians, our young Australians, and our sick and hospitalised Australians. The Fraser Government has failed all of these people in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> They have been the worst casualties of a rigid and unyielding approach to economic management which has done nothing for their wellbeing except to denigrate it and which has maximised only the distress and desperation in which most of them now live. By and large, most of them either do not have the dignity of a job, the comfort of a decent home, the security of enough money to pay essential bills, the opportunity of a reasonable education, or the right to be free of the fear of expensive illness. In many cases, these people have none of what should be the simple basics of life in such a wealthy country like ours, and their numbers are increasing. It is these people to whom Government has become little more than a symbol of worn-out and discredited slogans, slick and deceitful advertising, and of rank social injustice and economic unfairness. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister would do well to remember that the process of government does not begin and end with the fine words of his speechwriters. It is all very well to send 3,000 words of scripted prose to the Governor-General on what the Government would like the Australian people to believe is the tenet under which it will administer the nation's affairs for the next three years. It is quite another thing to make that script come alive, to give substance to the rhetoric, and credibility to the promises, particularly for those many Australian who have heard them all before and who still find that they make up the many hundreds of thousands of losers in our society. It is for these people, and the great majority of all Australian families who have seen their living standards go backwards over the last five years, that the Government must start living up to its word. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot expect people to respect their country's political institutions if they become convinced that those institutions have no real regard for their welfare and livelihood. We cannot gain their trust in politicians if those politicians continue to display an arrogant disregard of their campaign pledges, and a contemptuous indifference to their responsibilities to the community as a whole. Far too many promises to the people have been dishonored in the last five years-promises concerning the full range of unemployment, interest rates, inflation, the Medibank health insurance scheme, lower taxation, smaller government, Aboriginal welfare, community programs, wage indexation, education funding, housing, social welfare and ministerial appointments. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, at the start of a new parliamentary term, has a new opportunity to fulfill those pledges, and to reach towards the real potential of our country to the benefit of all Australians. It will have the fullest support of those on this side of the House if it honestly seeks to do so, if the Prime Minister will cease persistently attempting to divide the community, if he will accept his responsibilities to all sections of our society and if he will work for consensus rather than confrontation and the broad national interest instead of sectional privilege. I assure him it really is not all that difficult. It simply requires that the Government spend less time spoon-feeding the BHPs and the CRAs and the Ansett Airlines of this world, and give a great deal more attention to listening to, and acting upon, the basic needs of the Australian people. After all, big business in this country has had a pretty fair go from the Fraser Government since 1975. In the last five Budgets, tax concessions to the corporate sector, particularly the mining industry, have amounted to $3,000m in current terms. For a Prime Minister who is forever decrying the evils of big government and the imperative of small government supposedly to benefit ordinary people, the honourable member for Wannon seems not to have been embarrassed at such plundering of the public purse for the benefit of so small and privileged a section of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the increasingly high profits in recent years of so much of big business, and especially the mining companies, many Australians could be excused for asking why such large public funding might not have been diverted to areas more directly benefiting the community as a whole. The Government at last now has the opportunity to re-order its priorities. If it really intends, as it says, to support policies which are-I quote it again-'designed to work for the well-being of all Australians', it surely cannot continue to scale down government spending in areas directly affecting people and then use those funds to subsidise big business's profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> This broad and vital issue of exactly who the Government serves in this country will, for our part, be one of the dominant issues of political debate throughout the life of this new Parliament. We make no apology for our commitment to the necessity for government to reverse its withdrawal from a direct involvement in the funding of so many aspects of community life. The simple, unvarnished fact is that, for most Australians, there cannot be an adequate level of security, comfort or satisfaction in our society unless there is an adequate level of government involvement on their behalf. That means, among other things, a more effective and certainly a fairer redistribution of the great wealth generated in Australia, which is restricted to comparatively so few people. It also means not only the provision of material satisfaction, of physical and social security, but the provision of an adequate contribution in support of those aspects of community life which inspire creative endeavour and promote a strong and confident cultural identity and independence of expression. It means as well that we must adopt a longer-term perspective to economic and social planning to properly equip Australia and its people, not just for the 1980s and 1990s but into the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not the slightest indication in the Governor-General's speech of any such forward thinking, let alone planning. It would seem the future is being left to look after itself, while the Government concentrates on a perspective limited to the next six to 12 months. This cannot be justified in any terms, given the major resource development now getting under way in many parts of the country, which could seriously distort our economy for many years unless properly managed and regulated to ensure the widest benefit to the greatest number of Australians. Let me make it clear. We want and need mineral development at a pace that can be accomodated by our social and economic system. We want its benefits to be shared fairly by all Australians. We want more of the prosperity generated by this development to stay in Australia and to be used to revitalise our factories and our manufacturing industry, to provide jobs where they are needed most-in our great cities and provincial centres-and to strengthen our whole economy. We must have a resources tax that guarantees a fair profit return to mining companies but which does not allow excessive profits to be drawn off overseas. It is the only way to ensure adequate retention and fair redistribution of our vast mineral wealth. We want a confident foreign investment policy that maximises Australian ownership instead of selling out to foreign carpetbaggers and overseas board rooms. </PARA>
<PARA> I can find none of these matters dealt with in the Government's speech opening this first session of the thirty-second Parliament. Not a single line is given to explaining whether, or how, resource development is to be properly managed to maximise the benefits to the national economy. It seems a curious omission by a government which for so long has been insisting so stridently that resource development is the answer to all the economic problems it has not been able to solve in the last five years. We do not accept the Government's exaggerated claims and its failure to offer the Australian people any detailed knowledge of what government planning is going on. The failure only increases our scepticism of the forecast extent of this development. Yet the complex problems are considerable-problems involving the competition for investment capital; the impact of this competition on the general interest rate structure; its spin-off effect on manufacturing industry, small business and consumer credit; the claims to be made on public sector infrastructure capital for development related to the new mining projects; the effect in turn of those claims on the capital funds available to local government and public instrumentalities like Telecom Australia and public transportation authorities; the impact on the supply or money or large capital inflows from overseas and its likely effects on inflation; the influence of increased mineral export income on higher imports and the value of the dollar; and so on. None of these problems has been attended to. All of them are difficult and complex, but none of them is insurmountable. </PARA>
<PARA> Careful planning by concerned government will ensure that a regulated level of mineral development will not distort or damage our traditional economy, and that these problems I mentioned will not impede development. It is simply a matter of the Government getting itself into gear. Obviously this is not occurring, either because the Government does not comprehend exactly what is involved, or because it intends merely to ignore its responsibilities to the Australian people and allow development to proceed at whatever pace the mining companies like, irrespective of the consequences. Whatever the case, the Government's complacency is totally unjustified. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleagues and I consider that the issue of mineral development will be the great economic and political issue of the next 10 years. We do not see it as a matter simply to be rolled out for its 'gee-whiz' value at election time. It could be, and should be, an issue on which there is bipartisan agreement in this Parliament, just as there is already bipartisan agreement on the massive North West Shelf gas project. That is how importantly we view this matter. So far, however, we have heard nothing but rhetoric from the Government, and only in the context of the last two election campaigns. This seems to me to be selling Australia short on an issue of the most profound importance to the future of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the same sort of behaviour befuddles the continuing debate of so-called big government versus small government, a debate conducted in cliches for much of the past five years. Since 1975 there has been a good deal of posturing by honourable members opposite on behalf of small and efficient government, as they describe it. At the same time they have practised the deception of bigger government to serve the interests of the privileged. The present Government believes in redistribution as passionately as anyone on this side of the House, but it reverses the process-from the needy to the greedy. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Prime Minister and his colleagues are really opposed to is not big government, for government in Australia is now as big as it has ever been in peace time, but fair and efficient government that protects and services the interests of all Australians. Their argument in support of small government has been nothing more than a public rationalisation of their persistent scaling down of funds, right across the board, that go directly to community and welfare support to benefit the multitude of ordinary Australians who are the backbone of this great country. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been intended is an assault on the confidence of the Australian people in the capacity of government to serve community needs, and in the dedication and efficiency of the public work force. If this succeeds, it is then only a further short step to convincing people that they in fact are better off with more government neglect, fewer government services, and less government welfare. For example, government policies of strict staff ceilings and restricted finance for key areas of the public sector have struck Telecom with punishing effect. Telecom is now quite unable to meet growing demands for its services. The Government reacts by publicly questioning Telecom's ability to perform its designated function. </PARA>
<PARA> The scenario goes like this: Telecom is a big public instrumentality generating increased public dissatisfaction because it cannot now service public needs; therefore, such instrumentalities are inherently bad, their usefulness and cost effectiveness are matters of increasing doubt and they should be cut back. It is a discreditable tactic. Telecom's problems are the direct result of the Government's ideaological malice toward efficient state-run enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> To reinforce my point, I need only remind the House of the proposal continually raised within the Government to sell Trans-Australia Airlines. In Telecom's case, the Prime Minister now misuses the circumstances created by his Government's policies as a cudgel against it. In Perth, only a fortnight ago, he was suggesting publicly that profitable areas of Telecom's operations could well be opened up to private entrepreneurs. It sounded very much like the opening shots of a quite deliberate campaign to dismantle Telecom in the same way that Medibank was hacked to pieces over a period of two years. </PARA>
<PARA> The real political debate should not be about big government because government is as big as ever under the Fraser Government. The real political debate should be about good government. It should not be about what the Government describes so abusively as a parasitic Public Service, but about the privileged parasites who feed off the Government's handouts to its friends and supporters. Even an organisation such as the Murdoch empire believes big government can be good government when it is an active government operating on its behalf. With a stroke of the Government's compliant pen, the Murdoch group is about to have broadcasting and television legislation and the two-airline policy rewritten on the group's behalf. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly; one has only to recall the role of the Murdoch newspapers in the last three national election campaigns to understand that Mr Murdoch recognises good government-big or small-as government that can be controlled, government that pays up on its election IOUs and with a handsome dividend. Anyone who seriously doubts what I say need only wait for the revamped broadcasting and television legislation the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) will bring into this House this session. (Extension of time granted). We on this side of the House have little doubt that this new legislation will ensure that Mr Murdoch keeps the Melbourne television station which a public tribunal, in a public hearing, ordered last October he must sell in the public interest. The public interest will now be circumvented by Government fiat. Obviously this is what the Government means when it says that its policies are designed to-and again I quote-'maximise the reward of individual effort and initiative'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A similar set of double standards operates whenever we hear the Government attacking State enterprise and extolling the market force economy and free enterprise competition. Neither of these curious animals is anything more than a myth when applied to the monopolistic and cosseted atmosphere that cocoons much of industry in this country. The Fraser Government cannot possibly believe that commercial giants like BHP and CSR are the odd corner store writ larger. Certainly nobody else does. </PARA>
<PARA> If we really want to fill the corporate sector with fear and loathing we need only talk seriously about opening up the market place to some real free enterprise competition. The Ansett corporation, for instance, argues persistently in support of being allowed to compete against Qantas Airways Ltd on overseas air routes. The competition, says Ansett, would be good for Qantas as well as good for Australia. But Ansett is much less forthcoming about Qantas competing within Australia on the longer routes between capitals, because the competition would be unhealthy for Ansett, particularly for Ansett's profits-the principle being, of course, that competition is good when you can rig it to give you an edge over your opponent or an avenue to greater profits. Where it does not, where competition is commercially dangerous and one is big enough and influential enough to twist the Government's arm, one makes very sure that competition does not take place. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the real scandal of the two-airline agreement, an agreement which for many years was constructed to suit the best interests of a previous benefactor and handholder of a succession of Liberal-Country Party governments, and which is now being re-worded to suit his more ambitious successor. Once again, the public interest and the future of a viable state-run enterprise are of secondary importance to privileged sectional advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking beyond our shores, I agree with the Government's assessment that the next decade will be difficult and unstable. But we must be careful to avoid excessive gloom at the beginning of the 1980's simply to compensate for excessive optimism at the beginning of the 1970s. There is every justification for concern about the actions and intention of the Soviet Union, but not obsessive preoccupation. At the same time, we cannot be totally uncritical in our new relations with China. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not a great power on the world stage, but we can have a greater influence in our own region. We can help shape a sensible set of international attitudes that promote peace and greater international understanding. We can defend basic human rights and establish international respect for the consistency and fairness in which we promote our national interests as an independent state. </PARA>
<PARA> The strategic arms race is not an exclusive prerogative of the super-powers. The new doctrine of limited nuclear war has the gravest implications for Australia. United States of America installations in Australia fulfil all of the requirements for a first Soviet target in a limited exchange with the United States. The Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) casually announced last year that Australia was in fact a nuclear target. </PARA>
<PARA> In those sobering circumstances we should seek, with all of the diligence and persuasiveness we can muster, to be one of the key protagonists of detente. We should give balanced and fair opinions to our allies. We should not cringe before great and powerful friends. That means more forethought and, where appropriate, greater independence of our allies. Australia must work with its allies to achieve mutual aims. But we must not allow ourselves to be used for objectives we believe to be based on false interpretations of international events. We have to remember that alliance does not equal servitude. </PARA>
<PARA> A clear miscalculation would be for our closest ally, the United States, to embark on unwise policies that converted El Salvador into another Vietnam or an American Afghanistan. In the proper forums we should not hestitate to say no. We should urge on the new administration in Washington the futility of trying to store up aggressive right wing regimes, just as we persistently oppose oppressive left wing regimes. We must be steady supporters of human rights. It is not our right to tell other countries how to organise their societies. But we have the right to choose our friends and to demand the observance of international law concerning the oppression of political and civil liberties. </PARA>
<PARA> We often hear Government members attack repression in Vietnam, but we have heard almost nothing from them on human rights closer to home in the Philippines and Indonesia. Our servility towards Indonesia seems to know no bounds, despite that country's appalling record in Timor and the intimidation and political harrassment of those who fail to support President Suharto. We in the Labor Party do not subscribe to the belief that Indonesia is vitally important to Australia and we are of only marginal importance to it. We are neighbours, we have to live with each other, but we do not have to accept so meekly the contemptuous and offhand treatment now regularly handed out to us. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I congratulate the new members now serving in their first Parliament. I regret there are not more from the Australian Labor Party. A comparative handful of votes is all that now separates honourable members opposite from being returned to their rightful places on this side of the House. It will be our task over the life of this new Parliament to ensure they do not miss out at the next opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in congratulating those new members on both sides of the House who have joined the Parliament as a result of the election which was held in October last year. The Address-in-Reply debate provides to speakers on both sides of the House the traditional opportunity of reviewing any aspect of government policy or, indeed, any aspect of the policies of the alternative government of this country. Not unnaturally I will direct some of my remarks to the Australian economy. Again, I take this opportunity of observing what developments have occurred in the Australian economy since the Budget of August 1980 was brought down. I do so in the context, as I did yesterday, of reminding the House of some of the things that have been said by the Leader of the Opposition who has just concluded speaking and by other front bench spokesmen on behalf of the Opposition recenty and over the past few years about the economic policies of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been a fairly constant theme of speeches of the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) that the economic policies of this Government have failed, created conditions of recession, brought about stagnation, discouraged investment and consumer spending and created a sense of despondency, hesitancy and caution on the part of consumers in Australia. The truth, of course, is that virtually every day evidence is emerging of just how wrong those descriptions have been. Evidence is emerging of how correct the Government was in taking the decision it took in 1976 to put the first priority on reducing inflation and how wrong were the descriptions of the 1978, 1979 and 1980 Budgets by the Opposition and other supporters of the Opposition in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the policies of this Government are now bearing fruit. Not only have we attained a position in the world in respect of our rate of inflation that is the envy of most of the industrialised world, but also we are now starting to see, quite unambiguously and supported by statistics and economic indicators across a very broad front, the evidence of strong growth in the Australian economy. We are seeing it not only in the sector of the economy which has had most publicity in recent years, that is the mining sector, but also in the manufacturing sector, the sector that probably suffered more than any other industry sector in Australia when the high inflation of the early and middle 1970s came. It was also the sector which produced the largest number of people who became unemployed during those years. That sector has also experienced considerable growth, not only in domestic activity but also in export activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Who would have believed three or four years ago that 1979-80 would see a significant rise of about 30 per cent in the volume of manufactured exports from Australia? People may have believed that in respect of primary produce, or the mining industry, but they would have greeted such a claim regarding the manufacturing industry with very considerable scepticism. The better investment policies, the lower inflation policies, and the policies of making this country more competitive in the world economic environment, have provided a stimulus not only to the mining and rural industries but also, significantly, to the Australian manufacturing industry. We have seen markets open up for Australian manufacturers that would not have been thought possible only a few short years ago. So this growth is occurring across all sectors of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another development that has been particularly pleasing in recent months has been the strengthening in the employment situation. I do not pretend, nor does anyone on this side of the House, that the problem of unemployment is behind us. Clearly, it is not. We still have an unemployment level in this country which is far too high and on that there is common agreement in this Parliament. We may disagree as to how the problem should be tackled but at least there is common agreement that it still remains. Even on that front the growth in employment has been so strong in recent months that we have started to see a brightening picture of the unemployment level. For example, in the 1980 calendar year employment in Australia grew by about 2.7 per cent or 169,000 to 170,000 people. This employment growth, of course, is a direct result of the increased economic activity across the various sectors of Australian industry that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent months we have also seen for the first time very encouraging evidence of a sustained growth in the volume of retail sales. Only a few months ago I was told by people on the other side of the House: 'Well, you have got some capital investment and you may be doing a little better on the external account but the real Achilles' heel of the Government's policies is where it counts and that is the willingness of consumers to spend their dollars'. They pointed with satisfaction at fairly modest rises in the volume of consumer sales. They can no longer do that because there has been a strengthening in the volume of consumer sales which is further evidence of gathering economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Only 12 or 18 months ago the Opposition fairly regularly introduced matters of public importance into this House about the volume of overseas borrowings by the Australian Government. I can remember the honourable member for Gellibrand and the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), as a duo on this subject, fairly regularly arguing that it would be necessary, because of the economic policies of this Government, for us to go on borrowing very large amounts overseas to supplement our external account. What the Government did by way of an official borrowing program from 1977 onwards was a proper, legitimate and entirely justifiable instrument of policy by a government in a country that has always relied on significant inflows of capital to supplement a current account deficit. In no way could the activities which the Government undertook in a proper and orthodox manner during that period be criticised as being other than the correct and sensible economic action. It was done at a time when the Government believed that the fairly subdued volume of private capital inflow was of a temporary character. The Government said at the time that it believed that the right thing to do was to borrow large amounts on official account until more normal levels of private capital inflow were resumed. That prediction and that description have been proved correct. During the past 18 months there has been a major strengthening in the volume of private capital coming into this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that some members on the other side of the House think there is something wrong with capital coming into this country from overseas sources. They clearly do not want it and would be very happy if it did not come in at all. But the truth is that that money has come into this country because Australia is seen increasingly as an attractive place in which to invest. It is seen as a country that has stable economic conditions, good investment prospects, predictable and certain economic and other policies. Generally it is the sort of place in which people want to make long term and very large investments. We have seen in the last 18 months-it is a very instructive exercise to look at what has happened during that period despite the dire predictions of the Opposition about our external account-a major strengthening. We have been able to scale down quite dramatically the overseas borrowing program that was undertaken in 1977. That is yet a further piece of evidence of the strengthening which has occurred in Australia's international economic reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday I referred to some capital investment figures which give an idea of the confidence of private investors in the future of Australia. Capital investment, by any measure, is increasing very strongly. New fixed capital expenditure by private enterprise is expected to be 46 per cent higher in the half year to June than it was in the same period last year. If this expectation is realised it will represent a doubling of capital expenditure in the mining industry and a 70 per cent increase in the manufacturing industry. Against that sort of evidence, is it really credible to talk, as did the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) during the McPherson by-election, about a stagnating Australian economy and a failure of government economic policies? Is it any longer credible for members of the Opposition to speak in tones of gloom and despair? These are the figures of an economy which is beginning to reap the benefits of the restraints, the fighting of inflation, that this Government undertook to pursue when it came to office in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> One is reminded that when the Budgets of 1978 and 1979 were brought down, the Leader of the Opposition said that they would drive the Australian economy through the floor, that they would force us into a recession and would produce further stagnation, loss of activity and loss of production. The truth is that the reverse has occurred and is occurring across a very wide front. In my judgment, this is due primarily to the fact that over the last five years the Government has tackled the fundamental problems of the Australian economy. It has not pretended that there was a short cut to economic recovery. It has believed that ultimately economic recovery was possible if one provided for the private sector the environment and incentive, via lower inflation, to invest and therefore produce greater activity. That was the economic prescription that the Government proclaimed, and upon which it was elected, in 1975. We have kept faith with that prescription. We have not been seduced by the blandishments that we have received from the other side, and from elsewhere in the community, over the last four or five years, into believing that large amounts of government stimulus of the economy are needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps more than any other set of statistics, the evidence which is now accumulating about the volume of private sector capital investment demonstrates that if one persists long enough with the right economic policies, if one is prepared to have faith in the ability of the private sector to respond to conditions which stimulate activity investment, the reward will be there. I believe that the Australian economy is now on a stronger base than it has been on for many years. Our growth prospects among countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, according to that Organisation and not just the Commonwealth Government, are considerably greater than those of our principal trading partners. We are feeling less than are many other countries the effect of the temporary economic downturn in the United States. I do not pretend that all of that is due to the Government's economic policies. Some of it is due to the fortuitous destination of many of our exports. I acknowledge that. I say equally that government economic policies have had a great deal to do with the competitiveness of Australian exporters, have had a great deal to do with encouraging people to come to this country. Over the last five years the competitivenes of Australian industry has been significantly improved. That has played a major role in the improved export performance of so many sectors of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The last three months more than perhaps any time in the last five years have seen evidence of the success of the Government's economic policies. In saying that, I do not in any way regard the job as having been nearly finished. There is still a considerable distance to go in achieving the economic goals of the Government. Unemployment remains too high. Until there is in the community a broader recognition that the cost of labour plays a far greater role in the level of unemployment than the arbitral authorities of this country have been prepared to recognise to date, unemployment will continue to persist as a significant problem. There still remains a significant challenge to this Government and, indeed, to the entire community to find rational solutions to the present unsatisfactory levels of unemployment. We have to recognise that at a time of increased economic activity, particularly in sectors of the economy which will place strains and demands upon fairly scarce resources, it will be necessary to continue to give the very highest priority to our fight against inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as we go through the 1980s and the economic development and growth of this country proceed, increased demands will be placed upon our resources, not the least of which will be the financial resources available to support the activities of both the public and private sectors of the Australian economy. Even many members of the Opposition are prepared to concede that great private sector investment is not only occurring but also in prospect for the remainder of the 1980s. That makes it all the more imperative that we contain the public sector demand for funds. There is a limit to the funds available for investment. If honourable members believe, as we on this side of the House certainly do, that it is the role of government to encourage activity by the private sector, it is absolutely essential that we so tailor the demands of the public sector that there will be available sufficient financial resources for the private sector to take up. If we really believe in giving priority to the private sector, we must be prepared at all levels-not just at the Federal level but at the State level also-to contain the size both of Budget spending and of the demands we make by way of borrowings on the capital markets of this country. We must be prepared to contain the demands of the public sector as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> When I refer to the public sector and speak about achieving a proper balance between that sector and the private sector in the Australian economy I do not speak just about the size of the Commonwealth Budget deficit. That represents only a portion of the overall public sector borrowing requirement of governments in Australia. It is imperative that we contain, and where possible reduce, the size of the entire public sector borrowing requirement in Australia. That will become a more and more important and urgent responsibility of governments as we go through the 1980s, because the demand for financial resources from the private sector will not diminish but will rather increase. I have pleasure again in complimenting and congratulating those members on both sides of the House who have joined this Parliament and in supporting the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was no coincidence that on 18 October 1980 the electors of the seat of Canberra, whom I now have the honour to represent in this Parliament, recorded one of the largest swings against the present Government recorded anywhere in Australia. The outstanding political and economic fact in the Australian Capital Territory is that it reflects more directly, immediately and completely the effects of national government policies than does any other region in Australia. Here the Federal Government alone bears full and undivided responsibility. Here there is no responsibility to share with State governments or local government. Here the consequences of the Government's policy of the past five years have shown up sharpest and worst.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of those policies, the Australian Capital Territory has had, for most of that five year period, the highest unemployment, the highest cost of living, the lowest level of housing and construction activity and the lowest level of business activity in Australia. The youth unemployment situation, in particular, remains appalling. The Bureau of Statistics figures for the last quarter put the unemployment rate for young people aged 15 years to 19 years at 20.8 per cent for the whole of Australia, but 28.9 per cent for the Australian Capital Territory. The figures themselves tell only part of the story of the ravages inflicted on this great Australian community, in terms of its confidence and cohesion, in the past five years. This community has borne not only the heaviest burdens of Government economic policy; it has been the main target and chief victim of a sustained ideological campaign by members of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I am the third person to represent the seat of Canberra, created in this Parliament in only 1974. Before the 1974 splitting of the Australian Capital Territory into two seats, the Territory comprised one seat, created in 1949 and represented during 19 of its first 21 years by Jim Fraser, one of the most effective and most dedicated local politicians to sit in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I wish to put before honourable members three propositions: Firstly, that the unusual system of government administration in the Australian Capital Territory places special responsibility on all members of this Parliament; secondly, that the political myths about this city should be dispelled and members should realise that its inhabitants merely demand fair and equal treatment with other Australians; and, thirdly, that there is a need for this Government to rethink the basis of its policies towards the Public Service before one of the most significant institutions in this country is very severely damaged. On the first point, I stress that while all honourable members have a role in passing Federal laws, when it comes to the Territory they are also fulfilling the role of state and local government. Under Section 122 of the Constitution, the Parliament may make laws for the government of any Territory. This means that all members of the Parliament are responsible for Government of the Australian Capital Territory. I wonder how many honourable members have thought of themselves as the city councillors for Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Parliament can make laws for its territories on all matters including labour relations, health, education, local government, prices, rents, wills, property, land use and so on. Consider the Minister for the Capital Territory. He has an all-encompassing responsibility for this Territory. There is no other Federal portfolio which so comprehensively affects the lives of so many people. The Minister makes decisions about traffic control, travel for handicapped people, business regulations, the municipal budget which determines the rates people pay and services they get, social and moral issues such as whether we have nude bathing, poker machines or a casino, and other questions such as abortion law. Of course, many of these decisions do not rest just with the Minister, but go to Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a fully elected 18 strong House of Assembly, now seven years and two elections old, which sits part-time. Its members serve on boards and authorities running the Territory and, despite their total absence of any law-making power, they are dedicated and hard working and make a significant contribution in communicating between rulers and ruled. I know this from my own experience, having been an Assembly member for five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the House of Assembly is elected by the people of the Australian Capital Territory, it is only an advisory body. The members of this Parliament have more real power and responsibility for Australian Capital Territory legislation. There has been much criticism of the Assembly's so-called failure to live with the Government of the day, but this is a two-way process. I have seen Liberal members of the Assembly walk out on Liberal Ministers for the Australian Capital Territory. Before that I saw Labor members citicise Labor Ministers. Sooner or later this Parliament and the parties in it will need to face up to the political realities that the wishes of the Territory cannot be blatantly ignored and that despite some faults, by and large the Assembly respresentatives reflect those wishes. The failure of Federal governments to appreciate this point has cost them credibility and ultimately votes in this city in the past, and it will most assuredly do so in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give you examples of how the respective Ministers for the Capital Territory have ignored the wishes of the elected representatives of the citizens of Canberra: The overruling by the Minister of the unanimously endorsed ordinance by the Assembly to protect small business people from exhorbitant rent payments, an ordinance passed by the Assembly in 1975, 1976 and 1979, and still not gazetted; the overruling by the Minister time and time again of Assembly proposals for business incentives comparable with those given in the States, an essential condition for a diversified employment base in this Territory; moves by the Minister as late as last week to reject serious efforts to inquire into the disadvantages of this city and provide adequate welfare funding; and the overruling by the Minister of Assembly advice to establish a casino to help the economy, provide revenue and promote tourism and of course the overruling by the Minister of the termination of pregnancy ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> This list could be turned into a litany. There is no individual and no group in this city who has not suffered by ministerial fiat overruling the opinion of elected represenatives. At this point, despite the most recent disagreements with the House of Assembly on welfare, I must welcome the enthusiasn displayed and the communication with local politicians demonstrated by the new Minister for the Australian Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman). I congratulate him on his appointment, wish him well in his portfolio, assure him of my assistance and guarantee him my political surveillance. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my regrets is that most federal politicians who spend so much of their lives in Canberra travel like ships in the night, arriving at port but never disembarking to discover the town. They come so frequently yet see so little. One understands why. It is because of the pressures of political life. Yet, it is about time we put away the myths surrounding Canberra-that it is sterile and dead, elitist and spoilt. There are some distinctive features of the Territory which a proper analysis reveals. Yet the simple truth is that Canberra is populated by ordinary Australians who have the same aspirations as their counterparts in the states, who are concerned about their future and that of their country, who are worried about inflation and unemployment and want merely a 'fair go'-no more, no less-and who are angry when they find that they are being made ideological scapegoats. They live in a new city which has all the advantages of modernity and a host of the social disadvantages including family separation and physical isolation. We should not forget the dual nature of this city. It is both a place to live and a national capital. Too often politicians forget the former and resent the latter. If people in this city find that their city council and Federal government, both located in this Parliament, are treating them like statistics or a variation of Milton Friedman's economic model; they will react strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a city of people and those people have shaped its identity. It has a strong and vigorous ethnic community, a youthful population which places stress on outdoor activity, a cosmopolitan approach to sport, particularly football, a school system quite different and more progressive than any in Australia, a high proportion of women in the work force a growing sense of community participation and involvement in running the Territory, and a high proportion of employees in the public sector. That means that in this Territory, the strength and viability of the private sector is more dependent on the public sector and government decisions than most other cities in the nation. This means the interdependence of the public and private sectors in this city is extra- ordinarily high. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the second role of Canberra, as a national capital, despite the criticism of Canberra and the public sector which this Government has fostered it is my firm belief that this city will be recognised as one of the nation's great achievements. It is our national capital, a forum in which we strive for excellence because others will judge our history and identity by what we do here. For this reason the Federal government of the day must continue the collective momentum of its predecessors. I note that after some fits and starts that is the course adopted by this Government and I trust it will continue. Yet, few regions have been so adversely affected by Fraser Government policies than this city. Unemployment is a striking example of this-it is currently 6,300 or 5.7 per cent of the labour force. Family living standards have plummeted. Social and family consequences of this are huge. Much of Canberra's population is based on the movement of young people to this city in the 1960's and 1970's. This generation came, leaving its families behind in capital cities and the countryside, and settled here. Now it finds that there are no jobs and no future for its own children, the next generation in this city. We face the spectre of having the children of the people who expanded this capital now being forced to leave their families in an ironical reverse process. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another critical aspect of Government economic policy in relation to Canberra. It is simply not good enough to say that, after we squeeze the public sector which is the life blood of this city, the private sector will automatically expand. This has not happened and it will not happen. There is no development strategy for this city held by this Government. The fact remains that some of the signs of renewed growth apparent in recent months stem not from the private sector but from government spending decisions, particularly in the construction of the new parliament house. There are a number of steps which need to be taken and, as I have explained, they can be taken only by the Federal Government if a proper program for economic development and, hence, social cohesion is to be framed for this Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me explain the essence of such a program and what it should include. A long term plan for Canberra based on steady growth and co-operation between the public and private sectors is essential. This plan should include at least a 10-year construction program aimed at avoiding the stop-start-go effects of recent years. Unless there is such a plan, once the new parliament house is completed, Canberra will see an even greater depression than the one it has been through in the past five years. Tourism, which is now Canberra's second biggest industry after the Public Service, should be promoted. Stress should be placed on the attractions of the natural environment of the Australian Capital Territory and emphasis given to attracting tourists to lengthen their stay. Efficient and cheap transport is essential for the development of an inland city like Canberra. With the escalating cost of petrol there must be an upgrading of the rail services linking Canberra with Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve a more diversified employment base for Canberra, the Federal Government must provide incentives to business to establish here. At present, most State governments offer such incentives and unless the Australian Capital Territory can provide assistance to private sector establishments, we will remain a Public Service town. These incentives may have to be provided for only a short period-say, 10 years-but they are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me talk specifically about the Public Service. During the past five years the Public Service has been used by the Fraser Government to score cheap political points. This Government is of the view that Public Service bashing is electorally advantageous, and its rhetoric has grown more shrill every year. The Liberal Party campaign notes for the last election, for example, suggested that there was political capital to be made in aligning the Public Service with the Australian Labor Party and denigrating both. The disparaging remarks of the honourable member for Flinders-The Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch)-that since 1975 there were 11,000 fewer bureaucrats with their snouts in the taxation trough is well known. It has been easy to launch the unnecessary attack and this has worked to the detriment of the Public Service and ultimately, the Government. This contrasts with the tone of the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his 1977 Garran oration when he said about the Public Service:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in general there will be stability in the service. There will, of course, continue to be change and progress to meet the changing needs of modern government. It is important, however, that changes to the existing framework should only be brought about for good reason. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet I would argue that a study of this Government's approach to the Public Service reveals that it is a rhetorical stand only and that it has no concerted policy-contrary to the words of the Garran oration. If this Government took its own words seriously, it should have had a truly reformist attitude towards the Public Service. This has not happened. There has been no genuine concern with reform. The whole motivation of the Government has been to cut numbers to reduce costs. The Government's attitude towards the Public Service has contributed to declining morale. Many officials feel their professionalism is not recognised by the Government. I would simply point out that while political theory suggests that governments demand and expect loyalty from their servants, human practicalities suggest that such loyalty must be based on reciprocity. </PARA>
<PARA> So what is the Government's record? In June 1976 there were 160,298 public servants under the Public Service Act. Today there are 153,429, a reduction of 6,869 and at what cost? The cost was increased workloads, excessive demands on individuals and reduction of community services. The departments that have suffered the reduction are the service departments-like the Department of Health-not departments such as the Prime Minister's, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Reductions have been most significant in the Fourth Division, often resulting in inefficiencies. More highly paid senior public servants are seen doing the filing and photocopying, while Canberra retains 5.7 per cent unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has now at last realised that Public Service functions must be reduced if an effective reduction in Public Service numbers is to be attained. Only now, after five years, is it moving ahead with the desirable reform of voluntary early Public Service retirement. I fully support this move as do most public servants. But instead of being used to revitalise the Public Service and increase mobility within the Service and between the public and private sectors, early retirement is merely seen as a numbers saving device. This is a tragedy because it has the potential to transform morale and conditions inside the bureacracy. Unfortunately, it has been coupled with redeployment and retrenchment provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has shown a punitive, short-sighted attitude towards the Public Service time and time again. The Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act makes it possible for the Government to stand down, suspend or even dismiss-without notice, without time limit, without appeal and without any recourse to independent arbitration-any Commonwealth employee engaged in industrial action. The Public Service and Statutory Authorities Amendment Bill 1980 has further embittered the Government versus Public Service conflict as has the Prime Minister's politicisation of the Public Service Board. The worst aspect of these developments is the long term damaging and destructive effects on good government in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another myth which needs to be exposed is the widespread belief that genuine savings in Government spending can be brought about through squeezing Public Service numbers. The facts speak for themselves. The Public Service wage bill last financial year was $2,996m, compared to total public sector outlays of $31,694m. So the cost of public servants themselves is merely 9.4 per cent of total spending. Even if in one year public service numbers were cut by 2 per cent or 3 per cent-a huge task-it would reduce total spending by only 0.2 per cent or 0.3 per cent which is infinitesimal. It may be politically popular to talk about cutting back government spending through reducing the number of public servants. The facts show that this is merely nibbling the edges of the problem as a substitute for cutting into the real funding cake. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings us to the Lynch razor gang. It was set up to review Federal Government functions and to decide what Federal Government functions could be abolished. This is the way the Government sees that it can reduce its size and its spending. Maybe one of the greatest savings in Public Service spending will be brought about if the razor gang cut its own throat, as I would hate to attempt to assess the amount of time spent by public servants in replying to their Minister's call to defend their own territory and in other Minister's calls to wipe it out. The Government has applied a numbers and finance squeeze on the Public Service while asking the Public Service to do more and not less. It has not streamlined, it has squeezed the Public Service. No Prime Minister in the history of this country has been so demanding of Public Service time, advice and dedication as this one. Yet no Prime Minister and no government has been so ruthless in applying legislative sanctions and threats. There is obviously room for more efficiency and more economy; everyone admits that. But the candle is being burnt at both ends. This does not mean that reform is not necessary in the Public Service. There is room for great reform and we might start with the 190 or more recommendations of the Coombs report. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doctrine more damaging and divisive, than that which asserts that the public sector is unproductive and that public servants are parasites on the public purse. The truth is, of course, that the public sector has a vital, productive and constructive role to play, just as the private sector has. There is no economy and no society in which this has more truth than that of Australia. They are interdependent, and I shall maintain and seek to advance that truth as long as I am privileged to represent this great Australian electorate, not only because I am the member for Canberra, but because I believe it to be a cause and truth at the very heart of the best interests of the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I said 'honourable gentleman' I take it back. I will have to start again. I must compliment the honourable member from Canberra (Mrs Kelly) for the very delightful way she has presented her case and for the very persuasive arguments she has put to us in the House today. But I must also make one complaint and that is that I believe she did not effectively recognise the fact that the Government has performed near miracles so far as unemployment is concerned. The number now employed is unexpectedly much greater than was envisaged six months ago. In the three months to November 1980 employment improved by 175,000 which was 2.9 per cent higher than the improvement for the corresponding period a year earlier. We have to look in particular at the question of youth employment to which the honourable member for Canberra referred. Some progress has been made in this area. We hope that as a result of what has been done now youth unemployment will improve substantially during the months to come. I should mention that the Government is providing opportunities for specialist training in order to permit young people to get jobs in the new energy society. This year 75,000 people will be assisted under the Special Youth Employment Training Program; 13,000 young people will be assisted through transition courses; 80,000 apprentices will be trained under the rebate scheme for apprentices; and an additional 50,000 will be helped through the Community Youth Support Scheme. I also point out that in a recent analysis by Dr Gregory and Mr Stricker some of the difficulties associated with finding jobs for young people were brought out. They pointed out that a typical three-month period in 1978, about 262,000 jobs became available for teenagers. I stress the word 'became'. It was found that teenagers changed their jobs so frequently that different methods of assistance had to be found. This is one of the main reasons that the real rate of teenage employment is so high.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I wish to point out that I believe the Government is doing much to improve youth employment in other sections as well. I want to concentrate on two aspects of the Governor-General's Speech of 2 November 1980. Firstly, it is emphasised that the basic thrust of the Government's fundamental economic policies will be maintained. They are designed to benefit all Australians and to develop an economy which maximises the rewards for individual effort and initiative and the right of individuals to determine their own lifestyles. I emphasise that to achieve these objectives, government policies must continue to restrain public expenditure so as to provide the funds for reducing the burden of taxation. Second in importance, is that we should ensure that the Government does all it can to contain wage increases in the short term in order to expand aggregate employment and income over the medium term. The Government is trying to do this within the constitutional powers it possesses. These objectives and policies must be considered against the background that when the Fraser Government assumed office late in 1975 the economy was in a frightening mess. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1974-75 inflation was running at the rate of 16.7 per cent. It is now 9.3 per cent. In the first half of the 1975 fiscal year it was 15.1 per cent. Gross domestic product was falling. In 1975 as a whole domestic product increased by only 0.5 per cent and non-farm product declined by 0.8 per cent. In December 1972 136,000 people were unemployed. At the end of December 1975 after the Labor Government had been removed from office 328,705 people were unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The details of the picture I want to paint must be seen and understood with these facts in mind. The international economic environment as a whole is unfavourable. In European countries and in the United States gross domestic product is falling dramatically and on average it is now one per cent. As well, Australia has gone through a three-year drought. The weekly wage rises for adult males are about 11 per cent and for females about 12.5 per cent. Technical experts expected this to have a significant effect on Australia. It has not done so. There is also an inbuilt inflationary cost pressure because of the rises in male and female wages and the very small increases in productivity. Male wages are rising at well over 10 per cent for the relevant part of the year and female wages are rising by 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the fundamental indicators of changes of economic policy and the progress that is ensured to a large extent as a result of those changes. Final demand-that is consumer demand-and particularly consumption expenditure at current prices has risen from $16,000m in June 1979 to $18,700m in September 1980. Household disposable income, which is very important, has risen from $19,300m in September 1979 to $22,000m in September 1980. An illustration of this is the increase in production. When looking at the December production figures issued by the Bureau of Statistics Digest; one must at least be satisfied with what has been achieved. Yesterday we heard a report from the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd that the steelwork's normal production levels had increased. Output from Port Kembla rose from 450,000 tonnes in June to 462,000 tonnes-4,000 tonnes above the previous record set in 1976. Bass Stait production was restored to the normal level of 6.7 million barrels a day. These are all remarkable performances and they illustrate in very clear and precise terms the extent to which government policies are being achieved. It puts to shame the guesses made by leaders of the Labor Party, including the shadow Treasurer when speaking in the Budget debate last year. I make no comment on that because I hope that one of my colleagues will refer to the matter. I feel I should concentrate on other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The economy and, with it the prospects of the people, will inevitably improve unless trade unionists, led by economic illiterates and the radical trade union leaders, continue their destructive practices. These men are prepared to sacrifice the interests of their members in an attempt to achieve their delusions of grandeur and trade union muscle. They want to force employers and the Government to agree to union control over management and corporate industrial practice. Let us examine the dynamics of the developments that are now proceeding in Australia. Since 1977-78, and under the compulsion of facts, we have found for the third time that Australia is as well endowed as it has ever been. In fact, it is a leader in the world, particularly when taking into account the population of Australia. I refer to three great dynamic periods in Australia. Firstly, we had the dynamic period of wool production. Then we had the discovery of iron ore. Now we have energy resources and essential supplements available which will ensure big and permanent rises in production and exports. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been pointed out today due to devaluation and the cost advantage that we have derived internationally our manufacturing industries are heavily engaged in exports as well. Equally important is the fact that since 1973 when the Arabs and other petroleum producers decided to push up the price of crude oil, the importing countries had to absorb the inflationary impact of crude oil price roses and had to try to offset the associated balance of payments difficulties. Alternative sources had to be found. Australia had them. The demand for energy resources and the quick response of Australian industry created the foundation on which our current and growing prosperity is based. To prepare the way for further growth in these high productivity industries it is essential, in the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), that it will be an important policy objective to continue to restrain public expenditure so as to provide scope for personal tax reductions by reducing the burden of taxation. In 1981 we must reduce or eliminate government expenditure in those areas which belong to another age and concentrate efforts on industrial and mining areas which have the greatest productivity potential. As well, we need a sensible tariff policy. We also have to avoid duplication between Commonwealth and State authorities and to abolish those quasi-autonomous national government organisations which are no longer necessary, such as the Prices Justification Tribunal and the Industrial Relations Bureau. Government interference and attempts to restrain market factors must also be eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA> I have long favoured giving equal priority to inflation, national economic growth, employment and the reduction of personal income tax, including the substitution of increases in the wholesale tax and a service tax for personal tax reductions. I think we will better achieve the results we want to achieve by 'supply side' economics rather than by sticking with Keynesianism. These are the methods adopted by President Reagan in the United States of America. We have a good model. President Reagan is stimulating production, not demand, and reducing business and personal tax whilst relying on Budget cuts and tight money policy to rein in inflation. He has called for tax cuts totalling $A47 billion in 1982 and for a reduction in government expenditure of $A49 billion in that year. Keynesian doctrine which is based on generating demand by cutting taxes and raising public expenditure has been abandoned. As well, there has been a bonanza growth in tax revenue. According to the Australian Statistician's financial statement for the seven months of 1980-81, overall taxation will be up by 14.8 per cent on last year and net pay-as-you-earn tax receipts will be one per cent above the full year estimate of 13.8 per cent. Then, of course, there are increases in sales tax, company tax and excise duty. The crude oil levy will be $42m higher than it was estimated. I believe that it would be much higher but for strikes which cost about $300m. The levy has grown to $3,400m for the seven months of this financial year compared with $2,900m last year. </PARA>
<PARA> On the deficit side, tax receipts from farmers will be down, as will the collections from provisional tax. I believe that the matters I have mentioned form the basis for considering in great detail tax reductions on personal incomes when the next Budget is being framed. It is also argued that one of the reasons why personal tax cannot be reduced is that the tax yield from the oil levy will fall dramatically from 1985 onwards. I do not think a persuasive case has been made out for this. The missing link is that those preparing the Government's estimates forget the efforts being made to achieve extra extraction, the development of existing fields, the production from new fields, the building of new platforms and scientific development. It must not be forgotten that the free enterprise system will respond positively to incentives-the higher the better. The idea of introducing a resource rent tax does not fit in with such a concept. </PARA>
<PARA> Table 3 of the Parliamentary Library base paper No. 10 of 1980 estimates what the levy receipts on crude oil will be up to 1987. Before looking at those figures it should be known that the Budget estimate for this financial year is $3,157m. As I have said, it will be exceeded by $42m. I point out to honourable members that the figures contained in the Parliamentary Library table are considered by the corporations in the crude oil trade to be a very good basis on which to begin discussion. It is estimated that the levy receipts in 1985 will be about $2,520m. Later estimates made in the industry indicate that the figure certainly would be much higher-that it would be close to $2,820m or $2,920m-and that instead of tapering off very rapidly the amounts in 1986 and 1987 could well be a little higher than the 1985 figure. In other words, real difficulties should not arise until the end of 1987. Much can happen in the meantime. Results would be better if 'down time' losses were reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to refer to the imposition of an indirect tax of a retail or wholesale kind. I do not think the inflation cost of that would be as serious as has been estimated. It has been estimated that a one per cent reduction in all marginal rates would cost the Treasury this year $600m. At 5 per cent it would be $3,000m and might be as high as $3,500m. It is said that the replacement of revenue lost due to an income tax reduction by the imposition of a wholesale tax would have the effect of increasing the consumer price index by 5 per cent or more. I have grave doubts for these reasons: The increase in the wholesale tax would have a one-off effect. That has to be remembered. Under present conditions a considerable percentage of indirect taxes would be spread over two or three years. Also, any increase in costs can be absorbed as productivity grows over those two or three years. Further, in the case of the wholesale tax, because it is the corporation that pays before actual sales take place in the retail stores there is every prospect that they would be able to absorb some of the increased costs. </PARA>
<PARA> I must also say that I was disappointed when the Government decided not to adjust the tax burden between direct and indirect taxes by reducing personal income tax and balancing the loss of revenue by extending the wholesale tax as well as introducing a services tax. It has been said that it is better to reduce taxes close to an election. I have my doubts about that because I believe that people vote according to the degree of their perception of the improvement in their own living standards. This can be achieved by one, two or three reductions over a three-year period. Continued improvement in the economy would also increase expectations of reduced taxes which over time would increase in a compound way. This would be of particular political importance. If we can do it when conditions are difficult, why can we not do it when they are as good as they are today?</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude: In an economic and financial sense the country has done a 'U' turn in a remarkably successful but drawn-out way as a result of our own efforts. To the thoughtful politician this means that now is the time to be thinking about the future. We must now set out medium and long term goals. Government and business resilience and adaptation to meet changing conditions are essential. We should also remove those obstructions and constraints which protect the obsolete established institutions, outdated conventions and excessive bureaucratic control. What we need is courage and determination. Australians will respond to policies based upon incentives of the kind mentioned in the Governor-General's Speech. Our motto should be: Give Australian taxpayers a better go with taxation. </PARA>

One is overawed and has a feeling of humility upon realising that one is a member of the Federal Parliament of Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, I assure you and all honourable members that this realisation will have a far greater impact and lasting effect upon me as someone who has adopted Australia as my home. I am an Australian by choice and settled in Australia in 1958 having emigrated from Scotland. I love Australia and its people. My grandfather came to the port of Fremantle in a sailing ship in 1912. Unfortunately he spent only three years in Australia. My immediate family consists of two daughters, a son and two stepsons. I have two grandchildren and two more on the way. I have in my wife Michiko-who is here tonight-a friend, a companion and an unpaid social secretary. Michiko came from Japan some 25 years ago. I am the second eldest son of a family of eight. I am very fortunate in having most of my family and my cousins, uncles, and aunts here in Australia. My father was a coal miner who, at the age of 14, went down the pits. He vowed that none of his sons would go down the pits and that vow has been fulfilled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, through you, I thank Mr Speaker for the course conducted here for the new members of Parliament. I give thanks for assistance received from various departmental heads and public servants, the Library staff and all those people who have helped the new members. I give thanks especially to Gordon Pike who is a person who needs to be mentioned and thought of more often. </PARA>
<PARA> My electorate of Hindmarsh was previously represented by the honourable Clyde Cameron. My task to follow in Clyde's footsteps is quite formidable. Clyde Cameron will long be remembered in this House. I have noted that Clyde was granted an extension of time when delivering his maiden speech some 31 years ago and, further, that Standing Orders were suspended on the occasion of his last speech. That is only part of the mark that Clyde has made. I believe Clyde was the greatest Minister in the Whitlam Government. He was fearless in fighting for those things in which he passionately believed. The Australian Trade Union Training Authority and the Clyde Cameron College stand as a testimony and tribute to his work. </PARA>
<PARA> In representing the electorate of Hindmarsh I have had the most rewarding experience of working with many wonderful people. I must mention some of those people for they are the workers in the community whose praises are seldom sung. I refer to people like Sam Johnson from Brompton whose whole life has been devoted to serving the community and John Dillon, another person who hides his light under a bushel. I mention Harry and Elsie Dennis. Harry was one of the original Rats of Tobruk. He is still out in the comunity fighting for that better life in which we all believe. I mention Jim Toohey-formerly Senator Toohey-and likewise ex-Senator Arnold Drury. Those people and many others too numerous to mention have participated in the work of the community. I am sure that they will continue in their struggle to make the electorate of Hindmarsh an even better place in which to live and to bring up children. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to bring to the attention of this House a number of issues which have caused me and my constituents a great deal of concern. I have mentioned previously the Adelaide Airport and I have given notice that that will be an issue which I will continue to pursue. I wish now to pursue another matter which goes beyond the boundaries of Hindmarsh, the States and even Australia. I submit that this is a matter that affects all people in all lands. It is the very question of the survival of the species-the survival of the human race. It is the question whether we in Australia join, promote or encourage the nuclear industry and proliferate the nuclear arms race. I hope I will be given an opportunity at a later date to debate the wider implications of the nuclear cycle. In the time available to me tonight I wish to relate what is happening to the people living in my electorate of Hindmarsh. </PARA>
<PARA> The Thebarton suburb in the electorate of Hindmarsh has been inflicted with the plant of Australian Mineral Development Laboratories known as AMDEL. This organisation has been in operation since the early 1950s. Honourable members should bear in mind that this is mainly a residential area. Late in 1959, the Commonwealth Government, the South Australian Government and the mining industry became sponsors of the laboratories. Various changes were made to the sep-up of the laboratories and, in 1978, additional changes were made to allow the laboratories to develop as a market-oriented corporation. Included in the work carried out at the AMDEL plant at Thebarton is the testing of uranium core samples from South Australia, from other States and other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern has been expressed for some time over the AMDEL uranium operation. On 31 March 1980, the Thebarton pilot plant and Frewville site-which is a sample preparation area-were inspected by Mr D. J. Hamilton, a scientific officer employed by the South Australian Health Commission. No radiation measurements were made at either site as the State Health Commission did not possess the appropriate instrumentation. The Hamilton report, as it is now known, was extremely critical of a number of procedures in operation at the AMDEL plant. The logging in of samples was not carried out as laid down by the regulations. Certain precautions are supposed to be adopted when uranium ore is handled. The Hamilton report stated that it has not been the practice to prepare written statements describing the precautions to be adopted or to distribute the statement to all the workmen involved although the preparation and distribution of such a statement is required by regulation 79 (b) and (c). On the question of the monitoring of personnel, the report stated that the entire staff had been supplied with film badges to monitor exposure to external gamma ray and X-ray radiation. The Australian Radiation Laboratory which supplies a particular film badge service said that the calibration of the film badges for uranium ore is very difficult and large inaccuracies-both over and under estimations-can occur. </PARA>
<PARA> An improved badge service called the TLD-thermoluminescent dosimetry-system has been brought into being. It should be borne in mind that this report was made in March 1980. At that time they did not have proper coverage for the workers. The Hamilton report goes on to say that film badges only indicate exposures to external gamma radiation but internal alpha emitters, that is, radon daughters and dusts, are a more important hazard when uranium ores are being handled. I point out that the South Australian Government endeavoured to cover up and bury this report. Fortunately, there were public servants who had enough conscience to make sure that the report got out. On the question of environmental monitoring, the report states that a gamma radiation monitor and a radon measuring system were the only monitoring instruments it was planned to have available at Thebarton; that uranium ore can be expected to contain all the radioactive daughters of uranium and that therefore radiation exposures to all three types of radiation-alpha, beta and gamma-from a number of radionuclides via several different exposure pathways can be expected when uranium ore is being handled. The report also points out the failure to mark drums containing radioactive material with the radiation hazard symbol, as is required under the regulations. In conclusion, the Hamilton report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The handling of uranium ores is a potentially hazardous operation. Provided that strict precautions are adopted and rigidly adhered to at all times, the risks involved can be kept extremely small. However, this result can only be achieved if the organisation involved displays a strong positive attitude towards minimising the risks associated with the activity. Such an attitude was not in evidence at the time of the inspection. </PARA>
<PARA> Monitoring is required to demonstrate conclusively that all the potential risks (both occupational and environmental) are known and are very small. AMDEL's responsibilities in the environment area are particularly important as both its sites are located in residential areas. </PARA>
<PARA>I again point out that the Hamilton report was made following inspections in March last year. The State Health Minister has played down the report. Indeed, it was very difficult to get acknowledgement that the report existed. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to deal with a subsequent report made by the health surveyor to the Thebarton Council, again dealing with the problems of the Australian Mineral Development Laboratories. The Council has been deeply concerned for some time about the operations and the health risks emanating from the AMDEL plant. Less than 10 metres from this plant are homes, and the fence that joins the residents' homes is a common fence with AMDEL. One can almost put a hand through and touch the drums that contain the core samples and tailings. The Council, after approaching the company, AMDEL, in an effort to deal with the problems being raised by residents, including concern over possible radiation hazards, considered a report from its health surveyor. Some very important aspects of that report should be made known. </PARA>
<PARA> The Thebarton Council was called on to consider its possible fate should it not declare Thebarton a nuclear free zone. Sample readings were taken of ore in drums and in sampling trays of yellowcake in plastic drums and in a glass jar, and of other radioactive materials, including pitchblende. These were the inspections that the surveyor undertook. Whilst the readings were within prescribed international levels, the laboratory's assistant radiation safety officer only agreed to go before the Council to answer questions provided that he was advised in writing of those questions and provided that the questions would not entail making statements on Government policy. Where is the protection for the people? Where has the community's interest been looked after? It was pointed out by the Thebarton Council that many councils in Adelaide and Melbourne, and also in Western Australia, I believe, have declared nuclear free zones in their areas and have forbidden the storage of nuclear materials. Concern was expressed that should other councils with similar circumstances to Thebarton successfully police their nuclear free zones, then it was possible that AMDEL at Thebarton could become a dumping ground for radioactive materials. To protect against this possibility, Thebarton Council suggested to its residents that they should consider the area becoming nuclear free. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of points were raised by the health inspector, and they are extremely important because they show the beginning of the whole nuclear cycle which I hope to have time to touch on tonight. On the subject of the crushing of the ore samples, the health inspector's report stated that whilst AMDEL provides a suction system at the face of each crusher, some of the radon gas may escape to the atmosphere and be carried from the vicinity of the plant. On the subject of tailings spillage he said that during the processing radioactive material may be spilt onto the floor and eventually washed into the plughole. In relation to equipment decontamination, the question arises as to how the equipment used in the process is decontaminated and how the associated decontamination wastes are collected and stored. While I am on the subject, I should point out that of the 12 boilermakers and welders who worked in the Radium Hill mine seven have died from cancer. One died in 1960 at the age of 35 and the seventh person died last year at the age of 65. </PARA>
<PARA> Dealing with tailings storage, and this is one of the key issues at that site, whilst AMDEL is handling only approximately 20 tonnes maximum ore at any one time, research indicates that some 3,700 litres of liquid waste per tonne are generated in the process, all of it chemically toxic and radioactive. This means that in producing 20 kilograms of yellowcake from 20 tonnes of ore, 74,000 litres of tailings are produced. If stored in 205-litre containers, the tailings produced would amount to approximately 360 drums. As these tailings are also acid or alkaline by nature some etching of the containers with resultant leakages could cause the release of radon gas if the tailings are stored for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> This somewhat detailed outline of the AMDEL operation has been necessary in order to show just how callous and uncaring the mining industry and governments that support it can be. It has to be remembered that we are talking about a mineral laboratory processing uranium and other radioactive materials right in a residential area. There are residents-my constitutents-on three sides of this chemical, mineral laboratory. I make it clear that so long as I represent the seat of Hindmarsh my primary responsibility will be to the people and not to the mining interests, the multinationals, or any other exploiters of the people of the Federal seat of Hindmarsh. </PARA>
<PARA> In Thebarton we have an establishment in a residential area pumping out radon gas and radioactive dust, and pumping radioactive tailings into the ground, contaminating the land, the water and the people. I have spent some time in the Thebarton AMDEL location going from door to door to speak with my constituents. I have been informed by people in the immediate vicinity about two deaths from cancer or leukaemia, and in the past few months the death of a child, three cases of possible skin cancer, two serious cases of chest and breathing complaints, nine complaints of constant eye irriations, and numerous complaints of sore throats. This is an area containing approximately 36 homes.</PARA>
<PARA> My constituents have called by petition for a medical team to go into the area to do a survey and conduct examinations in order to assess the magnitude of the problem. So far, the State Health Minister, Mrs Adamson, has ignored these calls. She also declined an invitation from an invalid pensioner, who lives about 30 metres from the plant, to live with her for a week, with free board, just to find out what it is like. Mrs Adamson said that she was too busy. The struggle of the people of Thebarton to have the chemical factory closed and the area cleaned up is a struggle that may take some time. I have made a pledge to the people to struggle with them until the filthy, radioactive, foul-smelling chemical and mineral laboratory is out of the district. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, because of lack of time I want to touch just briefly on one other issue which goes beyond that of Thebarton, which is only the tip of the iceberg. If honourable members recall, in the debate in Australia on uranium there was talk about our having to mine and export uranium to gain export earnings. We were told about the various jobs that would be created. That is stage one. As this Government would have it, stage two is the uranium enrichment process. We are under way with the enrichment process. I draw the attention of all honourable members to a publication called Compendium of Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Projects. Page after page relates to the non-breeder nuclear program in which this Government is involved. I have to finish now, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank you. </PARA>

I join with other honourable members who have congratulated those new members who have made their maiden speeches to this House. We appreciate that this is our initiation into the parliamentary field. Undoubtedly, all of us have a deep appreciation of our responsibilities in the future. First of all, I express my appreciation to the people of the Lyne electorate who elected me to represent them for the forthcoming parliamentary term. I also say thank you to my campaign director and to all those people, numbering over 500, who provided assistance throughout the electorate on election day. I say to them that I greatly appreciate the responsibility they have placed on me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I especially wish to say something about my predecessor, Mr Philip Lucock, who represented the electorate of Lyne for 28 years. Ever since I arrived here, all the servants of the Parliament, from the most junior to the most senior, have spoken most favourably of Mr Lucock. I am very pleased to hear that. He sends his regards to all of them. Mr Lucock served the electors of Lyne most conscientiously over the years. He certainly did a tremendous amount for the development of that electorate. Moreover, he did a tremendous amount for Australia and the Parliament. He represented us at the United Nations and elsewhere, as well as being Deputy Speaker of the Parliament for over 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I think some honourable members are aware that I served as a member of the New South Wales Parliament for a 14 1/2-year term. Prior to that I served an 8-year term in local government. I sometimes wonder whether it is an advantage to serve within a parliament or council before reaching the Federal parliamentary field. I suppose I have never had any great ambition to serve in the Federal House, but one appreciates the responsibility he has been given. I certainly think that the experience one can gain within the local government field and within a State parliament leads one to know one's responsibilities and to have a better understanding of our parliamentary system. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a great believer in our parliamentary system and in our three tier system of government within Australia. I emphasise right here and now how important it is that the three tiers of government within Australia accept their true responsibilities. I have been alarmed, as I know many members of this House have been alarmed, over the years when I have seen one of the tiers of government moving into the field of responsibility of another tier of government. I am a great believer in the work performed by and the responsibility held by the States. I see the national Parliament as the body responsible for controlling the national scheme. Whenever we can pass down responsibility it is our duty to do so in order to ensure not only that the taxpayers' dollar is properly spent but also that we gain the maximum development and progress to which we believe we are entitled in this young country of ours. </PARA>
<PARA> I belong to the National Country Party, a party which was formed more than 60 years ago to represent the rural areas of Australia. I suppose the reason the party was formed at that time by the old Farmers and Settlers Association still exists. There is still that great need, it may be greater today, for us to be represented within the parliaments of the Commonwealth and the States in coalition with the Liberal Party of Australia in order to emphasise the importance of primary industry and the problems we face in the country areas of the State. I am pleased to be a member of the National Country Party. I am pleased to say that we have, particularly in the Federal coalition and in the New South Wales parliamentary National Country Party, of which I was a member, a very happy and very close association with anti-socialist policies which are so important to us. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that over the years since the formation of our party our responsibilities as a party have greatly changed. They have changed, to some degree, from policies with an emphasis on primary industry to policies which embrace the tourist industry, country industry, aspects of the life of people who retire in country towns and our responsibility to the aged. Through our policies we have contributed to increasing the population and improving the status of rural areas of Australia. We must keep fully abreast of our responsibilities in that direction as a party. I want to say something about agriculture. When I speak about my party, I am led to say this: Over the years it has emerged that we have an ever increasing responsibility to ensure that the economy of agriculture is sound, to ensure that the people involved in the various avenues of agriculture-the dairy farmer, the fruit man, the grazier, the grain man and others-given their investments and in the interests of the happiness of their families, are allowed to take a real place in the future economy of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise a fact which I believe underlies the whole field of agriculture: Australia, although it is a large and dry continent, has a true responsibility to help to feed the people of the countries which need the products we produce. We should never overlook that fact. We must condition our future thinking on agriculture to include that fact. We want to compete on world markets. I commend the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Government for carefully looking at the effect on our markets of the European Economic Community. How worrying it is to see that the EEC member countries are heavily subsidising their farmers and increasing production. When they do not require the produce of those farms, they will dump it on markets around the world in competition with our products. It is most important that we appreciate that fact. I believe the Government is very aware of that and has adopted measures which will play an important part in what happens in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I will never apologise in this House or elsewhere for the support I give to primary producer support schemes. We must never forget the principle of providing support schemes for primary producers because they are subject to the elements. They are subject to climatic and market conditions. It is most important that, in order to maintain their prosperity, we never forget that it is the duty of governments to ensure that primary producers receive the finance and the moral support they require when the going is bad. I am one who believes in orderly marketing. I believe that whenever the opportunity presents itself, either the Commonwealth or the States should set up the necessary statutory authorities to permit orderly marketing of a product. I believe it is most important that when a marketing authority, or whatever it is called, is set up its representation is basically producer oriented. It is the Government's policy and wish that it should provide the legislation to enable the authority itself to care for its maintenance and running of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the House to a matter that has concerned me for many years, that is farm ownership. Today we have many younger people within the farming community. I know it has been stated by the producer organisations that the average age of a farmer is 55 to 57 years. When we consider the attractions of industry and commerce within this country and the high investment involved in getting on to the farm, including the purchase of real estate, stock and plant, we realise that we have a responsibility to come up with a scheme of land settlement. In this way a young man who was not necessarily a farmer's son but who qualified would have the opportunity of owning his own property. I do not believe that this is a true Commonwealth responsibility. I lay the responsibility fairly and squarely at the feet of the States. Some of the States have already made a move towards such a scheme. But as we are supposed to be holding the purse strings we should give any assistance we can to encourage a State to set up a land bank scheme such as the Canadian scheme. I believe this is a very worthy scheme. We have a great respect for the family farm. In the long term it is the family farm-Mum, Dad and the kids-which will make the farming industry survive. It is important that we recognise the high investment that farmers make. I commend the numerous farming bodies throughout Australia that are representative of the farming industries. We appreciate the work they have done for agriculture and their industries over the years gone by. I assure them of support in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> In lowering the cost of production there is nothing more important than water conservation. In recent days and only this evening we have heard discussions about the pollution of the River Murray. Let us realise that six-sevenths of the water of New South Wales flows in to the River Murray system. The River Murray is partially a worn out stream. It is now receiving attention from the Commonwealth and the States with the general desalination of some of the areas concerned. Perhaps water has been wasted in the past. However, I will not enter that field although I will enter the general discussion about future conservation works throughout Australia. As a primary producing country we must ensure that adequate funds are made available for overall programs to assist the States to develop their water conservation schemes. I come from a coastal electorate. This is the first occasion within the last year that any authority has wanted to tap the watershed of the Manning River catchment area. The water that will be diverted from the Barnard River into the Newcastle area and the Hunter Valley will basically be used for industry. We have no riparian rights. We do not expect to have them but we want to ensure the future growth of agriculture which will be necessary to meet the domestic requirements in this area of Australia with its increasing population. There must be an overall program that will ensure that the people who are living there and the agricultural industries in the area are well cared for. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the natural resources of Australia. I suppose that this is a subject on the lips of each individual. It is a matter that concerns us. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) warned us of the dangers of development to health. I do not know whether he wants to do away with unemployment. If we carried out his policy nobody would have a job. It is entertaining to hear some Opposition members talk. People are wondering what is the future of natural resources in Australia and what are our responsibilities to provide countries with the energy and other resources that are so important to them. I believe we have a great responsibility. We must bear in mind the environmental and other factors which may curtail some future development. I am pleased that at least 50 per cent of investment in natural resources development will be held, we hope, by Australians. This is not an easy thing to forecast. The economy of this nation must be very sound. Australians themselves have to be in a position to be able to invest their money in the encouragement of these industries if they are to be Australian-owned. It is important that inflation comes down and that we pursue the policies of the Government at present in order that the country's economy can be sound and the average Australian person has an opportunity to invest in the industry in his country that he is so keen to expand. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Tambling) is sitting beside me. What a responsibility we have as a nation to develop the north of Australia. Almost half the population of this country lives in Melbourne and Sydney. Surely we can do something-we have to-to encourage people to go where the work is in the north of Australia, not only to develop the natural resources but also to assist in the actual defence and long term progress of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to our road system. Coming from a rural electorate I believe that there is nothing more important to us today than to ensure that we have proper and adequate lines of communication. I was pleased to hear the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) announce a $3,650m five-year program for roads within Australia. I issue one warning in this respect. In most of our country electorates classified roads are main roads or trunk roads. I believe that in the future these will be known as arterial roads. These are the roads that carry the bulk of the production from the farm to the market place or the factory. I believe that these roads are being starved of the funds they require in order to build up a proper network throughout the rural areas of Australia. I hope that under the new arrangements, which still have to be responded to by the States, the States will contribute adequate funds, along with the Commonwealth, to allow the proper development of these roads. Although local roads are tremendously important I am not talking about those roads. I am talking about the roads for which the average shire council in New South Wales would not receive any more than $300,000 a year for development and maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> I also welcome the decision of the Minister and the Government that in future greater consideration will be given to the letting of our roadworks and bridgeworks by the contract system. I have seen a construction developing in my home town. In two months a firm has built a very large building which is nearly completed. The firm will be a going concern within three or four months of turning the first sod. I believe there is a lot of waste, not only in the local government field but also in the State field and, perhaps, in the enterprises conducted by this Government. We have to place a greater emphasis on contract work generally. I see that the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) is in the House this evening. I am pleased to see that once postal services move out of Redfern in New South Wales and 11 processing centres are established, many of the deliveries of that mail will be undertaken by the contract system. I believe that in many other areas where Government employees are used at present the work could be done by contract. We would get a better return for the dollar and would certainly make greater progress. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that my time has almost expired. I wanted to say something concerning some important features, for the average Australian, of His Excellency's address, features which touched on the responsibility that the Government has, and is discharging, so far as the elderly, the disabled and the handicapped are concerned. This, of course, we recognise and in my own electorate progress in this respect has been most favourable. My electors, individually, are concerned most about the attitude of many of our left wing unions and workers. Why should their strikes, which interrupt airline and other important services, be allowed to hold people to ransom? The harmful effect of such action upon industry, commerce and farming is paramount in the mind of country dwellers. The very people who create this atmosphere are the union officials, who in fact hurt their own members as a result. No one can tell me that there is not behind it some major ulterior motive designed to reduce the standard of living of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, firstly, though I recognise somewhat belatedly, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your re-ection to your esteemed office of responsibility in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I feel both proud and honoured to have been chosen by the voters of the electorate of Ballarat to represent them in this Parliament and I am very mindful of the responsibilities this entails. I thank them for their support, their confidence and their encouragement. I also wish to place on record my gratitude to those dedicated members and supporters of the Australian Labor Party, and to my wife and my children, who worked tirelessly with me and sacrificed so much during the recent election campaign. It is for me a great privilege to carry the political hopes and aspirations of 70,000 voters to the benches of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, in reflecting upon the history of the electorate of Ballarat, which incidentally was one of the foundation electorates of this Parliament, it is a humbling experience to contemplate the distinguished contribution of some of my predescessors. Of these, the name of Alfred Deakin, the first Federal member for Ballarat, comes to mind as one of this Parliament's greatest liberal reformers. Much that his government achieved in those early days, with the support of the Australian Labor Party, has stood the test of time. I also wish to pay particular tribute to Mr Reginald Pollard, who served the people of Ballarat, the Labor Party, this House and Australia with great distinction from 1937 to 1949. I am sure that Reg is delighted that Ballarat, which was in his time traditionally a Labor seat, has returned to the Labor fold after languishing for 25 years in the political wilderness. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer also to two other famous sons of the Ballarat district who, although not parliamentary representatives of that district, became Labor Prime Ministers during times of great difficulty for our great nation. I speak, of course, of John Curtin from Creswick and James Scullin from Trawalla, who spent his early working days in the great city of Ballarat. It should also be remembered that it was on the gold diggings of Ballarat that the embryonic democratic aspirations of the miners led them to take up arms against a despotic colonial government. The outcome of that diggers' revolt at the Eureka Stockade was the first step in the gradual process of the democratisation of the institutions of government in the colonies which culminated in the constitutional conventions of the 1890s and Australian Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the cities and towns of my electorate owe their existence to the gold era. The opulent grandeur of so many of the beautiful mid-Victorian public and commercial buildings and private dwellings is a lasting reminder of the great wealth that was created during that mineral boom of more than a century ago. It is still possible to see some of the most beautiful Victorian streetscapes in Australia in those cities and towns. Yet, whilst gold was the basis upon which centres such as Avoca, Maryborough, Daylesford and Ballarat were established, the subsequent development of major rural and secondary industries provided jobs for their citizens on a continuing basis. Indeed, it can be said that the development of manufacturing industry in Ballarat was very much interconnected with the deep lead mining activity which followed the completion of the taking of alluvial gold. The need for sophisticated heavy machinery for mining, together with the rapidly expanding infrastructure development in the district, accelerated the expansion of a broad industrial base. It was this industrial expansion which led to future economic prosperity when unfortunately the remaining gold became too costly to recover. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in more recent times the impact of various economic forces, in particular the restructuring of industry in this country, has been keenly felt in the electorate of Ballarat. Five years of the economic policies of the Fraser Government have failed to curb the decline in much of this country's industrial activity. Nowhere are the effects of this decline felt more seriously than in established provincial and rural Australia. My electorate is no exception. The continued survival of many of the labour-intensive engineering and textile firms of Maryborough, Kyneton and Ballarat, which have served this country so well over the years, is constantly under threat because of this Government's failure to understand their special requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> I must remind the House that such industries are major sources of employment in my electorate. If dramatic proof of the impact of five years of Fraserism is required we need look no further than the most recent Commonwealth Employment Service figures for the Ballarat district. On 31 January 1981, 3,837 persons were registered as unemployed. That does not include all of the actual unemployed. The official figure represented 9.5 per cent of the total work force in the region. In the Maryborough district alone at that time 651 persons were unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Statistics do not tell the story of the social carnage of unemployment. Let us consider the pressures that high levels of unemployment have created in these provincial centres. Let us ponder for a moment the overwhelming sense of bewilderment and despair that is felt by so many of our young folk and family breadwinners. What cause for hope is there for those folk who are in the middle years and find themselves without a job and little prospect of getting one? It is nothing short of an obscenity that the Government should be even floating the notion of withdrawing the unemployment benefit from 16 and 17-year-olds when, through no fault of their own, so many of them cannot find jobs. Recently, when a job became available in Ballarat, more than 400 people applied for it. In a city where youth unemployment exceeds 20 per cent, the appallingly callous suggestion of removing unemployment benefits deserves the most trenchant condemnation. Today I received news that will bring no comfort to those who work so hard for the unemployed youth in Ballarat. I refer to a letter from the Minister for Employment-</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members-Unemployment!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AI4">Mr MILDREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what I would have thought. The letter from the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) indicates the truth behind the facade that obscures the real policies of this Government. The 1981 allocation to the Community Youth Support Scheme based in Ballarat has been reduced to the extent that one project officer will be dismissed. In 1980, the Victorian committee recommended a reduction in the number of project officers from seven to six. The Minister rejected this recommendation and maintained adequate funding to enable the project to continue its important work without interruption. That was very good. The work load in 1981 not only is similar in nature to that of 1980 but also has increased in volume. The ingredients in the story are the same, except one. I suggest the insincerity of this Government's concern for the welfare of the young unemployed can be well measured by a comparison between its decision in the election year 1980 and those taken in 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What comfort was there for the unemployed in the Governor-General's Speech? There was very little indeed. Whilst Opposition members welcome any sign that the overall employment situation is improving, one can see that there is still a long way to go before we in the Ballarat electorate can become complacent. There are those who for motives they prefer not to disclose believe that these problems in the community will disappear if they ignore them or remain silent about them. However, I am a representative of a political party whose philosophy gives priority to the care of and concern for the less fortunately placed in our society. Therefore, it would be grossly negligent of me if I failed to draw the attention of this House to the existence of real difficulties in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with the problems of the unemployed, there are also serious problems with regard to the availability of welfare housing. I know that this situation is not unique to the Ballarat area but, for those who are required to wait two years or more for a home, the problem is oppressive. They are often forced by their circumstances to live in substandard conditions. The Federal Government must accept its share of the blame. In real terms, this Government's spending on welfare housing for the current financial year is one-third of the amount allocated six years ago. In real net money terms, the payment to the States for housing has fallen from $515m in the financial year 1974-75 to $76m in 1980-81. Victoria now receives only one-third of the amount it was allocated six years ago. This provides no comfort for those in my electorate who are waiting for a Housing Commission home. That is why it constitutes one of the major problems that come to my office. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members have heard much from this Government about the economic bonanza that will flow from resource development. Today, electorates such as Ballarat are looking forward to the signs that the promised benefits of the much vaunted resource boom of the 1980s will be shared by all Australians rather than simply accrue to a few giant corporations, many of which owe no allegiance to this country. Of course, this presupposes that the resource boom will go ahead in the way in which the Government has indicated. If a further exacerbation of the difficulties faced by non-metropolitan secondary industries is to be avoided, it is encumbent upon this Government to provide a co-ordinated, balanced approach to resource development. However, on present indications this just does not seem likely. The track record of the Fraser Government has been one of continued neglect of the special needs of the great provincial cities and towns of this country. Expenditure on decentralisation assistance alone has been cut by 70 per cent in real terms since the financial year 1974-75. The current year's allocation is down 16 per cent even on 1979-80 figures. Furthermore, expenditure on urban and regional development has fallen from $205m in the financial year 1974-75 to only $65m this year. Unfortunately, the Governor-General's Speech did not contain any suggestion that there would be a change of direction by the Government, and so the tragic neglect will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite this Government's intransigence, at least I can take heart at the efforts of so many individuals and organisations within my electorate to find solutions to the problems that we face. I am proud to be associated with the Ballarat Regional Employment Committee and its important subsidiary, the Ballarat Expansion Today-Tomorrow Committee. These two groups are dedicated to the task of finding new industrial opportunities for Ballarat, particularly in relation to resource development needs elsewhere. Such opportunities are vital for the continued viability of local industry and commerce, for the future expansion of employment and for the maintenance of the excellent lifestyle traditionally enjoyed by the people of my electorate. I am proud also to be associated with a group of Ballarat engineering firms which have formed themselves into a consortium known as the Ballarat Industrial Consortium. Its aim is to tender jointly for government and other local and overseas engineering contracts, sharing the work amongst the members according to the availability of production facilities and the size of the job. The consortium might well become a model of industrial co-operation to be emulated by cities in other parts of the country. There are also the railway unions in Ballarat that have fought valiantly to ensure the continued survival of the local railways workshop. Over the years, the workshop has provided jobs for thousands of Ballarat workers and has trained many skilled tradesmen. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people in my electorate recognise in a responsible fashion the effects of the social problems being faced, not only in Ballarat but elsewhere in Australia, such as high unemployment, inadequate welfare housing and of course the industrial malaise. My presence in this House is testimony to their concern. The voters of Ballarat expressed through the ballot box their belief in the relevance of the humane policies proposed by the Australian Labor Party during the recent election campaign. They expressed also their dissatisfaction with the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, I am proud to be the representative in this place of the people of the Ballarat electorate, who have always displayed great independence and determination in facing up to periods of economic and social difficulty. In fact, if the people of my electorate had not taken initiatives and seized upon opportunities in the past, the problems of today would have been much greater. For example, the natural and historical resources of the region have provided a base upon which a flourishing tourist industry has been developed. I am sure that most honourable members are aware of that, and I hope most of them have either visited, or will take advantage of a visit to, our fair city. However, further potential waits to be exploited, such as the mineral springs of Daylesford and Kyneton which, if carefully managed, could turn that area into a world class health resort. There is also a burgeoning vine growing industry around the towns of Avoca and Moonambel. The wines being produced in that area could well challenge the supremacy of the wines of the Hunter and Barossa valleys in a few short years. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that those honourable members trying to interject should come over and try them. The many initiatives that have been taken by the citizens of Ballarat are dramatic evidence of their willingness to help themselves in spite of the intransigence and the dogmatism of this Government. I suggest that those initiatives are deserving of the most sympathetic consideration by the Government and I hope that it will respond accordingly. It was only recently that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said that the benefits of the great development projects, which he envisages will be set in train over the next decade, should flow to all Australians. I call on the Prime Minister to spell out the means by which he intends his aspirations to be fulfilled for the benefit of all Australia. The concerned, responsible citizens across the length and breadth of my electorate, who are prepared to sacrifice much to help themselves, eagerly await the Prime Minister's response. However, I fear that the present economic policies being so doggedly pursued by this Government, at variance with the real needs of the electorate of Ballarat and of Australia, unfortunately will be continued to be pursued. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject of industrial relations has attracted a number of speeches and comments during this Address-in-Reply debate. After 25 years of diverse activity as an employer in the industries of earth moving and trucking, pastoral farming, hotels and holidays, I feel I am unique among some of those speakers, having had to live by the system rather than from it. As an opening comment, I philosophise for a moment. Today we are very much into renewable resources such as the sun, wind and tide. Many people believe that they will be the salvation of the universe, but they overlook nature's tendency to balance. Nature has supplied these resources to maintain life on earth. There is insufficient to cater for extravagance. The renewable resource which can provide greatly extended benefits is that of personal endeavour. The people of Japan, through personal endeavour, overcome severe shortages of most natural and renewable resources. Historically the Romans had it and lost it. More recently the British decided that they did not need it and currently the Americans, after a short experience of doing without it, are planning to bring it back into fashion. Personal endeavour is unique amongst renewable resources and when coupled with democracy it returns the benefits to the provider. Industrial relations is to me the business of developing this prized renewable resource.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us have a brief look at the reality of industrial life in Australia. Historically, life was not too good for the worker. Many of our original immigrants arrived in Australia as a result of English legislation passed in 1799, which outlawed workers acting in combination to seek wage increases or to go on strike. Possibly due to the resulting six months chained in the bowels of a sailing ship, few of these immigrants resumed their interest in labour relations on arrival in Australia. They apparently became more addicted to then popular pastimes of wenching and drinking. A prominant figure in labour relations has suggested that if present day emigrants from that same country turned their minds to this pursuit instead of that of shop steward, many man hours and millions of dollars in wages might be saved. The 1890s saw relatively the most bloody era in Australian industrial history. Both the fledgeling unions and the employers emerged bearing deep and unhealed wounds. It was not surprising, therefore, that with the support from both unions and employers, this Parliament saw as one of its original and most urgent tasks, the preparation of legislation to resolve industrial disputes. In 1904 it passed the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it worth repeating the reasoning behind this legislation. It was passed at that time with good will from both sides of the House, as a substitute for the strike weapon. It did not and does not include any reference to the present eleventh commandment-the right to strike. The intention was that it be the sunset legislation for industrial militancy. We might ask why legislation originally so well conceived by wise men of genuine grass roots experience has failed us. The answers are easy to find. As has just occurred in Poland, many early industrial leaders were workers who stepped from the ranks to lead when the need arose. Many of these men were selfless individuals quite happy to retire into obscurity when they believed industrial justice was achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The union movement has since become a carreer service. Careers must have the opportunity for advancement and for advancement one must be in a growth industry. The union industry is singularly lacking in obvious consumer demand, so growth must therefore be generated by convincing the consumer that he needs you. The recipe is simple: Maintain dissatisfaction. When the membership starts to realise that all those pay increases for which they struck have resulted in higher taxes and no more purchasing power then the union says that the direction must be changed and the members must be involved in the uranium debate or demarcation disputes. When the union finds they are not really interested in that, then it tells them they are overworked and need more leisure time. There is a new honourable member on the other side of this House who believes that quotations from foreign sources give weight to any argument. Let us therefore read what Paul Johnson, a noted British left wing academic, said in his article 'Trade Unionism is Killing Socialism-The English Experience'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Above all, the economic organisation of society, the way in which wealth is invested, and rewards distributed, to all of us who are its members, should have become the function of democratic governments. </PARA>
<PARA> But this is not what has happened. The unions have refused to recognise the limits of their historical role. They have not only rejected the idea of a progressive abdication, and the shift of their social and economic function to the political process, but they have flatly declined to allow the smallest diminution of their power to press the sectional interests they represent. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed they have steadily, ruthlessly and indiscriminately sought to increase that power. In recent years, and in particular in the last five years, they have exhausted or beaten down any opposition and have finally succeeded in making themselves the arbiters of the British economy. This has not come about as part of some deeply laid and carefully considered plan. It is not part of a plan at all. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been, essentially, a series of accidents. Huge unions each pursuing wage claims at any cost, having successfully smashed other elements in the State-governments, political parties, private industry, nationalised boards-now find themselves amid the wreckage of a deserted battlefield. The undoubted victors. </PARA>
<PARA> They did not plan the victory-they do not know what to do with it now they have got it. Dazed and bewildered they are like medieval peasants who have burnt down the lord's manor. </PARA>
<PARA> He stated further:</PARA>
<PARA>What next? They have no idea as they did not think ahead to this sort of situation, and indeed are not equipped by function or experience to embark on positive and constructive thinking. That is not their job! Here we come to the heart of the matter. The trade union is a product of 19th century capitalism. It is part of that system. Against powerful, highly-organised and ruthless capitalist forces, it had an essential even noble part to play. But when those forces are disarmed, when they are in headlong retreat-indeed howling for mercy-the union has no function to perform. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to leisure as expressed at present by the 35-hour week campaign. How the work force can enjoy an additional day's leisure per fortnight on the same wages is beyond me. They needed a 17.5 per cent loading to finance an extra week's annual leave. So what is so good about leisure and what is so bad about work? The opposition demands the fulfilment of work for the unemployed. The unions demand more leisure for the employed. The average Australian worker, after allocating long service leave on an annual basis gets, 152 days of leisure a year, much more than workers in any other country. Nevertheless he pays a high price for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The union movement which demands all this leisure on his behalf, has established, to its satisfaction at least, that leisure can be enjoyed only on weekends or at night time, other than, of course, if one is enjoying a public holiday, long service leave, annual leave or a sickie. I am told that it has something to do with access to organised sport. Consequently, the unions demand complicated and outlandish penalty rates for work performed by those who work during these official leisure periods. </PARA>
<PARA> Such ideology completely ignores the thousands of people who would happily exchange weekday work for work at evening or weekends. Their reasons might be that they enjoy daylight recreation, dislike overcrowded resorts and facilities, enjoy mid-week organised sport or dislike having to take sickies to enjoy mid-week organised sport et cetera. Leisure and industry costs would drop substantially if penalty rates were removed and facilities or plant properly utilised. The unions have decided we have reached a stage in our development which was achieved by the Romans just before they were overrun from the north. It is called the bread and circus syndrome. </PARA>
<PARA> Few of us doubt that our resources of personal endeavour do not stand up to world competition. So how can we live so well? We finance this bread and circus act by digging holes in the ground. Members of the Opposition complain of the sellout of natural resources. When will they realise that each and every one of those holes in the ground represents the price we must pay for the leisure that so many Australians demand, both on and off the job. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a solution to this crazy leisure push. If it is genuinely the belief of the union movement that the efforts of its membership demands additional leisure, let that membership face up to the reality of world competition. I call for immediate tariff trade-offs for all 35-hour week settlements whether or not the industry concerned receives protection. By such action at least those still working 40 hours or producing exportable commodities will get the benefit of cheaper goods. I am well aware that the original industries which will gain the 35-hour week do not receive protection and such across the board reductions would endanger jobs in other areas. We might then discover whether the union movement knows the meaning of the word brother. Let us face it: High on the list of soft spots for the 35-hour week campaign are the motor vehicle and agricultural machinery industries. When will the flow on get to clothing and footwear?</PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned the failure of the arbitration system. What good is an arbitration system for which one side has lost complete respect and the other any trust in its ability to function according to its charter? The principle function of the arbitration system in today's labour market is to legalise and enforce that otherwise illegal practice of resale price maintenance. It is handy for continuing evidence of the union secretary's dedication by being the vehicle for constant applications for new awards and wage increases. It is staffed and attended almost entirely by men whose contact with the real everyday problems of managing or working in business or industry is so remote as to be ludicrous. It allows one side to operate in the jungle while it demands that the other side stays out on the plain. If honourable members want an example of how far the system has drifted from the intentions of our forefathers in 1904 I ask them to consider section 40 of the current Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, unchanged since that date. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) In the hearing and determination of an industrial dispute or in any other proceedings before the court, the court (commission) . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Commission shall act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Yet the system today bows constantly to industrial expediency. Judgments are based not on how much the workers should get but how much they will take. This was exemplified when Sir John Moore, in his December 1978 4.3 percent national wage case statement, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We agree that if the industrial effects of doing so could be ignored, no increase at all in award wages, would result in a greater restraint in costs and price. However, we don't believe that industrial considerations and their attendant cost implications can be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA>The highly expensive and publicised national wage case is played out every six months by, as I have said, a group of people least suited for the task. When the show is over the decision is invariably reserved. The following day or so members of the Press start predicting the likely wage rise. They do not do this by means of the much celebrated leak. They do not have to. The journalists does in five minutes what the court process takes some very costly weeks to achieve. He has a look at the consumer price index and discounts it by about 15 per cent to 20 per cent. He does what a group of workers and employers could achieve in half a day if they sat down together with good will. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to the Federal Government to fund the arbitration system is estimated for 1980-81 at $5.74m. The States spend approximately a further $12.4m totalling, say, $18m. Because this system has totally lost the goodwill which was present at its birth and, consequently, no longer meets the purpose of its passing this House, I recommend its total disbandment and a refund of that money to our taxpayers. It is improper to have this Act on the statute book while the right to strike is still the principal industrial tool. The provisions of our universally applied common and criminal laws are sufficient to handle the legal aspects of industrial relations. If employers would take any advice from me they would also dismantle their present hierarchy. Its continuing participation in the present day farce is evidence of the need for new blood. </PARA>
<PARA> To date I have criticised the system without supplying solutions. I may appear to have been kind to the employers for their role in our modern day Comedy of Errors but I do not intend to be. I have now led us to a situation where we have not arbitration procedure and no supplicants at that altar. Presumably that leaves both sides with the opportunity to go into the jungle or out onto the plain. The choice would be theirs. As a solution I am impressed with the Swedish system of collective bargaining and labour relations as it operated in the early 1970s. The Australian and, more particularly, the Australian union organisers' idea of collective bargaining is that a large number of unions collect together to confront an individual employer. During the resulting industrial action it is often normal for that employer's competitors to smugly observe his troubles while running around offering to take the work he would normally receive. These same competitors achieve industrial harmony through sweetheart deals registered through a tame arbitration system. This allows those wage increases to be included in their rise and fall clause of work contracts and so flow on to suffering clients. That is not collective bargaining; that is selective bargaining. Collective bargaining must be at industry level and must be conducted by competent, experienced and intelligent people. The Swedish national employer body, the SAF, and the Swedish national employee body, the LO, appear to have those qualities. Both have exacting discipline over and control of their members. Both have strike funds created by levy to compensate members affected by industrial action. Most importantly, both reserve and effectively use the right to approve independently negotiated agreements or local strikes. </PARA>
<PARA> The intervention of the SAF and the LO in industrial disputes or negotiations removes the parochial issues and ensures the matter is judged on its merits and with due consideration to its national consequences. Imagine the consternation of some of our more militant unionists if, after starting a strike, they were told by the employer that he was off to the Gold Coast to spend his strike compensation while they negotiated with a competent and independent industry group. No wonder the Swedish Information Service could state in 1975 in its 'Facts on Sweden Sheet':</PARA>
<PARA> One would expect a system of central and nationwide negotiations like the Swedish one to be predisposed to open conflicts. But as far as private enterprise is concerned the annals have to go back to 1954 to find a conflict involving a national union. Since 1956 the year when central negotiations started, the parties have not even had to threaten industrial action except on two occasions. It is common to explain this unusual stability in terms of a 'power-balance' theory. The fact that both LO and SAF are so tightly knit and well disciplined and also well funded renders industrial action on a limited scale a rather inept way of settling conflcts. </PARA>
<PARA>I like the use of the word 'inept'. It appears that even public servants negotiate with the employers federation in industrial matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Might I emphasise here that the system I refer to is my understanding of that which functioned in 1975. I am not aware of recent developments, nor do I care about them. The system that I have referred to sounds fine to me. Both sides are out on the plain. Could it work in Australia? I believe it could, provided some surgery was conducted. The surgery necessary is the transplant of some bone from the heads of our union leaders to the spines of our employers. </PARA>

<PARA> I rise to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent). In particular, I support his remarks on unemployment and on family life. I was expecting the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) to be in the chair. However, as he is not, I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to convey to him my appreciation of the role he played in the seminar that was held for new members. Although, technically, I am not a new member I attended the two-day seminar. I think it was one of the best things produced by the staff of this Parliament for a long time. So often new members came into this place with no knowledge whatever of procedure. The staff were painstaking in their efforts to make sure that we understood everything that happens. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to hear the Governor-General say in his Speech to the Parliament that his Government had a commitment to social security and welfare measures which will strengthen the family and, through it, the social fabric of this country. He went on to say that his Government cared deeply about the quality of life in Australia. These two statements, taken in conjunction with several other statements in the Speech, reflect a care and concern for the unemployed, for Aborigines, for welfare housing, for research and for a host of other social issues. This really represents an about-fact by a government not known throughout welfare circles for its humanity or understanding of social problems. However, I welcome the change of heart, even if so far it is only on paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us deal with some of the issues in the Speech. I refer firstly to the need to overcome unemployment in general and to stimulate the employment of youth. Everyone in this House and those listening to the debate will be well aware of the tremendous level of unemployment in this country throughout every age group. In fact, over the last five years unemployment has escalated at a rate that Australia has not seen since the last depression. The Government's answer to this and its answer to the enormous number of young unemployed is to initiate a debate within the community on the advisability of cutting off the dole for 16 and 17-year-olds. The reason given by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> For some young Australians, the present payment of unemployment benefits may act as a disincentive to continue in formal education or training or to seek work . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has said that it will be examining this as a matter of urgency, which means to me and my colleagues that it will again make policy on the basis of expendiency rather than evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the same Government which in 1976 stopped unemployment benefit for school leavers because, it said, some young people were collecting unemployment benefit and then returning to school. No evidence was ever given. The same Government in 1979 provided a mandatory penalty of between six and 12 weeks without unemployment benefit for people who turned down casual work because it was said that fruit growers could not get casual labour. Again, no evidence was ever given, nor was it ever emphasised by the Government that if one takes a week's casual work one has then to re-register with the Commonwealth Employment Service and one loses next week's pay. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HF4">Mrs CHILD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But one loses another week even if one takes the work. No study has been undertaken by the Government to show that there are disincentive effects in paying $5 a day to the young unemployed who, indeed, have to spend a fair amount of that money on fares in looking for work. No government report on education and unemployment, and there have been plenty, has ever recommended that the unemployment benefit for 16 and 17-year-olds should be scrapped. The clear fact is that there are not enough jobs to go around and the periods of unemployment among all age groups are getting longer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government completely misunderstands the problem of unemployment and the quality of living if it believes that every family can continue to support its children at school for an extra year or so. Low income earners certainly cannot; one income families certainly cannot; and single supporting parents certainly cannot. How a breadwinner who is on unemployment benefit, which happens a lot these days, is supposed to continue to support young adults at school for an extra year is beyond my comprehension. No one has explained to me where the jobs are to come from at the end of that extra year. The fact is that the Government refuses to accept that there are not enough jobs to go around and this prating about a clear commitment to the youth of the country is a clear insult to the army of unemployed. This House should remember that the coalition parties, when in opposition, tagged the unemployed as 'dole bludgers'. </PARA>

Did the honourable member for Dundas not hear the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr N. A. Brown) castigating them again last night?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Governor-General also mentioned that this Government has a commitment to the improvement of Aboriginal health. This Government has a dismal record in the area of Aboriginal health-in fact, in the care and concern of Aborigines and Aboriginal land rights generally. It was pleasing to see that commitment mentioned in the Governor-General's Speech but, unfortunately, the Government's track record is so bad that I do not have much faith in its putting up any programs. The Government is great on rhetoric but short on action. I would suggest as a starter that some honourable members opposite look at the mortality rate of black infants and the mortality rate of white infants throughout Australia. If they do they will see how much need there is for more than just talking about the health of Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that the Government also intends to do something about welfare housing. It will not do anything about welfare housing if the honourable member for Diamond Valley has his way. I would suggest that the first thing this Government should do is speak to its Liberal colleagues in Victoria and suggest to them that the hundreds of thousands of families in Victoria which have been waiting for housing commission homes for anything up to six years should be attended to. When I made my maiden speech in this House six years ago I mentioned then that I had people coming to me who were desperate, whose families were breaking up, who had to have their children made wards of the State because they could not get cheap housing. The list gets longer; the waiting time increases and the despair becomes greater. People on low incomes, one parent families and pensioners cannot afford the high rents prevalent in Victoria and, in fact, all over Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria in particular we have had a continuing debate over past months about the funding of the Olympic Games. The Minister for Youth, Sport and Recreation, who used to be the Housing Minister, was so keen on posturing on and postulating about the Olympic Games that he did not have time to look at his other portfolio. The present Minister for Housing has very little interest in welfare housing. If Victoria can find the hundreds of millions of dollars necessary to float the Olympic Games in either 1988 or 1992, good luck to it. But, first, it should make provision for those people in need of welfare housing. </PARA>
<PARA> With this new found care and concern of the Government for the quality of life in Australia, I suggest it now has a look at those ex-servicewomen who are not eligible for a defence service home loan. It is a fairly small group of women. The servicewomen, who enlisted at the time of World War II, were ineligible, by virtue of their sex, to enlist for overseas service, however willing they might have been to do so. Honourable members should remember also that servicewomen in those days received only two-thirds of the pay received by servicemen of equivalent rank. Since 1972 it has been possible for women members of the forces to obtain a loan but still those women who volunteered to serve their country in time of war are not eligible. These ex-servicewomen are suffering an injustice. A great way in which to recognise the services that they so willingly gave in years gone by would be for this Government sincerely to fulfil its wish to show care and concern for the quality of life and make the ex-servicewomen of yesterday eligible for the defence service home loan. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly enough, in the Speech of the Governor-General I found reference to the Government's recognition and appreciation of the contribution which the Public Service as a whole makes to life in this country. I endorse that statement wholeheartedly. However, the recent actions of this Government do not reflect any care or appreciation of the Public Service. For the first time in 50 years a decision of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission will be overturned by government legislation. This reflects great discredit on the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I was surprised also to read in the Speech of the Governor-General that the Government will give greater support and improved facilities for research. I am sure that those people at Monash University who have been asking for increased funding on a continuing basis will share in my surprise as its repeated requests to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) have fallen on deaf ears. I urge the Government to recognise the need for planned funding on a continuing basis so that medical research programmers will know where they are going for a definite period. Otherwise the brain drain to overseas countries will continue to the loss of our country. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year this Government insisted that it had funded community health centres set up by the Australian Labor Party in the period 1972 to 1975 up to the level of the previous year. As no funds were added to cover inflation, the health centres all had to cope with a 10 per cent decrease in their funding. This is one area in which the Government can fulfil the words of the Governor-General because the worth of health centres has been well proven in the community. Their value to community life is an accepted fact. They are not expensive to run and, in the field of preventive health care, are extremely valuable. </PARA>
<PARA> May I dwell for a few minutes on the plight of those people in the community dependent on social security. Time after time we have had reports prepared by respected groups within the community which have pointed to how many people are living below the poverty line. Professor Ronald Henderson, whose report on poverty has been well swept under the carpet, has urged that attention be given to those people whose incomes are totally inadequate. In answer, this Government has come up with a new method of defining poverty in the belief that by giving poverty a new definition it will fold its tent and silently move away. Professor Henderson's poverty level is pretty austere. The problem has probably been understated rather than exaggerated. Almost every welfare agency in our community-whether it be a voluntary or government agency-has criticised the Government for its policies. Almost every supportive body has run out of money to subsidise urgent needs. </PARA>
<PARA> All my colleagues have shared my experiences of more and more desperate families calling for help. For the first time, the pensioners association, in its frustration, called upon its members to vote this Government out at the last election. Family life is being threatened by poverty. Young unemployed have no access to things like dental care. The young unemployed I met during the last election campaign were very revealing in what they thought of politicians in general. They said to me: 'If you had a war, you would find us very welcome. We would have value. But our teeth can rot in our heads for all you care'. If one is poor and needs a hearing aid, one should forget about it. There is about a 24 month waiting list by which time one might not even need one. When this Government speaks of care and compassion for those in need, that is about all it does. A one income family with four dependent children on an income of $160 a week is now $25.40 below the poverty line. A single parent pensioner with four dependent children will be $27.70 below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA> All official reports surveying families-not just those of the Australian Labor Party-have called for an increase in allowances for children, particularly those children in poor families. Again the pleas fall on deaf ears. Without a change in government policy, half a million children will inevitably suffer through poorer housing, poorer health, poorer education and poorer job opportunities. The social problems of the future caused by this Government's policies are enormous. The Government appears determined, despite the Speech of the Governor-General, to follow a policy of survival of the fittest. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to discuss what was said by the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr N. A. Brown) in the Address-in-Reply debate last night. Evidently he believes that we will destroy society if we do not make people stand on their two feet and rely on their initiative and self-help. He kept saying: 'Set people free to determine their own futures. Cut social security so that they do not rely on it, and abolish welfare housing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, a very good fee. One would need to have experienced poverty in order to know about it. I will be very surprised to learn that the honourable member has experienced poverty. As George Bernard Shaw once said: 'Great wealth insulates people from the ordinary, every day experiences of living'. I would not know why the honourable member for Diamond Valley wants to abolish welfare housing or social security. If a business is not going too well, one tries to change the management. One does not abolish the business. If social services need improving-not abolishing-increase the welfare housing. The honourable member spoke a lot about poverty. It puzzled me somewhat as to why he dealt so much with it but he seemed rather interested in getting rid of it-under the carpet perhaps. We can get rid of poverty. In order to get rid of poverty we will have to make substantial changes in our approach to such fundamental matters as land tenure, housing, education, health, legal services, taxation and public spending. Such changes will not be forthcoming until either the political majority becomes committed to the abolition of poverty or the underprivileged minorities acquire sufficient political power to change the system of social stratification. I do not see either of those things happening in the foreseeable future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to the honourable member for Diamond Valley that any society based on the ideology of laissez-faire requires a deprived population which is allegedly unwilling to work or unwilling to work hard. That is where the dole bludger syndrome came from. Not only does the alleged moral inferiority of the poor reduce the moral pressure on the present political economy to eliminate poverty, but also welfare measures can be kept to a minimum if those who will benefit from them most can be described as 'lazy', 'spendthrift', 'dishonest' or 'dole bludger'. </PARA>

I hope that all new members will respect that responsibility and make their appropriate contribution to the betterment of life in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In speaking tonight to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor-General, I should like to refer to just two aspects of future development in Australia. The first is the development over the next few years of the electronic media and other services in Australia. In technical terms, Australia is very much at the crossroads. There are great changes to come during the 1980s-new services, new technology, and a whole range of new things that in many respects probably are beyond comprehension. Some of these new services have already been introduced, with varying degrees of success. For the past 50 years the development of radio and television in technical terms has been very much like Topsy-it just grow'd, to the extent that now we are virtually facing a crisis situation, especially in regard to the supplying of facilities and frequencies for the new services. In fact, the situation is so critical that even existing services are suffering in such important areas as Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> Although a study of frequency allocations is presently being conducted, there is still doubt in my mind as to whether this study will be enough to overcome the already critical situation of which I speak. I say that because I do not really believe at this stage that we know in which direction we are truly going, or which way we want to go, in fact. In Australia we have never really had any major system planning in frequencies. Certainly, in terms of the programs and types of media the public want, I do not really think we have a clue exactly what its expectation is or what it really wants. The public has been conditioned over a period to a system which I believe is one of the best in the world. However, we still do not really know what the needs of the public are. </PARA>
<PARA> I make these statements in conjunction with my comments about the frequency problems because in many respects the two are closely interlocked. At the moment, for many purposes the spectrum is being allocated on guesswork, with no real consideration of what future needs or desires may be. The truth is that currently the frequency allocations for television are saturated on the VHF band. We have introduced FM radio, and now channels 3, 4 and 5 on that band look as though they will have to be vacated by television to permit the wider introduction of more FM radio. If that occurs, what will happen to those stations from the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the commercial sector in areas such as Newcastle which presently use those frequencies? That is only the beginning. We are talking about the introduction of supplementary licences for television stations. Where will those bands come from? What will happen if the Special Broadcasting Service is extended beyond Sydney and Melbourne? Is a public television system to be introduced? If so, how do we handle that? There is great merit in the introduction of a second ABC network or an educational television service. We do not know just what we will do about that either. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a problem with Channel 5A. It looks as though that has to be cleared so that international meteorological services will not suffer from interference. There is yet a further problem if air navigation distance measuring equipment services are to be removed from the broadcasting band. Already in Sydney and, I understand, Melbourne difficulty is being experienced by new FM radio stations in that there is already the problem of interference or potential interference with television reception on channels 9 and 10, mainly through the use of domestic high gain television antennae. The frequencies being allocated for FM broadcasting are in the 88 to 108 megahertz band. </PARA>
<PARA> Station 2SER is causing problems in Sydney; 3MBS is playing havoc with television reception in Melbourne. Transmitter towers are springing up in these cities, where no due consideration is given to mast sharing or better locations to minimise that interference. To add to that, the technical specifications given to the two commercial FM radio stations by the Department of Communications frankly are just not good enough for those stations in Sydney-2MMM and 2DAY-to meet the requirements of their licences. They just cannot get enough power to adequately cover their licensed area. There are repeated reports of poor reception or lack of reception, to such an extent that the viability of these stations certainly must be in question. If we are truthful, it will be the commercial stations that will establish the FM band as a proposition for high quality stereo radio in Australia. Why we waste FM on talk radio is just beyond my comprehension. The medium is for stereo music broadcasting; the talks should obviously be going to another band. Admittedly, in this respect Sydney is worse off than Melbourne because of its topography. In FM radio power is all important for quality reception, but to my knowledge nothing has been done to try to rectify the situation or even to find out just how bad that reception is. Action is certainly urgently needed. </PARA>
<PARA> We badly need a frequency allocation policy to cover all aspects of broadcasting from radio and television right through to two-way radio systems and even as far as the citizen band radio system. Surely we can conduct a full and meaningful study to find out what the public wants in terms of the media, what the expectations are, and combine this with the identification of a suitable frequency allocation policy. The two are very much interlocked. We have had previous studies of the system. Attempts have been made to find out what some sections of the public want, but frankly we still do not really know what the phrase 'in the public interest' is all about. If somebody can tell me what 'in the public interest' means, I would certainly be appreciative. This is really no criticism of this Government or any government of any political persuasion that may have gone before. But we have a system that has simply evolved, and if we do not sort out the mess right now we are headed for disaster in the future. The frequency spectrum is a very precious commodity which must be managed and used well. We do not have that at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area to which I would like to turn my attention tonight is the development of airlines and aviation in Australia. Yesterday in this House the report of the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares was tabled. I do not necessarily want to canvass that document completely at this stage, but I would like to turn my attention to aviation and the changing nature of that industry, and again flag moves that can well be made to Australia's great advantage. Commercial aviation in Australia, both domestic and international, has been one of the most protected industries in this country. In many respects these policies have worked well for Australia. However, times are certainly changing and this industry is undergoing dramatic changes around the world. The Holcroft report recognises the advantages of deregulation, and there is ample proof, despite what many of the local sceptics may say, of the advantages that deregulation or restricted deregulation can bring. Whilst not advocating a complete open skies policy for Australia, there is obviously a great deal of merit in loosening up the present Australian system, domestically and internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should look at what deregulation is all about. It is not about throwing safety standards overboard, about treating passengers to cattle truck conditions, and the other terrors that are constantly being propounded by the established aviation gurus in Australia. It is simply about aviation efficiency and the provision of the most economic fares for the travelling public, who are the real pawns in the aviation game. It is about the right aircraft for the right routes. It is not necessarily about subsidies or cross-subsidisation of services. I know that the critics will say that deregulation in the United States of America has been a disaster. Frankly, I believe that aviation in the United States would have been in a much worse state had it not moved to deregulation in 1977. There have been very great changes in the structure of US aviation and those changes are still going on. Despite the skyrocketing fuel prices, the US travelling public is getting a much better deal through special fares than we are. The fact that scheduled fares are about the same as ours is not really relevant. In the deregulated regime an entirely new system has developed. Innovative pricing structures now rule supreme. When we consider that nearly 90 per cent of airline passengers in the United States travel on special fares, it is just not right to try to compare our established air fare regime with that which exists in the United States. The Australian public owns more than 65 per cent of scheduled aviation operations on trunk routes in Australia. I believe that the shareholders of Trans-Australia Airlines and Qantas Airways Ltd have the right to want a better deal in those companies in which they supposedly are shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> International aviation is at a most interesting stage. An examination of that development in terms of deregulation, especially in the case of Great Britain, is most interesting. Great Britain has gone to a system of limited deregulation. Both the United States of America and Britain have led the way in opening up air travel to the populace. Despite the forecasts of disaster by the experts, the carriers and passengers alike have benefited greatly. For example, the London-Miami route was forecast to be the greatest disaster in aviation history when an additional carrier came on to the route offering fares at 50 per cent of the established pricing structure. However, in 12 months, from April last year, it is estimated that the traffic has grown by a massive 118 per cent. That is happening with three carriers offering innovative fares. In fact, the aircraft of all the carriers are full. All are much more profitable. Miami and London both have benefited in terms of tourist expenditure and now a fourth carrier is being welcomed to the route to handle the traffic. I mention the Miami-London route because the traffic on that route is similar to the volume of traffic between London and Australia. But there are other routes involving similar volumes which could be mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> Since airline industry deregulation, in a 12-month period from last year, the volume of traffic on the London to Los Angeles route went up 177,073 passengers. The carriers on that route are profitable. There has been an increase of 60 per cent in traffic in one year. Last year on the London-New York route there was an increase in volume of traffic of 29 per cent after deregulation. Now five million Britons annually take package holidays overseas. That has happened since their limited deregulation regime was introduced. Because of our policies and admittedly the distance involved our share of that five million package holidays is the massive total of 2,000 holidays. At a recent public hearing held by the British Civil Aviation Authority, British Airways, one of the established, protected carriers on that route, admitted in public that it allocates 20 seats a week on 10 Boeing 747 services for package holidays to Australia. What a farce, what a sham, what a disgrace!</PARA>
<PARA> The Europeans and the Americans are travelling further now for their package holidays. That should give heart to all of us. Many of them are coming as far as Bali, which is about one and a half hours away from some of the major holiday resorts of Australia. I suggest that Australia's problem in gaining international traffic at the moment is no longer the tyranny of distance but rather the tyranny of the high air fares. Already 161,174 Britons travel to Australia to visit friends and relatives and for business purposes. They seem to take the distance in their stride. In 1979, 323,404 Australian went to Britain. The potential of that market certainly is there. Can we possibly imagine what a contribution could be made to the tourist industry, to the Australian economy and, as the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) mentioned, the employment potential in this country if we had an open air fare regime? Add the 10 per cent growth rate on that route, which has applied for so many years now it is not funny, to the stimulation factor which increased competition would bring-it is estimated by experts in Britain to be 30 per cent-and the advantages for all Australians are blatantly obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> Another international aviation review is scheduled for this year. Let us hope that all options are canvassed, especially in regard to the loosening up of Australia's civil aviation arrangements. Certainly, a number of public statements have been made by the Chairman of Qantas asking for the right to compete in the market place. I believe that those moves should be welcomed. I am sure that Qantas realises that it would benefit most of all from that form of deregulation of fares. Qantas would be the greatest beneficiary, but the Australian travelling public would benefit too. Obviously they have a preference to travel with Qantas but, like travellers everywhere, they are cost conscious. Frankly, who can blame them for shopping around to get the best deal? Yet we see the amazing spectacle of ticket inspectors and prosecutions when all people are trying to do is simply get value for money. I do not think that that is right. If other airlines, whose fixed costs, frankly, are the same as those of Qantas, can offer cheaper fares there must be something wrong with the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The morality of the present air fare regime must be in question. People talk of orderly marketing, but the experience in most areas of business, including aviation overseas, is to let the market place find its own level, which it will do and quickly, bringing great benefits to everyone, particularly to the carriers and the travelling public. The International Civil Aviation Policy regime is dead, thank goodness. Let us now get our house in order as soon as possible because we can do that quite simply, as I have outlined. Let us not discriminate against Australians who wish to travel overseas. Certainly, let us not discriminate against visitors who legitimately want to come here and who legitimately want to spend their money in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Governor-General's Speech, which we are debating tonight, alluded briefly to Australia's defence preparedness and held out the promise-yet another promise-that defence expenditure would increase to about 3 per cent of gross domestic product, this time by 1984-85. Let me state at the outset that, despite the Government's rhetoric on defence, defence expenditure as a percentage of GDP has remained constant at 2.6 per cent for the past five years and is precisely the same as the level reached during the Labor Government's term of office. The Fraser Government's pronouncements on defence since 1975 have been a catalogue of hollow phrases and empty gestures of omissions and remissions. Before I itemise that catalogue I, as the last Minister for Defence in the Labor Government, want to set the record straight and to lay to rest once and for all the lie created and perpetuated by the Fraser Government that the Labor Government neglected defence and, in particular, ran down expenditure on new equipment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All honourable members who have some knowledge of defence will recognise that there are long lead times between the decision to purchase equipment and the delivery of that equipment. The case of the F111 is a notorious example. The F111s were ordered with a great flourish in 1963, an election year, and they were not delivered until 1974, some 11 years later. It is important also to recognise that actual expenditure on major items of equipment can be spread over many Budgets. The main expenditure reflected in Budget outlays might not come for four of five years after the decision is made. Therefore, in analysing a current Budget, in effect we are looking at the consequences of decisions made four of five years before, not the decisions made in the current Budget year. That is precisely what happened to the Labor Government in its early Budgets. There had been a steady drop in actual expenditure on new equipment and stores from 1968-69 onwards. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave of the House to have incorporated in Hansard a table on actual expenditure on new equipment and stores from 1968-69 to 1972-73. The incorporation of the document has been authorised by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The Labor Government set out to rectify this grave situation, the product of a former Liberal-Country Party Government's neglect of defence. For a large part of the period from 1968-69 to 1972-73 the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was Minister for Defence and the present Minister for Defence was Minister for the Navy. We set out to change that situation and we all now know the results. The Fraser Government for the past five years has been the beneficiary of the initiatives in defence taken by the Labor Government during the years 1972-75. The Labor Government initiated the purchase of two guided missile frigates. The present Government ordered another two. I congratulate it on this decision but it was hardly a brilliant initiative. It followed precisely what the Labor Government had laid out. We ordered 15 patrol boats to replace the Attack class. We ordered 87 Leopard tanks. The Fraser Government increased that order by 14 but, regrettably, I think that about 20 are still in mothballs. We ordered eight P3C Orion aircraft. The Government added another two to the order-hardly a challenging initiative. We ordered 12 C130 Hercules medium range transport aircraft. We ordered the HMAS Tobruk, the amphibious heavy lift ship. We set in motion the purchase for Rapier missiles, the SAMS, and projects such as Jindalee and the Army transport including about 2,000 light vehicles. This was the Labor Party's equipment program in the period from 1972 to 1975. If we look carefully at how these initiatives of the Labor Government have impacted, not on the Budget of the Labor Government but on subsequent Budgets, we can see the effect of decision making that impacts upon subsequent Budgets.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. As an example, I announced the decision in 1975 to acquire 15 patrol boats. The first expenditure related to the purchase did not appear in any Budget until 1976-77. The major outlay did not appear until some years later in 1979-80. The nature of defence equipment purchases is such that the impact on the Budget comes in terms of progress payments. The progress payments on the patrol boats may well not be finalised for another four or five years. In short, this Government has been parading in borrowed clothes. The increased defence expenditure on new equipment in recent Budgets has been largely because of the initiative taken by the Labor Government in the period from 1972 to 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was not only in the well thought out initiatives in new equipment that the Labor Party made an outstanding and unrivalled contribution to Australia's defence preparedness. Critics of the status of Australia's defence should keep in mind that during the last 30 years the Labor Party has been in government for only three. Yet in those three years fundamental changes were made in defence policy and administration. I will give some of the context of the problems in defence administration that we, as a Labor Government, faced in 1972 and 1973. Vietnam marked the end of a particular kind of commitment that had determined Australia's defence thinking since the end of World War II. The defence authorities in the post-war period were preoccupied with immediate operational tasks associated with Korea, the Malaya emergency, and the South East Asian Treaty Organisation's confrontation and Vietnam. As in the world wars Australian responsibility was to mount expeditionary forces which were slotted into the combat forces of our principal allies and were under their command. Our force structure, procurement programs and training were determined by and fashioned to those commitments. In short, it was a derivative defence policy in which the major co-ordinates were determined for us by our allies. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation changed radically with the United Kingdom withdrawal east of Suez and the disengagement of the United States land forces in South East Asia. The Guam doctrine spelt out clearly that the United States expected its allies to handle with their own resources threats of a regional nature which were within their own capacity to resist. In this new setting Australia is required to pursue its own security interests by its own efforts more than was previously required. Intrinsic in this approach is that any future combat operations are much more likely to be in the Australian vicinity than in some forward theatre and our three Services are much more likely to be operating together rather than individually in support of an ally. The Labor Government clearly discerned this change. The aim of the reorganisation of the Services departments initiated by my predecessor, Lance Barnard, and passed into legislation during my term as Minister for Defence was to provide the administrative machinery for developing and implementing a self-reliant defence policy. Honourable members may recall that the Liberal Party in opposition was mindlessly opposed to the reorganisation. I was therefore delighted to read an unsolicited compliment from the Minister for Defence in his statement on 25 March 1980. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Defence administration in Australia was subjected in the 1970s to the most profound reorganisation in its history. I want it to be entirely clear that on the whole the Government is satisfied with the results. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that my predecessor, Lance Barnard, who took the initiative for the reorganisation, would be surprised but nonetheless appreciative, of this belated but handsome tribute. There were other outstanding achievements of the Labor Government administration in defence such as the establishment of the Natural Disasters Organisation, the introduction of a new Defence Force retirement scheme and a much belated upgrading of the pay and conditions of our servicemen. It was a remarkable period of intense and fruitful activity with which I was very happy to be associated. The Fraser Government has paid us the ultimate compliment of not changing the direction. Where it has fallen down is in its procrastination, its go-stop administration and in not keeping the very promises that it has made. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Liberal-National Country Party Government's first mistake, which was no doubt prompted by its attitude that defence is more a public relations exercise than a serious national responsibility, was to depart from normal practice in announcing the target figures for the total five-year defence program. That is precisely what it did in the November 1976 White Paper. The White Paper was essentially similar to the program that had been approved by the Labor Government when in office. What the Fraser Government failed to realise was that five-year rolling defence programs are essentially a planning instrument. They are not and should not be seen as a definite commitment to purchase. As projects come up through the program to a Year 1 decision changes can be made, and usually are. I pointed this out at the time in an article in the Pacific Defence Reporter, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . by the time recommendations come up for decision-</PARA>
<PARA>And it could be to a Labor Minister for Defence-</PARA>
<PARA>a different perception of requirements may emerge. </PARA>
<PARA>But it was not until a year later, in his statement of 22 September 1977, that the Minister was forced to recognise this elementary fact when he observed:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the issues with which defence policy is concerned are not static. They are constantly developing and we must keep them under continuing review and ensure that our defence planning is responsive. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Minister asserted that the White Paper of 1976 remains the basic document, the basic reference for discussion of our national defence, and in that context I would like to examine one or two issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The paper proposed to increase expenditure on defence facilities-on airfields, naval and air bases, housing and so on, from 6.2 per cent of total defence expenditure in 1975-76 to more than 7 per cent in 1980-81. That was not a particularly daunting task, but the results have been disastrous. The Department of Defence has been good enough to make the comparative figures public.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. In constant August 1979 prices, expenditure on defence facilities in 1975-76 was $170m. In 1980-81 it was $130m. That is, instead or rising to 7 per cent in 1980-81 as promised, in fact it fell to 4.03 per cent, much less than the 6.2 per cent figure in Labor's last Budget. The table that the House has kindly given me permission to incorporate in Hansard also provides an interesting commentary on the Liberal Government's professed interest in defence co-operation. On 19 February of last year the Prime Minister stated that he believed:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . that the abiding security interests that we share with our regional neighbours call for continuing consultation and co-operation in the defence field. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Defence subsequently proclaimed:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that policy has been pursued with vigour. </PARA>
<PARA>The evidence shows otherwise. At constant 1979 prices, the Labor Government devoted, in its last Budget, $45m to defence co-operation. During the last five years there has been a significant drop in defence co-operation expenditure. In 1980-81 it has falled to the level of $36m. We have become accustomed to this Government's flowery promises and subsequent retractions. It has left an ever-widening trail of broken promises but, regrettably for Australia, it is in the area of defence that the Fraser Government's penchant for broken promises is particularly evident. I can assure the House that the Labor Party will continue to monitor the Government's defence policy to ensure that its performance matches its promises and that Australia's security interests are adequately safeguarded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have today a great variety of addresses by honourable members in response to the Governor-General's Speech, including a number of maiden speakers whom I take this opportunity to congratulate, as well as the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child), who made her first speech following her return to the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a point of departure, I wish to refer to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). Predictably, he found fault with just about anything and everything that the Government has done, but the thrust of his speech to which I would particularly take exception was the suggestion that, broadly speaking, ordinary Australians have been neglected, have not been well served, by this Government. That is just plain wrong. Australia, and the majority of Australians, are in pretty good shape and prospects for the near and longer term are bright indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, difficulties and problems to be overcome. I have in mind particularly the continuing high level of recorded unemployment and, in a different context, the increasing incidence of strikes and industrial action. Yet the strength and the performance of the Australian economy, which is a basic pre-condition for the well-being of the Australian people, cannot be gainsaid. That strength and performance is attributable in significant measures to the policies of this Liberal-National Country Party Government, policies which it has carried through resolutely, policies which, as the Governor-General's Speech put it, 'are designed to work for the well-being of all Australians'-that is the keynote-'and to develop a society which maximises the rewards of individual effort and initiative, and which also respects the rights of individuals to shape their own lives'. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the best indicators of the economic health of Australia is the growth in employment over the last year, the number of new jobs that have been generated by getting the basics of the economy right through sound policies-getting inflation down, restoring competitiveness and encouraging and applauding reasonable growth in profits. During 1980 total employment has been consistently 150,000 to 200,000 higher than in the corresponding period of 1979, an increase of 2.5 to 3 per cent, the order of growth to which we were accustomed in the 1950s and 1960s. We are talking of real additional jobs generated-I use that word deliberately-by the dynamics of a sound economy and appropriate policies, not jobs 'created' by a big spending program such as has been espoused by the Australian Labor Party, a program which, in fact, would be counter-productive. Indeed it would end up destroying as many jobs as it might initially create. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no coincidence that in a recent issue of the Australian Financial Review, of 29 January, there were two headings, one referring to the fact that economic activity and business is now the best that it had been for many years and the other announcing an increase of only 2.1 per cent in the consumer price index for December, the lowest for a December quarter since 1972, giving a 9.3 per cent price increase for 1980-well below the 12.4 per cent average of the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a fact which was also reported in the same issue. I repeat, those two reports are by no means a coincidence. It is a basic, fundamental proposition, yet one that the Labor Party will not accept, or affects not to accept, that the anti-inflation stance of this Government has been and remains central, not so much as an end in itself but as a means to an end-the achievement of increased activity, employment and growth. It is a central fact that inflation itself is the major cause of unemployment, the major underminer of growth. One fights inflation, not in preference to reducing unemployment, as Labor Party supporters would try to suggest, but in order to reduce unemployment-by the growth of jobs on a lasting basis. To quote the Governor-General's Speech, there is no realistic alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to emphasise that this growth in jobs will continue, with the great boost to Australian development that is now under way, the so-called resources boom, the term used by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Mildren) in this debate a short while ago. I put 'resources boom' in quotation marks because there is something of a tendency to see it as a thing apart, whereas this surge of new development, which has been nurtured and encouraged by this Government's policies, should be seen as central and integral to the strength, the dynamic, the growth in activity and jobs, in the Australian economy today. 'Resources boom' is not a good term. In the minds of many it has overtones of stock exchange fever and the like. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9G4">Dr EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It goes much beyond. We are talking about a great new era in Australia's growth and development, centred on our massive energy resources, especially coal but also shale and crude oil-I am confident of that-uranium, and so on. One might speak of an energy rush comparable in dimensions and thrust to the gold rush period of the 1850s which made possible the first great period of prosperity and growth in Australia. It was an age in which Australia became recognised as a land of great opportunity for everyone. Indeed, in an energy hungry world where the advanced industrial countries must change away from dependence on oil, Australia's massive reserves of coal and other energy sources places it in the box seat of history. I hope that all Australians, and especially the youth of Australia, can catch something of the meaning, the vision, of what it is all about. It means not only higher living standards for all Australians, but also what we do with our resources will affect the lives of countless millions of people overseas, lifting their hopes and expectations, improving the lives of people all around the world, including particularly those in the developing countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I referred a moment ago to higher living standards for all Australians. That is the key note. The resources boom is not a thing apart; it is not just about a variety of big projects or, as many seem to think, big profits for big multinational or transnational-or whatever the in word is-companies. Yet, you get that sort of thinking. It is the stock in trade view of the Australian Labor Party that somehow in all this Australians are being exploited, that there is great benefit to the parties or companies immediately involved but Australia and Australians generally are not getting the benefits. Whilst the Labor Party likes to promote that sort of thinking, it is simply not the truth. It is just plain wrong; it is wrong-headed. The development-exploitation if we like in its proper sense-of Australia's great energy and other resources benefit all Australians, not just those immediately involved. Indeed, it is a key thrust of the Government's policies and its firmest determination that the development of Australia's great energy and other resources benefit all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus it should be noted that 46 per cent of every dollar of company profits goes direct to the Government to be used for the benefit of all Australians. In respect of the mining industry the figure, including resource-type imposts, is 53.7 per cent of every dollar of profit. It goes to the Government for disbursement in the interests of all Australians. This direct benefit, as well as dividends accruing to Australian ownership, is only the first part of the story. Next there are the new jobs, towns, railways and wharves and so on associated directly with the construction phase of new projects. There is also a spinoff in jobs in Melbourne, Sydney and elsewhere for manufactured structures, machinery, et cetera, for the new projects. That means more jobs, real jobs, for Australians. There is the permanent expanded employment base in industries which are viable in the highly competitive world of today. That reduces, although it does not eliminate, our dependence for employment on, for example, the motor industry where it is desperately difficult to sustain a competitive industry. Witness the position in the United States where the losses of the big three last year were of the order of $4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, there are the exports, including the sale of coal, in due course liquid natural gas from the North-West Shelf, bauxite, but also now, increasingly, the immensely more valuable aluminium. Exports benefit all Australians, for without exports to pay for needed imports no economy could work at the level of activity required to maintain high employment. In short, it all adds up to a strong economy which is the envy of the world, higher living standards for all Australians and for countless millions overseas, a natural growth in tax revenue to provide needed government services and lower tax rates. That is what this era of growth and development that we have entered is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> Having referred to exports, I conclude by saying that there are those around who, confronted with the wonderful prospect of greater growth in export earnings, see it as an embarrassment of riches. They get worried and talk about the Dutch disease or, alternatively, they preach a doctrine that says we should spend up much bigger on cheaper consumer imports. Rather, I believe it is important that we should continue traditionally to import capital-we need to do that because of the magnitude and lumpiness of many of our new developments and their need for associated technology and know-how-but at the same time, let us become exporters of capital and use the bonanza of export receipts, if there is one, to acquire assets. We want Australia, Australians and Australian companies to acquire assets both in terms of buying overseas and in terms of buying back assets here. It is the old phrase about buying back the farm, although there is much more than the farm. We have seen this week Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd announce that it will make provision for a public float and Australian ownership in part of its Australian operation. Let Australian individuals and institutions take up that. In recent years the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd has acquired the Peabody Coal Company. It has acquired the Burmah Oil Australia Ltd stake in the North-West Shelf project. A bit of muscle is sorely needed there with the tough Japanese negotiators they are facing. Australian companies are establishing factories overseas to mesh with their Australian operations, to produce more efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> All these things involve making payments overseas. Paying money overseas has the same effect as buying imports. If one is afraid of too much money from exports-and what an attitude that is-there is plenty to do with it. Let us have even more policies to promote the building of Australian ownership of assets in Australia-assets previously owned by overseas interests as well as assets in overseas countries, the earnings from which will benefit future generations-our children and their children. I tend to get short with people who, confronted with this prospect of great growth in export earnings see it as I said a moment ago, as an embarrassment of riches rather than thinking of building up assets and passing on the gains to our children. That thinking, I believe, is on a par with the Opposition's line on petrol prices-keep the petrol prices low, use it profligately, and to heck with our children; let them worry about it when the time comes. That is its attitude. The policy to promote this growth is an integral part of this Government's overall policy and so, as I observe that it is nearly time to adjourn this debate, I will conclude on the note on which I started: The policies of this Government are designed to work for the wellbeing of all Australians. That is the Government's commitment; that is the Government's resolve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) is not present in the chamber tonight because I wanted to draw his attention to the problems that are being encountered in the Melbourne Passports Office. I have received a number of complaints from my constituents who find that they are having a tremendous battle to get passports. The section is grossly understaffed and no doubt this is the result of the deliberate policy and the mania of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for setting unrealistic staff ceilings. In that section only one supervisor attends to 14 or 15 people who are often lined up trying to get passports. He has to go away and verify some of the details as well as answer the telephone; so the people in the office can wait anything up to an hour and a half to be dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know from personal observation that understaffing is suffered by the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security, because I have spent a day in each of those offices in my local area and I have seen that the stress the staff are working under is tremendous. Quite a number of people need their passports from the Passports Office in a hurry because they have made their bookings. I do not really think that staff anywhere, be they public servants or other employees, should have to work under such a tremendous strain. To test the delays, one day a member of my staff rang the Passports Office but the telephone was never answered. This is what is happening to the people applying for passports. They phone but they can get nothing done because the fellow on the counter does not have the time to answer the calls. So the people go to the office when their passports do not arrive. That means they will have a wait of another hour or so while the overworked fellow behind the counter tries to deal with everyone. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told, and unfortunately I cannot verify some of these assertions but I am sure the Minister can, that most passports are issued three weeks late and some are not ready for collection when the people are ready to leave to go overseas, which causes them a lot of worry and concern. Some people need their passports because they are travelling to Europe or somewhere else due to the illness of a parent or for other reasons and they have to get there in a hurry. I am also told that the Passports Office has a backlog of something like 6,000 passports. Unfortunately, I cannot check those figures, but the Minister can. I think that he should do so as quickly as possible both for the benefit of the hard working staff and for a very long suffering public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very disturbed to read a recent Press report of a statement apparently made by Miss Liliana Gasinskaya, the so-called 'red bikini girl', who was granted resident status in Australia in January 1979. Honourable members will recall that Miss Gasinskaya achieved notoriety after she jumped through a porthole of the Soviet vessel Leonid Sobinov and initially claimed political asylum in Australia. Her case was reviewed by the Determination of Refugee Status Committee or DORS Committee which determined that she fitted the definition of a refugee, and on that basis the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs quite properly granted her permanent residence in Australia. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 13 December last, the following sentence appears in a report of her discussion with another Soviet defector, Mr Victor Dudko:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Miss Gasinskaya, who jumped through the porthole of the cruise liner 'Leonid Sobinov' in Sydney Harbour two years ago, declared that she still had her Soviet citizenship and her Soviet passport and had been back to the USSR on holiday to see her parents. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement that she has recently returned to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to visit her parents surely raises certain questions about her refugee status. The United Nations convention relating to the status of refugees defines a refugee as a person who is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable to return to that country or is unwilling to return to that country owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted. What then is the position of a person who, having claimed refugee status, is able to visit her home country at a later date apparently without any suggestion of persecution. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine some of the statements attributed to Miss Gasinskaya at the time her applications for political asylum and then refugee status were being considered. The Canberra Times of 17 January 1979 records the person who found her after her escape from the Soviet vessel as saying this:</PARA>
<PARA> She kept talking about how she hates Russia and was afraid to go back. </PARA>
<PARA>The Daily Telegraph of 18 January 1979 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Miss Gasinskaya has said she fears reprisals if she is handed back to Russian authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> She has told friends she has made since her arrival in Sydney she would rather die than return to Russia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Melbourne Age of 17 January 1979 quoted her as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I hate Russia and I saw the ship as my only chance to leave the country. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly she based her claim for refugee status on a fear that she would be subjected to some persecution if she returned to the Soviet Union. Since it appears that Miss Gasinskaya can travel in and out of the Soviet Union with impunity, I believe that the Government should review her refugee status and consider returning her to the Soviet Union. If events have gone too far for that to occur, then we should learn a lesson from this incident. </PARA>
<PARA> We must be wary of claims from people who use terms such as 'political asylum' and 'refugee status' to gain themselves sympathy when the fact is that they merely prefer to live in Australia. Many people have that preference and under our immigration laws we often are required to reject their applications. These cases of highly publicised defections of attractive people such as the 'red bikini girl' or ballet dancers only bring our immigration policies into disrepute and probably make it more difficult for us to pursue normal family reunion applications from east European countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We did not even score any ideological points with Miss Gasinskaya's defection as her expressed hatred of the Soviet Union seemed to stem more from a feeling that the shops in Russia were boring and that our beaches, as portrayed in magazines, were beautiful. As Michael Barnard pointed out in the Melbourne Age of 20 January 1979:</PARA>
<PARA> This may be all very flattering to us here, especially when liberally dashed with words such as 'freedom', but it is not a very penetrating indictment of the Soviet system as great Soviet human rightists like Dr Sakharov see it. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is fair to say that while the Australian public supported the decision to allow Miss Gasinskaya to stay in January 1979, it would now welcome an opportunity to be rid of her and would certainly support the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) taking a very sceptical attitude towards such people in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Incidentally, while looking through the Press reports of the incident, I came across one statement which has proved to be prophetic. A report in the Canberra Times of 18 January 1979 says this:</PARA>
<PARA> The Captain of the Leonid Sovinov described Miss Gasinskaya yesterday as a bad worker who had caused trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> In an interview before the ship sailed from Melbourne to Adelaide, Captain Constantin Nikitin said she would prove 'a real pain in the neck for Australia'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House the plight of women under 50 years of age who lose eligibility for a Class B widow's pension and supporting mother's benefit when their children cease to be dependants. A group of these women in my electorate has formed an association and is seeking a simple change in legislation to lower the age of eligibility for a Class B widow's pension from 50 to 40. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the detail of their submission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>A PROPOSAL SUPPORTING THE LOWERING OF THE AGE OF ELIGIBILITY FOR WIDOWSCLASS B PENSION</PARA>
<PARA>Introduction</PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that the age limit for the Widows Class B Pension be lowered to allow for the inclusion of women in the 40-50 year age bracket. At the present time widows or deserted wives under a certain age and without dependant children are expected to find employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Facts About Current Eligibility for Widows Pension and Supporting Parents Benefit</PARA>
<PARA> Widows Pension is divided into three categories:</PARA>
<PARA> Class A-a widow or deserted wife with a dependant child (dependant child-under 16 years, or a full-time student under 25 years). </PARA>
<PARA> Class B-a widow or deserted wife of 50 years of age with no dependant children. </PARA>
<PARA> Class C-payable for a period up to 26 weeks after death of spouse, to a widow under 50 years with no dependant children. </PARA>
<PARA> Supporting Parents Benefit applies to a sole parent who supports a child and who does not qualify for Widows Pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The Widows Pension and Supporting Parents Benefit supply a basic income of $61.05, with additional entitlement to fringe benefits which include, amongst other things, a Pensioner Health Benefits Card, rate rebates and discounts on telephone rental and transport. </PARA>
<PARA>What Does This Mean</PARA>
<PARA> 1. A widow without dependant children, and who is under 50 years of age is not eligible for continuing pension (except under certain circumstances) and is forced to seek employment. Unemployment at the present time is high with skilled workers finding it difficult to obtain employment, and unskilled workers finding it even more difficult. The majority of widows in the 40-50 year age bracket belong to the latter section of job seekers. Many have devoted their whole lives to their families and do not have skills relevant to the present employment situation. Their future prospects of finding work are even worse than their present prospects, with increasing age and length out of the workforce being a deterrent to employers. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. These women are forced to exist for lengthy periods of time on unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefit was not designed for long term usage and the low rate of payment plus work tests over a long period of time lead to a general decline in the physical and mental health, with the result that the women are being placed on sickness benefits. Sickness benefit however, was also designed for short term usage and is unable to provide security for the women. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The widow pensioners were financially better off on the Widows Pension and Supporting Parents Benefits than on either Unemployment or Sickness Benfits due to the fringe benefits that are not applicable to persons on the latter two benefits. This, plus the security of knowing they would receive an income for some time in the future gave the widows some sense of confidence in the future. The present state of financial insecurity, and the inability to cope adequately on the benefit, is as mentioned previously, leading to great emotional strain which is resulting in physical and emotional decline. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The change from the pension to a benefit has even greater repercussions where the mother is attempting to retain a family home, and the child is either working or also on unemployment benefit. The change in benefit brings with it a change in status, and a change in identity, which can result in the family breaking up due to the child seeing and wanting a change of role for both parties, and the parent resisting this. Basically the shift in status and identity is related to loss of the ability to give financial support by the parent, and thus loss of ego and a change in self image and rebellion by the child to contribute equally to the upkeep of the home while also having to answer to, and obey, the parent. With equal payments towards upkeep of the home the child wants equal responsibility over his life and resists parental concern and any curbing of activities etc. As the whole relationship undergoes a change more strain and stress is inflicted upon an already stress packed situation. </PARA>
<PARA>What Can be Done</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Legislative change could re-define the Class B Widows Pension to include women who are 40-50 years of age. The result would be a re-establishment of security and dignity, and hopefully the prevention of some family breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA> In re-defining the Class B Pension to include widows in the 40-50 year age bracket the Government would not actually be allocating more funds to be spent on social security but rather re-distributing it. The women who would be eligible for the re-defined Class B Pension are already receiving monies from social security in the guise of either unemployment benefits or sickness benefits. The Government would not have to set up an administering body for the proposal and it should entail less work in the long term as the re-defining of the Class B Pension would make the Class C Pension redundant. </PARA>
<PARA> The re-defining of the Class B Pension would result in security of income for the widows and the addition of fringe benefits, which is of great significance to a person on minimal income. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Many widows expressed a sincere desire to find employment and thus be independant of Government aid. It is not envisaged that the re-defining of the Class B Pension will greatly detract therefore from the number of mature women attempting to find employment. It is envisaged that with a more secure financial position these women will be able to apply for suitable positions with the degree of self esteem and confidence that makes them a more suitable proposition to employers. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. It is also proposed that re-training schemes could be created to cater for the unskilled mature women who wishes to enter the workforce, thus, enhancing her ability to obtain employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusions</PARA>
<PARA> Informal contact with the Department of Social Security has revealed that there is an increasing number of women entering this situation. As it is envisaged that the number of women in the situation, and the problems they face, will continue to increase rather than decrease we urge you to initiate some legislative action. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal has been prepared by the 'Women In Search', which is a group of women in the situation depicted in this paper, being women under 50 years of age who lost entitlement to the Widows Pension or Supporting Parents Benefit when the youngest child turned 16 years. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of recent publicity a number of other groups have indicated their support for 'Women In Search' and their cause. These groups are:</PARA>
<PARA> Civilian Widows Association. </PARA>
<PARA> Melville Business and Professional Womens Association. </PARA>
<PARA> Womens Federation-National Country Party. </PARA>
<PARA> S.W.A.G.-(Social Work Action Group). </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. If a woman loses her status as a supporter of dependants after turning 45 she can secure a widow's pension. But if a woman loses that status before she is 45 years of age she must wait until she has turned 50 before she can secure a widow's pension. At present, such women in their forties have to go on unemployment benefit. This means that they lose security of income through having to face the work test. They also lose fringe benefits such as their pensioner health benefits card, rate rebates and discounts on telephone, rental and transport. They also lose about $8 a week in cash. These women have very little chance of finding work. They are reaching their forties and are women who, at the time they married, were actively discouraged from entering the work force. Hence they tend to be women without skills. They usually find themselves in competition, even when they are re-training with young women who are in a similar situation but who are more attractive to employers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The necessity of making fortnightly visits to the Commonwealth Employment Service office to be interviewed by employment officers concerning their efforts to find work and to apply for jobs they know they have no chance of getting places great strain on them. Over a period, the stress often causes a decline in physical and mental health such that the women go on sickness benefit. When they are sufficiently recovered they go back to the same routine on the unemployment benefit and so the cycle continues until they turn 50. A change from the pension to the unemployment benefit has even greater repercussions when the mother is attempting to retain a family home and the child is either working or is on unemployment benefit. The change in benefit brings with it a change in identity which can result in the family's breaking up owing to the child's seeking and wanting a change of role for both parties and the parent's resisting this trend. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has, on occasions, in reply to this group-there has been correspondence between them-expressed the view that the needs of those on social security benefits must be balanced with the willingness of the taxpayer to pay more. In this particular instance the reality of the situation is that the taxpayer does not have to pay a great deal more to continue to support women on the widow's pension as opposed to their receiving the unemployment benefit. If the employment situation were such that the women could find work then the Minister would have a case but the situation is that it does not seem likely in the very near future and certainly not in the life of this Government, that they will find themselves in that fortunate situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The existence of the Class B widow's pension for a widow or deserted wife of 50 years of age indicates that successive governments have recognised the situation of older women in this position. While women in their forties may be relatively more employable than women in their fifties, their chances of actually finding work are remote. Informal contact with the Department of Social Security has revealed that there is an increasing number of women in this category. The problems these women face are major and can have lasting effects. I urge the Minister to undertake the simple legislative remedial action of lowering the age of eligibility for a Class B widow's pension from 50 to 40 years of age. At least the Minister should consider special provisions whereby women in this category retain pensioner cards entitling them to benefits. It cannot remotely be argued that this change would be a major charge on the Commonwealth because the benefit obtained by rebate often relate to State, local government and private services. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I should like to draw attention to a further anomally. The Family Law Act no longer recognises blame and, therefore desertion. The relevant section of this Act concerning desertees does, however, do so. A woman deserted is entitled to the benefits that I have already outlined. A woman who deserts is not entitled to the benefit beyond the point of time when she ceases to support dependants. She must secure a divorce or when she reaches the age of 50 years or she is entitled to nothing. A variety of factors may determine a woman's decision to leave home and a variety of reasons may make her unwilling to seek a divorce. To retain in this Act a distinction in status between deserters and desertees which is no longer recognised in legislation.--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An article appeared on the front page of the Adelaide Advertiser this morning headed: 'Firm closing at Whyalla'. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A Whyalla engineering company employing about 100 workers said yesterday it would begin to phase out its operations and close the plant by early 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The company is NEI Engineering which, under various names, has been in Whyalla for 27 years. </PARA>
<PARA> It makes steam condensers, feed heaters, heat exchangers and pressure vessels. </PARA>
<PARA>All of these, of course, would be involved in any thermal power station. As the article stated this firm has been in Whyalla for 27 years. It is a branch of the A.C. Parsons group in Great Britain. It has played a significant part in Whyalla and it will be a blow to that city if this firm closes. It employs more than 100 people who are all very highly skilled in their particular trades. I think that something should be done either by the State government or this Government to keep this firm in operation. The employees are to be retrenched between now and the end of this year or early next year. The only alternative employment in Whyalla is with the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd and a few other small firms. The fact that this firm is to close certainly makes it more difficult to overcome the employment situation in Whyalla. It is a highly specialised industry. As I mentioned earlier, its products are connected with thermal power stations. The article to which I referred mentioned feed heaters, heat exchangers, pressure vessels and so on. All these things are used in the power industry. The divisional managing director of the firm is quoted in the article as stating:</PARA>
<PARA> We are finding ourselves in the position where we are not receiving sufficient work in this field to keep the business going and we have come to the conclusion that, on future projections, there is no point in carrying on . . . </PARA>
<PARA> We will wind down the factory from tomorrow onwards. </PARA>
<PARA>Just 45 to 50 miles away from this plant at Port Augusta a new 500 megawatt power station is being built. In this country we talk about the resources boom. Surely one of the major factors of the resources boom will be the production of power. Yet here we have a firm that makes the gear so that the thermal power houses can be established. This firm is to close down because of a lack of orders. I think it will be a backward step for this country if the State government, which is responsible for the powerhouse that is being built at Port Augusta, does not see that sufficient orders are given to this firm to keep it going. I have visited the place. I was a tradesman boilermaker. I have seen the extremely high quality of the workmanship in the factory. The workers can be proud of it and their industry enjoys a very high reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, it is about time a government came to the assistance of the industry, particularly at Whyalla. The decision to close Whyalla shipyard was made three or four years ago. Despite promises of the Government representatives who had discussions with the people at Whyalla and said that they would assist the retention of the Whyalla shipyards, those shipyards were eventually closed. The Government members came back to Canberra and voted for exactly the opposite of what they told the people of Whyalla they would do. The people of Whyalla, of course, felt very let down. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that 'decentralisation' is a word that is bandied about but does not have much recognition given to it. I think it is about time that recognition was given to it especially in a highly skilled area on which this country will greatly depend if the resources boom that we hear about takes place. If a firm such as this closes, the material, et cetera, will have to come from either Japan or West Germany. I think it is up to the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the State Government, to ensure that this firm stays in operation to provide Australia with very necessary equipment. It is capable of doing so. It has the skill. Its product is up to overseas standards. I am sure that if the governments can give the industry some assistance it will not be lost to Whyalla and those hundred employees at Whyalla will not lose their jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday I had the opportunity to open a course at the Wollongong Technical College involving a training scheme for 10 unemployed young women who had been out of work for at least four months. They began a training scheme arranged by a section of the Wollongong Chamber of Manufactures representing the textile industry. People from this section of private enterprise had got together and requested the Government to participate in a scheme which would involve the training of these young people so that they would be able to play a full role in the work force. They also guaranteed jobs to the 10 young women involved on the successful completion of their course at the Wollongong Technical College. The Government provided approximately $3,000 towards this venture, this money being assistance to both the running of the course and the payment of the National Employment and Training Scheme allowances to the participants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the first time that this has been done in New South Wales. I believe that it was also done in South Australia recently. I hope that it will be a precursor of many other schemes in which private enterprise initiates and joins the Federal Government in providing real opportunities for unemployed people to participate fully in the work force. What cheered me up was the fact that the Federal Government responded in such a positive way to this request by private enterprise. I was glad to assist in the decision, by this Government, to provide this funding. I hope this kind of scheme will be part of the present funding arrangements that the Federal Government has introduced. As the House knows, this funding applies to both the secondary school system and the technical college system in the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, in New South Wales in particular, and I believe in other States as well, the State governments have failed to participate in the transition training program. Certainly, in my electorate at least one high school in an area with a high level of unemployment advises me that its school to work transition program has been diminished this year despite the fact that Federal Government has increased the amount of money available for the school to work transition program. There has been no diminution whatsoever in the amount of real funding that the New South Wales Government is getting. Yet, as I understand it, the Dapto High School in my electorate-certainly an area which needs a great deal of assistance-is being required to cut back on its transition course funding. Nonetheless, it will be able to maintain some kind of course this year. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me very unfortunate that the State governments have not accepted the invitation of the Federal Government to participate in this magnificent program, which I believe is doing the right thing to provide job opportunities for many young people who, frankly, have been wrongly directed in their school activities. It is not simply a question of trying to pass the blame to somewhere else. This Government is trying to do something positive to create a better situation for young people who cannot otherwise get jobs because they are not trained or prepared for full participation in the work force. That is why I was so glad to take part in a course which demonstrated that if young people do have the work skills there are jobs available for them from the employers in the area. As the employers themselves indicated, there is a lack of skilled young people. What the Government has done in this case, and what I hope it will do in many other cases, has been to get together with private enterprise and assist in the training of young people so that they can become useful members of the work force. I congratulate the textile manufacturers of the Wollongong region for their initiative. I certainly congratulate the Government for participating in this most worthwhile course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; This evening I wish to draw to the attention of the House a problem that a number of my constituents will come up against later this year when they receive a tax bill from the Government. Many pensioners in my electorate, and indeed in Australia as a whole, will receive a Taxation Office bill this year which they will be unable to pay. They will have to ask the Commissioner of Taxation for time to pay. They will experience great personal problems in arranging to pay the money that they owe to the Australian Government. These people have taken the advice of the Department of Social Security in that they have been told that their pension benefits or pension fringe benefits will not be affected if they receive an income of up to $20 per week. These people believe that the Department of Social Security is the arbiter of most of the Government's policies in respect of matters relating to the pension. However, what those people do not realise and what some people in my electorate are coming to me about now is the fact that if they earn the $20 a week that the Department of Social Security says they can earn, at the end of this taxation year they will have to pay income tax on a proportion of that money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to give the Parliament two examples of people in entirely different circumstances being caught in the Government's draconian tax net. A single pensioner receives $3,304 per annum. If this person earns the $20 a week that the Department of Social Security says he is allowed to earn, his total remuneration will be $4,344 per annum. The tax threshold in this country is $4,041 per annum. This means that this pensioner will have to pay tax on the final $303 of his income. As a result he will receive a tax bill of $96.96 in June this year. </PARA>
<PARA> A person who has money invested in a fixed deposit, a bank or some other institution that returns him an income of $20 per week will have to pay provisional tax. The Government's tax threshold for provisional tax as introduced in the last Budget is $1,000. So this person will have to pay provisional tax on his income earned over $1,000. A person who receives a return on his investment of $20 a week will have to pay tax of $99.96 this financial year. That is because the Department of Social Security is not advising people who are receiving pensions that they will be liable to pay income tax. For a government that has said on many occasions that it wants to encourage initiative and the people who are recipients of social security benefits to do something for themselves, it is very much mitigating against those people. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in recent days talk about the ways that those people on extremely high incomes will profit from some changes that the Government intends to make to the taxation laws. I think it is very pertinent that we should highlight in this Parliament the problem faced by people who are on the lowest levels of incomes in this country, the pensioners, who will be taxed this year by the Fraser Government. Where those people will find the $100 that they will have to pay at the end of this year I do not know. Those people do not know either. I think the Government should bring in retrospective legislation in this session of the Parliament to increase the non-taxable threshold for income tax purposes to $4,344 per annum so that those people are not put into that situation by the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I wish to say that I have written to the Treasurer on this matter on two occasions in recent weeks. I have not even received the courtesy of a reply. I might say that it is probably the attitude that the Treasurer and the Government have for the pensioners of this country who are the people who made this country what it is. The resources boom which the Government reckons we are all going to get rich from was brought about because of the hard work of those people in their working lives. I commend to the Government retrospective legislation in this session of the Parliament to raise the taxation threshold so that the people who receive pensions in this country and earn the $20 a week that the Department of Social Security says they are allowed to will not be taxed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to raise a matter that has caused a great deal of interest in this country and a great deal of comment. It concerns the celebrated dingo case at Ayers Rock. Firstly let me say that I was delighted to hear of the decision of the coroner. I was appalled at the innuendoes and the smear campaign that was waged against the Chamberlain family in the period leading up to the decision. I was appalled at some very intelligent people-they are friends of mine-who were prepared to believe the very worst about these people and not give them a fair hearing. I am delighted that the decision was given as it was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was camping in the same area a few weeks before that incident occurred, on 30 June. During the last evening we were there I was disturbed by a noise. I thought it was my two sons fighting in the next tent. I stuck my head out and found that a dingo had overturned a huge garbage can. As I stuck my head out the dingo ran away. I was also told by the national parks and wildlife people that the day before they had killed a dingo which had savaged a young boy of about nine years of age; that was the second case in the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> I read the evidence very carefully. In my view it was absolutely impossible for anything to have occurred other than as was stated in the decision of the coroner. I believe is was impossible for any human being to have caused the injury to the child. Because it is difficult to answer the question it is not fair to accuse the Chamberlains of being participants in murdering their own child, which is what people have done. Finally, let me say that I am appalled at the coroner's suggestion that dingoes or animals of any description be destroyed in the parks. I have the greatest sympathy for the tragedy which the Chamberlains have suffered, but surely to God we are not going to commit the absurdity of banning wild animals from national parks. It is a bit like saying that one should go to Amboseli or Serengeti and take out all the lions, elephants and cheetahs. They are the very reason people go there. People have to be careful. </PARA>
<PARA> While we were in the Ayers Rock area the parks people said to us: 'Do not leave anything out. Dingoes are notorious scavengers. They will take cameras, bags and very large objects'. They warned us to pack everything away in our tent and bags so that the dingoes could not get at them. I think the coroner's suggestion is patently absurd. People must protect themselves and look after themselves when they go into national parks. Surely people go into the national parks to see the wildlife, flora and fauna, and what Australia has to offer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) During my discussions with Mrs Darling in my office on 27 November 1980, I stated that ultimately protection of the canal banks of the floodway at Brisbane Airport will be provided by the careful placement of mangroves, and the use of rock walls if appropriate. I also indicated that the Department of Housing and Construction would be examining whether there was a need for additional bank protection works to be carried out before the mangroves became established, and whether there were any other measures which should be taken to allay the concern being expressed by some local residents, particularly in regard to the narrow neck of land between the canal and Nudgee Creek.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I instructed the Department to carry out such stone pitching work as it considered necessary in the vicinity of the critical narrow section of road between the canal and Beach Road. The extent and nature of these protective works was determined by the Department (Mr H. C. Williams, in particular). Construction of a length of approximately 100 metres of stone pitching, together with paving of the edge of the road to join the stone work was commenced on 15 December 1980 and completed on 24 December 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that this work has proved to be most effective particularly during the recent cyclone-storm of 14-15 February 1981. The critical section of the banks was again looked at by Mr Williams on 23 February 1981. The Department will be further extending the rock protective work upstream by a length of approximately 50 metres to provide added bank stability. It is expected such work will commence in about the next two weeks.</PARA>
<PARA> I have also instructed the Department to constantly monitor bank erosion and this is being done with the aid of an advisory panel of expert engineers.</PARA>
