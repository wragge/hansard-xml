                        <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave- The</inline> honorable gentleman was good enough to inform me this morning that he proposed to ask me a question on this matter. I am becoming rather tired of the flood of propaganda which is beginning to assume the shape of an organized campaign to discredit the whole of the Government##'##s publicity service. In this House only a fortnight ago, I explained the position at some length. I then admitted that our service in Britain up to the present had not been adequate, but added that steps had been taken to establish in London a bureau to function on similar lines to the bureau that is functioning in the United States of America. The formation of that bureau is now in progress. But even with our limited resources in London, there has been a continuous flow on to the cinema screens of Britain and into the news and photographic columns of the British newspapers and magazines, of material from the whole of the SouthWest Pacific battle-fronts, stressing the part being  played by the Australian forces. Our reports from London show that week by week the space commanded in the British newspapers by activities in this war theatre far exceeds the space devoted to any of the other Domini oils. I shall quote a few typical cases from our weekly reports. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In three weeks in December, 1943, news from this theatre in the leading British newspapers aggregated 21 columns, 26J columns and 37 columns, compared with Canada 8##£## columns, 3$ columns, <inline font-style="italic">5$</inline> columns; New Zealand, nil, 3i columns, 1 column; and South Africa 2$ columns, 2 columns and 10##£## columns. </para>
                    <para>Since the beginning of this year, our reports from London have shown that an increasing amount of space is being given to Australian affairs in the same newspapers, rising from 42 columns in the week ended the 12th January, 1944. to 464 columns in the following week, and to 81 columns in the week ended the 27th January, 1944. </para>
                    <para>On the basis of these figures, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand might claim that they .have a more legitimate ground for complaint than we have. But C point out to honorable members that, just as we are in an active war theatre in relation to the other Dominions, so the$ war theatre is in competition in the world##'##s press with every other theatre of war, including the mammoth Russian theatre and the greatest news story in history - the impending second front##"##, and honorable members must not forget that the big bulk of the American forces, virtually the whole of the Canadian forces, and the largest proportion of the British forces^ are being concentrated at the moment for the second front offensive. Therefore, when this country is given SI columns of space in one week in newspapers that are severely rationed in regard to newsprint, with the small, inadequate service that we have bad in London, every honorable member must agree that we have not been sitting down on the job. Our London office maintains the closest association with the British Ministry of Information. As a result of this liaison work, the British Ministry is at the moment producing, in co-operation with Australia House and with the Australian Department of Air, a special film, for exhibition in Britain and elsewhere throughout the Allied world, dealing specifically with the heroic part that the Royal Australian Air Force is playing in the battle of Europe. In Australia, our department reciprocates by distributing British Ministry of Information photographs, newsreel, and other material. But the very newspapers which complain about our failure to impress the British press leave themselves open to the same charge from Britain, by the very poor response which they give to the joint efforts of ourselves and. the British Ministry to obtain proper publicity in this country for the theatres of war in which British forces are engaged. </para>
                    <para>I assure honorable members that, within the limits of. the funds that have been available, my department, both in America and in Britain, has done a remarkable job in competition with the propaganda units of over twenty different countries using much larger establishments, and expending thousands of pounds where we expend hundreds. Last year my department had a survey of the work of the Few York bureau compiled for the information of the Government. I intend to table that compilation in the Parliamentary Library. Honorable members, if they are interested, may see for themselves the nature and extent of the carefully planned work that is being carried out; but I should like them to bear in mind that any references to the domestic affairs of organizations with which the bureau has dealings are confidential. This review covers the work of the bureau in its exploitation of all publicity media - press, magazines, the issue of literature, radio material, the circulation of film material, the re-circulation of short-wave news broadcasts from Australia, the sponsoring of lectures, and the supplying of lecture material. The New York bureau is the only registered agency in the United States of America which is regularly supplying current factual material to educational bodies. It takes Australia into American schools, universities, debating societies and study circles. I do not intend to give figures relating to every phase of the bureau##'##s work, but I invite honorable members to go through the document which 1 am tabling, remembering that it is now twelve months old, and that most of the services have been expanded, and many new ones have been developed. </para>
                    <para>The standard of newsreel material sent by this department, from operational areas in the South-west Pacific has been recognized in both America and Britain as among the best which has come out of the war. It has received the widest publicity through the theatre audiences of Britain, America, Canada and New Zealand. These newsreel sequences have been fed also into India, South Africa and Russia. Any publicity organization operating in the United States must be registered with the Department of Justice, and must submit quarterly returns covering every one of its activities. These reports, being open to inspection by the Department of Justice, can be regarded as authentic. </para>
                    <para>Quoting from the report for the quarter ended the 31st December, 1943, made by the New York bureau, I shall give members a few facts concerning its activities. In addition to a number of pamphlets and booklets which arc in continuous circulation by the bureau, its monthly bulletin, which is named <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> and is made available only on request, has increased to a circulation of 12,000 per month. Fact .bulletins, covering activities of Australian women in the war, have been distributed to 1,000 women commentators. Circulation of a weekly mat and clip sheet to 450 American newspapers has been . continued. Seventy special news releases, based on recordings of short-wave broadcasts from Australia, have been distributed to special publications. Apart from routine servicing, research and inquiries, the radio activities of the bureau included participation in 156 separate American broadcasts. These included 129 sessions on the three largest American networks. In addition, members of the bureau staff either took part in, or otherwise assisted in, the compilation of seven feature radio programmes, and circulated to 125 radio stations each week a transcribed commentary entitled ##"## This Week in Australia ##"##. In addition to these transcriptions, copies of the printed script were circulated to an additional 250 stations. </para>
                    <para>In this morning##'##s newspapers honorable members will have noticed that a volume on the war effort of Australia, which has just been, published with a first print of 50,000, has practically been sold out in London. A similar volume was recently produced in the United States, of America where 50,000 copies were circulated widely among the most influential and opinion-forming sections of the community. </para>
                    <para>I am tired of the nagging of ill informed critics, who after spending five minutes in America send back, or bring back to this country, derogatory stories of the kind that we have seen in the press in recent weeks. No Australian visitor who has been to America and has taken the trouble to examine the work of the New York bureau has ever returned with anything hut the highest praise for its achievements. It must not be forgotten that to Americans, the activities of their own forces are naturally of paramount interest and importance. For example, a recent issue of a leading American pictorial magazine contained a relief map of the New Guinea theatre showing American flags firmly planted over Lae, Salamaua and Finschhafen, the implication being that these Japanese strongholds had fallen to American troops and American troops alone. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> very important part of the work of the bureau is tracking clown such misapprehensions, and endeavouring to secure  correction  of misstatements, which are due mainly to the natural enthusiasm of American correspondents, as of Australian correspondents, to make the publicizing of their own forces their first and immediate concern. </para>
                    <para>Over the same period, nineteen Australian newsreel sequences were distributed to newsreel companies and wenmade available to United States Army and Navy services, for showing in serviceestablishments. The bureau also continued the lending of Australian films t,&lt;##&gt;## educational army, trade union and other organizations seeking them. Under this heading 344 separate films were distributed during the three months to 159 separate borrowers. As these films are distributed only on request, it can be assumed that they reach the audiences for which they are intended. </para>
                    <para>The bureau##'##s participation in lecture activities falls into two sections, those directly promoted by the bureau and those for which material is made available. During the three months under review, thirteen separate lectures were directly sponsored and arranged by the bureau, and special material was prepared for many others. During the same period the bureau arranged several press conferences, one being for the members of the British Press Delegation on their way back from Australia to Britain. </para>
                    <para>In the same period, seven separate pictorial and other exhibitions were arranged, as far apart as Los Angeles in California, Boston in the east and St. Louis in the south. </para>
                    <para>Finally, without going into the huge volume of inquiries answered and the assistance given to people engaged in various forms of publicity in the United States, the bureau distributed 2,270 separate pictures of Australian troops in action during the three months. Of this number 837 went to press and photo agencies, 577 to newspapers and publishers, and 856 to other journals. </para>

                            <para>- They were distributed in the United States of America, and it was no fault of the bureau if the newspapers failed to publish the matter supplied to them. We cannot control newspapers in the United States of America or in Great Britain, any more than we control the newspapers here. Even in Australia, we supply five times as much material to the newspapers as they use. If they do not use the matter which the department supplies to them, the complaints of honorable members should be made to the newspaper editors. Theirs is the responsibility for denying to the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> and others the right to see published those photographs of operations in New Guinea which they think they ought to see. I think I have gone into enough detail to give members  some idea of the nature, the scope and the effectiveness of the work being carried out by the very compact and efficient organization which is maintained in New York, and I can assure them that, within a few months, activities of a similar nature and similar extent will be producing equally good results in Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- The Victorian Government has had the same opportunity to establish machinery pools as have the other State governments. I suggest that Mr. Martin, instead of indulging in carping criticism, should co-operate with the Commonwealth Government as has the Government of New South Wales, which, as an earnest of its sincerity, has made available to primary producers ##£##100,000 free of interest for the creation of machinery pools. There is no reason why the Government of Victoria should not have done the same. I cannot say whether the attitude of Mr. Martin is defeatist, but I know that the officials of his department have co-operated in every possible way with the Commonwealth in order to increase the production of food. Sometimes, when I read the criticisms directed by Mr. Martin against Commonwealth administration, I wonder whether he is in earnest, or whether he really controls his own department, because, as I have said, the officials of the Victorian Department of Agriculture are doing a 100 per cent, job, and the people of Australia appreciate the fact. </para>

                        <para>- A long while ago, I asked the Attorney-General a question  regarding the prices charged by proprietors for certain flats and boarding-houses, and I asked him what action he proposed to take, in conjunction with the Prices Commissioner, to control rents and tariffs. So far, the only reply I have received was to the effect that the Attorney-General was conferring with the Minister for Trade and Customs. In view of the fact that the unfortunate occupants of these places are having the important amenities of life taken from them, and that legal action is pending in some cases, I should like to know whether the Attorney-General intends to wait until they are deprived of all their rights before he takes any action? </para>

                        <para>- I said in answer to a previous question by the honorable member that I would bring the matter to the notice of the responsible Minister, the Minister for Trade and Customs, but, unfortunately, he was absent last week through illness. It is now proposed to niter the regulations so as to give the Treasurer power to deal with the matter at the most important point, that is, at the point of sale. When these businesses are turned over, the new proprietors increase the charges to the occupants. I can assure the honorable member that there has been no delay in this matter, and that investigations have been made. The Prices Commissioner has reported, and action will be taken within the next clay or two. </para>

As to whether the pound sign or dollar sign should be applied  to lend-lease or reciprocal aid between the United Nations, it is generally understood that those signs  are applied only in order to give some idea of the volume of goods supplied. </para>

                            <para>- They do not give a completely correct view of the exchange value of articles, but I think it is understood that both the United States and Australia agree, subject to physical limitations, to assist each other as far as they possibly can. That is the policy of Australia. This country has tried to give and has given to the United States of America in goods and services all that it is physically capable of giving, having regard to demands from other quarters and the labour and materials available. I repeat that pound and dollar signs after nil are only used within each country to give to that country an indication of the volume of the goods supplied. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - .On Friday, the 10th March, the honorable member for Deakin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchinson)</inline> read a telegram which he had received from the general secretary of the Commercial Motor Users Association of Victoria concerning action taken by the Government affecting the operations of certain road transport services in Victoria. In reply to the honorable member. I now inform him that under##'## a Cabinet decision made in January, 1942, if commercial motor vehicles had producer-gas units installed, they were permitted, under certain circumstances, to continue to operate in a manner which otherwise would have been regarded as nonessential. In all States excepting Victoria, non-essential operations which continued for a time in this way do not now remain. The vehicles themselves, or the producer-gas units with which they were fitted, have worn out or the vehicles have been diverted to essential work. In Victoria, where conditions are somewhat different, there still remain a few vehicles engaged in non-essential long-distance road transport on routes where railway services exist. Owing to the serious rubber shortage and the extreme difficulty in providing tyre replacements for essential motor vehicles, it is imperative that steps be taken to rationalize the operations of the few remaining vehicles engaged upon this non-essential long-haul work. They will be required to confine their operations within the limits imposed upon all other vehicles, unless permits are granted by the Victorian Directorate of Emergency Road Transport for particular operations beyond the limits generally imposed. The Director of Road Transport has already informed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> A. Pullman that the operators concerned should, if they desire to continue their present activities, immediately make application to the Victorian Directorate of Emergency Road Transport and that each application will be considered on its merits. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Maintenance of these uncontrolled isolated operations to particular areas is, however, inequitable and representations have been made from time to time concerning the anomalies and inequities which thus arise. The vehicles concerned will therefore be confined within the limits which apply generally throughout Victoria unless, more extended use is justified in any particular case to carry some special traffic which cannot otherwise be moved. Any restriction of railway service arising from coal shortage is met by a system of priorities within the railway systems themselves. The limited tonnages carried by the few road services concerned herein would hardly be noticeable if diverted to rail. If road transport were to be used to relieve rail transport, this would be done under a properly controlled plan providing maximum advantage over the widest possible area. Actually, however, owing to tyre shortage alone, road transport could not possibly be maintained at present to any extent in long-distance operations. All existing road transport facilities must he conserved for essential short-haul collection and delivery operations. </para>
                    <para>Since the matter was first brought to my notice, I have received numerous similar wires and have had representations made to me by various member?. In order to prevent any confusion, I have arranged for provisional permits to bo issued to the operators of the services affected pending a survey in each case and prior to a decision being given. </para>

                        <para>- The vice-president of the Northern Miners Federation, Mr. McBlane,  is reported in the press as having said that the end always justified the means and that if strike action was warranted at any time, he would advocate it and put it into effect. Did the Prime Minister see that statement? If so, what action does lie intend to take against this man who, by his words and advice, is inciting the miners to break the law by a form of direct action, which may be construed as an attempt to sabotage the war effort? </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen the statement, but if such words were used they are an incitement to unrest. How far the statement is a violation of the law is not for me to decide. I am happy to assure the honorable gentleman that the prediction which I made last week of increased production of coal without any change of the personnel of the Government is being borne out. </para>

Has the Government any other plan to alleviate the present shortage? </para>

                            <para>- The Government is well aware of the shortage of houses and very much regrets it, but the materials and labour requisite for an extensive building programme are at present required for the purposes of the war against Japan. To the extent that materials and labour can be made available for house-building without impairing the vigour of our war effort, they will be made available, for the Government is most anxious to provide adequate housing for the people; but we must frankly face the fact that a deficiency of housing was manifest in this country before the war began, and it has become aggravated by war conditions. </para>

The honorable gentleman knows very well that the coal shortage has contributed to the timber shortage. The honorable member##'##s lack of a breadth of outlook is also a contributing factor to our difficulties. </para>

                        <para>- Although some purchasers of war service homes now owe more money to the commission than the original purchase price of the dwellings, the honorable member must bear in mine! that for seven or eight years during the depression many of them did not pay one penny to the commission. Some are now making repayments of 17s. 6d. a week, and are sub-letting their dwellings for ##£##2 10s. a week. My only regret is that the Commonwealth has not got 80,000 instead of 8,000 of these dwellings in New South Wales. My department has done everything possible for returned soldiers, and is most anxious to assist them to own their own homes. </para>

If he means changes of the situation as it relates to the conduct of the war with Japan, I inform him that steps which have been taken throughout Australia recently were based on waging the war as far as we can direct  the  offensive and at the same time, meet any offensive that the enemy may seek to launch. What has taken place in Western Australia or elsewhere recently is perfectly explicable to those who know the justification for it. </para>

It is regrettable that the Prime Minister no longer holds the views which he enunciated in this chamber in 1940 concerning sittings of the Parliament. At that time he was of the opinion that the Parliament should meet for at least one week in each month. As things are now, private members of the House have very limited opportunities to bring to the notice of the Ministry business which they consider to be of very great importance. Honorable members on this side of the House art finding it increasingly difficult to speak on <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> floor of the House on matters ##"##which are of moment to their constituents. Apparently supporters of the Government have no say in such matters. It has been suggested that the Parliament will adjourn indefinitely on Friday of next week. If that should happen there will have been only one sitting day during a six weeks##'## period on which private members have been enabled to bring forward matters of consequence to their constituents. With the extension of the practice of government by regulation, of which we all are so well aware, a greater necessity has arisen than ever before existed for the private members of this Parliament to act as watch-dogs for the community. I can see no justification for this motion, but although I do not intend to call for a division on it, I am obliged to say that the patience of honorable gentlemen on this side of the House is wearing very thin. The proceedings in this chamber in the last five weeks have not suggested that the Government has any important or urgent business to submit to the House, for the pace at which business has been transacted has been such as would warrant a snail being charged with breaking the speed limit. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1330</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KZR</name.id><electorate>Balaclava</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">WHITE, Thomas</name><name role="display">Mr WHITE</name></talker><para>.-I object to private members##'## business being pushed aside in this way.

The honorable gentleman ##"##passed the buck##"## to his departmental head, and in two or three answers later gave no satisfaction. The Parliament is to rise, although it should be dealing with such matters as that of young men in the departments and many others being prevented from playing a citizen##'##s part in the war. because the Minister will not put his foot down and do the right thing.

We could understand the action of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> if he were consistent in his approach to matters affecting the rights of private members; but he is not. When he led the Opposition, he and those who supported him were continuously laying a barrage against the Government, stressing the need for additional sittings in order that honorable members might have greater facilities, for the statement of their case, and the opportunity to criticize the Administration. Indeed, he said that that was one reason why he would not participate in the formation of a national government - because he considered that it was the right of a live, virile Opposition to criticize the Government##'##s attitude towards works that were considered necessary for the successful prosecution of the war. Now that he occupies an exalted seat, his attitude is entirely different. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> has faised in this House time after time, on the motion of the adjournment of the House, as well as by means of questions to the Minister concerned, a matter of great, importance, of which I have some knowledge, and in respect of which rumours are circulating which are not very savoury. Numerous individuals, and possibly some members of the Government, may not wish to have their attitude in relation to it exposed. I know that the contractor in question has been carting certain material to the Bankstown aerodrome. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1331</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>009FQ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CURTIN, John</name><name role="display">Mr Curtin</name></talker><para>-  The honorable gentleman does not believe that Ministers have something which they wish to hide in relation to a matter of that sort. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1331</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KNX</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HARRISON, Eric</name><name role="display">Mr HARRISON</name></talker><para>- I am pointing out- </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1331</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>L08</name.id><electorate>DALLEY, NEW SOUTH WALES</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">ROSEVEAR, John</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER (Hon J S Rosevear</name></talker><para>- Order !

If the Government wishes to rush into recess in order to stifle criticism, honorable members of the Opposition must take every advantage of the forms of the House with a view to full publicity being given to the opinions which they hold. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1332</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>009MC</name.id><electorate>Fawkner</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLT, Harold</name><name role="display">Mr HOLT</name></talker><para>.- The House is entitled to have a reasonable explanation from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> as to why the course proposed has suddenly become necessary. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1332</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K0E</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">GAHA, John</name><name role="display">Dr Gaha</name></talker><para>-  The explanation is that only one bill has been passed in six weeks. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1332</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>009MC</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLT, Harold</name><name role="display">Mr HOLT</name></talker><para>- It is not an exaggeration to say that there is a great deal of disquiet outside this House at what is taking place in Commonwealth departments, and at the failure particularly of those honorable members who support the Government to ventilate adequately the grievances of those who consider that they are being injured by acts of Government policy. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1332</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>009FQ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CURTIN, John</name><name role="display">Mr Curtin</name></talker><para>-  I am quite sure that the honorable gentleman does not know what he is talking about.

This House is peculiar among the Houses of Parliament in Australia, in that very little provision is made for the transaction in it of private members##'## business. The introduction of bills by private members is a frequent occurrence in most of our State legislatures. In this House, however, the practice has been for private members to have certain privileges .at question time, and occasionally during the course of a sessional period to have a general debate on a supply bill or a discussion of grievances on certain Thursdays. The interests of private members must definitely be protected, particularly at a time when the Government has not only an overwhelming majority in this House, but also a majority that is so dumb, and so docile to the crack of the caucus whip, that the electors are unable to have thenviews properly represented. It would be a tragic day for democracy in this country if private members were not prepared, irrespective of the side of the gangway on which they sat, frankly and fearlessly to voice the grievances which their constituents brought before them. Therefore, we require an assurance that this opportunity will be available to us. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1332</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>N76</name.id><electorate>Kooyong</electorate><party /><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MENZIES, Robert</name><name role="display">Mr MENZIES</name></talker><para>. -  I understand that to-morrow is what we call Grievance Day, and that the first business will be a motion - ##"## That <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> do now leave the Chair ##"##.

Then, unlike the practice in some parliaments, where the motion for the adjournment of the House at night must be put without debate, it is the custom here for the motion to be debated for quite a long time, the opportunity being taken by private members to discuss matters of interest to themselves and their constituents. This motion is not a usurpation of the rights of private members. I desire to make that point clear, and also to correct the unfortunate misapprehension that prevails in the minds of many people that private members are somehow suppressed in Parliament. As a matter of fact, the very opposite is the fact. We all have been private members at one time or another, and I have yet to discover a way in which a private member can be kept from doing something that he wishes to do.

                    <para>In 1930 the Commonwealth Employees##'## Compensation Act 1912 covering compensation for injuries received by Commonwealth employees was replaced by comprehensive legislation on more up-to-date lines. In the intervening fourteen years, no amendments have been made to the present act, but all State governments have found it necessary to amend workers##'## compensation legislation. In some directions the basis has been altered, and in several respects the benefits granted have been made more generous than under Commonwealth legislation. Since the beginning of the war, the industrial activity of Commonwealth departments has been considerably enlarged in scope, and the necessity to widen compensation for injury caused by industrial process has become increasingly apparent. Furthermore, benefits, originally measured in the light of the onset of a financial depression, should now be made more generous. This bill therefore contains important variations from the present law, the chief of these being - </para>

The present minimum payment is ##£##400, or three years##'## pay, whichever is larger. The bill varies this provision by increasing three years##'## pay to four years##'## pay. The definition of dependant has been widened. </para>
                    <para>Present-day conditions warrant a review of weekly payments during incapacity. The act provides for two-thirds of the weekly pay with a maximum of ##£##3 10s. a week. Seven shillings and sixpence a week is allowed for each dependent child under fourteen years of age. It is now proposed that the weekly payment to the injured employee be a maximum of ##£##3, with ##£##1 for a wife or a housekeeper dependent on the employee, and 8s. 6d. for each dependent child under sixteen years of age, the total weekly payment not to exceed the employee##'##s pay at the time of the injury. </para>

Where the injury is not permanent and total, an injured employee is entitled, under the act, to receive in total weekly payments not more than ##£##750. With the amplified weekly benefits now proposed to be granted, it is deemed desirable to increase this amount to ##£##1,000, so that the maximum period during which weekly payments continue shall not be reduced. </para>
                    <para>An important benefit granted by State legislation in recent years is compensation for injury sustained between the employee##'##s place of abode and the place of employment and between either of those places and any trade, technical or other training school which he is required by the terms of his employment to attend, provided that the injury is not due to his own default or wilful act. The bill makes a similar provision for Commonwealth employees. </para>
                    <para>The second schedule covering industrial diseases is being replaced by a new schedule which, on the advice of the Director-General of Health and the Munitions Health Advisory Committee, improves the classification of diseases, widens the description of certain diseases, and includes additional diseases caused by industrial process. Under the actan employeesufferingfromanindustrial  disease can receive compensation only if the disease was caused within twelve months prior to date of incapacity. On the advice of the Director-General of Health, this provision is being amended so that the commissioner under the act may, at his discretion and after full inquiry, extend the period up to fifteen years for two specified diseases where the onslaught is gradual over an extended period of years. </para>

With the assistance of the Department of Health and on the recommendation of the Director-General of Health, a new schedule has been prepared to include a greater number of specific provisions and thereby to eliminate the anomalies.

                        <para>.- I approach this bill with mixed feelings. I realize that, on the one hand, it contains very many things that I wholeheartedly support. On the other hand, there are important omissions which somewhat reduce the value of the other powers that are provided for in this bill. This war has demonstrated two things of great importance to Australia: First, that we can achieve great things when our population is organized for a great purpose and everybody available is employed for that purpose and, secondly, that with our existing population and man-power we could not defend ourselves from invasion without the help of men and man-made munitions from overseas. It is certain that no responsible man will claim that our coast line of 11,000 miles and our territory of 3,000,000 square miles could all be defended by a total lighting force of approximately 750,000. That is the utmost which a country with the present population of Australia could equip and supply. All must recognize that by ourselves alone, with only 70 fighting men to each mile of coast and one to every 4 square miles of area, we should be unable to provide adequately for our defence. We cannot live indefinitely on whatever laurels we may have gained from this war, and hard facts must guide our postwar policy. We must develop population rapidly. Australians will never be content to let the other fellow do the fighting and to depend on the goodwill of kinsmen overseas and the United States of America. We must learn to stand on our own feet. We may hope that there will never be another war in the Pacific, but we cannot safely live on hope, and, if there is another war and we have to face it with 70 m.en to each mile of coast and one trained fighting man to every 4 square miles of territory, that war may well be our last. Let us resolve, therefore, that Australia shall live and that we here and now must enunciate a policy that will enable Australia to live. </para>

                    <para>Without immigration, greater family life and the natural increase of population, Australia will be weaker in manpower 30##'## years hence than it is to-day. The war has brought home to us vividly the suddenness of the fate that can befall ;i nation not able to defend itself. We may hope for a better post-war world in which the strong will protect the weak against a powerful aggressor, but we cannot live on hope, and we should not rely for our protection upon the goodwill of others. As soon  a3  circumstances permit, we must restore our declining families by ensuring social security to our people. In  addition, we must make possible a continuous flow of immigrants. This policy has been advocated on frequent occasions, but very little has been done to achieve practical results. Now is the time for us to formulate a plan of action. This must be no paper plan, and we must act quickly. We have been given a breathingspace, not by our own exertions alone, but partly as the result of the efforts of powerful friends who have come to our aid. This must be the objective of our policy and our action, transcending all else in urgency and importance. This action must be taken so that Australia shall live in security and our children shall remain a free people. Nothing is more important than that. </para>
                    <para>Any alteration of the Constitution##'## to provide the Government with wider powers should embrace certain objectives which I shall mention. One goal ought to be to double our present population within twenty years, and to double it again as rapidly as possible. Many authorities contend that a population of 30,000,000 is the maximum that this country can carry. Some critics will declare that my idea is to attempt too much, too quickly. Others will say that it does not go far enough. Actually, it is the utmost that can be achieved under present conditions and in the light of experience. With 30,000,000 people, Australia would have approximately two-thirds of the population of Great Britain, which, it must be remembered, successfully defied invasion across 20 miles of water when the country was virtually unarmed. A population of 30,000,000 could provide nearly 3,000,000 welltrained, well-equipped fighting men to hold our land inviolate for all time. To carry that idea a step farther, we must adopt certain internal measures to provide a sure and adequate livelihood, not only for our present population, but also for larger families and for men, women and children who may be expected to migrate to Australia after the war. Unemployment must be stamped out permanently, because it is a destroyer of individual lives and national security, and the greatest obstacle the task of populating Australia. When unemployment is rife the birth-rate declines and immigration ceases. We even lose population by emigration. Australia##'## can afford neither the loss of population nor unemployment. </para>
                    <para>In the task of populating Australia as a major objective in global post-war strategy we must have the active cooperation of Great Britain and the United States of America. We shall endeavour to have the plain fact recognized that Australia, with 7,000,000 people, under attack, is a liability to the great democracies. A weak Australia is a temptation to aggression and a menace, in itself, to the people of the world. But with a population of 30,000,000 people, Australia can be made impervious to attack, a powerful asset to the democracies, a warning to aggressors, and a bulwark of peace, especially in the Pacific. Australia remains the only large territory that can be populated by an English-speaking, peace-loving democracy of great strength. Strategically, the country is so placed as to serve as the third great corner-stone in the triangle of peace-loving democracies. If conditions were to continue as they have for the last fifteen years, the population of Australia would never reach 8,000,000, and before this generation passed there would be fewer virile people - those between 20 and 50 years of age - than there are to-day. Australia would grow steadily weaker in manpower, and would be subject to recurrent depressions that harass the people and retard progress. Although that is a bleak prospect, it is a danger only if we refuse properly to face it. Under attack wc may expect assistance from overseas, but we must depend upon our own efforts. If we obtain externa! aid, so much the better ! If we do not, we must still endeavour to carve out our own destiny in the Pacific. That will require all the courage and resolution that have made our fighting men so respected as they are. We shall not  experience easy times, and the measure of our difficulties will be the magnitude of our opportunities. No plan of action will be easy; but sourplan of action will be safer for the-, country than continued inaction. It gives up scope to build the kind of new orde: that so many people very earnestly, if somewhat vaguely, desire. </para>
                    <para>Let us be clear regarding principles. First, Australia must have more population, both native-born and immigrants. Secondly, to retain that population Australia must have abundant work and social security for a larger population. Thirdly, continuous full-time employment must be assured, because under no other conditions will our population increase in these times. Fourthly, to maintain continuous full-time employment, we must have a broad policy based always on certain consistent principles. This policy must be financial as well as political. It, must provide abundant money for investment at low rates of interest. Monetary policy must be guided by the self-evident truth that the expansion of industry, the provision of homes, the development of work places, the construction of transport, the opening up of land, the building of harbours, dams and waterworks, and a thousand and one other amenities of life all cost money. In our position, what is true of war is true also of peace. Wo must pay the price of security, and the price is likely to be high. If our population is to be doubled in twenty years, then, in some directions, we must invest nearly as much within those two decades as we have invested in the whole of the pre-  ceding 155 years of our history. That implies that vast sums of money will have to be expended. Despite loose talk about public debts, and the total ignoring of the assets created by such expenditure, it is true that only a fraction of Australia##'##s development has resulted from government expenditure from loan moneys. For better or worse, the settled policy of this country is that governments shall control and operate the public utilities such as transport, irrigation, harbour and water works and the like. But the vast bulk of our agricultural and manufacturing development, of our building construction and vehicle manufacturing, and of our amusement and recreations, has been achieved by private initiative and financed by private capital. That policy, in my view, must continue. It can continue only if our banking system provides abundant money at reasonable rates of interest for investment in sound securities. No better security exists anywhere than can be found in a country with a rapidly growing population. In some respects housing will provide one of the major means of restoring family life, and of maintaining the security of the family. There will be a vast leeway of building arrears to be overtaken in order to provide not only for newcomers to this country, but also for many people already here who have been unable to find homes for themselves. Building construction must be kept flowing strongly and continuously year in and year out in order to meet the urgent and expanding needs of the community. It must never be allowed to languish. To ensure this, abundant money at reasonable interest rates will be essential. In the pre-war years, during which our population was increasing at a very slow rate, an amount of approximately ##£##40,000,000 per annum was being expended in building construction. Yet, as the Prime Minister has reminded us this afternoon, even that expenditure was not sufficient to provide for our needs in respect of homes and buildings generally. Out housing arrears alone will require the expenditure of from ##£##80,000,000 to ##£##90,000,000 per annum; but we shall also require to provide for immigrants. It is safe to say that with a reasonable immigration policy in operation in the post-war years, we shall require to expend not ##£##40,000,000 but ##£##100,000,000 per annum on housing, and- we shall have to maintain that expenditure steadily. We should not engage in short bursts of building activity, with long and devastating periods of. relative idleness in between, but we should maintain construction at a steady rate for at least the next twenty years. Experience in older and more developed countries has shown that property is always a sound investment if interest rates can be kept at a reasonable figure. Instead of having 200,000 men engaged intermittently in building operations, and in the equipment of homes, we should have 400,000 men working continuously in these callings. Housing, therefore, will provide a vast and sound sphere of work with a steady and remunerative rate of pay for very many men in the post-war years. The conditions should be such as will permit the homes to be occupied for about ##£##1  a week. Under these circumstances, family life will be given a much-needed stimulus, and, after all, family life is the foundation of national life. In the past, scarcity of housing has always been a deterrent to child-bearing and childrearing, and has led to the development of slum conditions, and to ill health, real poverty and misery in the community. It has lowered the standard of living and practically ruined the lives of tens of thousands of people. </para>
                    <para>But housing is only one phase of what I may term the fertilizing effect of investment and development, such as a new country like Australia needs. We can add to the expenditure that I have proposed an annual investment of several hundred million pounds each year for the purpose of settling additional people in this country. We have been spending at the rate of approximately ##£##600,000.000 per annum for war purposes. We must spend that amount and more in an endeavour to populate and develop this country in the days ahead of us. Admittedly, most of our war-time expenditure is unproductive and will place on the community a dead-weight debt which will have to be liquidated from future taxation ; but most of the expenditure which I have been advocating for developmental purposes will be productive and will provide its own sinking fund, for it will lead to an expansion of the national income. The more we can expand the national income and the population of the country, the more we shall decrease the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> burden of debt. </para>
                    <para>I do not propose that the Government shall be the sole investing authority. Governments, of course, will have to put big national works in hand, but in the main private enterprise will need to invest in the other developmental enterprises, such as housing, to which I have referred. The Government will need to ensure that interest rates shall be kept at a reasonably low figure, and that conditions are made favorable, and kept favorable, for sound investment that will result in the expansion of both primary and secondary industries. Both primary and secondary industries must he developed in this country, though not necessarily by the direct action of governments. I have already indicated that the world demand for exports was decreasing before the war. Our primary production had reached saturation point on the home market; but whilst we were securing our relative proportion of the export trade, world trade was decreasing in the years immediately preceding the outbreak of the war, and all countries were facing crumbling markets. Our own secondary industries have been unable to win any considerable volume of export trade, and our production was being limited more and more to the needs of the home market. It may be confidently expected that for a few years after the termination of this war, a strong demand will be made by overseas countries for all that we can produce, but this demand is likely to be more or less temporary. We should use that period of export trading as a breathing space and as an opportunity to apply a national policy which will enable us to hold our ground when the temporary stimulus to the export trade has lapsed, as it surely will lapse. Unless we make good use of the time available to us in these years, another depression will undoubtedly overtake us; we shall find ourselves again in the depths of economic difficulty and it will be extremely hard to restore our industries to profitable production. Immediately peace is in sight, and we can proceed with demobilization, we should begin a planned restoration of our fighting men, munitions workers, and others, to the industries in which they will he required under the populating and developing policy which I am enunciating. There must be no delay, gap, or hiatus. It would be a national tragedy, as well as a personal tragedy to countless thousands, if there were any ##"## pulling of punches ##"## at that period. We must continue to put our money into development, just as we have been putting it into defence. Immediately the war ends, we must make a commencement with immigration, home-building, and developmental works, because housing and amenities generally must at least keep pace with the growth of population. This, of course, will ensure a high demand for labour, the continuance of full employment, and a growing home market for the products of our indus-  tries. By no other means can adequate, sustained markets be ensured; and markets we must have if there is to be a continuance of full employment and an increase of our population. The home market is the best and most dependable, granted we have the will, the wisdom, and the resources with which to provide it. I have already said that such a policy as I have outlined is not easy. Nor is it safe in the orthodox sense. On the contrary, I agree that it is difficult and that, if it be not carefully handled, it can be dangerous. But whether it be difficult or dangerous, it is the only way to ultimate security. In essence, it rests on the self-evident and rather simple proposition that the growth of Australia is in itself a sound investment. ##"##We can create this opportunity if m##'##o have the will to do so, just as we created a great war potential within a very brief period. All that is needed is the will to do it, combined with the skill, judgment and resolution to carry it through. We must end conditions which arc conducive to the circumscription of the growth of Australians by adverse circumstances, either external or internal. If we can obtain external aid, so much the better; if we cannot, then we shall have to proceed with the task alone. Finally, this policy which I have enunciated will depend for its fulfilment upon our own vision, courage, enterprise, and faith in Australia. </para>
                    <para>Those are the directions in which I consider the Constitution of Australia ought to be altered. Under the existing constitutional set-up, with sovereign powers divided between the States and the Commonwealth, it would be difficult indeed for any Commonwealth Government to give full effect to the suggestions which I have made. I had hoped that when the Government brought down this bill to alter the Constitution it would have not only given consideration to certain proposals which had been agreed to at a convention of representatives of the Commonwealth and. the States, but also would have taken a comprehensive view by proposing that there should be submitted to the electors proposals for the granting of power which would give to the Commonwealth real authority to do all the things that are necessary if we are to achieve national progress. I am sorry that certain vital matters have been omitted from the bill. I refer in particular to the lack of provision for some degree of security for the primary industries in the post-war period. Extensive powers are to be sought in respect of employment and unemployment and the organized marketing of commodities, but in respect of the marketing of primary products, there is a qualification which will negative the whole value of organized marketing. </para>

                            <para>- The bill provides for the organized marketing of commodities. But paragraph vii. states that no law made under this paragraph with respect to primary production shall have effect in a State until approved by the Governor in Council of that State. Primary commodities cannot be divorced from primary production, because production is the whole basis of the prices of primary commodities. If, because of division of authority between the Commonwealth and the States, the production of wheat, rice, or any other primary commodity be unchecked, it will be of no use to control the commodity when it is being marketed and sold for next to nothing. If these powers are to be of any value to the primary producer, primary industry as a whole will have to be controlled from the ploughing of the ground to the marketing of the commodity. No protection is proposed in respect of the great meat industry, which is represented by many honorable members, when the National Security Act lapses twelve months after the termination of the war. At the present time, the stability of the wheat industry is based on several foundations - the limitation of acreage, the licensing of planting, the curtailment of production, and, finally, a guaranteed price. Under the proposed powers in relation to the organized marketing of commodities, the Commonwealth would not be able to take action until after the wheat had been harvested. If 300,000,000 bushels was an economic production, it would not be able to prevent the production of 500,000,000 bushels, and the consequent ruin of those engaged in the industry. At the present time, the National Security Act enables the wheat industry to function under a stable scheme. This##'## legislation will leave the industry after the war exactly as it was before the war; in fact, in a worse position, because it will degenerate to a state of comparative chaos. </para>

                            <para>- It is interesting to hear that interjection from an honorable member who represents a wheat-growing district. He will have some difficulty later in explaining to his electors why he did not take action to have included in this measure some provision for the protection of the wheat-growing industry. The same danger threatens the great dairying industry, which is the principal primary industry in the district which I represent. The present system of marketing control rests upon the National Security Act, and when that act ceases to operate the industry will he left once more to its own devices, unless the States agree to introduce some measure of control. It is only necessary for one State to stand out for the whole system to collapse. I had some experience of these matters when I was administering the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. I presided over more than one meeting of the Agricultural Council, consisting of representatives of all the States, and I learned that complete agreement between the States on matters of this kind was practically impossible. At one meeting the representative from South Australia proposed, in view of the difficulty of marketing Australia##'##s wine surplus, that the planting of wine grapes should be restricted. Although Victoria was but a small producer of wine, the Victorian representative would not agree to the proposal, and because Victoria would not agree, South Australia could not impose restrictions lest Victoria should take advantage of them to increase its own acreage. At the very same meeting of the council, the Victorian representative proposed that the planting of potatoes, of which there was a surplus  at  the time, should be restricted, and! this time it was South Australia which refuse^ to agree. That kind of thing occurs time after time at meetings of the Agricultural Council, and that is why the Commonwealth should have an overriding authority. By this bill all sections are to be benefited in some way, except the primary producers. The Commonwealth is to have power to legislate for ensuring security of employment and control over trusts and combines, but the unfortunate primary producer is to be left exactly where he was before the war. As a matter of fact, he may find himself worse off than he was. Organizations of primary producers are greatly disturbed at the omission from this bill of any provision to protect their interests. Indeed, they are specifically excluded. For instance, paragraph vii states that the Commonwealth shall have power to legislate in respect of - </para>

                            <para>- I agree that it is proposed to leave the primary produce:to be the wood-and-water joey of the community, as he has always been. The entire marketing and stabilization scheme in connexion with the dairying industry is in danger of tumbling to the ground when the National Security Act ceases to operate after the war, and this condition of affairs could be brought about by the withdrawal from the existing arrangement of one large butter factory. Under the powers which it is proposed to obtain the Commonwealth could do very little to prevent this from happening. </para>

It is in fact in a large measure throwing the primary producers to the wolves. </para>
                    <para>I am strongly in favour of proposed new power No. X, which deals with the uniformity of railway gauges, but I would go farther and include a provision to enable the Commonwealth, if it saw fit, to take over completely the control of railways and other forms of transport in Australia. <inline font-style="italic">##[##Extension of time granted.##]##</inline> Country development and decentralization of industry depend more upon the control of transport facilities than upon any other factor. The discriminatory railway freights that exist all over Australia prevent the development of country industries, because there can be no hope of industries being established away from the coast under a system which results in different freight rates operating immediately goods pass a State boundary. If this country is ever to be made secure, one of the cardinal things which, will have to be done is the drawing of our population back from the great cities. Factories must be established far inland, as in Russia. What ultimately saved Russia was the fact that it was not entirely dependent on the Ukraine and industries there. It was able to recover its breath and fighting ability by falling back on war industries established beyond the Urals. In the last couple of years, Australia has learnt the greatest lesson of its history, namely, that had Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane been destroyed or damaged, its war effort would have been substantially reduced. One of the warnings that we ought to take from this war is, therefore, that we must shift our industries as far back from the coast as we can. We can do that only if the Commonwealth has complete control of railway, road and other transport facilities. This bill provides for power in respect of only one feature of transport, namely, the uniformity of railway gauges. Why not submit to the. people a proposal that the Commonwealth be given power to take over the railway systems as a whole? </para>
                    <para>I do not intend to refer in detail to the other proposed powers, because I am in agreement with a great many of them, although my agreement with some of them is qualified.

                            <para>- Since the Government has expressly excluded the production of primary commodities, I should like the Attorney-General to say in his reply which are the commodities whose production the Government proposes to organize. Are they boots and shoes, or women##'##s clothing, or agricultural machinery, or refrigerators? Can the Attorney-General give, us specific information as to what this vital paragraph means? If it does not mean the marketing of primary products, it must mean something else, and if it means something else we want specific information as to what it means and how it may be applied. I am not at all nervous about conferring these proposed powers on the Commonwealth Government, although a great many people are, but I am opposed to a referendum which excludes primary producers from any benefit of increased Commonwealth powers, while conferring on the Commonwealth power to legislate for other sections of the community. It would be farcical to submit a separate referendum on the control of the marketing of primary products with only the primary producers, a very small section of the people, voting in favour of the Commonwealth taking the power. Primary producers have no hope of getting an alteration of the Constitution to enable the Commonwealth Government to control marketing, unless such a proposal i-##°## coupled with others which are favorable to other sections of the community. The Government will have badly let down the growers of all kinds of foodstuffs, unless at the same time as it submits these proposals to the people it gives them an opportunity to vote on improved marketing conditions. </para>

                        and the Government upon having brought down this bill for a referendum to be taken on. an extension of the powers of the Commonwealth. It is most unfortunate that the attitude of the States, as expressed in some legislative councils, has forced the referendum to be proposed as the only alternative to the carrying out of the decision of the Constitution Convention that the States should refer the proposed powers contained in this bill to the Commonwealth Parliament for a period of five years after the end of the war. The people will, however, be glad of the opportunity to vote in favour of the Commonwealth taking these proposed powers which are necessary for post-war reconstruction. On constitutional matters, I prefer to that of the honorable member for Richmond the advice of the Attorney-General, whom I regard as the greatest constitutional authority in the land, and he assures, me, as does his colleague the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully),</inline>
                        that the Government will continue to apply the policy which has resulted in more prosperity and contentment among primary producers than the policy of honorable gentlemen opposite could achieve in a lifetime. We all know that Australia is a primary-producing country and that without stabilized prices for wool, wheat, butter, fruit and other primary products the country cannot prosper. It was the failure of our predecessors in office to provide for the stabilization of primary production that caused thousands of farmers to pick up their swags and walk off their properties. Now the same honorable gentlemen who were responsible by their bad legislation for the slump in the primary industries have the hide to advise us not to pass this  bill.  I can understand members of the United Australia party taking that attitude, because their interests are those of the cities, but I cannot understand members of the Australian Country party, who shed crocodile tears at the plight of the farmers, declaring that the primary producers are  excluded  from this legislation. Before 1 came to this Parliament, I thought that there was a lot of hypocrisy in it, and I am now convinced of that. The  Government  proposes that it shall have power over employment and unemployment. My mind  goes  back a few years to the greatest depression this country has ever suffered, when the pride of our manhood and womanhood was forced to subsist on a dole of about 5s. 6d. a week. That starvation payment is the greatest blot on Australia##'##s history, and those responsible  were  men of the type of honorable gentlemen opposite who oppose this Government having power to control employment and unemployment. Private enterprise thinks only of itself and does not care whether men starve by the roadside, with their wives and families thrown
                        <inline font-style="italic">to</inline>
                        the wolves. These are not suppositions. They have been borne out by experience. Nothing was done for the unemployed. When representations were made to the United Australia party Government to give these unfortunate men an opportunity to earn a Christmas dinner, they declared that no money was available for that purpose. Now they urge the people not to give the Commonwealth##'## Government power to start new industries and employ members of the fighting forces after demobilization. When the United Australia party was in  office,  it had a miserable record of failure. The people now look to the Labour Government to rehabilitate in the post-war era returned servicemen, employees of munitions establishments, and thousands of people directed from  non-essential to  essential jobs. Our soldiers must  be  found employment  in  trades and professions, because -they have succeeded in keeping this land free from the horrors of war. The La,bour party has the interest, ability and sincerity  to reestablish  them  in  industry.
                    </para>
                    <para>I shall not deal with the necessity for decentralization, but I was highly amused when honorable members opposite declared that industries should  be  transferred from the big cities  to  country districts. When they had the opportunity, they  did  not encourage decentralization  or  proceed with the standardization of railway gauges and the electrification of rural areas. When war broke out in 1939, about 250,000 people were unemployed in Australia, and honorable members opposite refused to help them. I had not intended to participate in this debate, but I could not endure in silence their hypocritical utterances. The Labour Government will not abuse these wider powers, if granted. Having saved Australia from the ravages of war, it now requires power to give to the people security and contentment in peace-time. The men who risked their lives to preserve Australia from the enemy, deserve the best possible social conditions that this great land of the Southern Cross can give to them. </para>

Honorable members from all parties, and from all States, have taken part. Several constructive suggestions have been made. I refer particularly to the suggestions made in relation to the exercise of parliamentary control over delegated legislation, and also to the suggestion made by the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> for including an amendment guaranteeing freedom of speech and expression. </para>

                    <para>British countries have tended to rely on Parliament itself to provide by ordinary legislation whatever safeguards in these matters may be necessary. I myself felt for many years that under contemporary conditions, it would be wise to follow the example set by the Constitution of the United States of America, and to give to two at least of the fundamental freedoms of democratic citizenship the special protection of embodiment in the Constitution. The Government included in the draft bill which was submitted to the Constitution Convention a proposal to extend the existing guarantee of religious freedom and a new guarantee of free speech. These, naturally, found no place in the Commonwealth Powers Bill, for they could not be ##"## referred ##"## by a. State to this Parliament. </para>
                    <para>I have circulated three amendments which, on behalf of the Government, I shall move in committee. One relates to delegated legislation, the second to freedom of speech and expression, and the third to freedom of religion. These amendments will incorporate some of the suggestions made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> and by the honorable member for Warringah. T notice that the Leader of the Opposition, in the fourth paragraph of his amendment, expresses concern for ##"## the liberty of citizens ... to exercise their rights as free people##"##. It is with that end in view that the Government propose? to include these guarantees. </para>
                    <para>Of course, some will contend that these freedoms are not endangered. They will certainly not be endangered by this Government. But a time may come when, under a government of Fascist sympathies, the freedoms may be whittled away or even destroyed. Then it would be too late to think of a constitutional amendment. </para>

                            <para>- Extremist government of any kind. There are considerable numbers of observations made by public men in. this country before the war showing too great a receptivity of the idea of Hitlerism and Fascism. There is no harm, and. there is definite positive good, in limiting the opportunity for the repression which under Hitler and Mussolini was first endured, then pitied, and finally almost embraced. I think I can say, from the letters and messages I have received, that a tremendous body of non-partisan leaders of thought in this country, including church leaders of all denominations, welcome the inclusion in the bill of the two freedoms which  President  Roosevelt regarded as basic to the democratic way of life. </para>

                    <para>To these special provisions I shall return later, but in closing the debate I recapitulate the main grounds upon which the Government has rested its case for the bill. I shall then show that the debate has not weakened the Government##'##s case, but has in many respects confirmed and -strengthened it. </para>
                    <para>The essentials of my opening speech can, I think, be stated in four propositions : First, that the existing peace-time powers of the Commonwealth will not <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> adequate to carry out a national plan of post-war reconstruction; secondly, that the list of fourteen powers agreed upon at the Constitution Convention are the minimum necessary for the task; thirdly, that the failure of four States to refer the agreed list of matters leaves the Government no alternative now to seeking the necessary powers by way of referendum; and fourthly, that the Convention list has the advantage of ensuring that in certain vital aspects of postwar reconstruction the States will be associated with the Commonwealth in carrying out the national plan. </para>
                    <para>No member of the House has denied my first proposition - that the Commonwealth needs additional powers for postwar reconstruction. I do not think that any responsible person could deny it. The Leader of the Opposition stated, and, indeed, over-stated, some of the possibilities of the existing powers of the Commonwealth, but he did not dare to affirm positively  that those powers would he adequate for the immediate post-war years. He contented himself, as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> pointed out, with a cautious double negative - that the existing powers of the Commonwealth had ##"##not been shown to be inadequate ##"## for the task of the post-war reconstruction period. On this, I need not remind the House that both the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the honorable member for ##"##Warringah, who both speak with authority on such matters, emphatically disagreed with the Leader of the Opposition. Both thought that in vital respects the existing powers of the Parliament would be inadequate. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that in his speech on this bill, he expressed a much wider view than he has done on other recent occasions on some important Commonwealth powers. The defence power, as the honorable member for Warringah observed, is one of them; the power with respect to interstate trade and commerce is another. In 1938, the right honorable gentleman was at pains to show that trade and comm##'##erce present an essentially unitary problem, which cannot be effectively dealt with by a power divided between the ##'##Commonwealth and the States. </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition has moved an amendment, in order to limit substantially the tasks which the Commonwealth should be permitted to undertake in the post-war years. But even for those restricted tasks he seems to have agreed that the position should be placed beyond doubt by constitutional amendment. That is an important point for honorable members to keep ##'## in mind. Honorable members of the Australian Country party have unanimously affirmed the need for further Commonwealth powers in the post-war years. But the case for the Australian ##'##Country party has not been presented in any uniform manner. Some honorable members of that party appear to think that the powers ##'##being sought are too great, and some of them have said that the powers are insufficient in certain respects. I shall deal in detail with those contentions when the bill is in committee and shall refer particularly to the subject of the marketing of primary products. The debate has disclosed, therefore, that, practical unanimity exists as to the need for additional powers for the Commonwealth. Honorable members opposite, however, have contested the second and third of the propositions on which, as I have said, the Government rests its case. The Leader of the Opposition -and some of his supporters have contended that the list of powers agreed upon at the Convention should be substantially reduced. The Leader of the Australian Country party and some of his supporters have contended that such additional powers as are necessary could be obtained, without a referendum, by further negotiation with the States. </para>
                    <para>Let me deal first with this contention. The Government has no wish to close the door to the possibility of action on the part of the four States whose parliaments have not passed, the Canberra bill into law, to make an effective reference of the agreed list of matters to the Commonwealth. That, however, is a matter not for this Government or for this Parliament, but for the State governments and parliaments concerned. I make it clear that the Parliaments of Western Australia and South Australia have not carried into effect the agreement of its Premiers, and, therefore, the passage of the Commonwealth Powers Bill through the Legislative Council of Tasmania would not, of itself, give to the Commonwealth the agreed list of powers throughout Australia. </para>
                    <para>To those honorable members who regard as a practical solution of this country##'##s present problem a renewed attempt to secure the necessary Commonwealth powers by reference from the States, I would say, to begin with, that they must be well aware that suggestions for a further conference between the Commonwealth and the States have already been discussed as between some State leaders. Apparently they came to nothing. Why? Because there was not sufficient likelihood of a meeting upon common ground. Further, it is quite obvious, in view of what has happened in some of the State parliaments, that some, at least, of the Premiers would not now be in a position to make any undertaking to carry out the terms of the original agreement. No good purpose could be served by a further conference with the State Premiers unless the Government were prepared to whittle down substantially the list of powers which was agreed upon at the Convention. The Government is not prepared to do that. It would be recreant to its trust if it did so. Such action would probably cause chaos in the community in the post-war years. In some States it has also been contended that a five years##'## reference would he invalid. If that should prove to be so, the Commonwealth would have no powers whatever by virtue of the reference. That difficulty would have to be overcome before any good purpose could be served by another conference. That difficulty, moreover, was not raised at the Convention although the legal advisers of the Commonwealth and of the States were present here in force. The contention that the reference of powers for a limited period would be invalid came later, and if, powers having ##'##been referred, that argument should prove to be correct the position of the Commonwealth would be extremely difficult. I suggest, therefore, that to hark back to the reference method at this stage might lead to utter disaster. </para>

                            <para>- I have not said that. I am referring to this point at some length, because of the strong suggestion of the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> that the endeavour to obtain power by reference should be renewed. Since the Convention was held, men of authority and learning in the law have argued that doubt exists concerning the competence of the State legislatures to refer power to the Commonwealth Parliament for a limited period under section 51. It has been said that any reference for a limited period would be invalid. If it were ultimately held by the High Court that a reference of this kind was invalid the whole edifice that we arc seeking to erect to enable us to cope with the post-war period would be destroyed. </para>

It would certainly follow that the Commonwealth Government would not be able to provide, by direct law, for security of employment and it could not, by direct law, prevent mass dismissals. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure that the honorable member for Indi followed the speech of the Leader of the Opposition carefully. The appropriation power of the Commonwealth is still under fire. One of the judges of the High Court considered that it could not be used except for providing money in pursuance of existing Commonwealth power already stated in the Constitution. Other judges said that the matter could not be determined at that stage. In any case, it is, in itself, an utterly unsubstantial foundation for Commonwealth legislation. The Leader of the Opposition gave us his opinion on the subject when he said that he did not consider that the appropriation power could be used at all except for the purpose of providing money to give effect to legislation passed under the existing Commonwealth constitutional powers. That was the view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke. Other judges have left the matter open. Power over ##"## employment and unemployment ##"##, I point out to the honorable member for Indi, is crucial. If this power be not referred  to the Commonwealth, or vested in the Commonwealth by referendum, all the rest of the powers of the Commonwealth will be inadequate. The wage-earners of South Australia would not think it a minor matter that, under the act as passed by the State Legislature, this Parliament would have no power to provide for security of employment for them in their ordinary jobs in the post-war years. </para>

                    <para>Instead of referring to the Commonwealth the general subject of ##"##the production of goods##"##, the legislature of Western Australia referred a much more limited subject - ##"## encouragement of production and of the establishment of new industries ##"##. Members of the Australian Country party have said that they want the primary production power in order to limit production. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable gentleman must see that power in respect of production, as such, would give to the Commonwealth Parliament the authority either to increase or to diminish production, and to pass any necessary law to achieve either purpose. The legislature of Western Australia said : ##"## We will not give the Commonwealth power over production as such; we will limit it to the encouragement of. production and of the establishment of new industries ##"##. The people of Western Australia as distinct from the legislature of that State, will not think it a minor matter that, under the a-ct as thus passed by the State legislature, this Parliament will have no power to prevent the wasteful production of unessential goods in Western Australia, even though vital supplies for housing construction, for example, may be in short supply there. To these matters I shall return later. With an eye to the practical difficulties that are certain to arise in the immediate post-war years, no Commonwealth Government could regard such differences as. insignificant. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>In short, the matters to which I have drawn attention suggest how little practical outcome there is likely to be from further consideration of the Powers Bill by the States, in their present frame of mind, at any rate. I remind the House again that the problem of securing unanimous agreement by the States cannot be solved merely by altering the thriceasserted decision of the Legislative Council in Tasmania to reject the Powers Bill. In view of the nature of the changes made by South Australia, and by Western Australia, the fact that the Victorian act can only be proclaimed if each of the other States has passed substantially the same act constitutes another major difficulty. In this connexion, I refer to the illuminating letter from Governor Denison, quoted by the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Gaha). Sir William</inline> Denison recommended the creation of legislative councils, with special reference to Tasmania, in order to check the development of the essentially democratic spirit which actuates the large mass of the Australian community, and to prevent that spirit from coming into operation. In the handling of the Commonwealth Powers Bill by the States, several of the Legislative Councils have effectively exercised the function##'## for which, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Denison, they were thus created, that of keeping the people in check and keeping down ##"## the democratic spirit##"##. Although the Legislative Council of Tasmania has rejected this bill on three occasions, the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> says, ##"## Go over to Tasmania and have another try ##"##. It is open to the four States which have not acceded to the agreement which their Premiers made at Canberra, to pass the law in the approved form. If they did that, there would be no need for a referendum. The matter does not affect Tasmania alone. Wo have also to consider the complication introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunstan</inline> in Victoria. He provided that the Powers Act should come into force in Victoria only if other States passed it either literally or in substance. He assumed the role of one who should make the last decision. Of course, if every other State had done what the Parliament of Victoria did, the legislation would not be in force in any State. This is an illustration of the difficulty of achieving agreement among the States. As I have clearly illustrated, the references made by South Australia and Western Australia are inadequate in relation to vital points. </para>
                    <para>Nothing that has been said during the debate has weakened the statement I made in my opening speech, that the failure of four States to pass into law the Canberra agreement has created a chaotic position. My further remark, that this Parliament might find itself forced to exercise some of the powers that have been referred to it by the States of Queensland and New South Wales, which have adopted the Canberra formula, has, I think, been misunderstood, particularly by the honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons). She interpreted what, I said as an admission that the Commonwealth could quite well ##"## carry on ##"## in New South Wales and Queensland alone. As a general proposition, that is altogether erroneous. Some of the powers cannot possibly be exercised effectively except on a completely Australia-wide basis. The power to fix prices is an excellent illustration of that. If the price of a commodity were fixed in New South Wales and Queensland alone, chaos would be caused immediately in the other States and the price-fixing scheme would break down. But there are other powers which could possibly be exercised in respect of two or three States only. That is, of course, plainly implied by the very nature of paragraph xxxvii of section 51 of the Constitution, under which a ##"## reference ##"## from a State may be made. The illustration which T gave in my second-reading speech was the power to give security of employment by regulating the right of dismissal. The Leader ##&gt;##f the Opposition stated that he. did not believe the powers would be exercised in respect of two or three States only. In many cases, it would be inconvenient to <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> so, and might cause anomalous results. But circumstances might very well arise in which inaction on the part of this Parliament would be by far the greater, of the two evils. I trust that such a position will never arise. But I assure the right honorable gentleman that what I said in opening is quite sound and is not a purely fanciful suggestion. </para>

                    <para>I appreciate the reason given by the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> and his followers for urging the Government to persevere in its attempt to solve the problem of recon- struction powers by means of a reference from the States. It is clear that success along those lines would make a referendum in war-time unnecessary. The Government sympathizes with the desire to avoid a referendum while hostilities are still in progress, and while the people are still taking the strain of the war effort. Indeed, we have shown in the most practical  fashion our sympathy with that view. But I say frankly to the House that the disadvantages of a war-time referendum may be greatly exaggerated. The holding of elections in this country during the war has not been destructive of the war effort, and the distinction between the holding of an election and the holding of a referendum is not substantial. There are, moreover, some real advantages in calling upon the people to think concretely, realistically and responsibly, at the present stage of the war, about the essentials of. post-war reconstruction. The servicemen are the electors most affected, and provision will be made for them to vote. I venture to forecast that they will vote in overwhelming strength in favour of the bill. </para>

                            <para>- That is merely to say that they will not hear what does not exist. The suggestion that the issues are too grave and complex to be satisfactorily decided by the people under war conditions can, I think, be dismissed. The Government##'##s decision ##'##to seek the new powers for only a limited period has deprived that argument of any force it might otherwise have had. The Government is not asking the people to make up their minds now, once and for all, on the question of whether or not the Commonwealth should permanently be entrusted with authority over the important new matters specified in the bill. The issue is the very much simpler one - whether, to meet the difficulties of the immediate post-war period, a temporary enlargement of the normal peace-time powers of the Commonwealth should be made. I have already conveyed to the House the Government##'##s intention to call, before the end .of the five-year period, a convention to revise the Constitution as a whole. Accordingly, the Government proposes to limit to the five-year period even the constitutional guarantees which it proposes to insert in tie bill. Nothing but an interim decision, therefore, is required from the electors. I put to the House that this reduces to very small compass the objections which some honorable members have expressed to the holding of a referendum during the war. </para>

                    <para>A good deal has been said during the debate about the possibilities inherent in a Constitution convention. I make bold to say that there is a certain amount of humbug about this. The House will not suspect me of holding an unduly low opinion of the advantages of such a gathering. After all, this Government summoned the first Constitution Convention that had assembled since federation. It must not be forgotten, however, that the normal convention, under our own Constitution, is the Parliament of the Commonwealth itself. This is the only body which can initiate alterations of the Constitution. The position is quite different under the Constitution of the United States of America, which does expressly contemplate the possibility of amendment by way of conventions. As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said, a representative Constitution convention, however elected or appointed, is likely to have as its central element the political leaders of Australia for the time being. How would such a convention be elected? Presumably, there would be 74 divisions from which representatives would be drawn. Considering the display of constitutional, legal and political knowledge during the course of this debate, I cannot believe that any honorable member of this House would consider himself disqualified from election to such a convention. Presumably, therefore, most of the present members of this House would be elected, and then we would get back to what we have now.  a parliament. </para>
                    <para>Practical men must deal with situations as they find them. I invite the House once again, as I invited it in my third proposition in opening the debate, to accept the fact that, for all practical purposes, there is no present alternative to proceeding with a referendum. The desire to avoid a referendum may easily become simply an escape into unreality. Honorable members may seek to avoid, by that route, the disagreeable necessity of making up their minds whether or not the powers contained in the Canberra list are necessary for the tasks of post-war reconstruction. In this regard, I commend to the House the example of the right honorable member for North Sydney - the Nestor of this House. Though averse to the holding of a referendum during the war, he said frankly that he realizes its necessity in the present circumstances, and he emphatically declared his view that at least all the powers contained in the bill are necessary. In other words, he will advocate an affirmative vote. On the same platform we shall have, when we go to the people, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> and, I hope, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> though I am not confident of that. We shall also ha.ve the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> and a section of the Australian Country party. The honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann)</inline> will, I hope, be there. </para>
                    <para>I think that the honorable member for Darwin drew a wrong inference from the attitude to the bill of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. The right honorable gentleman said that, if he were asked whether, under its existing powers, the Commonwealth has ample authority to deal with all the problems that will arise on the cessation of hostilities, he would say frankly that he did not know. He added that nobody else knows. But that was not in any way an argument against granting the powers contained in the bill. Nor was it an argument for taking no action until the matter could be further discussed at another convention. The convention would not be one whit better able to  clarify the position than this Parliament is to-day. Uncertainty as to the scope of some of the Commonwealth##'##s major existing powers does not arise from any lack of ability in this House to understand the problems, or from any failure to give adequate time to their study. It arises from the very nature of the powers themselves. You cannot determine the ambit of a constitutional power by a precise formula, as though it were the area of a circle. Exactly how far a power will extend, at a future date and under conditions largely unforeseeable, must inevitably be, to a large extent, a matter of opinion. If opinions differ about the potential adequacy of the Commonwealth##'##s existing peace-time powers, that in itself is a case for conferring additional powers in order to put the matter beyond doubt. </para>
                    <para>The choice, as the Prime Minister said, becomes one as to whether there shall be a referendum on the bill as introduced, or one on the substance of the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. This brings me to my second major proposition in opening, the debate, that the list of ##'## further powers drawn up at the Convention must be regarded as an indispensable minimum. How does that list compare with the list a dumb rated in the sixth paragraph of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition? How far can the list proposed in the amendment be considered , an effective provision for a national plan of post-war reconstruction? </para>
                    <para>In passing, I note that the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition would eliminate all the safeguards for State interests and State co-operation which the list in the hill contains. The fourth proposition which I made in opening the debate was that the Convention list did ensure, in certain vital aspects of post-war reconstruction, that the Commonwealth would act in association with the States. The Government recognized that the limitations embodied in the paragraphs regarding primary production, public works, and national health might, in some circumstances, prove hampering to the Commonwealth. But that was a part of the agreement, and the Commonwealth will abide by it. The right honorable gentleman expressly proposed to abandon all these special provisions. </para>
                    <para>In point of mere numbers, the amendment contains, though with some modifications, most of the fourteen powers that are contained in the bil##]## : I think about ten of them.. But the important thing is to ascertain what substantial matters have been omitted. The language of the amendment is in some places very general, but the clear intention of the Leader of the Opposition is to deny to this Parliament any new powers with respect to employment, except the power to use grants, loans, insurance, training and public works for the provision of employment and the prevention or correction of unemployment; and, secondly, to deny to it any new powers in relation to production. His amendment would not permit a law preventing mass dismissal, or restricting the right of dismissal. Such legislation as the Women##'##s Employment Regulations, fixing standards of employment to meet new conditions, irrespective of the existence of an industrial dispute, would be simply impossible. </para>
                    <para>In my opening speech, I emphasized the importance of arming the Parliament, to meet the inevitable economic difficulties of the immediate post-war years, with the power to carry out any policy which the circumstances of the hour required, provided that the people approved. My arguments have been strongly reinforced by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, and by my colleagues on this side of the House. The Leader of the Opposition proposes, on the other hand, to fetter the Commonwealth, even in these difficult years, by a cast-iron prohibition against any participation in commerce or industry which it could not undertake within its present powers. If the defence power were really as comprehensive, in time of peace, as the right honorable gentleman now think3, this prohibition might not turn out to be very important. He is, in fact, in this dilemma : that either his proposed prohibition is worth little or his estimate of the peace-time scope of the defence power is exaggerated. There is a further matter to be considered. This proposed prohibition would seriously impair the effectiveness of national works, as a contribution towards solving the problem of unemployment in the post-war years. Yet this is the instrument on which the Leader of the Opposition would chiefly rely. </para>
                    <para>Suppose, for example, that the Commonwealth decided to construct an electricity undertaking to serve an area on both sides of a State boundary. Once the buildings had been erected and the plant installed, the question of getting the undertaking to work would arise. The prohibition now proposed by the right honorable gentleman would prevent the Commonwealth from carrying on the undertaking as owner, unless it could be justified under existing powers, which I do not think would be possible. Nor, I take it, as a practical matter, would the Commonwealth be able even to dispose of the undertaking to either State, except on terms to which both States would agree. The whole undertaking might be held up during months or years of negotiation. </para>
                    <para>Underlying the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition seems to run the theory that the Commonwealth can deal effectively with unemployment by means of public works, such as roads or bridges. Once they have been built, they virtually cease to give employment, lt is quite otherwise with public works, which result in the establishment of some enterprise or undertaking that will continue to give employment after the initial construction is complete. An electricity##'## undertaking is an illustration of the kind of government enterprise members of all parties favour. Only the former class would be within the powers contemplated by the amendment. </para>
                    <para>Neither this Parliament, I venture to say, nor the people, will be ready to accept any plan for post-war reconstruction which does not make a far more direct and effective provision than that for grappling with the problem of unemployment. I remind the House that, when the present war broke out and the present Opposition was the Government, there were about 250,000 men unemployed in Australia. The ##'##people are determined never to go back to that kind of thing again. But the spectre of unemployment cannot be banished, except through the fullest development of all Australia##'##s resources of men and materials. The prospects of success in the task are hopeless from the outset if the nation##'##s efforts are to be restricted to certain selected methods of development. The task will be so great that every known method will be required. 1 turn next to the contentions of the Leader of the Opposition with regard to ##"## employment and unemployment ##"##. He said first that this is so wide a subject as to be incapable of definition. He thought that the phrase must enable the Commonwealth to deal with anything which, directly or indirectly, immediately or remotely, could provide or increase employment or prevent or relieve unemployment. He concluded, therefore, that the powers should be cut down, and the Commonwealth should be permitted to deal only by certain specified methods with the provision of employment and the prevention of unemployment. </para>
                    <para>I agree that ##"## employment and unemployment ##"## is a wide power - the widest power in the bill. I have claimed that again and again. I do not agree that the power is incapable of definition, or that in its natural meaning it is so general as to include every economic factor or circumstance that bears upon livelihood. ##"##Employment and unemployment ##"##, said the right honorable gentleman, are results, and a power to deal with results must necessarily include the power to deal with the causes. Without trenching on ground that can perhaps best be covered in committee, I express the opinion that ##"## employment ##"## denotes primarily the act of employing, or the state of being employed. If this is a ##"## result ##"##, so I suppose is the existing subject-matter of ##"## bankruptcy ##"## contained in section 51. But nobody would contend that the existing power with regard to ##"## bankruptcy ##"## would enable the Commonwealth to prescribe courses in bookkeeping or commercial principles in all schools, on the footing that ignorance and lack of business training are among the causes of bankruptcy. The power in the bill is wide. But there is no need to darken counsel by suggesting that it is as wide as ##"## peace, order and good government ##"##. </para>
                    <para>A power in relation to employment covers more than a power to provide employment. Here is one of the central differences between the list of powers in the bill and the mangled list which the Legislatures of South Australia and Western Australia, and now the Leader of the Opposition following them, are prepared to concede. They would leave this Parliament with no more than its present peace-time powers in industrial matters. In substance, the same is true with regard to production and distribution. I remind the House that these are the very spheres in which, for a whole generation, Australian governments of all parties have thought increased national powers are necessary. The Leader of the Opposition would deny them now, in face of difficulties more acute than anything Australia ha3 hitherto known in peace-time.  His  refusal to concede any powers in relation to production and distribution is the more remarkable in view of the general declaration with which his amendment began. For, in paragraph i of the amendment, he listed ##"## the reconstruction of primary and secondary industry ##"## as being one of the ##"##first obligations of government in the immediate period after the war ##"##. Is he seriously ranging himself alongside those relics of a bygone age whose gospel is that the best eoi.tribution of government is to let business organize prosperity by itself? </para>
                    <para>We have no need to guess at the nature and dimensions of the problem of the post-war years. Sufficient particulars are already upon record. Total enlistments in the fighting services already total some 900,000. It will be larger before hostilities cease. A huge number of civilian workers, in addition, is directly or indirectly engaged  in war work. There are over 400,000 in munitions factories alone. Some of the servicemen will wish simply to return to their former jobs. Some of the munitions workers will stay on where they are. But the Australian economy has under-##'## gone great changes during the war, and when every allowance has been made there will be a change-over that is hard to imagine. </para>
                    <para>Of course, many, of the war-time expedients in the provision and regulation of employment will disappear. The organization of the Allied Works Council and the Civil Constructional Corps came into existence to meet a special emergency, and would certainly not be employed in time of peace. This Government is resolutely opposed to industrial conscription in peace-time. I heartily endorse the vivid epigram used in an outstanding maiden speech by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eraser)</inline> : ##"## To travel the road to economic security, we do not have to become little  stooges ##'## of the state ##"##. The question is whether, in relation to production, distribution, and industrial relations, there is to be any national plan, or whether Australia is to revert entirely to the divided responsibilities of past years. Let us not miss the wood because of the trees. The organization of Australia##'##s war effort on the home front could not have been accomplished without much organization. Primary industries - such as apple and barley growing - have been kept on their feet despite drastic disturbances of markets. Entirely new industries have been started, both primary and secondary - flax-growing, for instance, and the making of machine tools. Products for which there used to be but little demand have been made available in greatly increased quantities. Stocks of raw materials, including imported raw materials, have been so handled that essential users have been kept in full production. This, in its turn, has required organization on a new scale altogether in shipping, and in the maritime and waterfront industries. The essential man##'## power needs, both of the forces and of industry, have been met. Profiteering has been kept in check more effectively than anywhere else in the world. How has this been possible? There can be only one answer. It is because the war-time powers of the Commonwealth have enabled Australia to function in accordance with a genuinely national plan for the war effort. The amendment moved by the- Leader of the Opposition rejects all possibility of continuing such a plan. </para>
                    <para>Security of employment for the wage earner will plainly be the central tasks of government in the post-war years. This cannot be achieved without some modification of the arbitrary powers of engagement and dismissal which have characterized industry and commerce in the past. This is not a problem which is peculiar to Australia. Every democratic government is giving anxious thought now to ways and means of accomplishing security of employment in the post-war years. I drew attention in my opening speech to some of the steps that will be necessary. Without repeating what I then said, I quote some remarks made last week by the Home Secretary in Britain, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> Morrison - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The right of private enterprise to inflict the penalties of unemployment and want in its own interest has been seriously and, I believe, decisively challenged. </para>
                        <para>The whole of the emphasis we are increasingly placing on full employment means the denial of this right to throw men on the scrapheap. The conscience of society to-day will not accept unemployment as part of the natural order of things. Still less will it accept unemployment as a weapon in the hands of competitive business. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The fifth paragraph of the Atlantic Charter points clearly in the same direction. The two signatories expressed their desire ##"## to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field, with the object of securing for all, improved labour standards, economic advancement and social security ##"##. </para>
                    <para>Government action to ensure security of employment cannot be completely effective unless production and supply can. also be encouraged to provide employment. But it is in  these  very spheres, as I have said, that the right honorable gentleman##'##s amendment would leave the Commonwealth with only its present powers. </para>
                    <para>As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition so forcefully said, the peace-time powers of the Commonwealth would make it impossible for Australia to tackle on any national basis the problem of even such a national industry as coal, which is the lifeblood of the industries of this country. Just the same must be said of the maritime and stevedoring industries. During the war, Australia has made important advances in organizing industrial peace. For party purposes, exaggerated attention is often given to every industrial dispute that takes place; but I remind the House that industrial relations are incomparably better in this war than they were during the last. The bill would enable Australia to do away with the confused and technical system of industrial relations in which the present Constitution has resulted. Let me quote the picture which the present Leader of the Opposition, then as Attorney-General of Victoria, drew some years ago, of the possibilities which would be open to a Commonwealth Parliament clothed with -the full control over industrial matters - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It is not to be assumed that a Commonwealth Parliament will be less conscious of the needs of the community than a State Parliament; and it is, I think, fair to assume that a Commonwealth Parliament, armed for the first time with a general power over industrial matters, would proceed to exercise it along sensible lines and in the light of prior experience. Let me picture briefly what could be done by such a Commonwealth Parliament. It would completely remodel our industrial machinery; it could eliminate the notion that the way to wage fixation or hours fixation is through the##'## processes of dislocation and dispute; it could provide for local tribunals to deal with local matters; it could make the round-table conference, in industries of individual factories or in departments .of individual factories, a real and effective thing; it could, by the machinery it set up, encourage the idea that wages and conditions are matters which ought to be sensibly discussed, and, if possible, agreed upon at periodical meetings between employers and employees; it could, by the total abolition of the existing overlapping, put every employer in a position to know exactly what his industrial obligations were, since those obligations would proceed from one ultimate source; it could, in short, bring about what can never be produced under our present divided system - the two great essentials of industrial regulations, simplicity and flexibility. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Let the House face again the fundamental issue. It is whether the bill makes effective provision for enabling Australia to deal, as a nation, with the acute employment problem .that the aftermath of the war will leave. The amendment moved by the right honorable gentleman leaves this matter very much where the present Constitution leaves it. In. peace-time the defence power of the Commonwealth, plus the  unco-ordinated  action of six State legislatures, will bequite insufficient for the task. Past history here proves the truth of this contention. To ensure the possibility of an adequate national plan of post-wa##¥## T6- construction, I invite the House to reject the amendment. It concedes the case for a referendum; it proposes a grant of powers for the same limited period as the bill, and it provides for a great many of the same powers. But what it does is to deny to the Commonwealth additional powers in the very fields that are essential to post-war reconstruction - employment, production and national works. </para>
                    <para>Of the many honorable members who have spoken, only a few are against the bill. Their opposition is tentative and uncertain. I hope that the House will read the bill by an absolute majority and that, on the third reading, honorable members of all parties will vote in overwhelming strength for a measure which, in my view, is essential to enable Australia - as a nation - to confront and solve the acute difficulties of the immediate post-war years. </para>

Either course would satisfy any constitutional requirement. </para>

                    <para>I am obliged to reiterate a part of the argument which I advanced in my second-reading speech. I submit that, as very little disagreement exists between the Commonwealth and the States with regard to the major powers being sought by the Commonwealth, the Government has not persevered sufficiently in its endeavours to find an alternative to holding a referendum during the war. Only one convention of the States has been held; and every honorable member will agree that it met with a great measure of success, having regard to the circumstances existing at the time, and the general atmosphere surrounding the Convention. However, the representatives of the States at that Convention agreed upon a draft bill, and undertook to do their utmost to have it passed in their respective Parliaments. Two of the States passed the measure as it was drafted by the Convention; and Victoria passed it with an amendment that it should not become law until all of the other States had passed a similar bill. In ##"##Western Australia and South Australia very good headway was made with the measure. I repeat that as only slight disagreement exists with respect to the major powers sought by the Commonwealth in order to enable the Government to carry out what it is pleased to call its post-war reconstruction programme, and having regard to all the circumstances, the Australian Country party is unanimously of the opinion that a referendum should not be held during the war. ##"##We submit that other avenues, should be surveyed in order to obviate the necessity for holding a referendum. As the Government insists that all of the powers set forth in the bill must be carried, it is running the grave risk of being denied that some of them which are indispensable to the Commonwealth, particularly in the post-war period, will be thrown into the discard for probably a period of 25 years or even longer. Consequently, the Australian Country party, in all sincerity, asks the Government to canvass all possible means of obviating the holding of a referendum during the war. It must be remembered that the representatives of all of the States at the Canberra Convention were unanimously of opinion that a referendum should not be held during the war. Therefore, as a practical alternative, the Government should negotiate further with the States in order to reduce to a minimum the number of powers which it seeks under this measure as indispensable to its post-war programme. Under the bill, fourteen powers are to be sought by referendum, and if amendments forecast by the Attorney-General can be agreed to, three other powers will be asked for. If that number could be reduced, as the result of further negotiations with the States, the people would be less likely to be confused as to the issues involved, and the Commonwealth would thus have a greater chance of being granted the more essential powers. I submit that this alternative is far preferable to the holding of a referendum during the war, which would undoubtedly throw the country into confusion. </para>

                        <para>does not meet the position; nor, I respectfully submit, does the ruling of the Chair. The amendment circulated by the right honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> ought to have been submitted prior to the motion of the Attorney-General. It is the official Australian Country party amendment and proposes that, before the bill is considered in committee, a further conference with the States shall be held in an attempt to remove the remaining points of disagreement. It is ridiculous to say that a proposal of that nature should be considered after the bill has been dealt with. The Attorney-General should withdraw his motion so as to enable this other proposal to be given precedence. </para>

The right honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> having circulated an amendment for the postponement of the clause, that amendment must first be submitted to the committee. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> however, has been given precedence. If the committee does not conduct its business in accordance with the Standing Orders, and if the Attorney-General presses what is most unreasonable and unfair, at the same time depriving other honorable members of the opportunity to submit amendments to this important measure, the suspicions now held concerning it will be intensified. I appeal to the right honorable gentleman to allow the amendment of the right honorable member for Darling Downs to be considered by the committee forthwith. </para>

He did not, however, attempt to move an amendment to the motion of the Attorney-General. Therefore, no amendment to that motion is before the Chair. </para>

                    <para class="block">My purpose is to instruct the Government to canvass means obviating the taking of a referendum during war-time. The reasons in support of this course have been given repeatedly. The Convention that was held in November, 1942, decided unanimously that war-time is not an appropriate time to throw the electors into a state of confusion on such an important matter as an alteration of the Constitution. It was for that reason that a compromise was reached between the States and the Commonwealth. The States agreed to submit to their respective Parliaments uniform legislation on the subject. The States of New South Wales and Queensland passed such legislation, and the State of Victoria passed it with the stipulation that it should be proclaimed only in the event of similar legislation being passed by the other States. There is practically no difference between the major powers which the Commonwealth regards as indispensable and those which the States are prepared to refer to it. To ask the people to pronounce upon seventeen heads of power, all of which must be granted in order to effect, the alteration of the Constitution in the manner desired, will be to make confusion worse confounded. If further negotiations with the States merely had the result of reducing the number of submissions to the people, a desirable object would be achieved. The Government has not persevered sufficiently with the States, having regard to the success which attended its efforts at the Convention. I therefore request it to institute further negotiations, in an attempt to reach agreement on the points that are outstanding. </para>

The issue now before the committee has been raised by a motion by the Attorney-General and another moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party, the latter for the purpose of giving a direc tion to t##'##he committee. If a motion be made that further discussion of the clause be postponed to enable the committee to decide whether the States shall be again consulted, should it not clearly be given precedence by you, no matter at what point of time it is moved, over such a motion as that submitted by the Attorney-General? If you do not give precedence to the motion of the Leader of the Australian Country party, you deny the committee its right to decide, at the appropriate time, whether or not there should be a further reference to the States. For my part, I shall oppose it, but, as a matter of principle, when a member asks that a major matter be discussed before a minor matter, irrespective of when he moves, even if both motions are before you simultaneously, you should give precedence to the major proposition. </para>

The question is how and when that is to be done. I understand your difficulty to be that, I having moved the postponement of the  clause, no amendment, in the strict sense of the term, can be moved to that motion for the purpose of adding words as an ##"## instruction ##"## to the Government. I am. told that if such a thing has been done in committee previously, it has probably been wrong practice, although such an amendment has been moved in the House on certain occasions and for certain purposes. </para>

Will the right honorable gentleman assist the committee by withdrawing his amendment now, and moving later to postpone clause 2? When that clause is called, I undertake not to rise, in order that the right honorable member may have the opportunity to move. In the meantime this clause can be postponed. That, I suggest, is a practical way out of the difficulty, and I can assure the committee,  and  especially the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser),</inline> that the object sought to be achieved by the Leader of the Australian Country party will be  achieved, because his point will be discussed and decided. </para>

You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> and the Attorney-General stated that if the latter##'##s motion to postpone the clause were allowed to pass, the motion of the Leader of the Australian Country party would then be in order, and you would allow it to be discussed. The Leader of the Australian Country party is now told to move on clause 2 in order to test the opinion of the committee. Which ruling is right? If what you first said is correct, may we not deal with the amendment of the Leader of the Australian Country party straight away? Must we wait until clause 2 is before us? I submit that when an amendment is proposed to add words to a motion actually before the Chair, it must, be put to the committee first. </para>

                            <para>- That is not the point of order I raised. The Attorney-General##'##s motion was that, the clause be postponed, and he did not add words indicating the purpose for which he moved it. If that motion be carried, the clause must be postponed at once, and no further opportunity will be available on the clause for the Leader of the Australian Country party to move to add words indicating the purpose for which he wishes the clause to be postponed. The point which I have tried to make all along is that the amendment of the Leader of the Australian Country party includes that of the Attorney-General in addition to words which would anable the committee  to  express its opinion upon a most important point. I am insistent in this matter, because it seems to me that the only satisfactory way in which we can deal with the bill is to have our minds clear at the beginning as to whether we shall proceed in a way which will take this issue back to the States, or in a way which will take it direct to the people. The manner in which this question is decided will determine the character of the amendments to be proposed, and the way in which they will be voted upon. The proceedings of the committee would, therefore, be greatly expedited if we could get that expression of opinion at the earliest possible moment, rather than wait for clause 2. If the postponement of clause 2 be moved, we shall not be able to deal with the matters at issue, because they all are contained in clause 2. If it were postponed, only the title would remain for the committee to discuss. The only correct procedure is to allow the amendment of the Leader of the Australian Country party precedence over the motion of the Attorney-General. </para>

In my ten years##'## experience it has been customary to allow honorable members to move to amend almost any motion. Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, a division took place in the House on an amendment which, if it had succeeded, would have left only the word ##"## that ##"## of the original motion. Do you rule now that nothing can be added to or taken away from a motion by the Attorney-General, especially a motion which you have allowed in contravention of the time-honoured procedure of this House - that motions of which notice has been given shall take precedence over other motions? </para>

                            <para>- It has been in circulation for the last 48 hours, and has lain on the. table in this chamber. It has always been the practice that amendments which have been circulated take precedence over those that have not, and if more than one has been circulated precedence is given to the one circulated first. Here is an amendment dealing with a basic principle of the hill now before the committee, and the established practice of Parliament will be departed from if your ruling is maintained. </para>

I said that I desired to have your ruling on a point of procedure, and I was speaking to the point when I was interrupted by the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mulcahy).</inline> I submit that it is in order for me at this stage to discuss the procedure to be followed in committee. I have stated that the Leader of the Australian Country party circulated an amendment which lay on the table - I think for 4S hours, certainly for 24. I now want your ruling as to whether the usual practice of this Parliament is to be reversed, and an identical amendment considered by the committee before that which was circulated. The forms of the House enable the Attorney-General to achieve the purpose which he stated he has in mind, namely, to alter the title of the bill. If the nature of the bill should be so changed during its consideration in committee as to make the present title inappropriate, it will be competent for the Attorney-General later to move for the recommittal of the title clause so that it may be altered. This unfortunate incident, which has already taken up about an hour of the committee##'##s time, would not have arisen if the usual practice of the committee had been followed. Custom and courtesy demand that the proposed amendment of the Leader of the Australian Country party be dealt with first. </para>

                    <para>That the clause be postponed,  as an instruction to the Government -  to call a further conference of the States to attempt to remove the remaining points of disagreement.  lt, is hardly necessary for me to reiterate the arguments which I have advanced already in regard to this matter; but I say with emphasis that, in my opinion, and in the opinion of the party which 1 lead, having regard to the unanimous decision of the Constitution Convention held in November,  1942,  there should be further negotiation with the States with a view to avoiding a referendum, or at least minimizing the points at issue. It was recognized that the Convention of  1942  was successful. Much more was achieved than was expected by the most optimistic of those who attended it. In view of the time that was devoted by that Convention to this important matter, it is regrettable that nothing more has been done to obtain a reference by the States to the Commonwealth of the powers which this Government, in its wisdom, considers indispensable to its post-war reconstruction programme. Government and Opposition representatives at that conference were unanimous in the belief that this is. no time for the people to be thrown into confusion by a referendum. Consequently, an alternative must be found. That alternative is further negotiation with the States. </para>

                        <para>- It is indicative of the dole system. We cannot accept that in place of power over employment and unemployment. Similarly, the list of powers referred to the Commonwealth by the Parliament of Western Australia was inadequate. They are two of the four State Parliaments which failed to pass the bill in the agreed form. The Parliament of Tasmania has not passed it at all. The Legislative Council of Tasmania has rejected it three times, despite the persuasive advocacy of the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Gaha).</inline> Worst of all, in my opinion, the act of the State of Victoria says that the powers as agreed to shall be referred by Victoria only when all the other States have passed the bills substantially in the form agreed upon at Canberra. So, whatever happens, the Premier of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunstan,</inline> must be able to survey the field to see whether he shall bring his act into force at all. Those are difficulties which we should not underestimate. There  i3  the further difficulty that, after the Canberra Convention ended and the Premiers returned to their States accompanied by their numerous legal officers who had assembled at Canberra, but not till then, it was persistently contended that there was no power in the State Parliaments to make a reference to the Commonwealth Parliament for a limited period. Honorable members will remember that that has been argued by one legal authority or another ever since. </para>

All of us, including the right honorable member for Darling Downs, who was- then Leader of the Opposition, and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> supported reference of power by the States to the Commonwealth for a limited period. It was to be for a limited period not exceeding seven years and. not less than five years and was to he irrevocable. Subsequently, however, counsel seem- to have found ready hearing, and a new view was promulgated. I say no more about it except to indicate to the right honorable, member for Darling Downs that much as I appreciate his objective, which we should like to achieve - that is, have the Canberra agreement or the substance of it carried out - I do not say that every ##"## t ##"## should be crossed and every ##"## i ##"## dotted - there are lions in the path. The lions in the path are put there, not by the Commonwealth Government, but by the Parliaments of four of the States. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, particularly in those four States. I assure the right honorable gentleman that, if the State legislatures make this reference of powers within a reasonable time and that reference gives us the substance of what was agreed to at Canberra, but not otherwise, no referendum will he necessary. I do not think that I could be expected to  do more than that. I ask the committee to remember that this matter occupied a great deal of time and was debated very fully from various points of view on the second reading, and that no amendment of this kind was moved at that stage. I have indicated the view of the Government on this point. I do not say that it is impossible that the right honorable gentleman##'##s desire will be achieved, but it will be very difficult. The States have taken up their stand, and they have also raised the extraordinary technical point from which I differ, hut which, if sound, would be disastrous to the whole plan of getting additional powers by this .method. I think I have dealt with all points raised by the right honorable gentleman. It is a matter not of minimizing what we want, but of seeing that we get the substance of what was agreed upon, because that was the minimum agreed upon by all six State Premiers, in addition to the representatives of the Commonwealth Government. I ask the committee not to accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- The importance of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> is apparent. It carries all the promise of resolving this great problem without reference to the people who, in the circumstances of war, will not be given the opportunity to consider these proposed alterations of the Constitution in a dispassionate and considered way. It can be decided in the legislatures by men who have their place in public life because they have elected to devote themselves to considering those measures most necessary .to promote the interests of the people. Surely, of the alternative juries to which these proposals could be submitted under the Constitution we shall get, particularly in the circumstances of war, a betterinformed and in every respect better jury when we appeal to the Parliaments of the States than when if we ask hundreds  of thousands of people, preoccupied by the war, to decide whether the fourteen proposed new powers - we may finish with 24 - should be given to the Commonwealth. Some of the proposals are framed in such a manner that they can be of only abstract interest to the masses of the people. The Constitution provides those alternative methods of securing alteration. The people have shown on many occasions that they are unwilling to consent to the alteration of the ##'##Constitution, notwithstanding that their elected representatives in this Parliament, whose special duty it is to consider the Constitution, have told them that the alterations are vital to their well-being. The Government will be flying in the face of experience if it entertains high hope that the people to-day will act in a manner completely different from that in which they have acted on almost every occasion on which proposals for alteration of the Constitution have been submitted to them. Many reasons as to why the people are unlikely to react favorably to these proposals could have been adduced at the second-reading stage. But progress has been made. There was unanimity of all political panties in the seven Parliaments represented at the Constitution Convention of 1942. The bill agreed to at that Convention has actually passed into law without qualification in two of the great eastern States. It was passed without amendment by the Parliament of Victoria, the only condition being that it should not operate until all the other States had passed substantially the same legislation. Of the fourteen proposed new powers, thirteen have been carried in a manner not cavilled at in South Australia and thirteen of the powers referred to the Commonwealth by the Parliament of ##"##Western Australia are  uncriticized  by the Attorney-General. The Parliament of Tasmania alone has not yet carried the agreement into law. But how far has it gone? With the full support of the Premier and Leader of the Opposition, the bill has passed through the House of Assembly of Tasmania and it has been defeated by so narrow a margin in the Legislative Council that a change of attitude of only two men would result :in the proposals being carried into law in that State. The conversion of only two men in that Legislative Council would, I submit, result in the Victorian legislation becoming effective. Then there would remain only those two modifications in the legislation passed by the Parliaments of South Australia and Western Australia, and I have little doubt that, in the first place, those modifications would not be found to be fatal to the effectiveness of the whole proposals and, in the second place, that a further approach made to those two legislative bodies would probably result in a satisfactory adjustment of their amendments. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I listened with interest, expecting to hear the Attorney-General state  clearly  how the amendment which the Parliament of South Australia made to the ##"##employment##"## paragraph of the bill, rendered that proposal useless. But the right honorable gentleman completely failed to make his case. When asked to explain how the amendment nullified the purpose of the paragraph, he cited on three separate occasions only one example of where the paragraph in its amended form fell short of what the Commonwealth required. He said that the amendment would prevent the Commonwealth from forbidding mass dismissals. I do not know what the right honorable gentleman has in mind. It would help us to determine our attitude to the referendum proposal if we knew that we had a lucid view of his intentions in this respect. But he appears to give us one peep at something which the Government has in mind, if it secures these powers. Is it intended that the Government shall exercise its authority to prevent an employer from dispensing with the services of one or a number of employees which the business cannot afford to retain ? No other inference can be drawn from the words of the Attorney-General. It must be breaking entirely new ground to promise or threaten, according to one##'##s point of view, that in circumstances which the Commonwealth Government considered justified- </para>

                        <para>- It is apparently the intention of the Government to exercise this power in such manner as to forbid an employer, be he a person or a company, to dispense with the services of employees whom the employer can no longer afford to employ. That seems to me to strike a fatal blow at the continuance of private enterprise in Australia. Private enterprise can provide employment only so long as it is able to secure such returns as will enable it to pay its employees for their services. Now, we are apparently to be treated to the introduction of an entirely new system under which the Government will forbid the dismissal of employees. For the Attorney-General to interject that the prevention of mass dismissals by the Commonwealth will be done only by an act of Parliament is to mislead honorable members. How on earth can the Attorney-General suggest that it is intended under this provision to pass a new act of Parliament to prevent every dismissal? The suggestion is ludicrous. Al##]## that he can do is to go to Parliament, with a docile caucus-ridden majority behind him, and force the passage of legislation which will authorize the Government, by executive act, to direct employers not to dismiss their employees. If the Attorney-General thinks that his statement will influence a majority of the people to support his proposals to alter the Constitution, he is vastly mistaken. Australia is a country which, thank God, still embraces the principle of private enterprise. It is just as well for this discussion to continue because we may, piece by piece, painfully and tediously, tear away some of the screens that are held before the eyes of the public regarding the intentions of the Government, if it secures these powers. I cannot imagine that the amendment made by the Parliament of South Australia has done any harm. Indeed, now that I understand the purposes which the Government has in mind if it secures these powers, I consider that the Parliament of South Australia has done us a service. For my part, I shall be glad to see that prohibition placed upon this Government. And what does the amendment made by the Parliament of Western Australia mean? The Commonwealth Powers Bill proposed to give to the Commonwealth an unqualified authority in respect of production. The act passed by the Parliament of Western Australia provides that the Commonwealth shall have authority to encourage production. Yet the Attorney-General declared that that amendment ruins the proposals formulated by the Canberra Convention ! </para>

                        <para>-  When I was speaking I took exception to the manner in which the Chair called me to order. To explain my conduct, I resented the Chair addressing me in these words, ##"## Yon will not get away with that##"##. I felt very strongly that that was not the customary manner for one occupying the chair to address an honorable member. </para>

                    <para>.- lt will be noticed that the temporary provisions cover new clauses which provide, first, for freedom of speech or of expression ; secondly, for extending to the States the provisions of section 116 of the Constitution; and, thirdly, for control by Parliament of regulations of a legislative character. I do not direct attention to the details of those particular provisions but to the fact that, being temporary, they are to operate for only  the  period of the measure, that is, for five years after the cessation of hostilities. It seems to be quite impossible to contend that freedom of speech or of expression shall be limited to any period. I cannot understand why Parliament should not now commit itself to the general proposition that neither the States nor the Commonwealth may make laws infringing the freedom of speech or of expression for all time. Indeed, the proceedings in this chamber this evening greatly reinforce the argument I am now putting forward. It is quite inconsistent to write the principle of freedom of speech and expression into the Constitution as a temporary provision. If that principle has any value at all, it can have value only as a permanent provision. I have given notice of a new clause which I desire the committee to add at the end of the bill and that clause includes Ia and In of these temporary provisions with an alteration of a substantial nature of lc. I seek among other matters to write into the Constitution the principle of freedom of speech and of expression for all time. </para>

                    <para>. - ##"##With one exception, to which I shall draw attention presently, the wording of this paragraph does not seem to me to call for explanation. Everybody agrees that the Commonwealth should have the fullest repatriation powers. The only question is whether any constitutional alteration is necessary for the purpose. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has expressed the opinion that, the existing defence power would cover in the post-war years everything that this paragraph contains. It may do so. But not even the unanimous opinion of this Parliament could make it certain. Only the High Court can decide whether it does or not. </para>

                <para>In my second-reading speech, I gave to the House in some detail my reasons for having doubts as to the scope of the defence power in time of peace, as applied to the protection and advancement of servicemen, and servicewomen. I agree, and have always emphasized, that the defence power includes some repatriation powers. The question is how far they go There is good reason to think that in relation to reinstatement strictly so-called - the actual first re-establishment of a serviceman in civil life - the Commonwealth##'##s existing authority is complete. But the moral obligations of the  Commonwealth  do not stop with a serviceman##'##s first job. The question of preference in employment, to which many references were made during the second-reading debate, well illustrates the problem. The Leader of the Opposition is of the opinion that authority to enforce a general and permanent preference to returned soldiers falls within the existing defence power. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> speaking out of his own experience as Prime Minister and Attorney-General during and after the last war, expressed the very opposite view. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> also disagreed in principle with the Leader of the Opposition. He expressed the opinion that under the important word ##"## advancement ##"## there may be matters which would not fall within the authority of the defence power, strictly so-called. The very fact that such a conflict of views can exist must surely convince the committee that the matter is at least doubtful. </para>
                <para>I remind the committee that in none of its many dealings with preference to soldiers in time of peace has this Parliament ever relied on the defence power. In my second-reading speech, I referred to the present preference provisions of the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act, which are limited to employment by the Commonwealth or by its instrumentalities. This provision brings up to date a series of provisions which date back to the amendment first made to the Commonwealth Public Service Act in 1915, to which the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has referred. It depends not on the defence power at all, but on the Commonwealth##'##s power to regulate its own services. I mention also section SI <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which dates back as far as December, 191S. This section operates to place servicemen on the same footing as those to whom any award gives preference. But that section is an exercise of the arbitration power, namely, the industrial disputes power, and does not rely on the defence power at all. Therefore - and this is important - although preference to returned soldiers has long been <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> plank in the platform of the Opposition parties, I have, been entirely unable to find in the records of the Parliament a single suggestion that the existing preference provisions could constitutionally be extended to all employment, or for an indefinite period. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with that. Whether or not a general preference should be given is obviously a matter of policy, to be determined in the light of the circumstances. But it would be absurd to leave in doubt this Parliament##'##s power to give such a preference, if it. desired to do so. Preference, moreover, is only one illustration of the uncertainty that will exist about the defence power when the war is over. </para>

                <para>Everybody agrees that the reinstatement and advancement of the servicemen and servicewomen should be a national responsibility. The Government wants to see the matter put beyond doubt. This paragraph does that. If the only criticism is that the Commonwealth already has, or may have, the necessary power, there can be, and is, no real objection to including the paragraph in the bill. </para>
                <para>I draw the attention of the committee to the phrase, ##"##members of the fighting services of the Commonwealth ##"##. The question has been asked whether or not. the inclusion of the word ##"##fighting##"## excludes non-combatant personnel, particularly female members of the defence force. It certainly does not. The word ##"##fighting##"## is applied to and defines the ##"##service##"##, not the individual member. The term ##"## fighting services ##"## is not defined in the Commonwealth statute-book, and is a popular rather than a legal phrase. In my opinion, however, the ##"## fighting services ##"## consist of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, including all their members. Every member of the defence force of the Commonwealth belongs to the ##"##fighting services ##"##. Here I should mention an amendment to the first paragraph which has been circulated by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page),</inline> the object of which is that the powers conferred by the paragraph shall cover the repatriation of soldiers of the last war as well as of the present war. The phrase used at the  Convention was ##"## the present war ##"##. The legislatures of South Australia and Western Australia virtually made this amendment to the paragraph. In principle, the Government raises no objection to it. The fact  was not commented upon at the Convention, that the reference to the servicemen of the present war would or might have the effect of excluding returned soldiers of the last war. None of the three State legislatures which passed the list of powers in the agreed form would regard the departure as being open to the slightest objection. Certainly, there was no intention at the Convention to discriminate in favour of present servicemen so as to exclude servicemen of the last war. Had the point been taken at the Convention, the amendment would have been made in a moment. In these circumstances, the Government is prepared to treat the amendment as a mere correction, and accordingly to accept it. By making it, this Parliament can make it clear that the power to advance the interests of servicemen will apply to the servicemen of not only the present war, but also the last war, or, indeed, of any war in which the Commonwealth, namely, the King as represented by the Commonwealth, is engaged. In the absence of the right honorable member for Cowper, I move - </para>

                        <para>. -  The primary matter which falls within this paragraph is the provision of employment and the prevention and relief of unemployment, by any and every method which this Parliament may regard as appropriate. The power would include all the methods specified in the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition the use of grants, loans, insurance, training and public works. But it would also include the provision of employment either in the Commonwealth##'##s own industrial or commercial undertakings or elsewhere. How it can be thought that the Commonwealth can really tackle the employment problem in the immediate post-war years without using every one of these methods, I do not understand. It is the fact that ##"##employment##"## is linked with ##"##un employment ##"## which suggests primarily the provision of employment for the prevention of unemployment. But it was not intended to limit the paragraph exclusively to the provision of employment. The word ##"## employment##"##, as I said in reply to the second reading debate, ordinarily denotes in itself the act of employing or the state of being employed. Hence, a power with respect to ##"## employment ##"## would include, though less obviously, power to determine the terms and conditions of employment. Engagement and dismissal, wages and hours, industrial relations and industrial disputes could thus fall within the scope of the power. The reason for using both words - ##"## employment ##"## and ##"## unemployment ##"## - is plain. ##"## Employment ##"##, standing alone, might not have been understood to include the provision of employment. ##"##Unemployment##"##, standing alone, might not have included the whole sphere of industrial relations. Each word brings out the full meaning of the other. A power in relation to employment which stopped where the Leader of the Opposition would leave it with the use of grants, public works and so on for the provision of employment, could not secure the full employment which the people demand, and have a right to expect. Surely the experience of every member of the committee during the war has made it plain enough that we cannot have full employment if plant and materials anywhere are lying idle. War-time experience, with which the Government and this Parliament have been so much concerned, inescapably demonstrates that. What is the inference? That you cannot have full employment unless you can secure terms and conditions upon which men are willing to work. The experience of Britain in the last fortnight drives home the same lesson. The employment problem in war-time cannot be effectively tackled without vesting in the National Parliament full power to deal with the terms and conditions of employment, and generally with the relation of employers and employees. Do honorable members opposite think that the position will somehow be different when the war is over? I remind the committee that the problem of  securing full employment is not an isolated one. The success of measures taken to provide or to regulate employment is closely linked with the use of other powers. For instance, there cannot be full employment without sufficient markets. The securing of satisfactory markets requires not only power to plan, direct and to organize production, but power to regulate marketing as well. These other powers are dealt with in later paragraphs. I mention them now in order to shew how comprehensive is the employment problem with which the Parliament will have to deal. </para>

                <para>The power to regulate prices i3 also closely linked with the power to regulate employment. This Government found, very soon after coming into office, that prices could no longer be held in check unless the genera##]## level of wages and salaries was pegged as well. Hence came the Economic Organization Regulations, which have played an importantpart in checking inflation. </para>
                <para>As I have said, I am not for a moment suggesting that it will be necessary to carry over into the post-war years all the regulations and instrumentalities for organizing employment that have been brought into existence to meet the special needs of war. I gave as an illustration of a purely war-time organization the Allied Works Council. When the war ends, that will cease to function. There will he no industrial conscription. The regulations restricting holidays likewise are a temporary expedient, directed to special war-time needs. So also are parts of the Economic Organization Regulations. My point is that an employment power limited to the provision of employment would be totally inadequate. Under the present constitutional powers of the Commonwealth in time of peace, this Parliament has no direct authority over employment, either to regulate its terms and conditions or to give security of employment. </para>
                <para>Here I should like to refer to what was said earlier by an honorable member - what a serious thing it would be to prevent an employer from having the right of dismissal. I quoted earlier a speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> Morrison, in which he said that that will.be the most important thing of all in the post-war period. What he said was this - </para>

                    <para>The  right of private enterprise to inflict the penalties of unemployment and want in its own interests has been seriously and, I believe, decisively challenged. . . . The whole of the emphasis we are increasingly placing on full employment means the denial of this right to throw men on the  scrap-heap.  The conscience of society to-day will not accept unemployment as part of the natural order of things. Still less will it accept unemployment as a weapon in the hands of competitive business. </para>

                <para class="block">That merely means that the Commonwealth Parliament must have power to ilea! with the matter as a whole. This provision will give to the Commonwealth that power. How it exercises it in principle will be a matter for Parliament to determine. I am pleased to join issue on the question of whether -to use the. American phrase - the absolute right to ##"##hire and fire##"## can be tolerated in the post-war years. Under this power, the Commonwealth Parliament will be able to set up machinery foi- the strictly defined functions of conciliation and arbitration in relation to not only interstate but also all other industrial disputes at present. lt could directly regulate the conditions of employment of those engaged in interstate commerce - if they could really be isolated and discovered as a class. But that is all. The cessation of hostilities will leave Australia with the general employment problem of which I have spoken at length. In addition, there will be several special problems in the sphere of employment for which provision must be made. One is the aftermath of the ##"## dilution ##"## agreements which the Commonwealth has made in a number of trades. The Commonwealth is under an obligation to adjust in certain. respects, after the war, the relationship between various grades of labour, in order to restore something like normal conditions. An even greater obligation will rest on the Commonwealth to deal with the position of the thousands of women who, during the war, have replaced men in industry of every kind. They have done so on terms quite different from those ordinarily applicable to women in industry. What is to be their future? </para>

Such problems as I referred to just now regarding women##'##s employment, cannot be solved in peace any more than in war by the ordinary limited arbitration machinery which the Constitution allows to the Commonwealth. To deal with women##'##s employment during the war has necessitated the establishment of special machinery with new and wider powers.

Security cannot be provided for unless there are efficient and comprehensive placement services, as under the Man Power Regulations, to match men with jobs, and unless there is some restriction on the right of arbitrary dismissal which has hitherto characterized private industry. Here then is what Parliament should have power to do in the sphere of employment after the war - I omit the provision of employment by public works and otherwise, since on that every member of the committee is agreed, and mention matters which fall outside that particular aspect - provide for adjustments consequential upon the dilution agreements, far wider adjustments in the position of women in industry, the maintenance of training facilities and placement services, the guarantee of security of .employment, the regulation of working conditions by <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc</inline> organizations in special industries, and the extension into the post-war period of the experiments in regulating industrial relations which have been made during the war, and to simplify and expedite the solution of industrial disputes. </para>

                <para>An employment power limited to the provision of employment would not cover the subjects which I have just detailed. The Commonwealth would therefore have only two alternatives. The first would be to undertake the necessary action itself, and rely upon the defence power. The second would be to leave the necessary action to the States. I can accept the view that the defence power might enable the Commonwealth to carry out its obligations under the trade dilution agreements, though I think even that is rather speculative. But I do not think it can seriously be suggested that after the war is over the defence power would sustain action on the part of this Parliament to deal with any of the other matters I have mentioned. They belong not to defence but to post-war reconstruction. To leave the necessary action to the States would bt- fatal. The problems are nation-wide.

To-day the Government has all the powers in respect of employment and unemployment that it needs, but it has an extremely sorry record. Take, for example, the trouble that has occurred recently in the coal mines, where there has been a loss of 500,000 tons in production since the 1st January. The Government, although clothed with all the necessary powers to handle the problem, refused to do so. Because of lack of coal, hundreds of thousands of people throughout Australia have been placed in positions of extreme discomfort. Housewives are at their wits##'## end even to cook the necessary meals for themselves and families, because of the restrictions placed upon them, in relation to a. commodity which exists in abundance in Australia. If it were something that we had to import, the position would be entirely different, but we have an unlimited supply of coal. We have sufficient manpower in the industry to provide Australia with its requirements, even during war-time, yet dle Government which has had the power but not the desire, the will or the courage to enforce the regulations, proposes to ask the people for extended powers in employment and unemployment. If there is one thing more than another calculated to ensure the defeat of these proposals at the proposed referendum, it is the insertion of this paragraph. </para>

                    <para>. - This is a very important paragraph. In the widest sense, every sale and every purchase of a commodity is ##"## marketing ##"##. But the power in this paragraph is limited by the adjective ##"## organized ##"##. It must be understood in the light of the recognized practice in Australian marketing legislation. So interpreted, the paragraph relates to a well-known, though not rigidly defined, aspect of putting commodities on the market. This is the process of organizing the producers of a commodity so that their produce is marketed through some central co-ordinating agency, acting under statutory authority. ##"## Commodities ##"## is the word most frequently found in the existing acts, especially the State acts; setting up machinery for organized marketing. The word is frequently used in ordinary speech as a synonym for ##"## goods ##"##. Marketing legislation hitherto has been confined chiefly to primary products. But it would probably be an undue restriction upon the word ##"##commodities ##"## to regard it as excluding other goods. The methods used in existing legislation for organized marketing include ##"##pooling##"##, compulsory or voluntary; ##"##orderly marketing##"## by means of  zoning, quotas and the like; and arrangements to ensure better grading, packing, advertising and so forth. All these methods would be within the power conferred by this paragraph. From the second-reading debate, I infer that members of the committee are generally agreed that the Commonwealth should ha.ve this particular power. I may remind the committee, however, exactly what the adoption of the paragraph would add to the present peace-time powers of the Parliament. Under the Constitution as it stands, the Commonwealth itself can deal only with interstate and overseas marketing. Each State has the exclusive power to deal with marketing transactions within its own boundaries. Under the power contained in this paragraph, the Commonwealth will be able to organize the marketing of a whole industry, whether the transactions concerned are interstate, or overseas. </para>

                        <para>- I am coming specially to section 92. All that I am at present saying is that the power to deal with the organized marketing of commodities, without at the moment considering section 92, is not limited by State boundaries. Experience in time of peace has shown that organized marketing can only be carried out in a major industry by the Commonwealth and the States acting in concert, and that it may take years, while an industry languishes, to bring the parties into accord. In war-time, when the Commonwealth has been able to regulate all dealings in commodities under the defence power, we have found that plans for organized marketing can he far more quickly and effectively carried out. Despite the disturbed marketing conditions caused by the war, the primary producers of Australia have benefited enormously from, the use of the Commonwealth##'##s powers. Equally disturbed and unusual marketing conditions are bound to continue in the years immediately following the war. That makes an overwhelming case for . con tinuing the Commonwealth##'##s present powers. I do not think any one disputes it. </para>

                <para>Only one criticism of substance has been levelled against this paragraph - in particular by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline> The power will be ineffective, it is said, because it will have to be exercised in subjection to the rule laid down by section 92 of the Constitution, that interstate trade must be absolutely free. This, it is said, will nullify all attempts to organize the marketing of commodities, just as it formerly nullified the attempt of the Commonwealth, in association with the States, to organize the marketing of dried fruit, dairy produce, and wheat. The objection is, of course, based upon the decision of the Privy Council in <inline font-style="italic">James</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth</inline> in 1936 (55 C.L.R, 1). I have given this matter most anxious consideration, the more so since, as honorable members may perhaps recall, the Government itself proposed, in the bill that was submitted to -the Convention, that the Commonwealth should, in its reconstruction powers, be released from the requirements of section 92. ##"##When the decision was taken to tackle the problem of postwar powers by way of reference from the States, this particular proposal had necessarily to be dropped. No reference from the States could free the Commonwealth from a constitutional restriction imposed on Commonwealth and States alike. Only a referendum to the people could do that. At the Convention, I had to make up my mind whether a Commonwealth marketing power which would remain subject to section 92 would be serviceable to the -people in the immediate reconstruction period. I thought it would be, and still think so. Members of the committee will forgive me if, in stating my reasons, I am a little technical. </para>
                <para>The Privy Council##'##s decision in <inline font-style="italic">James</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth</inline> in 1936 declared void certain existing marketing legislation of the Commonwealth. But that legislation had been drafted on the assumption, based on a decision of the High Court in 1920, that section 92 did not apply to the Commonwealth at all. As a guide to  future practice, the really significant feature of the decision in. <inline font-style="italic">James##'##s</inline> case was that the Privy Council endorsed a series of earlier High Court decisions which had shown that, without infringing section 92, the States could regulate such matters as road transport, or the movement of diseased stock, even where interstate movement was concerned. In -short, though the Privy Council held that section 92 binds Commonwealth and States alike, it adopted a much less destructive interpretation of what the section requires than had been laid down in some of the earlier cases. Since <inline font-style="italic">Tames</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth,</inline> the High Court has not had to apply section 92 to any Commonwealth law. But it has decided crucial cases arising under State laws. Its decisions emphasize the point I have made. It has upheld the power of a State, in regulating the processing of dried fruit, to prevent the delivery of all fruit, whether grown within the State or in another State, except to a registered packer. <inline font-style="italic">(Hartley</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Walsh</inline> (1937) 57 C.L.R. 572). It##'## has upheld the power of a State, in organizing the supply of milk and cream to its metropolis, to control all supplies coming into the metropolitan area, whether from within the State or not, - <inline font-style="italic">Milk Board, New South Wales##'##</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Metropolitan Cream Proprietary Limited</inline> (1939)- (62 C.L.R. 116). Lt has upheld the power of a State, in regulating the conduct of lotteries in the State, to prohibit the purchase of a ticket in a lottery conducted in another State <inline font-style="italic">(R.</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Martin, ex parte Wawn</inline> (1939) 62 C.L.R. 457). These cases will indicate the line on which I think the proposed Commonwealth power should be considered. Attention must be given in every case to the real object and substance of what is being done. If an organized marketing scheme is not directed against interstate commercial transactions as such, but is in substance directed towards the preservation of standards of purity and quality, or the maintenance of adequate supplies for areas in which special considerations apply, or the preservation of an industry, the mere fact that interstate transactions arc controlled will not invalidate it. </para>
                <para>Possibly the most significant part of the Privy Council##'##s decision, for the matter immediately before the committee, is the way in which Lord Wright dealt with a decision of the High Court in 1933 - <inline font-style="italic">Peanut Board</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Rockhampton Harbour Board</inline> (48 ##'##C.L.R. 266). A hoard was set up under the Queensland law for the collective marketing of the commodity, and all producers were required to deliver their whole produce to the board. By a majority, the High Court held the State law invalid. The Privy Council accepted this decision as correct, but only upon the basis of the particular interpretation of the State act which had been adopted by the majority of the High Court. In the <inline font-style="italic">Milk Board</inline> case in 1939 (62 C.L.R. 131-32) <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham, after a close examination of the Privy Council##'##s decision, said - </para>

                    <para>The view of their Lordships was that a State Parliament could enact and provide for the administration of a compulsory marketing scheme, so long as it was not directed against interstate trade and was not merely a prohibition as distinct from a regulation of such trade. </para>

                <para class="block">The committee will permit me to observe that, in substance, this was the view which I had expressed, as a dissenting judge, in the <inline font-style="italic">Peanut</inline> case. I thought the real purpose of the Queensland act then in question was not to interfere with interstate trade, but to stabilize and preserve the industry by setting up an efficient and representative selling agency, in order to dispose of the pooled product of an industry. The decision of the High Court in the <inline font-style="italic">Milk Board</inline> case shows clearly that an act passed for that purpose will not now be held to infringe section 92. </para>
                <para>When heed is paid, therefore, to the line of judicial decisions that have followed <inline font-style="italic">James##'##s</inline> case, I think that it cannot be doubted that the power proposed in this paragraph can be made effective. I remind the committee, also, that any attempt to free the Commonwealth from the restraints of section 92 would be a substantial departure from the understanding reached with the States at the Convention as to the scope of the new powers. </para>
                <para>The Legislatures of South Australia and Western Australia adopted this paragraph in a restricted form, as also did the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. In substance, the proposal is to grant the power in respect of those commodities of which Australia has normally an exportable surplus. Any such restriction is, I submit, exceedingly ill-advised. We are providing, as I have said, for a period of disturbed conditions. We may be called on to send abroad supplies of foodstuffs which we do not normally export at all. The effort, to do so may cause shortages at home of other foodstuffs not usually exported. How can the States possibly deal with such matters? The supplies available in Australia must be available to the people of Australia, irrespective of their State. The huge size of the country, and its transport problems, may make that difficult to attain, but without Commonwealth power it will certainly not be possible to attain it at all. </para>

                    <para>. - I still think that it would be wise to introduce the qualification which the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> has proposed. Indeed, in the first bill introduced by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> he himself proposed that it should be done. In the bill submitted to the Constitution Convention there was a provision for giving to the Commonwealth Parliament power to deal with the marketing of goods, and also to control profiteering. Sub-clause 3 of clause 2 of the bill submitted to the Convention provided that Parliament should have power to make laws in respect of organized marketing of commodities,  Ajc.,  ##"##notwithstanding anything contained in section 92 of this Constitution##"##. Now, the Attorney-General has been at great pains to prove that this provision is not necessary. Legally, that may be so, although I take leave to doubt it, but I believe that the power of the Commonwealth to make laws in regard to the marketing of goods should be placed beyond all doubt. The Attorney-General was of that opinion himself in 1942, because, in November of that year, he prepared a very interesting and valuable book on the subject of post-war reconstruction in which, when discussing the need for a national plan, he said - </para>

In the second place, moreover, the Commonwealth##'##s trade and commerce power, under the Constitution as now interpreted, is subject to the declaration in section 92 that ##"##trade, commerce and intercourse among the.

                <para class="block">The  committee, and to the people of this country. I see no reason why I should refrain from giving what help I can to the committee, despite the absence of some honorable members opposite who apparently do not feel called upon to assist the committee in dealing with these most important national matters. </para>
                <para>There is no doubt whatever about what the State Premiers intended at the ##'##Convention when they agreed that the Commonwealth should have power to pass uniform company legislation. Rather to the surprise of the profession, the High Court held in 1909, in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Huddart Parker</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Moorehead,</inline> that the Constitution did not give to the Commonwealth power to provide for the creation or formation of companies, though it did confer upon the Commonwealth some power with respect to companies formed under State laws. Therefore, the Commonwealth did not have power to pass a national Companies Act, to operate throughout Australia. What was intended at the Convention was to remove this incapacity. Let me remind the committee briefly of the present position : Paragraph xx of section 51 of the Constitution gives to the Commonwealth power to make laws with respect to ##"## foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth ##"##. The High Court held in 1909 that an Australian company must already be ##"## formed ##"## before the Commonwealth power could operate in relation to it. The result is that a company incorporated under the law of one State is regarded as a foreign company in all the others. Before it can carry on business in any other State, it must be registered there, or comply with some other formality. This involves inconvenience, expense, and much unnecessary multiplication of returns. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said, there is very great merit in the proposal for a uniform Australian ##'##Companies Act. There has been strong support for such an act in the business community for years. I do not think that there would be any real opposition to the enactment of such a measure. </para>
                <para>Two objections have been put forward to the inclusion of this paragraph in the bill. The first is that the time limit of five years would make the power totally ineffective. The Leader of the Opposition thought that to pass a bill, and set up a registry, and then allow the whole thing to lapse in five years##'## time, would create chaos in the business world and would be absurd. But this objection altogether misconceives the position. This is a power that Commonwealth Governments for twenty years have thought the Commonwealth should have for all time. The State Premiers agreed to put it in the five-year list, on probation; but it does not follow that the grant of power would necessarily expire at the end of the five years. The Government and this Parliament would set to work on the assumption that it had an opportunity tb meet a frequently expressed business need. It would not contemplate the cessation of the power at all. If the Australian act is a good one, the business community will make sure that the power is made permanent. Even if the power were to lapse at the end of the five-year period, chaos need not be caused. The present State acts would not be repealed or abrogated, though their operation would naturally be suspended during the existence of the Commonwealth act. If the Commonwealth act ceased to operate, companies registered under it could immediately register under a State law, exactly as at present, and there would be nothing to prevent any State from making special provision for the recognition of any company that had been registered under the Commonwealth act. The Commonwealth might even be able to make some such provision itself under paragraph xx of section 51. Thus there is no substance in the objection that a power limited to five years would not be of any practical use. </para>
                <para>The second objection is that the power set out in this paragraph could be used for purposes other than the establishment of an ordinary Australian Companies Act. Such acts usually deal with matters such as the formation of companies, the issue of prospectuses and the constitution, internal regulation, and dissolution of companies. The Leader of the Opposition contended that the power in this paragraph could be exercised validly to enact any imaginable type of punitive legislation so long as it was directed against companies. This objection is without foundation. Surely the right honorable gentleman must have forgotten the existence of paragraph xx of section 51. If a power over companies does enable the Commonwealth to take the punitive measures that the right honorable gentleman described, then the Commonwealth already has that power, in relation to every foreign company and every trading or financial company in Australia. Indeed, it has had that power ever since 1901. </para>
                <para>The new power contained in this paragraph is needed, as I have said, only in relation to the formation of companies. It could have been drafted so as to fit technically into the words of paragraph xx of section 51. Instead the Convention adopted a form of words that would describe the general result which everybody was aiming at; but the only additional power which the paragraph will give to the Commonwealth is a power to provide for the formation of companies. The now power will enable the Commonwealth to make laws with respect to companies which are not ##"## trading or financial corporations ##"## ; but that is a minor matter. The Leader of the Opposition was simply raising bogies, for political purposes. </para>

                    <para>. -  It has been suggested that the subject-matter of this power is so vague as to be indefinable. If that were so, the Canberra Convention would have sinned in good company, for this phrase has more than once been adopted by the Commonwealth Parliament as the basis of a constitutional alteration, with the addition of words which for present purposes are immaterial; but the objection is ill-founded, as the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> showed sufficiently in his speech on the second reading of the bill. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>As used in the bill, the three nouns in this paragraph are, I think, broadly interchangeable. They are not true synonyms, for each denotes a different aspect of the same general business process. They are also words with which care must be exercised, since each of them has other well-recognized and quite different senses, in which they are not interchangeable at all. For instance, there  i3  nothing common to a ##"## trust ##"## as exemplified in the ##"## trustee ##'##.##'## of a deceased person##'##s estate, and a ##"## monopoly ##"## in its strict legal sense as exemplified by the exclusive legal right of a patentee to sell his invention. It is only in relation to a particular business process that the collocation of trusts, combines - or combinations - and monopolies has any meaning. That process is neither obscure nor unfamiliar. It takes place when persons or undertakings enter into  an agreement, association or organization for the purpose of restricting or suppressing competition in some trade, industry or market, to the detriment of the public. Thus, the two root ideas are, first, detriment to the public, or, as it is sometimes put, the unreasonable or unlawful restraint of trade; and, secondly, the action in concert of a group of persons or undertakings. In relation to this process, the word ##"## combine ##"## - originally an American slang word being short for ##"## combination ##"## - denotes the act of association. The word ##'####"## trust ##"## denotes the particular legal method originally the creation of a trust in the true equitable sense by which the organization or association is accomplished. The word ##"## monopoly ##"## originally meant merely the exclusive possession of some particular trade or market. Derivatively, it came to be applied also to. the trust or combine by means of which this position of exclusive privilege is usually established; but there can be, I think, a monopoly without a trust or combine. Statutory definitions cannot, of course, actually control the meaning of words in a Constitution. On the other hand, where a word before its introduction into a Constitution had acquired a sufficiently defined common meaning in the law of the community, there is a strong presumption that the Constitution uses the word in that sense. In 1906, the High Court treated as decisive of the meaning of the word ##"## excise ##"## in the Constitution, the fact that legislation in all the Australian colonies had used the word consistently in a particular sense. </para>
                <para>Illustrations of the general propositions that I have stated can be gathered from the statute-books of Australia and New Zealand, during the present century.

                <para>Under section 6 it is an offence to sell any goods at a price which is unreasonably high, if the price has been determined, controlled or influenced by any commercial trust of which the seller is a member. Section 5 makes it an offence to conspire to monopolize the demand or supply of any goods, or to control the demand or supply or price of any goods if the monopoly or control is of such a nature as to be contrary to the public interest. The Monopolies Act, 1923, of New South Wales provides in section 5 that no person shall monopolize, or combine with any person to monopolize, trade in a commodity or service, with intent to control, to the detriment of the public, the supply or price of the commodity or service. Further indications, in the same direction, are to be found in section 10 of the Profiteering Prevention Act, 1920, of New South Wales. That section authorized the  President  of the Profiteering Prevention Court to investigate the operations of certain trusts, combinations, ##&amp;##c, in order to ascertain whether their purpose or effect wag the regulation of the prices or output of commodities or services, insofar as they tended to the creation of monopolies or to the restraint of trade, or to the abuse of a power to control trade. </para>
                <para>These illustrations show very clearly the sense in which the bill uses the words ##"## trusts, combines and monopolies ##"##. The difficulty, I suggest, lies not in ascertaining the subject-matter of the power, but in making effective the measures of legislative control which are adopted. At one time, in the first generation of the Commonwealth##'##s history, this subject was a much more live one than it has been in recent years. I commend to members of the committee a study of the trust movement in Australia, published in 1914 by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> L. Wilkinson, of Melbourne. He showed the wide ramifications of trusts, combines and monopolies in Australia. He dealt with the sugar monopoly, the tobacco trust, the interstate shipping combine, the Newcastle coal vend, the beef trust and a series of combinations and associations fixing the ;##&gt;##rice of various food and other supplies. He was dealing only with Australian trusts, and therefore did not find it necessary to deal with the##"## overseas shipping combine to which the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chambers)</inline> referred in the course of the debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson##'##s</inline> survey showed bow the results of the trust movement had been to permit the accumulation of large profits, to curb enterprise, and to raise prices unnecessarily. He admitted, however, that trusts, in proper hands, were capable of giving to the community certain economic advantages in the way of the efficiency. </para>
                <para>In the years immediately before the war, increasing attention was being paid to the development of the trust movement on an international scale, in the form of cartels. The war has further stimulated this development. The Assistant Attorney-General of the United States of America recently gave a most outspoken public address, raising the question of what was to be done about cartels in the post-war world. He pointed out that their operations cut right across the policy of governments, and that their conduct before and during the war had been one of the tragic pages of American history. In particular, he mentioned the fact that in February, 1941, when Britain was in the most critical peril, a cartel agreement decreed that a large American munitions manufacturer could not supply certain explosives to Britain. That would have violated the commitments of the American  cartellist  to its German partner. He also mentioned that in 1935 England and France desperately needed military optical goods from the United States. A cartel agreement decreed, however, that England and France were territory to be supplied by German interests. The sale was prohibited. </para>
                <para>In the post-war world, as I pointed out in opening the debate on the second reading, the Australian economy would probably be particularly susceptible to th, operation of trusts, combines, monopolies and cartels. I remind the committee that, under the Constitution as it stands, neither the Commonwealth nor the States can tackle the problem effectively. Only a comprehensive national power, resolutely exercised, can suffice. Indeed it may well be necessary to act in cooperation with other governments in an attempt to bring international cartels under control. For such a purpose it is essential that Australia should be able to act as a unit. This is the power which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> fought for over and over again in appeals to the people one or two of which very nearly succeeded. I trust that all members of the committee will agree to its inclusion. </para>

                        <para>. -  Criticism has been directed at the use of the word ##"##profiteering##"##, but as I have already reminded the committee, we find in State legislation, n.n act of the Parliament of New South Wales dealing with unreasonable or extortionate prices, the title being ##"## Profiteering Prevention Act ##"##. The term has not been invented for the present occasion. ##"## Profiteering ##"## is not a technical legal term. It has, however, a fairly well defined meaning. It is the deriving of an unreasonable or excessive profit - in particular, by the charging of excessive prices. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>The State legislation passed at the conclusion of the last war throws lighton the meaning of this expression. The Queensland Parliament passed the Prevention of Profiteering Act 1920. The act did not in terms define the word ##"## profiteering ##"## which appears only in its title. What it did do was to provide machinery for the fixing of maximum prices in Queensland and to prohibit sales at prices in excess of those fixed. Even without an expressed definition, therefore, it is plain that under this act profiteering was precisely what I have described as the deriving of excessive profits from sale at prices in excess of those fixed by law. The collocation in the bill of ##"## profiteering ##"## with ##"## prices ##"## points in the same direction. </para>
                <para>I do not think it follows that the power is limited to the fixing of prices for the sale of goods and the supply of services. The position is rather that the power includes price-fixing. </para>
                <para>In this field, as in all other economic matters, the scope of the defence power in peace-time is doubtful. Apart from the defence power, the Commonwealth would have no direct authority in relation to profiteering, except as regards interstate and overseas transactions. This is another of the spheres in which the existing division of commerce powers between the Commonwealth and the States makes it impossible for either to deal with the problem effectively. </para>
                <para>It has been suggested by some that this is a dangerous power to give to the Commonwealth, because the determina tion of what is an undue or unreasonable or excessive profit lies wholly in the discretion and good faith of the Parliament. If this objection were valid, it would obviously apply to many other powers as well - e.g., to the taxing power. </para>
                <para>As to the power to fix prices, I do not think that a single member of the House would deny that this Parliament should have it during the post-war years. Power to fix prices, in the disturbed conditions of the post-war years, will be the only barrier against the evils of inflation. This is generally realized. I remind the committee, however, that in some industries the danger may for a time be the possibility of collapse through unchecked deflation. The system of price control which has been adopted during the war will have the result of leaving in the hands of some traders, when more normal supplies begin to be available, stocks which they had bought at high prices during the##'## war. Traders who are able to buy on an easier market would be able to start a disastrous spiral of deflation unless a price structure in the industry could be maintained. That, of course, is a matter entirely for the discretion of Parliament, but we have to determine whether Parliament should have the power. </para>
                <para>I dealt with- this point at some length in my second-reading speech, and think it is generally understood. I mention the matter particularly, however, so that there shall be no misunderstanding on the point in the Parliament or in the country. I mention it expressly, in view of the fact that, in the powers which the Leader of the Opposition proposed, ##"## the prevention of inflation ##"## was specifically mentioned, but no provision seemed to have been made for dealing with the reverse process or with prices at all. </para>
                <para>The sale of goods and services by ##'##State authorities is excluded from the power, as stated in the bill. Broadly speaking, these authorities have been co-operating during the war period. There is no reason to expect them to be otherwise in the post-war years. </para>

The proposal is to give to the Commonwealth a general power with respect to both matters, subject, however, to two reservations. One which is contained in sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> prohibits discrimination between States or parts of States by any law made under the paragraph. The particular object ##"##was to extend to laws with respect to production the prohibition against discrimination which is already contained in the Constitution in the case of laws of commerce or revenue. The other reservation which is contained in subparagraph a is a requirement of State consent to the operation in a State of any law with respect to primary production. </para>
                <para>Both safeguards grew out of the anxieties of the State Premiers at the Convention. They recognized that no adequate plan of post-war reconstruction could be carried out without extending the Commonwealth##'##s present authority in relation to production and distribution. They wished to make sure in particular that, in matters affecting primary production, which has played so important a part in the political and economic life of the States, they could work in cooperation with the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>In view of the fact that the reservation contained in sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> is limited to ##"## primary production ##"##, the meaning of this term is a matter of importance. It is also a matter of some difficulty and obscurity. In a popular sense, ##"## primary production ##"## is used to mean not only the process of deriving the immediate produce of such industries as agriculture, dairying, pastoral, farming and mining, but also certain processed goods derived from that produce. In this sense butter, cheese and canned or dried fruits would all be classed as ##"##primary products ##"## and the industry producingthem would be classed as ##"## primary production ##"##. In a technical or economic sense, such processed goods as these would not be counted as primary products, and only the process of obtaining the commodities from which they are processed would be classed as ##"##primary production##"##.In this sense the production of milk would be ##"## primary production ##"##, but the production of butter and cheese would not. The production of grapes would be primary production, but winemaking or driedfruit processing would not. In either case the distinctions are rather arbitrary, even when judgment is based on the practice of an industry as a whole, rather than the manner in which any particular product happens to have been treated. </para>
                <para>It is not possible, in this Parliament, to say exactly what sense this phrase should be understood to bear. The ordinary rule is that, where words in a statute have a technical meaning, the presumption is that they are used in their technical sense. In this particular case, however, it is probable that neither what I have called the popular nor what I have called the technical meaning is sufficiently well defined for the application of this rule. Australian official statistics of the assistance given to ##"## primary industries ##"## appear to include, possibly for purposes of mere convenience, types of production which would not strictly be called ##"## primary ##"## in either of the senses I have mentioned. </para>
                <para>The whole point, however, may in practice be unimportant. The two stages of the dairying industries, for instance, are in practice so closely connected that Parliament would not wish to deal with one in isolation from the other. </para>
                <para>I remind the committee how little direct authority, in these vital spheres, the Constitution in its present form entrusts to the Commonwealth. As to production, the Commonwealth can make no laws except for granting bounties. As to the distribution of goods, the Commonwealth has power only insofar as distribution takes place in the course of interstate or overseas trade. </para>
                <para>Both the production and the distribution of goods are central phases of any post-war reconstruction policy. One of the war aims to which Australia, like the rest of the United Nations, has most clearly pledged herself is the improvement of living standards by expanding production and consumption. That is also an obvious step in achieving ##"## full employment##"##. </para>
                <para>After the war, it may take a considerable time to produce a sufficiency of goods and services to satisfy all the demands of the community. Unless during this period production can be directed into the provision of the more essential and desirable goods and services, business conditions would become chaotic, and much-needed services and supplies would probably be available only to a few. I remind the committee of the illustration from the Government##'##s housing plans that I gave in my second-reading speech. A housing programme of the dimensions we have planned will require stock-piles of all kinds of materials, prepared beforehand and distributed to each State, so that a co-ordinated attempt may be made to reach the housing goals all over Australia. What is true of housing##'## is just as true of other national works. Unless both production and distribution of the necessary materials can be organized on fi national scale, no programme of housing and national works can possibly be efficiently carried out. </para>
                <para>I draw particular attention to what can be done under the bill to give stability of prices and satisfactory markets to the primary producer. Questions were raised on this score by the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen).</inline> During the war, despite the unprecedented dislocation of markets, the position of primary producers as a whole has greatly improved. I remind the committee of the figure quoted by the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan),</inline> who said that the mortgages and bank overdrafts owed by primary producers have been reduced by over ##£##60,000,000 since the war began. The Commonwealth has been able to organize production in the light of the needs of Australia itself and its associates in the United Nations. New markets have sprung up to make up for markets that have been temporarily lost. Under the paragraphs in the bill relating to primary production, to the distribution of goods, to prices, and to the organized marketing of commodities, the measures which have been employed during the war to improve the position of the primary producers will continue to bc available. Therefore, every primary producer should support this proposal. </para>
                <para>In my second-reading speech I mentioned particularly that the ##"##external affairs power##"##, contained in paragraph xxix of section 51 of the Constitution, may reasonably be expected to confer on this Parliament full power to carry out any legal obligations regarding production which may rest upon it or come to rest upon it, by virtue of international treaties or conventions to which Australia is a party. The Leader of the Opposition accepts, I believe, the view I have expressed about the scope of the external affairs power. Insofar, however, as he suggested that the power had a major significance in relation to the matters covered by this bill as a whole, I definitely disagree with him. The power may be of importance in relation to this particular paragraph. The Leader of the Opposition rather suggested that the Commonwealth might cast round among its neighbours solely with the object of making some international agreements as to matters in which this Parliament##'##s authority was lacking or doubtful. I think that that is mere fantasy, but I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the external affairs power is important and far-reaching. Nevertheless, this power overroduction and distribution is essential, particularly wish to say in relation to primary production that although laws directly bearing on primary production must operate with the consent of the State governments - that provision was inserted in the Convention Bill - there is very little reason to suppose that the State governments will not readily##'## consent to the law. In any event there are other powers that the Commonwealth could call in aid in order to ensure that the principle of long-term price stabilization within the vital primary industries of Australia, should be effected. At any rate, I am satisfied that, given all these powers together and taking them in conjunction with the existing powers to the Commonwealth, we can continue to give to primary producers those advantages which they have received even during the war, as the figures of the honorable member for Kennedy will demonstrate. </para>

                    <para>. - In thanking honorable members for the close and attentive consideration that they are giving to this important ,, ill. I again emphasize the necessity for explaining every paragraph. The eighth power sought by the Commonwealth involves three distinct subject-matters, though the first two are closely cognate. They are (1) exchange and (2) Investment, and are restricted to overseas transactions. The third, the raising of money, relates only to transactions in Australia. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has said, the Commonwealth already has express powers in relation to some aspects of all three matters. These are the powers with respect to overseas trade and commerce, currency, banking, aliens and foreign corporations. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Primarily and originally, ##"## overseas exchange ##"## denoted the payment of debts in different countries by an exchange or transfer of credits. In current usage, however, the phrase is ordinarily _ employed to include overseas remittances of  a  non-commercial character as well. Every transaction involving an interchange between Australian currency and some other currency would fall within the heading of ##"## overseas exchange ##"##. The power with respect to overseas exchange would include the power to prescribe not only the rate of exchange, but also the extent to which exchange should, from time to time, be permitted. ##"## Investment ##"## is the conversion of money into some other form of wealth,  such  as securities, land or other assets, primarily, but I should think not necessarily, with a view to deriving an income from the investment. ##"## Overseas investment ##"## is the process by which a person resident in Australia invests in some asset held or payable abroad, or by which a person resident abroad invests in some  asset  held or payable in Australia. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Opposition suggested that the existing powers of the Commonwealth with respect to currency, banking and overseas trade and commerce make it altogether unnecessary for the Commonwealth to have the further specific powers contained in this paragraph. ##"##Without going into unnecessary detail, I inform the committee that this matter has been minutely considered by the Government##'##s financial advisers and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley).</inline> In their opinion, experience both during the depression and during the present war has shown that there are certain gaps in the normal peace-time powers of the Commonwealth which it would be wise to close. </para>
                <para>The existing power to licence the import and export of goods would not by any means cover the whole of Australia##'##s overseas financial transactions. It would not touch what are known as ##"## invisible ##"## imports and exports. These include movements of capital, interest and divided payments, traveller##'##s expenses, and the like. </para>

                        <para>- A flight of capital would be a most important matter to bring under control. These items amount annually to a considerable sum. The existing power over banking would enable the Commonwealth to regulate some of them but not all, as experience proved during the depression. The result, in certain circumstances, might be to embarrass Australia##'##s overseas reserves. Some further specific authority is therefore needed to regulate the overseas financial transactions that are included in the two subjects of ##"##overseas investment##"## and ##"## overseas exchange ##"##. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>In favorable circumstances only a minor degree of regulation of overseas financial transactions would be required. This could be exercised simply and directly through regulation of overseas exchange and overseas investment. It would thus be possible to avoid the cumbersome and rather vexatious procedure involved in licensing the import and export of goods. <inline font-style="italic">##[##Quorum formed.##'##}</inline></para>
                <para>I need hardly add that the maintenance of exchange stability is an essential part of any policy aimed at full employment. If this paragraph in the bill did no more than put beyond all possible doubt the power of the Commonwealth to maintain exchange stability in the post-war years, it should certainly be included. ##"## The raising of money ##"## is not a term of art in the law. It is a term in popular use, and means to obtain or procure money by means of collecting or otherwise. A person who collects gifts for a public institution ##"## raises ##"## money. But the expression also, and much more generally, refers to the raising of money by way of loan, for example, by capital issues, mortgages and the like. ##"## The raising of money ##"## is a narrower term than ##"## investment for it does not seem to include the investment by an undertaking of its profits in its own business. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Opposition correctly stated that the paragraph does not relate to public borrowing at all. That subject is dealt with exclusively by the Financial Agreement, which derives its force from section  105a  of the Constitution. That section gives paramount force to the Financial Agreement, notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in the Constitution. The powers to be conferred by this bill are all ##"## subject to ##"## the Constitution. There is, therefore, no possible conflict between this paragraph and the provisions of the Financial Agreement. </para>
                <para>At the ##'##Constitution Convention, the Premiers felt that a power to regulate private .borrowing in Australia would affect so many purely local transactions that the States ought to be associated in some way with the Commonwealth in the exercise of the power. The result was the suggestion which is incorporated in the present paragraph, viz., that the general principles on which the raising of money should be based are to be formulated by the Australian Loan Council, and that the Commonwealth will have power to make laws regulating the raising of money in accordance with those plans. </para>

As the honorable member for Warringah knows, there may be a tremendously strong tendency when money is available, to invest it in concerns and undertakings that are detrimental to the interests of the whole community. The example given by the Premier of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunstan,</inline> in the speech which I quoted, was amusement, parks as opposed to the erection of houses. That illustrates the principle. The powerwould not be applicable unless the Australian Loan Council laid down the principle.

                        <para>. - I agree with the statement of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> that the Commonwealth must possess this power. In the immediate post-war period one of the most important requirements will be some power to ##"## canalize investments when capital will be competing for goods in short supply. I believe also that labour for a period of fon r or five years after the war will be in short supply. Consequently, the Commonwealth must possess authority to eontrol these matters. I am particularly gratified that power is sought to control governmental spending. When I was Commonwealth Treasurer, a few years ago, I encountered difficulties as the result of the actions of certain State Premiers in seeking to circumvent the Financial Agreement. They displayed amazing astuteness in the way in which, by semi governmental borrowing, they overcame the obvious intention of the Financial Agreement. For example, they would establish corporations in different places, give them governmental functions and permit them to borrow upon the open market. But they were really the agents of the governments, who should have submitted their programmes to the Loan Council for approval.

                    <para>. - No honorable member will deny that the Commonwealth should have full authority in the sphere of civil aviation. This paragraph is intended to give that authority. The committee may be assisted if I state briefly the present constitutional position as to air navigation. The Commonwealth is a signatory to the Air Navigation Convention. The High Court has held that under the external affairs power the Commonwealth can make laws to implement the Convention ; but any such laws must keep within the four corners of the Convention, and must not be inconsistent with its terms. The Convention is concerned with domestic regulation of air transport in the signatory countries only insofar as it affects international air navigation. But, of course, there must in practice be only one sot of rules for conduct in the air, and for the management of aerodromes. Outside the matters dealt with by the Convention, the Commonwealth can use its power to regulate interstate commerce. But over civil aviation within the limits of a State the Commonwealth has no control. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The nature of aviation makes it essential that there shall be uniform regulation throughout Australia. Hence ##"##when the limitations affecting the existing Commonwealth law on the subject were realized, the States, after seventeen years of pressure and of unfulfilled agreements, passed laws giving effect within their boundaries to the Commonwealth regulations. These acts can at any time be repealed. Uniform regulation of civil aviation does at present exist, but only on sufferance. This Parliament cannot insist upon its continuance. And, in any case, it extends only to those matters which are within the scope of the international Convention. </para>
                <para>During the second-reading debate, the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White),</inline> who has specially studied air navigation, contended that there is no need at present for placing the Commonwealth##'##s position on a secure footing, because at the moment unified regulation exists. Having regard to the history of this very matter, that attitude seems to me a very casual and happy-go-lucky one. My colleague the Minister for Air and Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> reminded the House that the existing taxation and registration provisions in force in some States could readily be used to frustrate any national plan for the development of civil aviation after the war. Too little attention has been given to the fact that, outside of the matters dealt with by any international convention which may from time to time be in operation, the Commonwealth can rely only on its interstate commerce power, and this cannot effectively cover the field. That the power of the Commonwealth to control aviation should he limited by the necessity for a particular flight to be of an interstate character is, in this country which has comparatively few States, extremely dangerous. </para>

                        <para>- This paragraph deals with the uniformity of railway gauges, a matter which has been given special study, I understand, by the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward).</inline> Everybody agrees  that it would be in the interest of Australia if practical steps were ##"##taken, and the sooner the better, to secure uniformity of railway gauges throughout the great trunk lines of the continent. At the request of the Government, the Minister for Transport and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harold</inline> Clapp are at present engaged in formulating a plan with that end in view. Some discussion, however, took place during the second-reading debate as to what contribution this paragraph in the bill makes to the solution of the problem. Three things supply the key to the meaning of this paragraph. First, it was agreed to at the Convention by all of the State Premiers. Secondly, it must be read in conjunction with the existing railway sections of the Constitution. Thirdly, it must be read in conjunction with the new ##"## national works ##"## power proposed in paragraph (xi). In the light of those considerations, it can easily be seen that this paragraph does not substantially threaten or impair the control by the States of their existing railways. Under paragraphs (xxxii.) and (xxxiv.) of section 51 of the Constitution, the Commonwealth can acquire State railways and construct or extend railways in a State; but, in each case, the consent of the State concerned is necessary. </para>

                <para>It is doubtful whether either of these paragraphs would apply to the conversion to a standard Australian gauge of an existing State railway. Accordingly, when the bill relating to increased Commonwealth powers was being debated in the State Parliaments, the question was naturally asked whether the new power in paragraph (x) would enable the Commonwealth to direct a State to convert any or all of its existing lines to a standard gauge, at its own expense. Some lawyers thought that it would. Others considered that it would enable the Commonwealth to convert to standard gauge, at Commonwealth expense, such State railways as it thought fit, whether or not the State consented. The Parliaments of South Australia and Western Australia ##"## referred ##"## the matter to the Commonwealth in a form which made clear that the Commonwealth could not do either of these things. The matter they referred was ##"## the conversion of any railways of the State to a uniform Australian gauge on terms approved by the Parliament of the State##"##. </para>
                <para>I do not myself think that this amendment was necessary. Even, if the power in the paragraph did, as a mere matter of wording, permit a Commonwealth act directing a State to convert its railways at its own expense to standard gauge, there is no means known to the law by which the obligation could ,be made effective without an appropriation by the State Parliament. Similarly, whatever the wording of the paragraph, an attempt by the Commonwealth to carry out railway conversion works in a State, without the State##'##s assent, is outside the realm of practical politics. But, in any case, I do not consider that the paragraph would include either of the matters which were suggested as possibilities. Assuming this to be the case, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> found himself at a loss to explain why the paragraph should be in the bill at all. He thought that any necessary initiative by the Commonwealth could be undertaken, with State consent, either by way of a grant to a State under section 96, or in the exercise of paragraph (xi) of the present bill, which relates to ##"## national works ##"##. The most obvious step for the Commonwealth to take under this paragraph is to prescribe a standard Australian gauge, and to prohibit any new railway construction by a State except on that gauge. As my colleague, the Minister for Air pointed out in the ##"##second-reading debate, it cannot be assumed that the era of railway construction is now over. An exercise of power along these lines by the Commonwealth would prevent the further aggravation of the existing evils that flow from disparity of gauges. The alteration made in the form of this paragraph by the legislatures of South Australia and Western Australia is open to objection on the ground that it would deprive the Commonwealth of the only substantial new power which the paragraph does contain. Everything that the South Australian and Western Australian legislatures were prepared to ##"## refer ##"## can be done by the Commonwealth under paragraph (xi) of the bill. </para>

                    <para>.- A public ##"##work##"## is a construction or establishment or undertaking built or carried out for the public use, on behalf of the public, or at public expense. A ##"## national ##"## work is a public work authorized by the Commonwealth, as contrasted with a State or a municipality. I think that all members of the committee are agreed in principle that the Commonwealth should have this power. Public works are an essential element in securing full employment, especially at times when private enterprise has been undergoing dislocation, as has occurred during the war. The Commonwealth##'##s peace-time powers to give employment by means of public works are limited, as the Constitution now stands, by the number and character of its services. Apart from the postal and telegraphic services and the few Commonwealth railways, little more than office construction is required by the civil services. The Defence Force will always have substantial needs of both constructional services and supplies. As I pointed out earlier, the High Court##'##s decisions have left in a state of uncertainty the extent to which a defence establishment can in time of peace be used to produce supplies for disposal outside of the Defence Force itself. The##"## power in this paragraph will expressly enable the Commonwealth to take its proper part in planning and carrying out public works in aid of the policy of full employment. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> moved his amendment in such terms as to cut down this public works power by a prohibition against engaging in any industrial or commercial process which its present constitutional powers would not permit. I answered this contention in replying to the second-reading debate. At the present stage, it is perhaps sufficient to say that such a limitation would seriously impair the ability of the Commonwealth to use national works as an instrument to prevent or relieve unemployment. The Leader of the Opposition further stated that##'## the provisions requiring consent of a .State for the commencement of a national work in that State and State co-operation in the actual execution of the work should be dropped, as being likely to hamper the Commonwealth in exercising its powers. The answer is that these safeguards for the States were a part of the agreement which the Government deliberately entered into at the Convention. The Government  is  willing to honour its acceptance. In any  case,  I do not anticipate that difficulties will arise in the exercise of this power. It is not at all like stipulating for State consent to the making of a Commonwealth law with respect to divorce, or weights and measures, where Commonwealth policy might cut clean across existing State law. What is involved here is the expenditure of money and the development of resources. A State will be expected to desire and not to oppose the execution of national works within its boundaries. If not, its citizens will deal with the- Government of that State. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Opposition further objected that if the existing requirements of State consent and participation are to be retained, there would ##'## be no substantial difference between the power that the Commonwealth will have under the bill, and the existing power of the Commonwealth to make grants to the States under section 96 for the purpose of carrying out national works. I agree that, on paper, section 96 would appear to be very similar to the power contained in this paragraph. In practice, however, I imagine that the  results  will be very different. It is a question of initiative, responsibility, and direction. A Commonwealth Minister and his staff, under the power in the bill, will be actively responsible for planning the Commonwealth##'##s public  works  programme, and for defining the part which the State concerned can usefully play in assisting to execute, the works. The initiative will come from the Government responsible for planning the general economic policy of the nation. Under section 96, initiative naturally tends to come from the other end - the State  that  needs assistance. I commend this paragraph to the committee. </para>

                    <para>. - The term ##"## family allowances ##"##  13  not a technical term. It will include, however, any allowance which is given to a, family, and, I think, also to individuals through the medium, of or in virtue of their membership of a family. I remind the committee of the illustrations I gave i;i  my  second-reading speech - child endowment payments; widows##'## pensions; allowances for medical assistance; and allowances for vocational training, or university bursaries. Assistance for housing purposes would also be included. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> asked how it could be necessary to make express provision to authorize such payments as these, seeing  that  many of them  are  already being made under existing Commonwealth legislation. The position is i:1 some ways puzzling,  and  further explanation  may  be of service to  the  committee. </para>
                <para>The Constitution as it stands gives to the Commonwealth  express  power to make laws for ##"## invalid and old-age  pensions##"##,  section 51 (xxii.). It also gives power in relation to ##"## insurance other than State insurance##"##, section 51 (xiv.). Any other social service payments made by the Commonwealth must rest on someother foundation. In time of war, support could probably be found for most, if not all, of them in the defence power. But in time of peace that support would undoubtedly be withdrawn. The only other foundation would be the power implied by section 81 to appropriate money by law, from the Consolidated Revenue, for the purposes of the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>The question is whether ##"## the purposes of the Commonwealth##"## are those purposes only which fall within one or other of the subject-matters with respect  to  which this  Parliament  has power to make laws, or whether the Parliament can appropriate money for any purpose whatever thai,  ic  may think fit. If the word? of section 81 have the wider meaning, all the payments mentioned by the honorable member for Parramatta - maternity allowances, widows##'## pensions, child endowment, unemployment and sickness benefits, and pharmaceutical benefits, would be secure, even in time of peace. If the words have the narrower meaning, none of these payments would be valid under the Constitution as it now stands. </para>
                <para>The meaning of section 81 is doubtful. I accept entirely the statement on this point of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden).</inline> He remarked that successive Commonwealth governments, and successive Commonwealth parliaments, have in practice acted on the view that section 81 has the wider meaning. He pointed out that the matter was expressly left open by a majority of the High Court, in 1935, though two justices expressed the definite view that the section has the narrower meaning. The honorable gentleman also expressed his own personal opinion that  a3  a matter of law the narrower view is correct. </para>
                <para>The object of this paragraph of the bill is therefore to put this matter beyond doubt by placing family allowances on the same express footing as the social services already provided for by paragraphs (xiv.) and (xxii.) of section 51. </para>
                <para>The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition likewise provided for putting this matter beyond doubt. But he suggested that ##"## allowances ##"## may be too vague a term, and that ##"## endowment ##"## might be preferable. ##"##Endowment##"##, however, has now acquired a specific meaning in many quarters as denoting what this Parliament knows as ##"## child endowment##"##. For this reason a wider term should, I think, be used. </para>

                        <para>. - The inclusion of this paragraph of the bill is necessary only because of what has become a complete anomaly in paragraph (xxxvi.) of section 51 of the Constitution. That paragraph gives to this Parliament power to make laws with respect to ##"## the people of any race, other than the aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws##"##. The paragraph in the bill will have the same effect as an amendment suspending that exception for five years. I do not think that any objection has been raised to this paragraph. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> is aware that the matter he has raised has been considered by the Government. I wish to deal broadly with the first proposed-##'## sub-clause - freedom of speech and expression##'##. It is quite true, as the honorable member for Warringah has pointed out. that there is a limitation of time upon the inclusion of this guarantee. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para class="block">That limitation derives from the fact that all the powers .sought are of a temporary character, namely, for a period of five years after the cessation of hostilities ; but it is proposed by the Government that a convention be held to revise the Constitution including all these provisions, before the expiration of that period. I admit that at first sight it would seem to be anomalous to put a guarantee of this kind in the Constitution and to put a limitation of time upon Lt; but the whole basis of the proposals to be submitted to the people is that they are of a temporary character, the intention being that the whole of the Constitution will be revised and further amendments covering the same ground, or wider or narrower ground, will be put to the people before the end of that period. This is a vital clause. </para>
                <para>The wording of this proposed guarantee is based in part on the First Amendment, to the United States Constitution (1791) ; in part upon the language used by  President  Roosevelt in formulating the Four Freedoms ; and in part upon the wording of section 110 in our own Constitution. The guarantee is extended to State laws as well as Commonwealth laws. </para>
                <para>The position under the United States Constitution requires some explanation. In terms, the First Amendment applies only to federal law ; ##"## Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech or of the press ##"##. Since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, (1866), however, the courts have gradually come to apply the same guarantee against State law  a3  well. The Fourteenth Amendment does not expressly refer to ##"## the freedom of speech or of the press ##"##. It does, however, impose certain prohibitions on the States, and goes on to say: ##"##Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law ##"##. The courts have held that the ##"## liberty ##"## which is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment includes the liber tie.i protected by the First Amendment. The position in the United States to-day, as under this bill, is that freedom of speech is guaranteed as against both the Federation and the States. </para>
                <para>The First Amendment refers only to the freedom of ##"## speech ##"## and of ##"## press ##"##. </para>
                <para class="block">The courts have given a wide interpretation to both words, so that the guarantee has been held to apply to any form of oral or written expression. This is plainly a legitimate interpretation. But it is wiser, in inserting a new clause in our own Constitution, to adopt a more comprehensive form of words which cannot depend on nice distinctions between different modes of communicating thought.  President  Roosevelt##'##s ##"## Second Freedom##"## seems to supply just the generalization that is needed - ##"## freedom of speech and of expression ##"##. </para>
                <para>In considering the adoption, for the first time, of a guarantee of this kind, it is pertinent to ask two questions. First, will it give sufficient protection to be of real value to the individual ? Secondly, is it consistent with such recognition of social interests as will enable society to secure public safety, order and normality? </para>
                <para>Despite the proposed differences of wording, the experience of the United States of America is obviously of the utmost value in answering these questions. Since 1791, no American thinker has had to ask himself whether individual rights would be as well secured without the guarantees, or whether social interests would be more secured in their absence. The guarantees are there. I have certainly never heard of any movement for their repeal. The plain implication is that, over the generations, the guarantees have been so applied as to give neither too little protection to the individual nor too little power of control to society. The cases decided by the American courts fully bear out that conclusion. </para>
                <para>The provisions of a  guaranteee  of ##"## free speech ##"## cannot be applied with absolute literalness. So applied, they would mean, as the High Court at one time held ##"## freedom of interstate trade ##"## meant in section 92, that speech must be free from all forms of governmental control, and that only action could be  regullated  by society. The literal interpretation of our own section 92 has been rejected. Such an interpretation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments has never been accepted in the United States of America. The general proposition is that- </para>

In <inline font-style="italic">Schenck</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">United States</inline> (1919) 249 U.S. 47, the appellant had sent out to men who had been called up for military service a circular which attacked .the Conscription Act.

The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances##'## and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.

In dealing with an important guarantee like this, one must take into account the difficulty of application in the particular case. Nevertheless, the principle has solid advantages. ##"##We have to remember, too, that in the twentieth century there has been a tendency towards dictatorship, towards fascism. What has happened in Germany since 1933 illustrates that perfectly. As the dictator is coming into power, his first acts are, to close down on freedom of expression and then to prevent freedom of religious worship. That has happened in Germany, and I believe that the inclusion of this power may be helpful for the future of this country. The quotation continues - </para>

                    <para>Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and burnt women. It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears. To justify suppression of free speech there must be reasonable ground to fear that serious evil will result if free speech is practised. There must be reasonable ground to believe that the danger apprehended is imminent. There must bc reasonable ground to believe that the evil to be prevented is a serious one. </para>

If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence. </para>

                    <para>Persecution for the expression of opinions seems to me perfectly logical. If you have no doubt of your premises or your power, and want a certain result with all your heart, you naturally express your wishes in law and sweep away all opposition. To allow opposition by speech seems to indicate that you think the speech impotent, as when a man says that he has squared the circle, or that you do not care whole-heartedly for the result, or that you doubt either your power or your premises. But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct, that the ultimate good desired is better reached by  free  trade in ideas - that the best test of truth i-= the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. That, at any rate, is the theory of our Constitution. It is an experiment, as all life is an experiment. Every year, if not every day, we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge. While that experiment is part of our system, I think that we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loath and believe to be fraught with death, unless they so imminently threaten immediate interference with the lawful and pressing purposes of the law that an immediate check is required to save the country. . . . Only the emergency that makes it immediately dangerous to leave the correction of evil counsels to time warrants making any exception to the sweeping command, ##"## Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech ##"##. . . .

                <para>In <inline font-style="italic">Gitlow</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">People of New York</inline> ((1924) 268 ILS. 652) the appellant had been convicted of a statutory crime of criminal anarchy under the penal code of New York. ##"## Criminal anarchy ##"## was defined as ##"## the doctrine that organized government should be overthrown by force or violence ... or by any unlawful means ##"##. The advocacy of any such doctrine, either by word of mouth or writing, was declared to be a felony. The appellant had published a manifesto which plainly infringed the statute. The Supreme Court of the United States held that a State may constitutionally punish utterances which endanger the foundations of organized government and threaten its overthrow by force, violence and other unlawful means. I quote the following : - </para>

                    <para>It is a fundamental principle, long established, that the freedom of speech and of the press which is secured by the Constitution, does not confer an absolute right to speak or publish, without responsibility, whatever one may choose, or an unrestricted and unbridled license that gives immunity for every possible use of language and prevents the punishment of those who abuse this freedom. </para>
                    <para>Reasonably limited, it was said by Story in the passage cited, this freedom is an inestimable privilege in a free government; without such limitation, it might become the scourge of the republic. </para>
                    <para>That a State in the exercise of its police power may punish, those who abuse this freedom by utterances inimical to the public welfare, tending to corrupt public morals, incite to crime, or disturb the public peace, is not open to question. . . . Thus it was held by this Court in the <inline font-style="italic">Fox Case,</inline> that a State may punish publications advocating and encouraging a breach of its criminal laws; and, in the <inline font-style="italic">Gilbert Case,</inline> that a State may punish utterances teaching or advocating that its citizens should not assist the United States in prosecuting or carrying on war with its public enemies. </para>
                    <para>And, for yet more imperative reasons, a State may punish utterances endangering the foundations of organized government and threatening its overthrow by unlawful means. These imperil its own existence as a constitutional State. Freedom of speech and press, said Story, does not protect disturbances to the public peace or the attempt to subvert the government. It does not protect publications or teachings which tend to subvert or imperil the government or to impede or hinder it in the performance of its governmental duties. ... It does not protect publications prompting the overthrow of government by force; the punishment of those who publish articles which tend to destroy organized society being essential to the security of freedom and the stability of the State. . . . And a State may penalize utterances which openly advocate the overthrow of the representative and constitutional form of government of the United States and the several States, by violence or other unlawful means.  In short, this freedom does not deprive a State of the primary and essential right of self-preservation; which, so long as human governments endure, they cannot be denied. </para>

                    <para>The appellant##'##s solo offence, for which he was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for seven years, was that he had assisted in the conduct of a public meeting, albeit otherwise lawful, which was held under the auspices of the Communist party. The broad reach of the statute as thus applied is plain. While defendant was a member of the Communist party, that membership was not necessary to conviction on such a charge. A like fate might have attended any  speaker,  although not a member who ##"## assisted in the conduct ##"## of the meeting. However innocuous the object of the meeting, however lawful the subjects and tenor of the addresses, however reasonable and timely the discussion, all those assisting in the conduct of the meeting would be subject to imprisonment as felons if the meeting were held by the Communist party. Freedom of speech and of the press are fundamental rights </para>
                    <para>These rights may be abused by using  speech  or press or assembly in order to incite to violence and crime. The people through their legislatures may protect themselves against that abuse. But the legislative intervention can find constitutional justification only by dealing with the abuse. The. righto themselves  7n  us t not be curtailed. The greater the importance of safeguarding the community from incitements to the overthrow of our institutions by force and violence, the more imperative is the need to preserve inviolate the constitutional rights of free speech, free press and free assembly in order to maintain the opportunity for free political discussion, to the end that Government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes, if desired, may be obtained by peaceful means. Therein lies the security of the Republic, the very foundation of  constitutional  government. </para>
                    <para>The question, if the rights of free speech and peaceable assembly are to be preserved, is not as to the auspices under which the meeting is held but as to its purpose; not as to the relations of the speakers, but whether their utterances transcend the bounds of the freedom of speech which the Constitution protects. If the persons assembling have committed crimes elsewhere, if they have formed or are engaged in a conspiracy against the public peace and order, they may be prosecuted for their conspiracy or other violation of valid laws. But it is a different matter when the State, instead of prosecuting them for such offences, seizes upon mere participation in a peaceable assembly and a lawful public discussion as the basis for a criminal charge. </para>

                    (308 U.S. 149). A municipal ordinance provided that ##"## no person shall distribute in, or place upon any street or way, any placard, handbill . . . advertisement or paper of any description ##"##. Under this ordinance appellants were convicted of an offence for having distributed in a street leaflets announcing a protest meeting in connexion with the administration of State unemployment insurance. Another municipal ordinance enacted that ##"## no person . shall canvass, solicit or distribute circulars or other matter or call from house to house  without first having reported to and received a written permit from the chief of police ##"##. Applicants were required to go through an elaborate procedure of identification and the chief of police was directed to refuse a permit wherever he was satisfied that the canvasser was not of good character or was canvassing for a project not free##'## from fraud. Under this ordinance the appellant was convicted of having canvassed without a permit. She was a member of a religious society, and as such, went from house to house distributing booklets. The Supreme Court held both ordinances unconstitutional, as abridging the freedom of speech. These passages are from its judgment -

                    <para>Municipal authorities, as trustees for the public, have the duty to keep their communities##'## streets open and available for movement of people and property, the  primary  purpose to which the streets are dedicated. So long as legislation to this end does not abridge the constitutional liberty of one rightfully upon the street to impart information through speech or the distribution of literature, it may lawfully regulate the conduct of those using the streets. For example, a person could not exercise this liberty by taking his stand in the middle of a crowded street, contrary to traffic regulations, and maintain his position to the stoppage of all traffic; a group of distributors could not insist upon a constitutional right to form a cordon across the street and to allow no pedestrian to pass who did not accept a tendered leaflet; nor does the guarantee of freedom of speech or of the press deprive a municipality of power to enact regulations against throwing literature broadcast in the streets. Prohibition of such conduct would not abridge the constitutional liberty since such activity bears no necessary relationship to the freedom to speak, write, print or distribute information or opinion. This court has characterized the freedom of speech and that of the press as fundamental personal rights and liberties. The phrase is not an empty one and was not lightly used. It reflects the belief of the framers of the Constitution that exercise of the rights lies at the foundation of free government by free men. It stresses, as do many opinions of this court, the importance of preventing the restriction of enjoyment of these liberties. </para>
                    <para>We arc of opinion that the purpose to keep the streets clean and of good appearance is insufficient to justify an ordinance which prohibits a person rightfully on a public street from handing literature to one willing to receive it. Any burden imposed upon the city authorities in cleaning and caring for the streets as an indirect consequence of such distribution results from the constitutional protection of the freedom of speech and press. This constitutional protection does not deprive a city of all power to prevent street littering. There are obvious methods of preventing littering. Amongst these is the punishment of those who actually throw papers on the streets. </para>

                    <para>The ordinance is not limited to those who canvass for private profit; nor is it merely the common type of ordinance requiring some form of registration or licence of hawkers, or peddlers. It is not a general ordinance to prohibit trespassing. It bans unlicensed communication  of any views or the advocacy of any cause from door to door, and permits canvassing only subject to the power of a police officer to determine, as a censor, what literature may be distributed from house to house and who may distribute it. The applicant must submit to that officer##'##s judgment evidence as to his good character and as to- the absence of fraud in the ##"## project ##"## he proposes to .promote or the literature he intends to distribute, and must undergo a burdensome and inquisitorial examination, including photographing and finger-printing. In the end, his liberty to communicate with the residents of the town at their homes depends upon the exercise of the officer##'##s discretion. </para>
                    <para>Conceding that fraudulent appeals may be made in the name of charity and religion, we hold a municipality cannot, for this reason, require all who wish to disseminate ideas to present them first to police authorities for their consideration and approval, with a discretion in the police to say some ideas may, while others may not, be carried to the homes of citizens; some persons may, while others may not, disseminate information from house to house. Frauds may be denounced as offences and punished by law. Trespasses may similarly be forbidden. If it is said that these means arc less efficient and convenient then bestowal of power on police authorities to decide what information may be disseminated from house to house, and who may impart the information, the answer is that considerations of this sort do not empower a municipality to abridge freedom of speech and press. </para>

An act of the legislature of that State required a licence for permission to sell advertising space in any publication having a circulation of over 20,000. I emphasize the fact that this was a State act. No question arose as to whether it was a law with respect to any particular subject-matter. On its face, the act was ##&amp;## valid exercise of the State##'##s general power to regulate commercial transactions in the State. In fact, however, all the publications affected were opponents of the Huey Long administration in Louisiana. The act was held. invalid, as abridging the freedom of the press. Here again the court penetrated to the real substance and object of a measure, though it was superficially directed towards lawful constitutional ends. </para>

All these powers are to be given for a limited period. I see no harm whatever in including this fundamental constitutional guarantee for that period. The intention is not that it shall then disappear, but that, in the light of the experience of its working, and also of the working of the fourteen additional legislative powers, Parliament shall, before the end of the five-year period, examine the matter afresh and decide whether it would not be wise - and I think it will determine that it is wise - to include such a guarantee permanently in our Constitution. I commend it to the committee as an important, step in safeguarding democratic rights in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- He told us that he thought it would do no harm; but that is not a reason. He told us also that it would come up for reconsideration five years hence, but that again is no reason. There is no justification whatever for limiting the period to five years. When the Attorney-General brought his bill before the Constitution Convention he thought fit to include both these powers as permanent alterations of the Constitution. If this power is a good one, as I believe it to be, and as the Attorney-General obviously believes it to be, it should ##"##be written permanently into the Constitution. Just as every permanent part of the Constitution can be reviewed by any convention called for the review of the Constitution as a whole, so can this power, if placed on a permanent basis, be reviewed. The Government will ##'##do its cause a great deal of harm if it insists upon limiting this provision to five years. Its action will be misunderstood and misrepresented. It if also absurd that the provision guaranteeing freedom of religion should be limited to a period of five years. It, too, should be a permanent part of the Constitution. We have heard much about the four freedoms mentioned in the Atlantic Charter. It is here proposed to write two of them into our Constitution - for a period of five years only. There will be important interests anxious to defeat the Government##'##s proposals. There are, for example, Labour men who give lip-service to the ideal of greater Commonwealth powers, but, who, because their interests lie in the preservation of the powers of State Parliaments, will, ##"## under the lap ##"##, do their best to defeat the Govern.ment##'##s proposals. Other interests will fight bitterly against the attempt to control profits mid prices. The Government, should avoid providing opportunities for the raising of false isues. It should, therefore, make these powers a permanent part of the Constitution. </para>

                <para class="block">Evatt) was suggested in the first place by the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender).</inline> It was not in the original draft of the bill. Having regard to the speech just made by the honorable member for Warringah, I should say that the amendment were better left out of the bill. When I say that, I hope it will not be thought that I am in favour of any undue limitations upon freedom of speech or freedom of expression. I think it is probable indeed, I know it is a fact that my belief in freedom of speech and freedom of expression goes, to some extent, beyond what the Government considers reasonable and properin all circumstances. I point out that, under the laws which have been promulgated and put into operation by means of regulations issued by the Government, prosecutions have been launched against citizens for reasons which I regard as insufficient. In some cases, it is true, the prosecutions have failed for technical reasons, but in others they have been carried through and convictions obtained. The honorable member for Warringah is apparently blissfully unaware of the fact that there is in existence a large body of law which makes it a penal offence on the part of a person to say anything which might tend to influence other persons in opposition to the war, or in promotion of the ideal of peace. Indeed, it is an offence even to analyse and examine propositions, however well meant, or however disinterestedly expressed, for arrangements on the basis of reason between nations at war. Prosecutions have been laid and continued against individuals of the highest character, men whose reputations cannot be impugned, men of such nobility of character indeed as to make it clear that they were influenced by the highest spiritual considerations based upon Holy Writ itself. That has not saved them from prosecution. Apparently, that will not, in the view of the Attorney-General, save persons from prosecutions in the future. That is where freedom of speech stands. </para>

It was my intention to assist the re-shaping of this measure in such a way that it would be acceptable to the people of Australia. The Country party voted for the second reading of the bill in the belief that its defects could be remedied at the committee stage. We were informed that having departed from its original plan  30  far as the structure of this bill was concerned, the Government would be prepared to consider other amendments which had not been agreed to by the Convention. Unfortunately, in spite of the fact that the Country party voted for the second reading of the bill, when the measure reached the committee stage, my colleagues and I encountered strenuous opposition from the Government and from the  Chairman  of Committees who, in his endeavours- </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw any reflection that I may have cast upon the  -Chairman  of Committees, and shall content myself by saying that for one and a-half hours we on this side of the chamber had the greatest difficulty in endeavouring to bring certain amendments before the Committee at the time when we considered they would have been of the most assistance in refraining this measure. In fact, as a result of what took place at that time, this chamber, for a while seemed to lose its deliberative character, and to become something in the nature of a ##"##rough house ##"##. Consequently, members of the Country party have not participated in discussions of the various details of the bill to the degree that we intended originally. However, the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> moved an amendment for me, relating to the organized marketing of primary products that removed the obstacle of section 92 and the acceptance of that amendment by the Government would have enabled members of the Country party to support the measure. As the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> are aware,- at the Canberra Convention, I raised the very point which I sought to cover by means of an amendment, namely, the need to ensure organized marketing upon a basis which would enable Australia to compete with other countries, immediately after the war, by reason of the fact that section 92 would no longer be an impediment. </para>

                        <para>- I am merely drawing attention to the fact that the amendments which have been moved by the Attorney-General will extend the scope of the bill beyond its present limits. I also gave notice that I would move certain amendments to extend the scope of the bill, but as the measure in my opinion, still discriminates against primary producers, I see no reason for moving those amendments, because the rejection of the original amendment will make the bill unacceptable to country people. However, I still say to the Attorney-General and to the Government, that despite the fact that these fresh powers are to be incorporated in the bill, a last-minute endeavour should be made to secure the co-operation of the States in regard to powers to be exercised cooperatively by the Commonwealth for a five-year period only. Other matters in respect of which permanent Commonwealth power is desirable and- in which co-operation is not so necessary, should be put before the people on that basis. </para>

                <para class="block">Warringah desired to do was to incorporate proposed permanent and temporary amendments of the Constitution in the one hill. That would not minimize confusion; it would create confusion. I cannot imagine any referendum being carried by the people if they were asked to vote for a bill which provided for some amendments to be incorporated permanently, and others to be incorporated for a period of only five years. The alternative to that would be to submit the two proposals in separate bills. Then the people would be asked to vote for one bill for permanent inclusion, and another bill for temporary inclusion, of certain provisions in the Constitution, and I believe that would confuse the people much more than the simple method which the Government proposes to follow, namely, to incorporate all its amendments for five years only. No one would be robbed of religious freedom, or freedom of speech and expression, if those freedoms were guaranteed for a period of five years, with the proviso that, before that period had expired, the people should be given an opportunity, in an atmosphere of peace, arid with every person now away at the war back in civil employment, to consider what permanent improvements or alterations should be made to the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- I have said, too, that I should like to see that permanently included in the Constitution. The attitude of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> is quite clear. When he came to this House with a certain bill in 1942, he not merely proposed the permanent inclusion in the Constitution of the right of freedom of speech and freedom of religion, but also he wished to make permanent provision in the Constitution for freedom from want, and the legislative measures were set up. That bill proposed a permanent alteration of the Constitution in respect of everything that the measure contained. The Canberra Convention supervened, however, and it was decided unanimously that powers should be sought for a limited period only, or, in other words, that the ##'##Commonwealth should be on probation for a certain term. It would be a departure from the spirit of the Canberra -Convention, and of the agreement which emanated from it, if we now sought the permanent incorporation of certain additional powers - safeguards if you wish to call them that - and the temporary inclusion of certain other legislative powers. I can imagine many people saying, if the referendum were held: ##"## Why do you want to incorporate freedom of religion and freedom of speech and expression permanently in the Constitution, when you are not seeking to include those other powers permanently ? ##"## We should be in a continuous state of argument and disputation, in our endeavours to tell the people why we had to do certain things because we had agreed with the State Premiers to do them, and why we had to do certain other things because we believed that certain powers should be incorporated permanently. The honorable member for Warringah will not be helping the Government to pass the referendum - and I am sure that he desires to help the Government: - if he insists upon these distinctions between permanent inclusion and temporary inclusion. </para>

                <para>I am afraid that the attitude adopted by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> is not helpful at all, because he seeks to include certain legislative power permanently in the Constitution at this stage. In effect, that would tear up the Canberra agreement. We recognize the difficulty of trying to persuade the people to carry any referendum; but we think that we are on very safe grounds if we ask them to vote for something upon which the leaders of all political parties have agreed. There cannot be much wrong with a proposal that has undergone, the closest scrutiny and won the unanimous support of persons of all shades of political opinion in the Commonwealth and State Parliaments. We are asking the people to vote for or against the Canberra agreement, plus the safeguards which subsequent thought has decided it would be desirable to include. </para>

                    <para>. - I listened intently to the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> and if what he said is to be the explanation that is to be given to the people I do not like the Government##'##s chance of getting this proposal accepted at the referendum. I am not concerned about helping the Ciovernment as such, but I am concerned  to  get the people to accept something in which I believe. The simple answer  to  the Minister##'##s question is that, in the first place, the Government is already going beyond the agreement with the Premiers, because it is including certain additional provisions, so that cannot be an argument at a ll ; and, in the second place, one subject-matter of the bill is additional powers to be vested in this Parliament, whereas what we are dealing##'## with now is not power vested in the Parliament but a prohibition against the Parliament doing something. Powers vested in the Parliament and safeguards to the people are entirely different. For the life of me I cannot see why the Government cannot say to the people : ##"## These are the safeguards which we want to write permanently into the Constitution, and those are the powers which we want temporarily and which you shall have an opportunity to reconsider ##"##. Not with a desire to help or hinder any one, but with knowledge of how some people are thinking on this matter, I say that if the Government goes to the people with a proposal that safeguards which are fundamental to our way of living shall be provided for only five years it will do the referendum great harm. </para>

                    <para>. - It  is obvious at a glance that the safeguards proposed by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> in proposed new sub-section  1a  are entirely different from the powers which are being sought in proposed new section  51a.  No honorable member, having regard to the long and exhaustive debate which took place on the second reading and the discussion of the provisions of this bill in committee, should have any doubt that the powers asked for are merely indicative of the kind of authority that the Commonwealth ought to exercise when it is fully empowered to deal with matters of common interest to the nation. Such guarantees will be permanently written into the Constitution when steps are taken permanently to alter it. There are many guarantees which ought to be written into the Constitution. Some I referred to in my second-reading speech as having been written into the Constitution of the Irish Free State, a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations. One safeguard that I should like to see permanently incorporated in the Constitution is that of the liberty of the subject which has been infringed by regulations. </para>

                <para class="block">In the sphere of religious freedom, it is not proposed to adopt any new principle. Section  116,  the principal source of which is the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America, already forbids the Commonwealth to make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion. It also provides that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth, but that guarantee applies only as against this Parliament. There is nothing similar to it in the Constitution of any State except that of Tasmania. A new section  46  was inserted in the Tasmanian Constitution in  1934.  This section is  modelled on section 116 of the Commonwealth Constitution, though it does not follow that model exactly. In particular a qualification which is implicit in section 116 is stated explicitly in the Tasmanian section. The guarantee of freedom of conscience aud the free profession and practice of religion is expressly made ##"####'##.subject to public order and morality##"##. The present proposal is to apply section 116 to the States. </para>
                <para>In the United States of America the position in respect of religious freedom is the same as the position I have described to the committee in respect of freedom of speech. The First Amendment applies, in terms, only to Congress. But the courts have interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment as protecting, against the States, all the liberties which the First Amendment guarantees as against the Federation. </para>
                <para>Not all of our own section 116 is derived from the First Amendment. The prohibition against the imposition of a religious test as a qualification for office is based on a provision contained in Article VI. in the Constitution of the United States of America. No prohibition against imposing a religious observance is found in the First Amendment. A similar phrase, however, is found in a number of the State constitutions. </para>
                <para>The right which the First Amendment was intended to secure was clearly explained by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1890 in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Davis</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Season</inline> (133 U.S. 333,342)-- </para>

                    <para>Thc First Amendment was intended to allow every one under the jurisdiction of the United States to entertain such notions respecting his relations to his Maker and the duties they impose as may bo approved by his judgment and conscience, and to exhibit his sentiments in such form of worship as he may think proper, not injurious to the equal rights of others, and to prohibit legislation for the support of any religious tenets, or the modes of worship of any sect. The oppressive measures adopted, and the cruelties and punishments inflicted, by the governments of Europe for many ages, to compel parties to conform in their religious beliefs, and modes of worship to the views of the most numerous sect, and the folly of attempting in that way to control the mental operations of persons, and enforce an outward conformity to a prescribed standard, led to the adoption of this amendment. </para>

                <para>The exercise of religion, like the exercise of any other right, may impinge on the rights of other individuals and of society. As with freedom of speech and expression, a balance has to be struck between individual right and public order. In applying the guarantees of religious liberty, the courts of the United States of America have acted on the same principles as in applying the guarantees of free speech. In the sphere of religion, as in that of speech and expression, the constitutional guarantee has been a real protection to the individual, but without prejudice to the vital interest of society in maintaining order and morality. </para>
                <para>I cite some of the leading cases - both those in which the guarantee was successfully invoked and those in which measures of social control were upheld. </para>
                <para>In 1925 the Supreme Court of the United States of America decided the case of <inline font-style="italic">Pierce</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Society of Sisters</inline> (266 U.S. 510 J. The State of Oregon had passed a compulsory education act requiring every child between the ages of eight and sixteen to attend a public school. The Society of Sisters was a religious organization, which maintained a system of private schools in which the pupils received religious as well ##'##as secular education. The Supreme Court held that the statute was unconstitutional.

                <para>In 1939, in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Cantwell v. Connecticut</inline> (310 U.S. 296) the Supreme Court, while asserting that freedom to act in the exercise of religion must be subject to regulation for the protection of society, again emphasized that, in obtaining a permissible end, regulation must not unduly infringe the protected freedom. In that case, the State statute forbade any person to solicit money, services or subscriptions for any alleged religious, charitable or philanthropic cause from anybody but a member of his own organization, unless the cause had been approved by the secretary of a public welfare council. The appellants were convicted of having solicited contributions for a religious society, without the prescribed approval. The court held that, in effect, the statute submitted the exercise of the appellants##'## religion to the censorship of an administrative official - </para>

                    <para>The State is likewise free to regulate the time and manner of solicitation generally, in the interest of public safety, peace, comfort or convenience.- But to condition the solicitation of aid for the perpetuation of religious views or systems upon a licence, the grant of which rests in the exercise of a determination by State authority as to what is a religious cause, is to lay a forbidden burden upon the exercise of liberty protected by the Constitution. </para>

                <para>On the other side of the line, a number of cases have made clear that freedom of religious practice must not be made the excuse for failure to comply with the reasonable dictates of public order. The leading case is <inline font-style="italic">Davis</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Beason</inline> in 1890, to which I have already referred. A person belonging to the Mormon sect challenged the validity of a statute which provided that no person should be entitled to vote at any election if he was a member of any organization which practised bigamy or polygamy as a doctrinal rite. The Supreme Court held that the statute was valid. After stating, in the language I have quoted, the real intention of the First Amendment, the Court went on to say - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>It was never intended or supposed that the Amendment could be invoked as a protection against legislation for the punishment of acts inimical to the peace, good order and morals of society. _With man##'##s relations to his Maker and the obligation he may think they impose, and the manner in which an expression shall be made by him of his beliefs on those subjects, no interference can be permitted, provided always the laws of society, designed to secure its peace and prosperity, and the morals of its people, are not interfered with. However free the exercise of religion may be, it must be subordinate to the criminal laws of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> country, passed with reference to actions regarded by general consent as properly the subjects of punitive legislation. </para>

                <para>In 1934, the Supreme Court decided the case of <inline font-style="italic">Hamilton</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Regents of the University of California.</inline> Under State law, the university required every able-bodied male student under the age of twenty-four years to complete a course in military science and tactics. The appellant objected on religious grounds to war and military training. He claimed an injunction declaring him entitled by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment to attend the university without undergoing the course in military training. The court upheld the State law. The plaintiff had not been in any way compelled to attend the university. That was his own free election. To prescribe a course in military training was itself a lawful measure. It could validly be applied to the plaintiff, notwithstanding his religious beliefs. </para>
                <para>The High Court of Australia has on two occasions considered the operation of section 116 of our- own Constitution. In 1912 in <inline font-style="italic">Krygger</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Williams</inline> (15 C.L.R, 366) the court held that the compulsory military training provisions of the Defence Act do not prohibit the free exercise of any religion. A like decision was reached during the first world war by the Supreme Court of the United States of America in relation to the conscription imposed by the Selective Draft Law of 1917. I refer honorable gentlemen to the Selective Draft Law Cases ((1918) 245 U.S. 366). </para>
                <para>In 1943 the High Court of Australia applied to the National Security (Subversive Associations) Regulations the principles laid down in the American decisions I have referred to. This was the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide Society of Jehovah##'##s Witnesses</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">the Commonwealth</inline> ((1943) 67 C.L.R. 116). The object of these regulations was to put an end to the existence of bodies the continued existence of which was regarded as being prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth or the efficient prosecution of the war. The court held unanimously that these regulations did not contravene section 116. </para>

Conflicts in the exercise of rights arise, and the conflicting forces seek adjustments in the courts, as do these parties, claiming on the one side the freedom of religion, speech and the press, guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, and on the other the right to employ the sovereign power  explicity  reserved to the State by the Tenth Amendment to ensure orderly living, without which constitutional guarantees of civil liberties would be a mockery. Courts, no more than constitutions, can intrude into the consciences of men or compel them to believe contrary to##'## their faith or think contrary to their convictions; but courts are competent to adjudge the acts men do under colour of a constitutional right, such as that of freedom of speech or of the press or the free exercise of religion, and to determine whether the claimed right is limited by other recognized powers, equally precious to mankind. So the mind and spirit of man remain forever free, while his actions rest subject to necessary accommodation to the competing needs of his fellows. </para>

To proscribe the dissemination of doctrines or arguments which do not transgress military or moral limits is to destroy the principal bases of democracy - knowledge and discussion. One man, with views contrary to the rest of his compatriots, is entitled to the privilege of expressing his ideas by speech or broadside to any one willing to listen or to read. Too many settled beliefs have in time been rejected to justify this generation in refusing a hearing to its own dissentients. Hut that hearing may be limited by action of the proper legislative body to times, places and methods for the enlightenment of the community which, in view of existing social and economic conditions, arc not at odds with the preservation of peace and good order.

                    <para>Another historic right which applies to both citizens and aliens is that of freedom of religion. The original settlers in the American colonies had in many instances left their English and French homes to seek freedom of religion; consequently this right has been particularly dear to large numbers of their descendants. On occasion there has been intolerance - even on the part of those who themselves suffered hardships in order to worship God as they believed proper. The Klan scourge -which spread so amazingly through the South and Midwest during the 1920##'##s indicates how far religious intolerance can be carried even in this day and age. The  recent  treatment of the Jehovah Witnesses has been interpreted toy some observers as a definite denial of freedom. However, there has been no serious agitation for a State Church and in general this right has been well safeguarded. </para>
                    <para>It should be noted that religious freedom does not carry with it the right to engage in practices that violate the criminal laws or the regulations relating to public nuisances. Members of a sect which stresses the importance of a practical display of faith killed their two children one night, with the expectation that their faith in the power of God v.-ould restore  them  to life before the morning dawned. Of course, they were not permitted to escape the clutches of the law when their faith failed although they had had unblemished reputations in the community in which they lived. Congregations of Holy Hollers sometimes are hauled into court for disturbing the .peace with their loud singing, speaking in tongues, and noisy conduct during  the  late evening hours; freedom of religion does not justify such practices. </para>

                    <para>Among the historic rights, obtained only after centuries of struggle, which we to-day have inherited are those of freedom of speech and of the press. Some unsophisticated persons imagine that these rights are unlimited and confer the license to say anything or print anything that may be desired. Actually they always have certain restrictions attached to them and during times of national emergency may even be drastically curtailed. In ordinary times these rights are restricted in sofar as they involve slander, indecency, incitement to insurrection, and similar offences against the public welfare. Even if statements of an indecent character are based on facts, freedom of speech does not permit their public utterance, lest public morals be contaminated. </para>
                    <para>The last decades have seen several attempts toreduce the scope of freedom of the press. Minnesota passed a law in 1925 which provided for the suppression of a ##"##malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper, magazine or other periodical##"##; apparently with the intention of closing up newspapers which had the temerity to criticize certain politicians. The Supreme Court, while admitting that penalties could be enforced against newspapers which violated the accepted canons of propriety, declared that the Minnesota statute went too far toward destroying freedom of the press. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Minton</inline> led a crusade in the 1930##'##s to muzzle the press in criticizing the New Deal, but he failed to get his bill through Congress. </para>
                    <para>During war-time it is invariably the custom to impose added restrictions upon speech and the press. The Sedition Act of 1798, the Espionage Act of 1917, the Sedition Act of 1918, and sections of emergency legislation passed in 1941 are but a few of the laws that Congress has passed on the subject. In 1941 a special section of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was set up to deal with cases in which it appeared that speech or the press conflicted with the national defence programme. Even in times of national emergency the U.S. record is reasonably good, although it is true that on several occasions there have been ##"## scares ##"## which led to excesses. One of the encouraging aspects of the picture is that the courts, especially the Supreme Court, have remained somewhat above the clamour of certain public officials and ##"## super-patriots ##"## for almost complete abandonment of those rights. </para>

                <para>Outside of Parliament, people speak a t times as if there were at present something in the Constitution, or in the law of the Commonwealth, which deprived this Parliament of any opportunity of reviewing the regulations made by the Executive in the exercise of statutory powers, and which put the Executive in a dictatorial position, above even Parliament. Members of this committee know, of course, that there is no legal foundation whatever for such an impression. Delegated legislation is subject to review by each House. If, in practice, the Houses do not exercise their powers of r eview as actively as they should, that is a political matter, without any effect on the legal position. </para>

                <para>I draw attention to four points in this section. First, in the normal case, a regulation will take effect upon notification, and will already he in operation when it is laid before the Houses. Secondly, unless Parliament is sitting, the members of the Houses will not receive any formal notice of the making of a regulation until the Houses re-assemble. Thirdly, the rule is only a rule of interpretation. It can be excluded, in relation to any act, by a contrary expression of intention in that act, and it can at any time be repealed by ordinary act. Fourthly, so long as this section is in operation and so long as the Houses are reasonably vigilant, each House has the same power to prevent a regulation of which it disapproves from remaining in operation as it has to prevent a bill of which it disapproved from becoming law. </para>
                <para>Government by delegated legislation has, inevitably, been carried to great lengths during the war, and the Executive has found it necessary to regulate in some detail many of the ordinary day to day affairs of the community. There is an inevitable public reaction at the moment against the whole system of delegated legislation. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and important books were written in answer to that work. The practice of delegating legislative powers to the Executive is, nevertheless, a universal one in democratic communities. Critics who are best informed in the matter are of opinion that the practice is both necessary and, where Parliament carries out its own duties effectively, advantageous. It is the duty of this Parliament to view the situation in proper perspective. This Parliament##'##s duty is to avoid taking any step which, though in accord with the apparent feeling of the moment, would in the long run injure the community by imposing unnecessary fetters upon the processes of government. </para>

                <para>The amendment proposed by the Government is based on the following assumptions :  - First, that in normal times Parliament could with advantage be given a fuller opportunity of supervising the delegated legislative work of the Executive. Secondly, that it would be advantageous to embody rules for this purpose in the Constitution itself, and thus put them beyond the reach of casual revocation by Parliament. Thirdly, that the manner in which the Parliament organizes itself for the purpose of supervising delegated legislation is a matter for each House to determine in its own discretion, and not a matter which should be embodied in the Constitution. </para>
                <para>The proposed amendment is based generally upon the present law, but makes two substantial changes. In the first place, the proposed new sub-section ensures that, whether the Houses are sitting or not, members of each House shall receive notice, in such manner as the Parliament itself specifies, of the contents of the regulation. In the second place, the regulation, instead of coming into operation immediately on the date of its notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> will not take effect until fourteen days after its contents have been notified to each member of both Houses. </para>
                <para>The idea underlying the proposal to give notice in every case to the members of both chambers is, of course, that this will place on each member an individual  responsibility for deciding whether or not the proposed regulation is to take effect. In principle, this is probably a more real responsibility than that of deciding merely whether an existing regulation shall be disallowed or left to take effect. It is a departure from existing practice, and should be most valuable. </para>
                <para>If Parliament is not actually sitting when notice is##'## given of the contents of a regulation, there is no formal provision in the amendment for the taking of any action by a member who disapproves of the making of the regulation. He can, of course, approach the leaders of his party, or the Government, or other members, with a view to taking immediate action to prevent the regulation from taking effect. If it were found that a substantial body of opinion among individual members disapproved a regulation, a government would, no doubt, withdraw it before it took effect. This is not in itself an absolute safeguard. But it is a very great improvement on the present position. For, as things now stand, a member does not receive any formal notice of the making of a regulation unless he happens to see a press announcement or obtains a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline></para>
                <para>Provisions requiring proposals for the making of regulations to be notified have long been in partial operation in Britain, and from 1904 until 1916 were in operation also in Australia. Such a system, however, caused delay, and the relevant legislation contains provisions enabling the Executive to make regulations forthwith in any cases where it was deemed to be urgently necessary to do so. In practice, it was found that resort to the emergency provision became very common. During the last war, the whole system in Australia providing for the notification of proposed regulations was abandoned. The Government has thought it wise to incorporate in the proposed amendment a provision along these lines postponing the operation of regulations until, the expiration of a specified period of. notice......  </para>

                <para class="block">Parliament is required along two lines. First, it will be necessary for Parliament to make some legislative provision for determining the manner in which the contents of regulations are to be notified to members, both when the Houses are sitting and when they are not. Secondly, the Houses will no doubt duly lay down means of organizing their proceedings so that they will be able to-take full advantage of the opportunity of giving better supervision to the legislation made under statutory powers by the Executive. </para>
                <para> Members of the committee may have observed that, under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the proposed new sub-section, the power reserved to each House is to disapprove of a regulation before it comes into effect. That is to say, the power can only be exercised within fourteen days after the notice of the contents of the regulation has been sent to members. In other words, the power is exercisable as a preliminary to the coming into operation of a regulation. Moreover, section 48 will, no doubt, also remain in operation, with or without some modification, in addition to the new constitutional guarantee. </para>
                <para>Section 48 applies to all statutory rules, whether of a ##"## legislative character ##"## or not. It is proposed, in accordance with the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition, that the new guarantee should operate in respect only of exercises of delegated power which are of a ##"## legislative character ##"##. This expression has been considered by the High Court in one or two cases during the war, with reference to orders under section  5  of the National Security Act. The court has held, in effect, that the test of whether an instrument is of a legislative character is whether it purports of its own force to impose legal obligations, or whether it can properly be regarded as merely executing or implementing a law laid down by some other body. The distinction is between the delegation of power to make the law, which necessarily involves a discretion as to what it shall be,, and conferring ari authority or##'## discretion as to its execution,- to be exercised under and in pursuance of the law. For instance, if an act gives to the Governor-General power to make regulations with respect to the employment of transport workers, the resultant regulations would be legislative in character, for the Governor-General  would  have complete discretion as to what the law should be. On the other hand, if the act required a person to give such particulars at such times and in such manner as the Governor-General .should prescribe, the specification of time and manner  by  the </para>
                <para>Governor-General  would not  be  legislative  but  would be executive in character; for all the Governor-General would do would be to exercise his discretion in specifying the matters on which the legislative command would operate. The limitation of the constitutional guarantee  to  exercises of power which have a ##"## legislative character##"## is sound in principle. It is only in issuing regulations of a legislative character that the Executive is really acting as the delegate of, and substitute for, Parliament. </para>

It is riot to the point to say that the right is at present reserved to us to disallow regulations. Every honorable member knows that regulations come out in a substantial spate, and in all probability the rate of promulgation will not diminish after the war. It is not always easy to appreciate quickly the actual effect of regulations immediately they are issued. The full force of regulations frequently dawns upon us a long while after their promulgation, when we consider them in relation to specific facts placed before us. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The Minister responsible for their promulgation frequently realizes afterwards that they have a far wider scope than was thought at first. In fact, the administrator to whom the power is delegated is often found to exercise power which the Minister, had no intention to delegate to him. I say with all respect to the Attorney-General that the proposed provision now under consideration is valueless. It is to operate for only five years, but beyond that it will apply only to regulations made under the new powers proposed to be granted. What is the reason for the distinction in respect of regulations promulgated under the new powers? </para>

                        <para>- The Minister who interjects does not pay proper regard to a serious submission. If this bill becomes law, then for five years from the termination of hostilities this Parliament will have the powers at present vested in it, plus the additional powers which it is hoped that the people will confer upon it. Therefore whatever provision may be made to protect this  Parliament  and its legislative powers, I do not see why it should not extend to all of the powers to be possessed by the Parliament during the five-year period after the war. It is quite impossible for the Parliament, with the increasingly complex nature of governmental activities, to do other than delegate many powers to administrators, hut with regard to legislative powers the position is quite different.

                <para class="block">Then the proposed new sub-section provides that such a regulation shall not take effect if, within fourteen days after its  contents have been so notified, either House of the Parliament passes a resolution disapproving the regulation. The chances are that when members are notified of regulations the Parliament will be in recess. Objectionable regulations are usually promulgated when the Parliament, is in recess, the reason for that, unfortunately, being too obvious. The chances are that during the ensuing fourteen days Parliament will not meet, and if a further fourteen days elapse while Parliament is in recess the regulations cannot be disallowed under this provision. The proposed new sub-section lc robs the two preceding sub-sections of any value which they might otherwise have, because it provides that a regulation of a legislative character made in the exercise of any power -conferred bv sub-section 1 of proposed section 51a shall take effect on the date of its making or on such later date as is specified in the regulation, if the Governor-General in Council declares on specified grounds that the making of I he regulation is urgently required. Only three Ministers are required foi1 the signing of regulations. It is not unknown for Ministers to meet in Executive Council and approve large numbers of regulations without much knowledge of either their content or exact effect, although they operate upon the lives and property of the people. I have reason to believe that that practice is not unusual at the present time. The Government can promulgate, therefore, at its will under the proposed provision, any regulations and they come into force immediately. As I have already said, this is a worthless proposal. We should endeavour not only to prevent the abuse of the delegation of legislative power, but also to preserve the rights of members of this Parliament. </para>

                <para>The fears entertained by the honorable member for Warringah might be justified if it were proposed by the Government to end the existing disallowance provision. No such proposal is contemplated. I should like to examine the honorable member##'##s amendment. What exactly would be its effect if it. became part of the Constitution? The first part of his amendment prohibits the making of any regulation of a legislative character, unless and until it has been approved by both Houses of the Parliament. This first part also has a second limb which provides that if any such regulation is made it is not to become operative unless and until it has been approved by both Houses of the Parliament. This part of the provision appears, therefore, to contain a contradiction in terms because it first prohibits the making of any regulation without the required approval and then goes on to say that if it is made it shall not become operative without the required approval. It may be, therefore, that not only must approval be obtained before the regulation is made, but also once it is made a second approval must he obtained before it can become operative. I cannot believe that this is what is intended. </para>
                <para>More important, the effect of this part of his amendment is that every regulation must be considered by both Houses of the Parliament and approved toy both Houses of the Parliament. If such a provision were incorporated in the Constitution, it would practically put an end to legislation by delegated authority because it would be just as expeditious to make the same provision by act of Parliament as by regulation. It is quite impossible to administer government in that way and no one knows that better than the honorable member for Warringah. </para>

                <para>His proposed provision contains a proviso under which, when Parliament is not sitting, the Governor-General may declare that the making of a regulation is urgently required and thereupon any such regulation may be made and take effect immediately or on such date as is specified in the regulation. But even then within one month of the next meeting of the Parliament the regulation must be confirmed by both Houses of the Parliament, otherwise it will cease to have any effect or operation. The effect of the proviso is simply that regulations may, when Parliament is not in session, be made as a matter of urgency to cover a period up to the time of the next sitting of the Parliament. If Parliament sits frequently the confirmation of such regulations by both Houses of the Parliament might be spread fairly evenly over the whole year, but if Parliament were in recess for a period of three or four months it might be faced in the first month after the resumption of the sittings with an overwhelming mass of regulations requiring confirmation. </para>

                        <para>- Even if the sittings were frequent and regulations could be dealt with a few at a time, the burden on Parliament would be insuperable. The result would be that either no regulations would be made or if regulations were made Parliament would have great difficulty in dealing with them,- and in many cases probably regulations would cease to be operative because of the inability of Parliament to deal with them. While some parliamentary control over the making of regulations is necessary, and is recognized in the amendment which I have moved, the limitations proposed by the honorable member are far too rigid in a democratic community. Parliament would be unduly hampering itself, and also the people of Australia, if it agreed to the amendment proposed by the honorable member. I repeat that Parliament already possesses the power to disallow the regulations; but how many times has it exercised that power? In this Parliament, the honorable member for Warringah alone of all honorable members has given notice of a motion to disallow a regulation, and in the last Parliament we disallowed only two or three regulations. One of those was Regulation No. 42 <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> which appeared to infringe many fundamental rights. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> and the ex-member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> opposed that regulation, and it was disallowed; but that was a major event in the life of the Parliament. Nobody knows better than does the honorable member for Warringah that the disallowance of a regulation is an unusual and serious affair. Parliament##'##s power of disallowance is an important power, but it is exercised sparingly. However, if . the honorable member##'##s provision be agreed to - and we could not get rid of the provision without holding another referendum on the subject - every regulation of a legislative character would have to be dealt with by Parliament, and, consequently, the work of honorable members would be increased to a very great extent. The Government proposes to embody in the Constitution safeguards in order to enable honorable members to see a proposed regulation before it becomes operative; and that is without prejudice to Parliament##'##s existing power of disallowance under the Acts Interpretation Act, or its opportunities to make that power even more effective. My amendment secures for honorable members, whether the House be sitting or not, knowledge and notice of a proposed regulation at least fourteen days before it becomes operative. Thus honorable members are given an opportunity to consider it before it comes into operation at all. I do not think that that is without importance. What is complained of very often is the making of a regulation before any notice is given to honorable members. If the House has an opportunity to disapprove, that can be done before the regulation becomes operative. Moreover, there is the existing power of disallowance. This is a genuine attempt to improve the existing position. The problem is difficult to solve because whilst Parliament on the one hand should keep a close watch on all subordinate legislation, it is equally true that Parliament will not wish to interfere with regulations, even if they be of a legislative character, if they are of minor importance. That will be particularly the case in view of the legislative work which Parliament will be called upon to perform after the proposed new fourteen powers are included in the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>- The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has exaggerated the magnitude in number of regulations of a legislative character. 1 have attacked the powers which are used by the Government to make regulations, and it is extraordinary that the reply to my amendment has been prepared by officers who play a part in the framing of regulations. It is quite obvious that the reply made by the Attorney-General was so prepared by his advisers. He says that the reason why he is not willing to put a break upon the Executive##'##s power to make regulations, is because if that is done, Parliament will be overwhelmed by regulations. That is eyewash. It is about time that Parliament met more frequently than is the case at present, and exercises to a greater degree the legislative powers vested in it. The people expect us to protect them in this way. If Parliament met more frequently it would have ample opportunity to deal with all regulations of a legislative character in the way I suggest. To-day, Parliament meets on an average of one day out of eight or ten, and most of the time of our limited number of sittings is wasted in debates which are completely futile. I submit that the Attorney-General##'##s amendment is completely valueless and will not achieve the purpose which it is intended to achieve. </para>

If this Parliament meets as infrequently as the honorable member says that it does, then not many protests have been made from his side against the alleged infrequently; this is the first we have heard of it. </para>

                        <para>- I was about to remark that the suggestion of the honorable gentleman for altering the procedure with respect to dealing with regulations made under acts of this Parliament is but an extension of the proposal of the Attorney-General. This is the first occasion upon which any attempt has been made to write anything into the Constitution to safeguard the people from the regulatory power of the Executive. The honorable gentleman suggests that we ought to go very much further. I consider that we are doing very well. There is such a thing as the inevitability of gradualness when it comes to the making of Constitution alterations. If I may express it in another way, it is a case of one step enough for me ##"##. One cannot get at one effort all that one may want in the matter of Constitution alteration. I consider that we have made excellent progress,and that the committee ought to accept the amendment of the Attorney-General and reject the amendment to it proposed by the honorable member for Warringah. The honorable member must be reasonable in all such matters. Instead of attempting , to flay the Government for an abuse of power, he ought to remember some of the things that were done by the bureaucracy when his Government was in power, which caused a good deal of discussion in this Parliament, by some members on his own side. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members in committee, at a time when I was present, devoted their attention to the consideration of this bill. In the course  of that attention, certain events occurred which led to the suspension of one honorable member, first from the service of the committee and then from the service of the House. The events which led up to that event were, in my submission, a complete travesty of parliamentary procedure, and represent, as nothing in my experience in this Parliament or in any other Parliament, has represented, a gross misuse of the power of a majority to coerce a minority. One of the things that has been written into this bill in the committee is some alleged guarantee of freedom of speech and expression. The whole of the proceedings have indicated how utterly worthless a guarantee of freedom of speech and expression can be, in the presence of a majority determined to use its power. The event was this : The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> was treated, in my opinion - and it is an opinion which is shared by at least those honorable members who sit on this side of the House - in a most offensive manner, and when he resented that treatment he was subjected to a motion for his suspension ; that is to say, he was named, and, following the procedure laid down in the Standing Orders, a motion was in due course submitted for his suspension. In the meantime, the honorable member had left the House. He was sent for by the Temporary  Chairman  of Committees. He returned to the chamber. Having returned to the chamber, he was then invited by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> to express regret for the events which had led up to his being named by the Chair. He did so. Thereupon, the incident closed, and the honorable member for Indi sought to resume the speech that had been interrupted by his being named. When he sought to resume his speech he was informed, first that his time had expired, and secondly that the question which he ##'## desired to debate, namely, the question of the postponement of clause 2, had been resolved in his absence. That, to nae, is one of the mysteries of procedure. I do not profess for one moment to understand how, after a member has been named and a Minister has been called upon, under the Standing Orders, to move the suspension of that member, a question can then be put by the Chair which has no relation to the suspension of the member, and de-1 clare it carried. There are two things to be said about that. The first, I may say on the authority of several honorable members on this side of the House, is that no such question was put. </para>

                        <para>- That is not exactly correct. What I ruled is that any point of order in regard to what took place in the House should have been raised at the time. The right honorable member did not raise it. What took place in committee is a matter for the committee to decide. The  Chairman  of Committees has made a certain report to me. The only question involved in the motion before the House is whether that report should or should not be adopted. The committee has to solve its own problems. The House cannot solve the problems of the committee. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to order, I ask your ruling, sir. When the motion before the Chair is that the report of the committee be adopted, must the debate then be confined merely to whether the report should or should not be adopted? If in committee a procedure had been followed which was regarded as a denial of the rights of the Opposition to debate a matter, surely that question could be discussed on the motion for the adoption of the report? </para>

The Leader of the Opposition was leading up to the point  that there was an inaccuracy in the report, in that a certain amendment submitted by the Leader of the Australian Country party was not properly placed before the committee, and that, therefore, in that respect the report could not be correct. I submit that honorable members are quite in order in discussing an alleged inaccuracy in regard to the voting in committee. </para>

The committee of the whole House had such an opportunity. It had the question put to it that the bill be reported in a certain way. To that motion any honorable member could have moved an amendment, upon which the committee could have resolved the nature of the report which the  Chairman  should give to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> By carrying the motion that the  Chairman  report to the House that the committee had agreed to the bill with amendments, and with an amended title, the committee itself decided the nature of the report that should be given to the House. That at least is ray point of view. Any honorable member is entitled to advance arguments as to why n point of order should be sustained or ##[##ejected before a final determination is made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> I have advanced my arguments in reply to the first submission of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender).</inline> In regard to the honorable member##'##s second submission, I contend that there are definite limits to the amendments that may be moved to the motion for the third reading of a bill. </para>

An amendment may be moved for the postponement of the third reading, but in that event only the details of the bill and the reasons for the suggested postponement may be mentioned in the course of the debate. That is quite clear. Therefore, I hold that the ruling which I have already given i3 correct.

I am of opinion that the amended short title is a complete misnomer. I hold the view that this bill not only fails to provide any embodiment of democratic rights, but also that it will be a monument to a denial of democratic rights in this country. I am obliged to offer this criticism of the measure - and it is very serious criticism - because a very important amendment was not voted upon during the committee stage. </para>

                            <para>- It still carries this title alleging that it is a bill to preserve democratic rights. Taking the point that that is an incorrect description of the hill, I consider that I can explain my reasons only by referring to the fact that democratic rights have their foundation in the decisions of a democratic parliament, and here we are assembled for consideration of this measure, in what we all were under the impression was a branch of a democratic parliament. A democratic parliament functions under a series of Standing Orders which enable the representatives of the people to move motions and amendments and to be assured not only that their voices shall be heard but also that their motions and amendments shall be voted upon. As that is the very basis of democratic rights, I am obliged to say that no act of parliament is entitled to bear words in its descriptive title ##"## and Democratic Rights ##"##, when it has become law in circumstances in which the representatives of the people have not had the opportunity to move their amendments and to have a vote taken upon them. </para>

It contains the- powers which a representative body considered to be necessary for this Commonwealth Parliament to have especially in the five years after the termination of hostilities. That representative body decided that the Parliament of the Commonwealth should be clad with the requisite legislative competence to deal with the matters of great moment with which the Parliament will be called upon to consider. In addition to the powers which it was said this Commonwealth Parliament should have and which are now in this bill, there are certain safeguards against abuse of those powers. Those safeguards have been added as the result of discussions which have marked the whole question of what should be the constitutional powers of this Commonwealth and how far there should be safeguards against abuse of those powers. It would be altogether a reflection upon the capacity of Australia to deal with the problems of Australians if we were to allow this bill to pass without a true appreciation of the substantial achievements which this bill accomplishes in order that the legislative powers of the Commonwealth may be adequate in time of stress to deal with the difficulties of that time. I can recognize that the hill, as submitted to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> may not meet with the complete approval of every member of Parliament or every citizen, but it has to be remembered that no constitution yet evolved in a written form can be said to have the unanimous support either of the Parliament which passed it or the people who by a majority voted for it. But this bill represents one of the stages of the development of the legislative authority of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. We shall emerge more definitely to the status of a nation when this Parliament has the powers which the House of Representatives now considers are necessary for the Parliament to exercise. Whatever##'## controversies may be engaged in between now and when the people make a decision, if they are to be given the opportunity to make a decision, those controversies will, I hope, be animated only by the desire to serve the people of Australia. That is the whole motive that the Government has in bringing the legislation forward. That motive can be regarded as perfectly genuine because the contents of the bill are such that it has the endorsement not only of the Government but also the leaders of the political parties of Australia. It would be unfortunate if, because of some misunderstanding or misapprehension, or through one of these lapses to which all parliamentary assemblies are heir, there should be any misconception or misstatement of the character of the powers which this Parliament thinks it should have and for which we propose to ask the people to vote. There can be perfect safety in this measure, because this Parliament has not the last word as to whether this bill shall become the law of the land. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable gentleman has himself sponsored proposals for the enlargement of the powers of this Commonwealth and failed to get those powers. He should not view with any sense of envy the endeavours of others to achieve what he could not achieve. If these powers be granted, it will be the duty of this Parliament to see that they are wisely used. Whatever disputation has marked this Parliament since its establishment, I cannot conceive that either ourselves or our successors will fail to have that regard for the welfare of the people that characterized our predecessors. An enlargement of the powers of this Parliament has been sought by every party which has had the responsibility of governing Australia. Once again we face the task, which all parties have regarded as their imperative duty, to endeavour to get from the people of Australia a mandate for more extensive authority than the present Constitution gives to this Parliament. Whatever may be the differences of opinion, surely we can agree to dispute about them in such a way that at least the issues which confront the people shall be clear and explicit, and so that the people shall be able to decide, not as the result of some misunderstanding of the powers engendered by political argument, but solely in the light of reason and in accordance with the weight of evidence. </para>

                        <para>. - According to my understanding of parliamentary procedure, the chief purpose of allowing a debate on the third reading of a bill is to ensure an opportunity to discuss any amendments which may have been made during the second reading and committee stages. In this instance by an overwhelming majority it was decided that the bill be reported from committee. The report was adopted. The question which you have put, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> is ##"## That the bill be now read a third time ##"##. But the bill has a title different from that of the bill which was read a second time yesterday. Certain amendments were made in the bill in committee and it is to one or two of those amendments that I propose to address my remarks. The term ##"## democratic rights ##"## has been imported into the title. In view of the context of the bill and what has happened during the last 24 hours, it might be more appropriate to add to the title the words ##"## and democratic wrongs ##"##. Reference  ha3  been made to freedom of speech. I put it to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> that when an attempt is made to alter the Australian Constitution at a referendum and to negotiate hurdles in order to reach success we run the risk of the people of this country saying that they will not agree that neither the Commonwealth nor the States may make any law abridging the freedom of speech and freedom of expression. What is to be the position in relation to freedom of speech and freedom of expression in Australia if this bill goes to the people and they say by any majority that they do not want it? Where do we stand then? To submit to the people a bill constructed as this is and with  such  a title as this has, is to court defeat. No government, with pretensions to statesmanship, can afford to contemplate that prospect with equanimity. The risk should not be taken. The very fact that the Government has decided to submit this proposal to the people postulates that there must be some threat to freedom of expression and freedom of speech. It is  not  often that I visit the Sydney Domain  and Yarra  Bank, Melbourne; but when I have done so I have seen evidence of remarkable freedom of expression. I do not know that any people in Australia are attempting to restrict the legitimate freedom of expression. I have yet to learn that the proposal of the Government is that freedom of expression and freedom of speech means that every nit-wit, crank or crook shall lie entitled to say in the Domain or to have published in the press what he likes about anybody or anything. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the provision relating to freedom of faith. What does that mean? Who is attempting to interfere with freedom of faith in Australia? What State Parliament is introducing legislation to interfere with it? If this proposal be accepted, does it mean that every one must profess some faith? Does it mean that a man must adhere to one faith and shall not be entitled to change his beliefs, as some persons have done? These are important matters which should not be glossed over lightly. Whilst I did not support these proposals, I recognize that the Government has aperfect right to submit them to the country. I do not agree with the method the Government has adopted or with the proposal that the powers, if granted, shall remain operative for a period of five years. If the Constitution is altered at all, the change should be permanent. Men of high legal standing have declared that they have grave doubts as to whether the five years##'## limitation will stand the test of litigation of the High Court. </para>

                    <para class="block">What will be the position in regard to freedom of faith in this country if the people reject this proposal? They might declare that the Commonwealth Parliament shall not possess powers to legislate on this matter and that they do not care a tinker##'##s benediction whether the State Parliaments legislate for  or against it. That is virtually what they will say if this proposal be rejected. My honest opinion, for what it is worth, is that if ever a referendum was certain to receive a caning, it is this one. The events pf the last 24 hours will ensure it. I do not make this statement in a party spirit because- 1 have had little to say in this debate. There are matters which, I regret, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> will not let me mention now, but I shall refer to them outside this chamber. Many cogent reasons could be advanced why the Government should give earnest consideration to the suggestion of the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> that the third reading of the bill should be postponed. However, I know what democracy means. I am not ignorant of the history of democracies. There is no worse dictatorship on earth than that of a democratic majority that has taken the bit in its teeth. Before a vote is taken in the electorate, and certainly before this Parliament goes to meet its masters, what I have seen to date Will impel the people of Australia to describe this legislation as a ##"## bill to inflict democratic wrongs ##"##. There I leave it. I have no. doubt as to where the common sense of the majority of the people will leave the matter when these proposals are submitted to them. </para>

                            <para>- But the character of the bill has . since been altered. The Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eadden)</inline> did not attend a convention that considered certain proposals now to be submitted to the people. Therefore, the contention of the Attorney-General that this particular matter relating to section 92 could not be submitted to the people at this juncture is countered by the fact that other foreign matter has been introduced. The Minister for##'## Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> knows what will happen to the primary industries if, through a defect of the Constitution, they are deprived of the protection now conferred upon them by National Security Regulations and are compelled to depend upon pre-war methods. The bill is deficient in the sense that primary producers and primary production have been excluded. If in future a government decides to rectify this omission, it may perpetrate a great fraud, because any political realist knows that a referendum on section 92, unless accompanied by proposals affecting industrialists and other sections of the community, must be defeated. Of what use would it be to submit to the people a proposal for an alteration of section 92 to be voted upon by hundreds of thousands of consumers whose main interest would probably be to keep the prices of food and primary products at low levels ? This bill is deficient, from the point of view of the man on the land, and I agree with the honorable member for Indi that the bill should be postponed for six months in order that the Government might further consider it. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to show that this bill could be so improved as to secure similar support. We should be realists in this matter. We all desire to obtain some increase of powers for this Parliament, and it is regrettable that we cannot discover common ground that would enable the members of this Parliament to fight unanimously for the reform considered necessary. Outside this House many thousands of people will bitterly oppose constitutional reform, oven with respect to matters on which ##«##( in this Parliament are in agreement. </para>

                    <para class="block">Therefore, I regret that the details of the bill do not enable us to present a common front to the electors. The greater the measure of unanimity which the Government obtains on the bill in this Parliament, the better chance it will have of carrying its proposals at the referendum. Every one who thinks seriously of the. necessity for . constitutional reform is anxious to enable Australia as a nation to play its part proudly in the world after the war. We cannot do that unless the National Parliament possesses adequate legislative powers to enable us to compete on the markets of the world with countries which are our rivals in primary production. On a previous occasion it was said that the Labour movement would wholeheartedly have supported the claims of primary producers for organized marketing by the Commonwealth, had it also been proposed that the Commonwealth should be given complete power in the industrial field. Iii dealing with constitutional reform, one of our main objects should be to enable the Commonwealth Parliament during a period of five or ten years after the war to play its full share as a food-producing country in feeding the starving millions in war-stricken areas. It is evident from the information gained by the Attorney-General and his officers at the Hot Springs Food Conference that Australia must co-operate with other primary producing countries in the building up of international commodity reserves. We shall not be able to achieve that objective until this Parliament is given full power to control the production and marketing of our important primary products such as butter, wheat, dried fruits and meat, and is enabled to ensure the production of such commodities on a basis payable to producers and in sufficient abundance to supply not only our own needs, but also those of other countries. Therefore, I greatly regret, that the Government does not propose to seek full power to enable this Parliament to deal effectively with primary production, or to overcome the position created by the Privy Council##'##s interpretation of section 92 of the Constitution. I urge the Government to remedy this defect in the measure when it is before the Senate by enlarging the  scope of the measure to embrace the whole field of primary production which, in my view, will prove to be the most important section of our economy during the period of ten years immediately following the cessation of hostilities. Thus we shall be enabled to make our greatest contribution as a nation to the welfare of the world as a whole. If that were done the Australian Country party would be able to give its fullest support to the Government##'##s proposals. However, the bill as it stands at present discriminates against primary producers. The Government has not responded to our appeal to re-open negotiations with the States. In that way it could obtain at least eight or nine of the powers sought under this measure. Should it be necessary to do so in order to assist the carriage of portions of the bill on which all could agree, the Government should not hesitate to divide its proposals into three or four sections for submission to the people. Powers which it requires permanently could be classified in one section, and those which it requires only temporarily could be placed in another section, and those to be operated in concert with the States in a third section. I again urge the Government to ask the people to grant to the Commonwealth Parliament complete control of primary production. </para>
                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ADERMANN</inline> (Maranoa) ##[##4.37 ;i.m. |. - I cannot support the measure in it.? present form because only limited power is to be sought in respect  of the organization of primary production. 1 also regret that the Government declined to accept the amendments moved by the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> with respect to paragraph (iii) - organized marketing of commodities - and also sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of paragraph (vii), which deals with the production and distribution of goods. I contend that the two are closely  interwoven. 1 submit that tile Commonwealth might  just  as well leave the control of primary production entirely in the hands of the States, as it is at, present. Paragraph (vii) seeks power for the Commonwealth Parliament to control the production and distribution of goods, but sub-paragraph  ii  makes the exercise of this power in respect of primary production subject to approval by the government of a State. I have discussed this matter with the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> and I listened attentively to his explanation of these proposed powers. We know that various important products are produced on a large scale in two or more States. Consequently, the Government is not seeking sufficient power to enable the Commonwealth Parliament to deal effectively with the organization of such industries. The Government, therefore, should ask for full powers in respect of primary production. Under the measure as it stands, primary producers in an industry carried on in two or more States will not be afforded an opportunity to organize on an effective basis. Therefore, I regret very much that the Government rejected the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Warringah with respect to this power. The Attorney-General stated that the Government would be enabled to assist primary producers through its power to control prices. That alternative does not offer a very encouraging prospect to primary producers in view of the Government##'##s exercise up to date of its power to control prices during the war. This fact has been evidenced particularly in the wheat industry. In Queensland, for instance, wheat production has dropped considerably below the pre-war figure for that State. Indeed, under the .Scully plan, wheat-growers in Queensland have not been allowed to grow sufficient wheat to meet the State##'##s requirements although they did so prior to the war. </para>
                    <para>I must also withhold my wholehearted support of the measure as it stands, because I cannot rest assured that full opportunity will he given to members of our fighting services to cast a vote at the referendum. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> of the 8th March points out that, whilst the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> stated that approximately 850,000 men and women are in the services, the service vote at the last federal election was only 417,831, including 16,707 women, or less than 50 per cent, of the total service personnel. I am afraid that only a low percentage of service personnel will be given an opportunity to cast a vote at the referendum, although all honorable members agree that members of the fighting forces are perhaps more vitally concerned than any other section of the community in the Government##'##s proposals. </para>

Paragraph (iii) of sub-section 1 of proposed new section 51a  provides  for power to be given to the Commonwealth for the organized marketing of commodities; and paragraph (vii) for the production and distribution of goods, but so that no law made under the paragraph with respect to primary production shall have effect in a State until approved by the Governor in Council of that State. In the booklet, <inline font-style="italic">Post-war Reconstruction.

                    <para class="block">Not only are the wheat industry and other primary industries to be sacrificed, but also the right honorable gentleman himself has recognized the menace which wool, the greatest and wealthiest producing industry in the primary field in Australia, is facing to-day - the menace of synthetic fibres. The graphs which form a part of the interesting textile exhibit in King##'##s Hall show that in 1921 the production of synthetic fibres had a weight of under 1.000,000 lb. per annum, and that to-day these commodities are produced in greater quantity than is wool, itself. Other graphs in relation to the cost of synthetic fibres show that from 1926 to 1928 it was on a somewhat higher level than the cost of wool, and that it is to-day well under the primary cost of wool. Because of their cheapness, these fibres are seriously threatening this great industry, upon which we are largely dependent for the discharge of our overseas commitments and the imports of necessary capital goods for future development, if full employment is to be provided for the citizens not only of to-day but also of the future.

                    <para class="block">Despite the expression of those sentiments, the right honorable gentleman is prepared, without the slightest compunction, to sacrifice the primary producers  of this country and throw them to the wolves, although he is willing to have the bill altered in certain directions so as to quieten criticism that has been levelled at it by the metropolitan press throughout Australia. The bill fails to embody provision for the granting of powers over primary industry which initially the right honorable gentleman claimed were absolutely essential. I am in favour of granting to the Commonwealth extensive additional powers. But surely the time is ripe to afford protection to the primary producers of Australia, so that they may not be thrown to the wolves! Considerable alteration of the bill would not be necessary. Paragraph (iii) - organized marketing of commodities - could have added to it some such words as ##"## but so that no other section of the Constitution shall prevent this clause from operating##"##; and in paragraph (vii), all the words in subparagraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> could be left out. The right honorable gentleman said that the greatest difficulty was experienced in achieving unanimity among the States. The Prime Minister remarked that it was hopeless to try to achieve unanimity among State officers at meetings of the Australian Agricultural Council and at other conferences. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has spoken in a similar strain. Why, then, can the Government not defer the operation of the bill, and draft provisions that would, cover the points that have been raised in the course of the debate ? There is no need to hasten the passage of the measure. There is no indication that the war will end very shortly. The war with Germany may end sooner than we expect, but there is not much prospect of the war with Japan ceasing for some time. Consequently, there is ample time to provide safeguards which would protect the primary industries against the possibility of their being sacrificed in the interests of the secondary industries. The Government should not try to mislead the primary producers, by making it appear that this legislation will protect them when in fact it will do nothing of the sort. . </para>

                            <para>- One of the reasons suggested for the further postponement of this bill was a new legal point; which the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> mentioned. But the only serious argument raised was, not  that a referendum cannot limit powers for five years, but that the system of State reference cannot limit powers for five years. If a referendum is to be taken that argument disappears. </para>

                    <para>It is not correct that the bill in any way discriminates against primary production. Every paragraph of the clause, with the exception of the first paragraph, in which I accepted an amendment by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page),</inline> extending repatriation and other benefits to the veterans of all wars, follows the identical formula agreed upon at Canberra by the leaders of all the parties. It is useless to tell me that the bill discriminates against primary production. It is true that the direct power over production in relation to primary production will operate only with the consent of the particular State Government. That provision was insisted on by some of the State Premiers, notably the Premier of Victoria, but the point is, not that the States wish there to be no control of primary production, but that during this post-war period of five years, they desire to co-operate with the Commonwealth in these schemes, as most of them have fairly co-operated during the period of the war. To talk of our discriminating against primary production is an absolute misrepresentation. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members correctly quoted some remarks I made in relation to the bill brought before the Convention, but at the Convention the present proposals were agreed upon, and all that the Government is doing is to carry out that agreement, almost to the very letter. </para>

                    <para>A point was made by the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> with regard to the paragraph giving power over ##"##the organized marketing of commodities ##"##. That power will enable Parliament to organize the marketing of##'## commodities, including every primary product, on an Australia-wide basis. It cannot be organized by the Commonwealth in that way to-day, but legislation on the same terms has to be passed in every State. The Commonwealth can legislate only in respect of interstate trade, not trade confined to one State. One objection, which at first sight appeared very formidable, was the fact that, under this provision, section 92 will still bind the Commonwealth as it binds the States. That is the foundation of the suggestion made during the debate on the third reading, with regard to altering one of the powers, namely, the  organized marketing of commodities. All I need say about that, and I said it in great detail in committee, is that the system of pooling primary products can now be effected notwithstanding section 92, according to a ruling of the High Court as given by His Honour Chief Justice Latham. In that regard, I quote one paragraph from his judgment in the <inline font-style="italic">Milk Board</inline> case of 1939. He said- </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In my opinion, in spite of what might appear to be a contrary view, expressed in the comment upon the <inline font-style="italic">Peanut Board</inline> case, which I have quoted, the view of their Lordships ot the Privy Council was that a State Parliament could enact and provide for the administration of a compulsory marketing scheme so long as it was not directed against interstate trade and was not merely a prohibition ##»##s distinct from a regulation of such trade. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That appears in volume 62 of <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Law Reports</inline> 1939-40, page 132. The inference from what the judge said in that case is that the system of marketing by pooling of products, which is the system favoured in many primary industries, can be effected although section 92 binds the Commonwealth, providing that the Commonwealth gets this additional power of organized marketing on a Commonwealth-wide basis. </para>

                            <para>- The power of ##"## organized marketing of commodities ##"## is a new Commonwealth power, for which we do not need the consent of the States. It means the organized marketing of any  commodity selected by this Parliament, and regulating it on an Australia-wide basis. I am concerned that the honor-, able member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann)</inline> has not seen the importance of Chat point. I assure him that this is not discrimination against primary industries but a new charter for them. The Commonwealth will, by its power over organized marketing of commodities and over prices, do a great deal for the primary industries. Indeed that should be one of the first duties of Parliament. Admittedly the Commonwealth could not under the ##"## production ##"## power make a direct law to tell a grower that he must not produce more than a certain acreage of wheat. It is correct that such a law could not be passed by the Commonwealth except in co-operation with the particular State, but the Commonwealth can do much under the prices power. For instance, it could say to the grower : ##"## The price to be paid to you, at the point where you market your product shall be so many shillings per bushel grown on so many acres##"##. That price need not be fixed on a flat-rate basis, but can be fixed according to whatever relevant scheme of price-fixing was thought reasonable. </para>

                            <para>- The Commonwealth could not discriminate by reference to States, but it certainly could discriminate by reference to acreage or any other relevant ground. The primary industries of Australia will get new and additional benefits should these fourteen paragraphs be adopted. I admit frankly that we would have liked these legislative powers granted in a broader and more comprehensive form, but I refuse to be deterred by that, because we have agreed to the fourteen powers, and they can be worked successfully. When I point out that these powers are extensive, honorable members opposite ask, ##"## Could not they be made even better than that?##"## When I say ##"## Yes ##"##, they ask ##"## Why not do it?##"## When I point out the reason why they cannot do it, they raise further objections. I assure primary producers that under the new powers, the Commonwealth Parliament will certainly do a good job for the primary industries. </para>

                    <para>The only other observation I wish to make relates to a document read by the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony),</inline> containing a statement attributed to me about the ##"##employment and unemployment##"## power. I said during the second-reading debate, and I repeat, that one of the greatest evils of the modern industrial system is the practice of mass dismissal, that it has to be stopped, that somehow or other security of employment must be provided, but that unless control over employment be given to the ##'##Commonwealth as a power, that cannot be done. The remark attributed to me concerned the right of the individual to choose his own job. I went to the Summer School of the Australian Institute of Political Science, as did the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> We, of course, had nothing to do with the other papers read at the school, or the other speeches made there. I read a paper, and was asked, ##"##What about the inalienable right of a man to choose his own job ? ##"## It was pointed out that in time of war he did not have that right. I replied that in war-time industrial conscription was an essential part of the war organization of the country, but that under the modern industrial system to talk of a man having the right to choose his own job was almost meaningless, as very few men had that right. Under the power of ##"## employment and unemployment ##"##, in the bill, we want to improve the prevailing state of things. Too long through economic pressure no one in this country, unless extremely well endowed with worldly goods, was really free to choose his vocation. That was the essence of my statement. When my attention was drawn to the report by the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> as appearing in some newspaper in his electorate - and so far as I can ascertain in no other newspaper in Australia - I repudiated it immediately. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know who was responsible for it, but it was not correct. I am opposed to individual conscription in time of peace. I suggest that the position which we have reached is this: The bill has passed the committee substantially in the form agreed upon at the Canberra Convention. However, we have extended the benefits of repatriation, rehabilitation and advancement to veterans of the last war as well as this. We have added also three popular safeguards. One in relation to delegated legislation, giving to the Parliament greater powers to be included in express terms in the Constitution itself. We rightly refer in the title of the bill to the fact that the bill does confer special civil rights. They are ##'##there for the limited period only because the powers are there for the limited period, the intention of the Parliament or Government being to have a complete revision of the Constitution before the end of the five-year period. I am sorry that the members of the Australian Country party were absent at an earlier stage this evening, when I went into all this matter in detail; but I have done my duty to the House, and I can assure the members of that party that those primary producers, for whom they speak here, will get very substantial benefits under the powers given to the Commonwealth Parliament by this bill. </para>
