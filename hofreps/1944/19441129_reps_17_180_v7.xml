                    <para class="block">Honorable members will observe that, in relation to each portion of the motion, the reference I have made is to the Government. It is the Government##'##s public attack upon Justices of the High Court that is involved; it is the Government##'##s interference with the normal process of justice in the cases referred to, that is involved. I say that, because there has been a growing practice in the last two or three years of Ministers making statements and attacks, of doing this or that, and then saying, ##"## I was speaking only for myself, not as a Minister##"##. Time after time, we have had instances in this House of the head of the Government or the leader of the House for the time being explaining that what had been said or written by some Minister represented only the private view of that gentleman. The time has come when it should be understood that no Minister who stands in his place in this House and speaks as a Minister, offers a private opinion. He speaks for the Government. It is because he is a member of the Government that he speaks from the table. </para>

                            <para>- It is in accordance with a very fine practice, established for very many years, that when Ministers speak at the table, particularly on behalf of the Government, in reply to a debate, their speeches are those of the Government. Otherwise, the position would be absurd; any Minister might say anything at all in respect of either policy or anything else, and the Government could always - as, indeed, it so frequently does - wash its hands of the whole matter, and say, ##"## You will never know when it is our policy; but whenever it proves to be an unsuitable policy, we shall be able to deny that it is ours and to say that it is merely something which the Minister himself has said ##"##.

                            <para>- I am sorry, and apologize for having done so. I was craning my ear, because I am so frequently helped in that way that I do not want to miss anything that is good. I put on one side the assumption that this is supposed to be a figurative account, and concentrate on the charge that two justices who are supposed to he impartial in the exercise of their functions openly ##"## barracked for the press ##"##. If this were a mere expression of ignorance, it could afford to he disregarded. If the position were merely that the Minister for Information does not know that, in the courts of this country - and I refer to practically all the courts - in the course of argument, justices put forward, for the purpose of eliciting argument, views which are in no sense their final views; I should overlook it. But this was a deliberately calculated statement, designed to satisfy the rabble of this country that the justices of the highest court in the land are politically opposed to them. </para>

If he does not know that, in every country of this kind, there is a rabble which can be stirred up to hate all authority, then he is very innocent of public affairs. This statement, I repeat, was designed to stir up that mob feeling, and to bring into contempt the authority of the judiciary of Australia.No authority could be possessedby a judiciary which was, in fact, corrupt or biased. Does the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> really believe that the High Court is a biased and corrupt tribunal? If he does not, why has he, as the chief law officer of the Crown, preserved silence for days after the making of this dastardly and contemptible attack ? It is quite unnecessary for me to say that the two learned justice referred to have been on the judicial bench of this country for many years. </para>

                    <para>The presiding justice, in referring to that letter in his judgment, pointed out, as I myselfpoint out, that as a communication from one Minister to another it was perhaps not impossible to regard the letter as having no further intention than to influence the receiver of it to bring about a settlement of the litigation rather than allow ##'##the case to go to trial.  His  Honour said that that is a not impossible view in theory, but of course the one thing that is clear is that the Minister for the Interior did not take that view, because he hastened to pass this letter on to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gahan.</inline> When the latter read in the letter the statement that it would be most unfortunate for him, as he desired reappointment, we can very well imagine that he knew he was being told that the kind of evidence be gave might influence his prospects of being re-appointed. </para>

As he gave his evidence freely, independently and candidly, it is necessary to say that it is against the law for any person who has any authority or means of influence over a witness to use it for the purpose of affecting his evidence. </para>

                    <para class="block">I hope that this case is without precedent, but the astonishing thing about it is that for days and days after it has become notorious, no action whatever has been taken in relation to the Minister. I do not believe that in Great Britain, from which we derive our parliamentary institutions, a Minister could hold office for five minutes after the publication of such a threat.

                            <para>- All the sidestepping in the world will not get rid of that fact. What a ludicrous/ position it would be if some act of this kind were performed by this Minister and then by another, until nineteen of them had done it. We should still be told, I suppose, that it was not the act of the Government, but only that of nineteen individual Ministers, who were utterly distinct from the mystic body, the Government, which alone has the power to declare policy and perform public acts. Of course, that suggestion is perfectly ludicrous. This Government stands condemned through having, through one of its members, used an utterly corrupt, or designed to be corrupting, threat to a prospective witness, for which there is no apology, no withdrawal and no explanation. </para>

                    <para>Then I turn to the third paragraph of my motion, which relates to the attempt, in fact more than an attempt, to put the coal tribunals beyond the corrective jurisdiction, on questions of law, of the High Court. Honorable members will recall that, when the Coal Production (War-time) Bill 1944 was before this House, an assurance was given by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> that the wage-pegging law contained in the economic regulations would apply to the coal-miners as much as to anybody else. This House, then in committee, accepted that assurance. Notwithstanding that position, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Connell,</inline> the  chairman  of one of the tribunals, gave certain decisions later increasing the pay of the miners, and the result was that proceedings were taken in the High Court. The court first decided that those regulations did apply to the coal-miners, thus supporting the undertaking given to this House, and in the second place it decided against the validity of the orders made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Connell.</inline> What then happened? Did the Government say, in effect, ##"## We are delighted to find that our view of the legal position has been upheld, and that what we told this House about coal control is now authoritatively declared to be the law##"##? Not at all. It made another regulation, which is found in StatutoryRule No. 157of 1944. It refers to the coal tribunals, and says that the awards and decisions made by them prior to the commencement of this regulation are to stand, as if they were valid laws. </para>

Mr.Justice de Baun was appointed because of his judicial training, experience and office. On the 3rd May of this year, the commission was considering whether war risks in certain waters near Australia had been reduced. It was considering whether a bonus paid to seamen, and designed to be accommodated to the quality of the risk, should be reduced. On the 3rd May the commission asked its Minister to advise whether there were grounds for any belief that the risk in Australian waters was the same as in June, 1942. That was a fair question. What the commission said, in effect, was, ##"## We have our own ideas, no doubt, but the Government, in the last resort, is in the bestposition to assess what the risk may be, because it has all the naval and military intelligence on the matter ##"##. The commission could get no reply to its question, and although it renewed its application several times, it received no reply, good, bad, or indifferent. Then the commission decided to reduce the bonus rate, because it found that the risks had, in fact, diminished, particularly in certain Australian waters, and it made an amending order which was to come into operation on the 15th September. As the result of discussion with certain Ministers, the date was altered to the 1st November, on which date the order was to become operative.. The Government then interfered, and: directed the commission toreview its decision. </para>

Was it merely so that he might give a sort of judicial dignity to decisions##'## made by other people, or was it so that he might exercise his Own judgment, thus##"## giving the public an assurance that there would be independent judgment?

What did that matterto the Government ? Undermining the authority of the court is no new thing for thisGovernment. Setting aside the law,or allowing it to be treated with contempt, is nonew thingfor this Government. And so the judge went, and no doubt some other  chairman  will take his place. If he desires a long life the new  chairman  will do wellto study the wishes of the Ministry, because a condition of long life for him will be aclose adherenceto the political views of his masters. </para>

                    <para>Paragraph 5 of the motion refers to the Government##'##s -  feeble failure to enforcethelaw against war-time strikers. </para>
                    <para class="block">This matter has  been  referred to many times. Nothing that has occurred this year gives any indication##'## that  the Government will enforce any industrial law, or exercise any industrial authority. Month after month we have witnessed the steadily growing industrial anarchy in Australia, and the steadily increasing total of industrial disputes. There have been threats by the Government, but not so many of late. There have ##'##been promises by the Government, not whole-hearted promises but hints after this fashion: ##"##Now, look; we know that you want a pensions scheme, gentlemen of the coal-miners union. We know that you want a Commonwealth pensions scheme which will put you in a position of great advantage as compared with any other industrial workers in Australia. We are not exactly promising that we will give you such a scheme, but, ah ! if you would onlyhelp us for the next month, and get the people##'##s minds off the coal problem, we might be able to do something for you ##"##. In that sense, promises have been made, but even the promises have been feeble. It might have been better if the Government had said, a long time ago. We know we cannot exercise authority. We will not pretend that wo can. Therefore, we are cutting out all this fine talk about ruthless enforcement of the law ##"##. The Government could then have said to the coal-miners and other militant unionists, ##"##What is your price, and we will pay##"##. If the Government had done that, at least it would have been honest. It would, at least, have had a policy, however bad; but the Government has never had a policy. It has shuffled uneasily from one foot to the other. There has been a touch of ruthlessness, followed by more than a touch of weakness. Its whole attitude has been provocative, and I have no doubt that in every trade union throughout Australia, the very suggestion of discipline by the Government is treated with shouts of derision. The unionists know very well that what really amounts to treason to the country pays. The loyal, patriotic trade unionist, who goes on with his job, accepting wage restrictions, paying his taxes, and giving thought to the men who fight for the country, receives no industrial reward; but let the trade unionist be a man of dubious allegiance to his country, let him be a man who has, in many instances, done his best to sabotage the war effort by his utter disregard of the law of the land, and by his carelessness of the safety of the country, and everything will be added unto him. He. will get what he wants. He will even get headlines in the newspapers. He will have conferences with the Government, and be provided with transport to attend them. He will even be allowed, in suitable circumstances, to address a few Ministers by their christian names, and in the long run the wage pegging regulations will be eased a little in his favour. It is a sorry day for any country when it comes to be known that subversive activity is worth cash in hand. Yet that is the industrial policy of this Government. </para>
                    <para>The true foundation of democracy, so much discussed in this place and in this country, is to be found in the positive authority of a body of law, the nature of which is controlled by the people themselves through their own Parliament. When the rule of law goes, democracy goes. Of course, there are some people who think that, in order to be democratic, one ought to be moved solely by what I call rabble considerations.Such people arc not friends of democracy. There are others, and we have some conspicuous examples in this Government, to whom parliamentary and ministerial power presents a glorious opportunity for using authority, not to produce a common observation of the law, but to produce its sectional enforcement. For them, power is something to be used for its own political sake. They are enemies of democracy. It is for those reasons that the motion concludes by directing the attention of the House and of the country to the fact that, because of the charges so abundantly proved against it -  . . the Government is undermining the authority of the courts and of the law, and is thereby injuring the basic structure of Australian democracy. </para>

His  five-pointed attack was flat and anaemic. It lacked conviction, and savoured of petty, party political propaganda. It came from a man who to-day tries to convince the people of Australia that he could govern the country in a statesmanlike manner, although he failed to do so when given opportunities such as few men have enjoyed. </para>

He was returned with a majority in both Houses of the Parliament; yet, despite his great eloquence, he failed to convince Parliament, or even the members of his own party, of his sincerity of purpose. It was because of the dissension within his party that he was cast overboard. Some honorable members, who were not elected to support the Labour party, considered that the only way to get constructive and fearless government in Australia, government that would re-organize the country##'##s war effort, was to support the Labour party. The record of the present Government speaks for itself. Its definite, progressive, and fearless administration is in sharp contrast to the policy of ##"## business as usual ##"##, <inline font-style="italic">laissezfaire</inline> and procrastination which characterized the regime of the Government that was so misled that it fell to pieces around its leader in the Cabinet room.

                            <para>- I do not favour criticism in this Parliament of the justices of the High Court unless such criticism be followed by action in the terms of section 72 of the Constitution of Australia. There must be good reasons for taking the step set out in that provision. I was not present in the chamber when two honorable members indulged in some criticism of justices of the High Court, but I find, on reading the reports of the proceedings in the Parliament, that the criticism did not come from only one side of the House. The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> who, as Leader of the Australian Country party, was  deputy  Prime Minister for a time in a government led by the present Leader of the Opposition, had a good deal to say on the subject. I believe that the honorable member isan estimable gentleman in many respects, and I have a high personal regard for him, but he set the lead in one of those characteristic speeches to which we have become accustomed. He criticized the Chief Justice of the High Court in these words - </para>

                        <para>After some moving from one court to another, and after various adjournments, the Chief Justice of the High Court finally appeared in an entirely new role. I cannot understand why, on an issue which called for an interpretation of the Constitution, he should sec fit to suggest to the litigants that  they  might confer in an endeavour to Teach a settlement. When a litigant challenges in thu High Court the validity of a Commonwealth regulation, or an action taken under that regulation, there can be no such thing as a compromise. In such a case the court is constituted primarily, if not solely, for the purpose of determining the rights of citizens and other interests under the Constitution. I trust that this will prove to be the last time that a member of the High Court bench will adopt the role of mediator, and suggest that the parties should compromise on an issue involving the interpretation of the Constitution. ... If the Attorney-General were still a brother judge, instead of being merely a kind of step-brother. T nin sure he would agree with me. </para>

                    <para class="block">In those words the honorable member for Barker referred to a man who occupied high ministerial rank in this country before he was elevated to the High Court Bench. No man in this country has had. the respect and confidence of honorable members in a greater degree than has <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham, the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. The criticism of him by the honorable member for Barker was most unfair. The Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> who has not had so long a parliamentary experience as the honorable member for Barker has enjoyed, rose in his place to defend the Chief Justice. As in his speech  this morning the Leader of the Opposition entirely ignored what the Minister for Information had to say on behalf of the Chief Justice, I shall read to the House the words of the Minister - </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Barker has taken it upon himself to reflect upon the Chief Justice for the action that he took in the rase. It was a perfectly legitimate exercise of his judicial functions for the Chief Justice to take the case himself and eventually make a decision upon it. Some other people perhaps did not like his action. I am told some of his brother justices were- not pleased, but. because the honorable gentleman or some other people are dissatisfied, that does not make thu action of the Chief Justice wrong or improper, but if the honorable member can reflect, as he lias done, upon the Chief Justice for his action, I can, I assume, express my views on the actions of several other justices in the case. </para>

                    <para class="block">I believe that all. honorable members heartily endorse what was then said in praise of the Chief Justice. The Minister for Information in his own characteristic style - a style not unlike that of the honorable member for Barker - indulged in some criticism of two other justices, but he would be the first to say that his remarks were not intended as any reflection on their honour and integrity. We must remember that these incidents occurred during a highly controversial debate. That they occurred is to be regretted; but they do not constitute ground for any lack of confidence in the Curtin Government. </para>

From that point of view, the Minister for the Interior considered that the sending of the telegram was justified, and it was only from that point of view that it was sent. I sent a letter to the Minister for the Interior. Certain passages of it were quoted in the telegram and others were not. The letter was intended to try to bring about an amicable settlement of the case. There is no reason why it could not have been settled, as one of the contenders for the position was one of the finest soldiers Australia ever produced.

The commission decided at a special meeting on the 16th November last to restore the war risk bonus from the 1st November, 1944, to the 31st January, 1945. A previous order by the commission had reduced the war risk bonus from 50 per cent, to 33^ per cent., 25 per cent, and 15 per cent, in certain areas from the 1st November, 1944. The commission placed on record the fact that the statement that the Government had directed it to review its previous decision was incorrect. The meeting of the commission was convened in accordance with the by-laws of the commission. The <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Mr. Justice</inline> de Baun, in a public statement on the 15th November, announced that his reasons  for resigning were contained in a letter to the Prime Minister, but that the immediate cause of his resignation was the failure of some members of the commission to abide by its decisions, particularly in regard to War Risk Bonus Order No. 46.

                            <para>- As Director of Shipping, he gave certain advice regarding shipping requirements. Was any other man in Australia more fitted to give advice? W,t##&gt;## there any other man possessed of more comprehensive knowledge of the whole of the shipping requirements of the fighting services and the civilian population in the outposts of Australia than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Gordon? In reviewing its decision on the war risk bonus, the com mi sion would undoubtedly have gi vt n mort careful consideration to the advice of the Director of Shipping that the operational requirements of Australian and American force in forward areas would  be seriously affected if there were any interference with the movement of ships. Because of the tremendous strain placed on the shipping tonnage possessed by the United Nations, Australia has not all the ships it needs and it is imperative to make the utmost use of those available, Any delay in ports would bring serious consequences in the operational areas. Apart from that aspect, it is essentia##]## to keep ships moving for the transport of fodder for starving stock, in addition to normal requirements in respect of c##é##a ironstone and essential civil supplies. Many thousands of tons of coal has to be shipped every week from Newcastle to Victoria and South Australia to keep industries and essential services in operation. Coal stocks are low in those States and unless regular imports be obtained the operations of the railways and gas and electricity undertakings will come to a standstill. No one knows the needs better than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Gordon. On the 10th November, he advised that if the trouble on- the ships continued in the next week, shipping movements would become chaotic. All the heavy industries would be affected in a very short time and the consequent shortage of strategic and essential requirements would have very serious consequences for the country as a whole. The commission##'##s decision means that the war risk bonus will be extended for three months. The Government believes that an overwhelming majority of the people of Australia will agree that it is just that some recognition should be given to the valiant services of the men of the Australian </para>

                    <para>Merchant Marine. These men unflinchingly carried on when ships were being  regularly  torpedoed off the Australian coast with serious loss of life. Any honorable member who goes to a capital city and pays public tribute to the men in the merchant marine will be deafened by the applause from the people present, who know the dangers the seamen have encountered and the services they have rendered in sailing through dangerous waters to operational areas in order to supply the armed forces with foodstuffs and munitions. Those facts frequently are lost sight of. </para>
                    <para>The fifth charge made against the Government by the Leader of the Opposition is that it has failed to enforce the law against war-time strikers. The right honorable gentleman failed to substantiate that charge. Characteristically, like a dilettante, he flitted from one subject to another, and, indulging in  histronics,  endeavoured to embarrass the Government by pointing to stoppages in the coalmining industry. Any one would think that when he was Prime Minister his Government, was able to settle all industrial disputes. He used to pat himself on the back and say, ##"## I went to the coalfields. I addressed the coal-miners##"##; as if he had ventured into the very fire of the enemy and merited the Victoria Cross. He takes to himself great kudos for having addressed the miners, and having been addressed by them as ##"## Bob ##"##. But, like his eloquent speech this morning, his action produced no results. He failed to stop strikes ; and during his very short period of glory as the Prime Minister of this country, coal production in Australia fell to a record low level. There are stoppages in the industry in this country, just as there is in any other country where the industry is carried on. But this Government has obtained more coal that would have been obtained by its predecessor; even had it remained in power until to-day. That fact is clear from the figures, which show that during the three years of office of this Government, coal production has totalled 35,360,537 tons, whereas in a similar period under previous governments, total production reached only 13,316,860 tons. The Prime Minister and I, and our colleagues, have done everything humanly possible to increase coal production. It is cheap for the right honorable gentleman to wave his hand and say, in effect, ##"##Put me at the head of the Government and I will solve the problem ##"##. When he was in office he proved a dismal failure in everything that mattered in the administration of this country in the dark days that then confronted us. He failed so dismally that he walked out of one government, and was kicked out of another. I shall not quote from the speech made by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> in this Parliament when he refused to serve with the right honorable gentleman in the same government. Although the right honorable member for Cowper had worked with him for many years previously, he would not serve under his leadership. Later, the Leader of the Opposition tried to induce the right honorable member for Cowper to reverse his decision, and, in the interest of Australia##'##s war effort the latter decided to co-operate with him. This is the man who endeavours to vilify and besmirch the reputation of other public men in this country, but, smarting under the rebuke meted out to him by the right honorable member for Cowper, he went around crying for sympathy, and claiming that a personal attack has been made upon him. No one could, make a more dastardly attack upon a public man than that which the Leader of the Opposition made upon the Prime Minister in this House last session when we discussed transactions concerning certain broadcasting stations. He knew that the Prime Minister was absolutely above suspicion in that matter. I, as Acting Prime Minister, have visited all of the coal-fields of New South Wales, with the object of familiarizing myself with the industry. I met the representatives of the coal-miners in conference. </para>

                    <para>The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has told us of the stoppages that took place in the industry when he was in Great Britain, He has told us also of the cooperation between all parties with the object of putting an end to stoppages in the industry and increasing production. The press of Great Britain is wholeheartedly assisting the Government in that work. Contrast that attitude on the part of the British press with the attitude of the Australian press which vilifies this Government, and the editors of which say, in, effect, ##"## If we were only on the front Government bench in the National Parliament instead of in our editorial chairs we could promptly solve this problem ##"##. Only constructive criticism is levelled against that Government, and honorable members opposite in this Parliament would do well to follow that example. Too much bitterness has been engendered in the coal-mining industry over the years, and it will take a long time to establish a new outlook towards it. However, we hope that that day is not far distant. We must remember that at one stage over 500,000 coal-miners in the United States of America were on strike. Our great ally has had its troubles in this industry. The same can be said of New Zealand and of all countries in which the industry is carried on. I shall not take up the time of the House by reading the decisions made by Cabinet yesterday with regard to this problem. It is most unfortunate that stoppages occur at present. In view of the industrial machinery now available for the settlement of industrial disputes, stoppages should not occur when, Australia is . engaged in an all-in war effort, and must of necessity concentrate the whole of its resources -upon the prosecution of the great offensive which we are to undertake in order to do our share in the struggle with the other United Nations. I say emphatically that this Government, during its regime, has made a strenuous attempt to co-operate with the industry in order to prevent stoppages and allay unrest. It has improved machinery for dealing with the problems of the industry. All the penal provisions with respect to stoppages of work and refusal to work, and for keeping employees or sections of employees at their work, particularly work essential to the prosecution of the war, have been passed, not by the Government led by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Prime Minister, but by this Government. Generally, the regulations have proved effective for the purpose for which they were passed. The Man Power Regulations are designed to ensure that the available man-power of the Commonwealth shall be used with the greatest efficiency and the least risk of wastage. Hundreds of prosecutions, in respect of which hundreds of pounds in fines have been imposed, have been made by this Government, which has taken more definite disciplinary action than that taken by any previous government. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to refute that statement. Moreover, this Government has averted considerable industrial trouble by conciliatory action. No man has done more in that respect than the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> whose long career in the trade union movement in this country is well known. The Government has also increased the number of conciliation commissioners, who have averted stoppages and interruptions by settling disputes on the spot. </para>
                    <para>Although the Leader of the Opposition has joined with a section of the press in attacks upon the Government, he knows in his heart that this problem cannot be readily solved. Does any one believe that any honorable member on this side of the chamber, having the interests of Australia at heart, would refuse to take any further action that might he. deemed advisable or necessary in order to increase coal production and put an end to stoppages ? We believe that, as the result of the recent conference between  the  Government and representatives of the industry, better results will be achieved in the future. However, some honorable members opposite have short memories. Let me quote for their special benefit the comment expressed by some newspapers concerning the failures of the Leader of the Opposition and the Government he led to grapple with this great problem.

                        <para>. - Had the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> occupied as much time, used as many words and devoted his undoubted enthusiasm to replying to the charges made against the Government instead of indulging in a personal attack on the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> the nation and tins House would have been all the better for it. I take strong exception to the tactics of the Acting Prime Minister in using this motion to make a personal attack of a degrading nature on a member of this chamber. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>It behoves me to redirect the attention of the House to the motion itself. Obviously, the Acting Prime Minister does not realize the gravity of the charges and has not a proper assessment  of the destructive nature of the attacks upon the judiciary of this country; otherwise, he would be aware of the degree to which our national integrity has been dissipated. The Government always appears to be satisfied to answer serious charges against its administration by tediously repeating the assertion that it saved Australia from invasion. Those charges were made by a responsible Opposition that conscientiously believes that it is serving the best interests of the nation. The extent to which the Labour party contributed to the defence preparedness of Australia may be debated on a more appropriate occasion, when we shall dispose of the Government##'##s claims, and show that its pre-war policy was not in the national interests. The Acting Prime Minister failed entirely to answer, even by way of an. excuse, the charge against the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings).</inline> He also overlooked the principle of Cabinet responsibility. As the Leader of the Opposition so aptly stated, the Government cannot accept the principle of Cabinet responsibility at one time, and on another occasion declare that any statements made by a Minister were made in his private or personal capacity. The Leader of the Opposition emphasized that when a Minister makes a statement, charge or criticism in Parliament, he does so as the spokesman of the Government, and the Government as a whole must bear the responsibility for it. As the Minister for the Interior has accepted full responsibility for his action, obviously the Government as a whole is responsible for it. It is not a personal matter between the judiciary and the Honora##'##ble Joseph Silver Collings. It is a matter between the High Court, arising from a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich, and the Honorable Joseph Silver Collings as Minister of State for the Interior, acting for and on behalf of the Curtin Government. As the Acting Prime Minister has not attempted to answer the charges contained in the motion, I can only conclude that he does not realize the importance of them. Because they are factual, they should not require repetition; but in view of the attitude of the Acting Prime Minister, it will be necessary for me to refer to the events in order that some spokesman on behalf of the Government may give a satisfactory explanation of this unsavory and extraordinary occurrence. </para>

                    <para>As mentioned in my letter to the Attorney-General, whether the procedure taken by your department to give effect to the decision of Cabinet was good or bad in law, it is not fitting for the Commonwealth to be brought before the High Court as a defendant in an action instituted by an employee. I learn from the Commonwealth Crown Law authorities that the case is listed for hearing this mouth and that application for certain subpoenas has been taken out in the name of the plaintiff. Tt is understood that one will be served on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gahan.</inline> It would be unfortunate if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gahan,</inline> who I understand, desires his reappointment to be considered by Cabinet, were to give evidence not completely in accord with the case presented by the Commonwealth. All this shows the desirability of a settlement of this litigation before it reaches the Court, and I believe that if there is a right approach from both sides it can lie settled. It is my desire as Minister for the Army and the desire of the permanent hoad that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harding##'##s</inline> services, which have been of great value to the Army, should continue with this department for the duration of the war. Therefore the question of his return to the Commonwealth railways during <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gahan##'##s</inline> term of office does not arise. As it will be necessary to act quickly I suggest you get in touch with the Attorney-General immediately with a view to reaching a settlement before the question of the Commissioner##'##s reappointment comes before Cabinet. </para>

                    <para>The next matter to which I shall refer is the practice that has grown up since this Government assumed office of Ministers of the Crown launching violent attacks upon the judiciary, which after all is the foundation of our democratic system. Nothing could be more calculated to undermine the established judicial system or to encourage Australian workers to treat with contempt our judges and the tribunals set up to administer justice, than these attacks. In fact, they provide irresponsibles in industry with reasons why justice should be overthrown in favour of the law of the jungle. </para>
                    <para>The most recent intemperate attack was made by the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> whose writings in the press of this country have inflamed the minds of patriotic and responsible citizens, sufficiently to convince them that he is not a fit person to remain in a democratic government. Speaking, not in a private capacity, but as a responsible Minister and a spokesman##"## for the Government, he made such a violent attack upon the judiciary that it was headlined in the press throughout Australia. The item was featured in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> and carried the heading in bold black type ##"####'##Calwell attacks High Court Judges ##"##. In the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun Pictorial</inline> the heading was ##"## <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ##'##Calwell</inline> attacks judges on press decision ##"##, and in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> ##"## Minister criticises High Court Judges ##"##. Such publicity given to an outburst by a Minister must have an effect upon the national integrity of this country; but once again the incident was accepted with irresponsibility and apathy by the Government. It has been left to the Opposition to bring the matter before this House, and therefore, before the country in an endeavour to draw from the Government some indication that it has a sense of responsibility and due regard for the position of the judiciary.

                    <para>That attack was delivered by a Minister of the ##'##Crown upon  the  High Court, a foundational structure charged with the interpretation of the laws of this country, and an indispensable part of democratic administration and constitutional authority. It is time that Ministers of the  Crown  realized their responsibilities, their relative importance, and the scope of their authority. It is time also that some government representative confirmed or denied on behalf of the Government the statements that have been made by irresponsible members of the Ministry. Apparently the Government wants to have it (both ways. It owns statements of Ministers which suit its book,  but  disowns others which it regards as unsuitable. The time has come for the people of this country to recognize that a statement made by a member of the Government is a statement for and on behalf of the Government. Ministers derive their executive powers from Chapter II. of the Constitution just as the judiciary derives its judicial powers from Chapter III. In relation to the three great functions of democratic government, the ##'##Constitution provides first that the legislative power shall be vested in a federal parliament, consisting of the Sovereign, a Senate and a House of Representatives; secondly, that the executive power shall be vested in the Sovereign and exercised by the  Governor-General  and the Executive Council, comprising Ministers of State; and thirdly that the judicial power shall be vested in a federal Supreme Court, namely, the High Court of Australia, and certain other courts. Consequently, the executive authority of Ministers of the Crown is no higher than the judicial authority of the High Court. Each has its defined functions to perform under the Constitution, and each is exclusive of the other. A Minister who attacks the judiciary is exceeding his authority in exactly the same way as a judge would be exceeding his authority, if he attempted to interfere in the exclusive functions of the Executive. This violent attack upon members of the High Court bench cannot be ignored by Parliament. It is far too serious to be passed over with the excuse that it is merely the view of a Minister. The Government should either own or disown the statement made by the Minister for Information. So far it has been left to the Opposition, to bring the matter before Parliament in order that the people of Australia may know where we stand in relation to this unsavoury behaviour, the only effect of which can be to undermine the course of justice and national responsibility. </para>

                    <para>The Acting Prime Minister waxed eloquent in regard to industrial conditions in Australia, and compared the existing position with the unrest during the regime of the Menzies and Fadden administrations. Such a comparison is odious and ridiculous because, since December, 1941, this country has been engaged in a disastrous war, and we have had to strain our resources in every direction to the utmost of our capacity. The position in the coal-mining industry, and the industrial position generally, must be viewed in the light of that fact. The point that should be considered is, whether or not industrialists generally, and the coal-miners in particular, have been and are doing everything possible to meet the demands made upon Australia by the circumstances in which it has found itself. The latest available details in connexion with industrial lawlessness and anarchy in this country are interesting. They show that, during the twenty months up to the 31st August last, there were 1,432 industrial disputes, which involved588,951 workers and resulted in a loss of 1,461,671 man working days. Those figures illustrate in no uncertain way the industrial drift that has occurred. The loss of 1,461,671 man working days has contributed greatly to the impossibility of making effective use of the man-power resources of this country, and of utilizing adequately our industrial capacity. Indubitably, it has been a contributing factor in the failure of the dairying industry and of other great food-producing industries to obtain the labour they have needed. It is an indisputable barometer of themalutilization of the available man-power by a nation at war, (fighting to retain its place among the democratic nations of the world, and having international as well as national responsibilities; moreover, a nation that will , be judged in the peace yearsby the manner in which it has discharged its ##'##responsibilities during the period of the war. </para>
                    <para>The situation at the Homebush abattoirs is a striking condemnation of the administration of the Commonwealth Government, and the strongest indictment of the lawlessness with which it has been either powerless to deal or too spineless to tackle. At Homebush to the 30th June this year, there had been ten strikes of one day or two days, and 68 stop-work meetings affecting production. The number of sheep killed was 300,000 below the award tally. During the year ended the 31st March, 1943, no fewer than 75 stoppages in the metal trades were reported to the court. In the next twelve months, 81 were reported ; and between the 1st April and the 26th October of this year, a further 44 had occurred. <inline font-style="italic">{Extension of time granted##]##.</inline></para>

I have shown that the Government has been apathetic and spineless in its handling of the menace of lawlessness and anarchy. The nation can ill afford the loss of 1,461,671 man working days. In the meat slaughtering industry, the production has declined steadily since 1941, and strikes, stop-work meetings, and absenteeism have increased alarmingly during that period. </para>

                    <para class="block">A 44-hour week is provided for all sections by the award. The average weekly working hours during the half year ended the 30th June last were: sheep section, 311/4; pig section, 321/4. The shortest weeks were respectively 161/2 and 251/2 hours. Is it to be wondered at that meat has been rationed, and that there is the prospect of further rationing; ithat we cannot meet our own requirements, much less discharge our commitments overseas and to the Allied forces? Between January and June of this year, the total number of sheep and lambs left alive in the pens at the end of the day was 293,117, representing 17.6 percent. of the number actually killed during that period. There were ten strikes at Homebush, most of them in the sheep slaughtering section; in which, in addition, there were 66 stop work meetings, and on 117 of the 124 working daysthe men failed to complete their tally of 80 sheep a man, or the actual number yarded on the 25 days when fewer than 80 sheep a man were available. Although, during the first six months of 1944, nearly 300 men were capable of working as sheep slaughtermen, only on sixteen days was it possible to complete three full teams of 76 men each, a total of 228. Is it necessary for me to produce further evidence to show that industrial conditions in this country have got out of hand, and to prove indisputably the spinelessness and ineffectiveness of the Government##'##s administration? A contributing factor has been the encouragement given by the Government to those who would break down the very foundation of our democracy, by criticizing and attacking, maliciously and in other ways, the wholebasis of law and order, which enables us to maintain national integrity and discharge national responsibility, namely the judiciary. It is time the Government grappled with the position. It is all very well to say that there are only a few irresponsibles and Communists. The suggestion that I would make to the Attorney-General is that a searching investigation should be made as to the effect of communism in this country, and that proper action should be taken to stamp it out as expeditiously as possible. <inline font-style="italic">Sitting suspended from 12.43 to 2.15 p.m.</inline></para>

                        <para>. -  I propose to deal carefully and frankly with the various matters that have been placed before the House by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> and I think that I can show that the House should be satisfied that there is no ground whatever for censuring the Government. At the same time, none of us can properly object to some of these matters being brought up for consideration. I have every confidence that when the facts are fully known and appreciated the Leader of the Opposition will be, or should be, satisfied that there is no ground for censuring the Ministry. In the first place, I shall deal with the remarks of the Minister for Information (Mr.Calwell) who, on Friday last, made certain passing criticism of the manner in which the constitutional case on censorship was dealt with by the full bench of the High Court. I use the words ##"## passing criticism ##"##, because the issue on Friday had nothing to do with that case, and the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> will be the first to admit that the matter arose incidentally in the course of a discussion, as to a new regulation. </para>

                    <para>At the outset I endorse without reservation or qualification what the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has said. All of us have confidence in the impartiality and integrity of all the members of the High Court bench. Indeed, in this respect no member of the bench needs defence from the Government, and still less from the Opposition. I submit that we should carefully observe the real reasons of some of those who, from time to time, for political purposes, rush in to defend members of the judiciary. 1 speak without the slightest reserve or qualification. If there were any charge, or suspicion of a charge, against any member of the bench, it would be the duty of the Executive Government to investigate it, and bring it before the House for consideration and determination under the Constitution; but, as I repeat, such an occasion has never arisen in the history of Australia, and I hope that it never will arise. Having said that. I could part with the subject, but I do not think that I should do that. </para>
                    <para class="block">I consider it to be my duty to this House to make one or two supplementary observations on the hearing of the censorship case. It would be a profound mistake for the House to accept any doctrine that the administration of justice in the High Court, or anywhere else, is immune from criticism. It is not immune, and constructive criticism may be of the utmost value to this country and to the High Court itself. Let me quote the words of a very great judge, a memlber of the House of Lords, and an Australian, Lord Atkin, who, in 1936, said - </para>

                        <para>But where the authority and position of an individual judge, or the due administration of justice, is concerned, no wrong is committed by any member of the public who exercises the ordinary right of criticizing, in good faith, in private or public, the public act done in the seat of justice. The path of criticism is a public way. The wrong headed are permitted to err therein. Provided that members of the public abstain from imputing improper motives to those taking part in the administration of justice, and are genuinely exercising a right of criticism, and not acting in malice or attempting to impair the administration of justice they are immune. Justice is not a cloistered virtue; she must be allowed to suffer the scrutiny and respectful, even though outspoken, comments of ordinary men. </para>

                    If the Court pleases, may I ask for an adjournment of this matter, as the Defendants have not yet been served with any affidavits.

                    That is opposed. My friend is obviously entitled to some adjournment, such as the Court thinks proper. The events which will have to be considered in this case are restricted to three days and three issues of the particular newspaper. My chief concern is in not having had the main affidavit filed, which I understand will be finished during the day and also a short supplementary affidavit which will be filed to-morrow morning. The Court will then see that there are no concrete facts in controversy between us at all. There will undoubtedly be questions of law at issue, and the matter is one of very great importance to the newspaper concerned. Its publication has been prevented for two days, and its publication will continue to be prevented completely unless it conforms to the directions of the Censor.

                <para>I appreciate my friend##'##s position, but I have also an appreciation of the difficulty in which my client is placed, and if it were consistent with the convenience of the Court to allow this matter to stand over until 10.30 to-morrow morning, the Court would then be able to judge whether or not a further adjournment is necessary. There is no controversy bet ween us at all. </para>

                    Is the Commonwealth contending that the publication of these newspapers -

                    At the moment, I cannot answer that question, because I have not seen the order to which my friend refers, and I do not know its terms. Those matters are a little extraneous to this present application. This application relates, not to the publication of the newspaper, but only to the publication of two particular articles.

                <para>I have no instructions in the matter that would enable me to say that any steps have been taken which would operate as a perpetual ban or an indefinite ban or restraint upon publication of this paper.

                    No; but I submit there must be some misconception about the matter. I have had no instructions, but I do not see how there could be in existence an order or direction of such a nature as would place any ban upon future issues.

                    LATHAM C.J. If that is your view of the meaning of the order, it would certainly be a more rational view. If one is to consider the reason for any action at all, then it appears tome there ought to beno difficulty in you stating that the Commonwealth does not propose, and will give an undertaking not to take any action in respect of the mere publication of the paper to-morrow if the paper does not contain any of the matter which is alleged to be in contravention of the order.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SUGERMAN</inline>
                    . The difficulty about that is that the paper may contain other matter. But really, I submit that there is no real difficulty about the matter. That is not only the natural meaning, but it is the only meaning of that order which Your Honour has just read. It is an order relating to what is about to be published, which is alleged to contain matter in contravention of the Censorship Board.

                    considering the application for adjournment the Court must consider the position which will be created if no adjournment is granted. In the affidavit in the other case, it is stated that a representative of the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>
                    rang up Mansell and said, ##"## I am asking you as Chief Censor if, under the terms of this order, I am entitled to the belief that. I am to cease publishing ? ##"## - and there was no answer, and the question was ... Of course, we have not heard the other side. It is to the effect that the newspaper has run the risk of having any edition seized, whatever its contents.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SUGERMAN.</inline>
                    That is a very ambiguous statement. Of course, the newspaper runs the risk if it publishes data other than, or different from, this matter. But nothing has happened. As I understand the matter, it has this result, that merely because this contravening or allegedly contravening matter was proposed to be##"## published this morning, the future publication of the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline>
                    has been banned. But nothing like that has arisen. But I put it that an undertaking is not called for. One is not asked to give undertakings as to things which one does not intend to do. I understand that there was really an order made in pursuance of the Press and Broadcasting Order - or the powers conferred by that order, and if Your Honour looks at the terms of the paragraph under which the order was made you will see (volume 2, page 1205, paragraph 12 of the Press and Broadcasting Censorship Order) - ##"## Where any newspaper, periodical or other publication has been printed or published incontravention of this order  . . Commonwealth Officer or Constable may seize such copies ... if necessary by force.##"##
                </para>
                <para class="block">That does not purport to relate to anything of the nature suggested by my friend, that is, the placing of an indefinite ban upon the publication. It relates only to the seizure of particular copies of the newspaper where the newspaper has contravened or where there is reason to believe that it is about to contravene certain orders. It is not a question of the difficulty of giving an undertaking in the light of the facts. It is rather a question of whether the Commonwealth should be asked to give an undertaking, when all that has happened is that an order has been made the effect of which related to the particular issue of the particular paper. As I put it to the Court, that does not arise in these proceedings. All my friends are asking for is an injunction to restrain the defendants until the hearing from preventing the publication of two specified articles - an article and one editorial. They have no ground, I submit, for asking for an injunction to restrain us from preventing them from publishing their paper. They are only asking for an injunction to restrain us from preventing them from publishing these two articles, which are named. </para>

There may be no dispute, or there may be very little, about the facts. It is possible the dispute about the facts is very little, and undoubtedly the facts are not in a big compass.

The Commonwealth by its proper officer acting under the discretion and powers conferred upon him , by the censorship made an order relating to a certain issue of the paper in which there was published matter which contravened the order.In those circumstances the Commonwealth does not feel that it should give an undertaking. At the same time I have prepared a statement of what the Commonwealth is prepared to inform the Court as to its attitude. If I may read that statement, it is this - the defendants inform the Court that if the plaintiff refrains from printing or publishing the articles mentioned in paragraphs (1) and (2) of the endorsement on the Writ of Summons herein and otherwise complies with the provisions of the present censorship order and instructions given thereunder, the defendants will not prevent or endeavour to prevent the plaintiff from publishing its newspaper, the

It was stopped because the issue contained this matter after the censor had ruled that this matter should not be published because it was an offence against the order. It all gets back to the basic situation, that we
                    <inline font-style="italic">are</inline>
                    here on an application for an injunction to restrain us from preventing publication of the Press.

We are here only on an application for an injunction to restrain us from preventing publication of two named articles. Well, as to that, we say that issue is not a vital issue. That is not an issue of urgency. If we were herebecause we had threatened that we would not allow them to publish their paper to-morrow, it might give rise to very different considerations. But no such claim is made against us, and it is not suggested that we have so threatened.

                <para class="block">My opinion is that the hearing of the case was unsatisfactory because of a number of factors. The Commonwealth has no privilege whatever in the High Court, or any other court, but it has the same right as every other litigant to have its case fully heard without undue interruption. I agree with what the Leader of the Opposition has said that, in the High Court, it is the practice for members of the Bench to ask questions of counsel, without thereby committing themselves to any particular view of the case, and mainly with a view to clearing up the true issues. If that had been all, no criticism could be forthcoming. I draw the conclusion from the transcript that the majority of the judges reached a strong opinion, very early in the case, that the claim of the Censor supported by the Government was legally unsound. The unfortunate thing is that they made their opinions very plain and very evident before it was possible for the Commonwealth to have the case presented with the care and attention it deserved. ##"##What are the facts? Here was a great and grave constitutional issue, namely, was the Censor acting in good faith to be judge of what was detrimental to the prosecution of the war or, on the other hand, was the court competent to say or right in saying, that despite the Censor##'##s opinion his order could be nullified and publication could take place in spite of that order? In popular language the constitutional issue was this : Did the regulations which had been operating ever since 1939, when they were promulgated by the Menzies Government, make the Censor the final judge of what was a detrimental publication or could the court, to use the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich in another case, ##"## censor the Censor ##"## ? I repeat that the case required careful consideration. It was a great case. </para>

                    <para>At the very outset of the case, counsel for the Commonwealth asked for an adjournment for one week. The application of the plaintiff was for an interim injunction, which in substance meant that, if it were granted, the offending matter could be published there and then. Counsel for the plaintiff newspaper opposed that and said that the ##'##Commonwealth was obviously entitled to some adjournment, such as the court thought proper, and suggested an adjournment until 10.30 o##'##clock on the Tuesday morning. However, when the matter was discussed in a- way shown by the transcript, after an adjournment until 4 o##'##clock on the Monday, the court, by a majority of three to two, issued an injunction which in effect permitted the newspapers to publish the material which had been ordered to be excluded by the Censor. The Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> McTiernan, who dissented, desired to have the matter postponed till the Tuesday, obviously in order that the case for the Censor and the Commonwealth could be more fully presented. It is -no reflection on the impartiality or integrity of the majority of the members of the court that they decided to do as they did. At the same time, it is only right for me, as Attorney-General, to say that the Solicitor-General and all legal advisers of the Commonwealth considered that the case should not have been decided so shortly and so summarily, because, in fact, the decision on the Monday determined the real issue between the parties which was whether the newspapers could, in spite of the censor##'##s order, publish what he had prohibited, as he said, rightly or wrongly, in the interests of the successful prosecution of the war. They did publish it, and, if any harm to the war effort was likely to result then, that harm followed immediately upon the court##'##s order. During the course of the argument there was much interruption from the Bench of the argument of counsel, and no doubt the Chief Justice had a very difficult task in conducting the proceedings through to finality. </para>
                    <para>I have already referred the House to the general right of criticism of the administration of justice. There is another ##'##principle.

I refer to the case of <inline font-style="italic">Moskun</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">U.S.A.</inline> This is a striking illustration and application of the well-established principle of British practice laid down by Lord Hewart in 1924 in <inline font-style="italic">Rex</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Sussex Justices,</inline> reported in 1 K.B., at p. 259 - </para>

I ask him to hear what is said before he presumes to condemn. In ray opinion, the only possible complaint that could be made by the defendant litigants was the speed and hurry of the hearing, having regard to the vital importance of the case. I know that that criticism may be answered by emphasizing that the matter was an urgent one. On the other hand, publication of a matter deleted by the censor could have been postponed for several days without any irreparable injury to the plaintiff, whereas the publication in fact meant that the real issue in the case was decided so far as the injunction was concerned. Repeating the words of Lord Hewart, Lord Chief Justice of England, all litigants, including the Commonwealth, are entitled to expect from every court in the land not only an impartial administration of justice ; that, all of us are getting.

I repeat the Government##'##s confidence in the essential impartiality of the Bench, but I am  sure  that I reflect the views of nearly every member of the bar practising before the High Court of Australia when I say that in all cases, particularly those in which intense public feeling is aroused, it is absolutely essential that the fullest opportunity should be given to have the case presented. </para>

I believe it is justified. At any rate, it would be most unfair if, this matter having been raised in this particular way, I failed to express it. In this instance, precedents existed and might have been followed. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke said during the last war in the case in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> the Premier of Queensland, was plaintiff, that you cannot censor the censor and you must accept his opinion as to whether a publication is likely to injure the war effort, which is binding on the court. Above all, in matters of this kind, it is vital that hurry, or the appearance of hurry, should be avoided. When honorable members read for themselves the transcript of proceedings before the court they will, I hope, agree that my comment is justified. </para>

It is true that the court, on the 1st November, invalidated a decision given by one of the local reference boards established some years ago. The Government accepted that decision, and in the regulations which were subsequently framed an exception was made of that particular case, and the law was applied in accordance with the rule laid down by the court. That, however, does not stop the Government which, in time of war, has authority over labour and industrial matters, from doing what it thinks it ought to do to preserve industrial peace.

                            <para>- I suppose that it would be in order for me to compare the enforcement of the law by previous administrations with its enforcement by the present Government. That would necessitate some reference to past industrial disputes. In the enforcement of the law regarding absenteeism and other industrial offences, the present Government has steered a course between extreme repression on the one hand and extreme complacency on the other. In whatever it did, the Government had one object in view, namely, increased production in order to ensure the maximum war effort. I suppose that in concentrating on the war effort the Government has made some mistakes; it might have prosecuted more persons; but, on the other hand, it might have acted more wisely had it prosecuted fewer persons. The Acting Solicitor-General informs me that the Government has proceeded against workers in no less than 4,000 instances. That has been done under the law relating to man-power absenteeism. It may interest honorable members to know that under the law relating .to absenteeism the Government has not proceeded against a single employer of labour in this country. Why? How could the law be enforced against such a man? How could the Government obtain evidence on which to convict him ? No one can cheek the coming or going of an employer or manager. This law is one which operates against the workers; it is a one-way law. I do not say that the fact that prosecutions have been launched against 4,000 employees in industry, whilst not one prosecution has been launched against an employer, is likely to please the people whom I represent, nor do I think that anything would satisfy the Leader of the Opposition. But is the Government to do things which it thinks will satisfy the right honorable gentleman? No. I call attention to the fact that before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour there was no law of absenteeism in this country; it was then largely a matter of ##"##go as you please ##"## and ##"## business as usual ##"##. That was the state of affairs under previous administrations after the war had been in progress for over two years. There was no law against absenteeism until the Curtin Government brought it in. It is impossible to get a 100 per cent, enforcement of such a law. Things being as they are, I know that whenever an industrial dispute occurs a section of the critics will cry, ##"## Enforce the law against the workers ##"##. The Government has enforced the law. For instance, the Prime Minister gave an undertaking in regard to the coal-mining industry. In August of this year, he announced that proceedings would be taken for breaches of the regulations, and the result has been that some hundreds of persons have been convicted. I make no boast of that. Those prosecutions -were launched because the Government had in mind, above all else, the production of the maximum quantity of coal. The policy announced by the Prime Minister has been followed : in every case which has arisen since he mentioned this matter in Parliament last August, action has been taken in accordance with the recommendation of the Coal Commissioner, to whom the administration of the act has been committed. In such cases as the Commissioner directs, an investigation is made by officials of the investigation branch of my department, and a report is furnished to the Coal Commissioner, who decides on the course of action to be taken. In no case has his recommendation been departed from. Efforts have been made to avoid blanket prosecutions. In pursuance of that policy, prosecutions have been launched in  almost  all cases in which persons could be identified as being mainly responsible for causing disputes. The Coal Commissioner has had complete freedom of action in this direction, and he will retain that freedom of action. The Government will not depart from that attitude. I ask honorable members to - imagine the position confronting the Government; on the one hand, it has had the miners complaining against the multiplicity of prosecutions, and asking that they should be withdrawn; and, on the other hand, it has had, the Leader of the Opposition and those who support him saying that there have not been sufficient prosecutions. The Government has acted in accordance with what it believes to be sound common sense. I realize that there are some, even among the supporters of the Government,  such  as the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Martens),</inline> who do not believe in prosecutions, and I hope that the time will come - and the sooner the better - when collective action by employees at a mine will be followed by the application of the pre-war practice, that is, action against their organization through the Industrial Court, and not by means of proceedings in the police court. However, that time has not yet arrived. I ask honorable members to be realistic, and to recognize that the Government, in taking action against the miners has had a most difficult task to perform. But has it had any assistance in that task from the Opposition, or its leader? No. On the contrary, the Government has been blackguarded. </para>

                    <para>The next point raised by the right honorable gentleman related, to the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> De Baun from the Maritime Industry Commission. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> De Baun is a judge of the Industrial Court of New South Wales. He accepted the position of  Chairman  of the Maritime Industry Commission, and </para>
                    <para class="block">I believe that, on the whole, he did an excellent job for the Commonwealth during a difficult period. I pay that tribute to him. He held strong views on the subject of war risks. The tribunal consisted of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> De Baun as  chairman,  four representatives of trade unions, three representatives of the shipowners, and one government representative. As -the Leader of the Opposition has said, the commission decided to reduce the war-risk bonus, and to bring that reduction into operation on the date mentioned by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> At the time that the decision was made, the facts before the Government warranted the conclusion that that was a just thing to do. Subsequently, however, further facts came to light. The War Cabinet considered them, and concluded, that the best thing to do was to postpone the operation of the order for three months. It had in mind the valuable services rendered by the mercantile marine during a period of great danger, when the risk of attack by enemy submarine was ever present. Perhaps the members of the War Cabinet were wrong; but they thought that it was right to postpone the operation of the order until the 31st January, 1945. They acted on the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Gordon, but, as I have said, they may have been wrong. Let us suppose that they were wrong. Even so, was not War Cabinet entitled to ask the representative of the Government on the commission to support the Government##'##s view? Believing that it had that duty, the War Cabinet instructed the representative of the Commonwealth Government on the commission, within the terms of its constitution, to support the postponement of the operation of the order for three months. The Leader of the Opposition calls that interference with the work of the commission. The matter did not come before the  chairman  of the commission for his decisive or casting vote, but he thought that the operation of the order should not be postponed. I repeat that he accepted a position on the commission as one of eight members. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> De Baun, as a member of the commission,  was acting as an administrative officer, and not as a strictly judicial officer. He has paid a tribute to the administration of the Minister for Supply and Shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> in a time of great crisis. Was it not reasonable that when the risk from enemy attack lessened there should be some tapering off of thebonus? Was it wrong to grant some little concession to these men who had run great risks? Perhaps what was done ought not to have been done; but, even supposing that the Government##'##s decision was wrong, was it not entitled to make that decision, particularly in view of the fact that these man had rendered to their countryser- vices equal to those performed by many men in the fighting forces? </para>

Our object has been the successful prosecution of the war. All allegations have been answered. Instead of positive help in the prosecution of the war, all we have had from the right honorable gentleman has been an epic in exaggeration and distortion. I am confident that the House will reject his motion. </para>

                        <para>.-- I support the motion and I shall restrict my remarks mainly to its first two points. Either the Government fails to understand the principle of the motion or it seeks deliberately to mislead the country as to what i$ involved. The first point involves the question of whether a Minister of the Crown made a charge of corruption against justices of the##'## High Court. I propose to deal with that question first, and I shall not Be led- down the alley-way by the rather shrewd move by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> to describe what took place in the court. I nsk Ministers who will follow me whether, if what was said by the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> amounts to a charge of corruption, they defend him. If they do not defend him, what course do they intend to pursue ? That is the whole issue. To draw attention to what took place in the High Court is to evade the point. </para>

                    <list type="upperalpha-dotted">
                        <item label="I.">
                            <para>do not advance the proposition that justices of the High Court are above criticism, but I observe that the opinions of the Attorney-General and the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> on that matter differ extraordinarily. The Acting Prime Minister said that the only criticism of the judiciary should be made on a motion under section 72 of the Constitution, whereas the Attorney-General said that judges could be criticized on any occasion. It seems to me that they should never be criticized except on a substantive motion. In any event, no matter what the occasion, when a Minister speaks he does so with a semblance of responsibility, and it is not to the point to say that what the Minister for Information said occurred in a debate on issues of little importance. A Minister should recognize his responsibility as a Minister when he speaks or retire from the Ministry. On the question of whether there was a charge of corruption, the Attorney-General tried to keep to the point, but the Acting Prime Minister never got anywhere near it and only felt comfortable when talking about the coal-miners and the coal-owners, stuff that we have been hearing here for months. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para>The Attorney-General upon whom rests a very special responsibility as leading law officer of the Crown said, though, not in the same words, something not completely dissimilar to what was said by the Minister for Information. Before I come to what was said by the Minister for Information it is well that I should repeat what was said by the Attorney-General. He said, ##"## Once and for all, let it be made crystal clear, these men are free from any charge of partiality. We have the utmost confidence in and respect for them##"##. Then he proceeded to say, ##"## Why, they made up their minds and gave their decision before the Commonwealth Government had argued the case ##"##. I do not know what use there is in wrapping up meanings iri word*. </para>
                    <para>When one makes a charge one should make it without equivocation. The right honorable gentleman has said, if words mean anything, that the justices of the High Court had made up their minds before the Commonwealth had had the opportunity to put its case and had stuck to their view and had never given the Commonwealth the opportunity to be heard. I can see no other interpretation of his words. That is a grave reflection upon the Attorney-General himself and upon the Ministry that permits it. The Minister for Information will speak on this motion. </para>

                            <para>- I am not to be led aside. The honorable gentleman must tell the House and country whether he meant that justices of the High Court were corrupt. If he did not mean that, it is surprising, because he is a Minister of the Crown, an educated man who knows the meaning of words, not an uneducated man who could plead that he did not know the meaning of the words he used. So the honorable gentleman must be held responsible for the contents of his sentences. This is a vital matter. No impartial observer could escape the conclusion that there is an infiltration of propaganda in this country designed to destroy confidence in the judiciary. Such confidence is a fundamental in a democratic state. The High Court is the custodian of the democratic liberties thatsome honorable members of this House would like to destroy. </para>

All he did was to challenge the wisdom of the Chief Justice in suggesting a compromise to the action then pending. But the Minister for Information went much beyond that. He at first said that the law was on the Government##'##s side. I do not see how the honorable gentleman can square that statement with the statement of the Attorney-General that justice was done. The justices are on the High Court bench to administer the law, and it follows from the Attorney-General##'##s speech , that the law was administered. The second statement made by the honorable gentleman was that if another government had been in office, the result would have been different, and the third ##"## Two judges threw away their wigs ##"##. </para>

                    <para>If that is not a charge of corruption, I do not know what it is. Perhaps the honorable gentleman will tei! the people what he meant by those words if he did not mean to charge their Honours with corruption. Does he realize that that is the only construction that can be placed on the words? It is of great moment that the Government fails to understand that democracy cannot survive once confidence in the judiciary is destroyed. Students of the history of democratic liberties will acknowledge that most of those liberties have arisen from the impartial administration of the law by the judiciary for generation after generation. The judiciary, more than politicians who pay lip service to liberty, is the defender of liberty. Lately in our history we have had right through the country charges of partiality levelled against judges. I do not desire to instance particular cases. They are known to every honorable member. Whenever a decision is given which is not acceptable to the political wing or industrial wing of the Labour party, comments are made that the judges were appointed by another government of a different political colour. How can the Government expect democratic principles to be upheld and democratic institutions to be respected if those very democratic principles and institutions are allowed to be attacked in what should be the citadel of liberty, this Parliament. That state of affairs cannot be tolerated by any one.  Unjustifiable  charges of corruption against the judiciary ought not to be made by any one, least of all by a Minister of the Crown. Apparently the Acting Prime Minister knows nothing of the principle of collective responsibility of a Ministry. When a Minister rises in his place and makes public utterances in his ministerial capacity, it is clear, without a shadow of doubt, that he speaks on behalf of the </para>
                    <para class="block">Government. I should like to know and the public would like to know why a Minister who has made a disgraceful charge of corruption against members of the High Court bench is not thrown out of the Ministry. Is it because, as I am inclined to believe, it is not the Ministry but the industrial movement outside that governs the country? If a Minister said in so many words, .  ##"## I charge Justice so and so with corruption ##"##, would the Acting Prime Minister or Attorney-General do nothing and just say, ##"## It is a personal opinion which he is entitled to express ##"##, and cite Lord Atkin or some other judge as an authority to justify the right of a man to criticize a judge? </para>

The best case advanced so far on behalf of the Government was that submitted by the Attorney-General, who was called upon to endeavour to explain the meaning of a letter which he did not write. I always believed that when a charge was made against the writer of a letter, he should be the person to explain the meaning of the contents.

Any one who uses his eyes cannot fail to see that this kind of political intimidation is taking place not only here but also in public departments. Once it is known that a public official can be intimidated by those in office who owe their allegiance to industrial organizations, it will be the end of democratic government in this country. When the Leader of the Opposition sought to ventilate these matters, the Acting Prime Minister hurled all manner of false accusations against him. </para>

                            <para>- That would not mislead blind Freddie. Undoubtedly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gahan</inline> was re-appointed, but for a period of twelve months, and the decision to re-appoint him was made between the time of the hearing of the case and the giving of the judgment. This letter was produced at the hearing, and even the Government, realized that in  those circumstances it, would be too ##"##hot##"## to dismiss him. Therefore, the Government re-appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gahan</inline> for the minimum possible period. The Government hopes that by the expiration of that period, the matter will have blown over and it will be able to do as it pleases. Consequently, the re-appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gahan</inline> does not impress me very much. In my opinion, the letter clearly indicates that an attempt was made by the Acting Prime Minister to bring pressure to bear upon an important official and to interfere with the administration of justice, because the only question to be determined was whether the Crown was right or wrong in contending that an official had been improperly appointed as Secretary of Railways. The matter was before the court. Whenever we attempt to voice criticism of the Government in this chamber and the matter can by the wildest stretch of the imagination be considered to be <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> privilege is claimed, and discussion is stifled. In this instance, the case was ready for hearing and the subpoenas had been issued. I desire to refer to the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich who, on the testimony of the Attorney-General is a man of great ability and impartiality.  His  Honour said - </para>

                    <para>The seriousness of the offence is greatly accentuated when a Minister of the Crown, on whose decision depends the livelihood of this man, is involved. The Attorney-General disregarded the letter written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gahan</inline> last February, and endeavoured to ##"## whitewash ##"## the Minister for the Interior. Does any one believe that it was an impartial judgment? Very clearly, it is a political judgment. The Government said : ##"## We must get the Minister out of this difficulty, and no action must be taken. We shall give some kind of explanation in the House ##"##. That is precisely what has taken place. This reflects the very low level to which the public life of this country has sunk. If, as the Acting Prime Minister claimed, the Opposition should not raise these matters in the Parliament, there is absolutely no forum where they may be properly ventilated. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the interference with the discretion of the Maritime Industry Commission, over which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> de Baun formerly presided. Here again, we heard a very specious argument advanced by the Attorney-General. The fact is on record that for five months the commission sought from the Government information as to whether war risks had decreased in certain waters. The Government was silent. Receiving no assistance from the Government, the commission gave its decision, reducing the war risk bonus. Immediately the unions were up in arms. We have not been told so, but are we expected to believe that not a word passed between the unions and the Government on this matter? Obviously, pressure was brought to bear on the Government, and it succumbed, as it always succumbs. The Attorney-General said that when the decision was made it was discovered for the first time that there was no diminution of war risk. I am a member of the Advisory War Council, and when that body assembles, the Chiefs of Staff give a review of the war position, and refer to danger zones. All I know is that if this information came into the possession of the Government, it was not made known to. us as a member of the council. </para>

                            <para>- Apparently only Ministers have the privilege of revealing what takes place in the War Council. I stated a negative, without revealing anything, and that immediately raised a howl from the Attorney-General. It is extraordinary that at the very time when the unions were exerting pressure on the Government, new facts about war risks should come to light. Again, that horse will not gallop. Obviously the reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> de Baun resigned was that pressure had been brought to bear upon the commission. The Attorney-General has contended that the Government is entitled to instruct its representative on the commission how to vote on various matters under consideration. I point out that the unions have four representatives and, with the Government representative, have an absolute majority on the commission of eight members. Again, it was left to the Attorney-General to make a case; but he failed to do so. The Government is deserving of censure. It is time that we devoted attention to principles in government, and not go from one expedient to another. It is about time that the public realized that this Government is not governing the country, hut merely carrying out the behests of the industrial organizations which stand behind it. </para>

Am I right with the honorable member for Barker, or am I wrong with him? The Leader of the Opposition seeks to make a difference of principle, not of degree, between us.

                            <para>- The Leader of the Opposition, in making his motion this morning, attempted to stigmatize me as dastardly and contemptible. I suggest that such language is unbridled, intemperate and reckless. I usually express my views in guarded terms,  but  there have been very many incidents in this Parliament to which I could properly apply such epithets, adjectives, and adverbs as those which the Leader of the Opposition attached to me in the course of his outburst this morning. He said that my contribution to the debate constituted an ##"##unsavoury incident ##"##. Any fair-minded person would apply a similar expression to the part played by the honorable member for Barker. I do not say that that honorable member contributed to any ##"##unsavoury incident##"##. He criticized the Chief Justice of the High Court, and I defended him. </para>

I did not criticize the judicial system as such, nor did I criticize the judiciary. I made some observations in regard to a majority decision which was given in one case by three members of the High Court and, for doing so, I had the terms ##"## dastardly ##"## and ##"## contemptible ##"## applied to me. Before I conclude my speech I shall involve honorable members opposite - including some of those who have interjected - in certain incidents to which those terms could be applied. </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition talked about a ##"## rabble ##"##. When he uses that expression, of course he means it to apply to the people who vote for Labour party candidates. When he talks about the working men and women of Australia as a rabble he is attacking them because they will not vote for him or accept him at his own valuation. They have refused to place him back on the ministerial bench, and so he talks of them as rabble. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> read his speech. He generally reads what somebody else has written for him. I might add that he did not read it very well. What he said was merely a re-hash of what previously had been said by the Leader of the Opposition who, apparently knowing something of the subject, gave to the Country party Leader a carbon copy of his speech in order to help him out. Then we had the spectacle of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> the independent gentleman who is also a King##'##s Counsel, addressing this House. It is particularly easy to deal with King##'##s Counsel in debate. This honorable gentleman, who criticized me so bitterly today, and said that I should have to answer to the country for what I had done, knows at least that what I say and do I say and do in the open. For weeks past, he has been crawling to Ministers, seeking travel priorities to America. He even approached the Director-General of my department for special facilities in America, so that he could pose there as Australia##'##s Abraham Lincoln. The honorable gentleman knows that his political days are numbered, and that he will not be a member of the eighteenth Parliament of the Commonwealth. I congratulate, in advance, the members of that Parliament, on the fact that its atmosphere will not be poisoned by the pestiferous presence of the honorable gentleman who now represents Warringah. ##"##Dastardly##"## and ##"##contemptible##"## are the terms that have been used in regard to me and other Ministers of this Government. Nothing could be more dastardly or contemptible than the actions of honorable members opposite when they were the Government of this country, in failing to provide for its defence. Their incapacity made the position such that, had they remained in office, the whole of Australia north of the Brisbane line and north of the Perth line would have been abandoned to the advancing Japanese. These persons who talk about dastardly and contemptible conduct are those who sold pig iron to the Japanese before Japan entered the war. They have a lot to answer for at the bar of public opinion, to the present generation of Australians ns well as to posterity. It would seem that the honorable member for Warringah desires to ingratiate himself once more with the powers that control the finances of the anti-Labour parties. He spoke about trying to ##"##stir up the rabble ##"##. That is a European expression. We who sit on this side of the House are an Australian Labour party and government; in fact, we are the only. Australian party in this Parliament. Those with European appreciations of and outlook on our problems are entirely unfitted again to be entrusted with the government of this country. The Leader of the Opposition was particularly offensive in the style of his delivery. He talked about ##"## the rabble##"##, ##"##dastardly and contemptible conduct ##"##, and ##"## unsavoury incidents ##"##. Yet he is the person who addressed the last meeting in Canberra of the Summer School of the Institute of Political Science, and the best subject that he could think of for his speech was a plea for a prosperous postwar Japan. He made it at a time when men were still fighting for Australia, and everybody in this country was realizing that, if Japan were prosperous and strong in the post-war world, the peace would be only an interlude between this war and another and more terrible war. I am entitled to say of the right honorable gentleman, and of those who cheered him, that that attitude was dastardly and contemptible. There are honorable members opposite who do .not agree with his sentiments, yet none of them has yet repudiated him. I know that the vast majority of them do not believe in the dictum which he uttered because he thought that it might suit international finance. I could talk about a lot of other things which the right honorable gentleman has said and done in the past. I can best comment upon his conduct by repeating what was said of him as late as the 20th October last by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> The press reported that right honorable gentleman as having said - </para>

It was awfully good of Menzies to say I could join the new show if I applied. Menzies formed a group of the outstanding tories under the style of the national service group; he damagingly renounced overnight the post-war credits points of the 1943 policy speech, jolting the then Leader of the Opposition into the cry that he had been stabbed in theback. No one is going to be leader if Menzies cannot. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is no need to ##"## paint the lily ##"##, to ##"## gild refined gold ##"##. That is the statement of one who knows the Leader of the Opposition better than he is known by any one else. The right honorable member for Kooyong also accused the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> and me of breaking Cabinet solidarity, and of being a law unto ourselves. He has always been a law unto himself. He is the only political leader in Australian history who has succeeded in dividing his own Cabinet on the floor of this House. The honorable member for Warringah also talked about Cabinet solidarity and collective responsibility. On the 30th May, 1940, the House of Representatives divided on the subject of the Motor ##"##Vehicles Agreement Bill. Every Australian Country party Minister in the Government of that day voted against it, and all United Australia Party members voted with the Australian Labour party after the then Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> had asked for leave to withdraw an amendment he had moved. There has been no division in the present Cabinet: there have been no crises of that sort. Before the Leader of the Opposition ran successfully charge the Minister for Transport and me with breaking Cabinet solidarity he will have to explain, if possible, how he obtained leadership of a government at a time when the then Prime Minister described him as lacking in loyalty, courage, and a lot of other things, and how he eventually proceeded to the point of destroying that same government. He took three new men into his Government, in the hope that he would thereby secure a majority in his favour; he created three new portfolios to bring them in, but it did not take those new Ministers long to find out the real position. . They soon voted the right honorable gentleman out and voted in as Prime Minister the right honorable member for Darling Downs (Mr.Fadden). Yet he stands here to-day. and presumes to lecture this Government ! He has made the incident of last Friday the important one on which to base his charges.  His  motion to-day is a fivepoint programme. He had a. fivepoint programme last week, and he will have another when we meet again. He will try to censure or criticize us on some collection of five points that will arise between now and the next meeting of the Parliament. All that I have to say is that I accept responsibility for what I did; but I refuse to accept the interpretations that have been placed upon my actions. I have been attacked in this Parliament, and in the press of this country. The Leader of the Country party built a part of his case on the fact that my speech had been featured in the press, of this country. I care nothing for the press. I am concerned about only the common people of Australia and their interests. If people malign me in this House, I shall defend myself as best I can ; and when I am maligned and attacked outside this Parliment I shall take such action as will ensure my protection. I was attacked in a certain newspaper last Saturday, and was called ##"## a malicious liar ##"##. I have to-day issued a writ in the High Court of Australia, claiming damages for libel, and have set the amount of the damages at ##£##25,000. Whatever may be charged or alleged against me, it can never be said that I have uttered sentiments in favour of Germany or Japan. In reply to the talk of dastardly and contemptible conduct, I quote finally the words uttered by the gentleman who now leads the Opposition after his return from Germany in 1938. The words more fittingly apply to him. He then said - </para>

                        <para>.- I commend the Government on its enterprise and foresight in taking steps to establish the aluminium industry in Australia on a sound and permanent basis. The bill provides for the allocation of ##£##1,500,000 of Commonwealth money for this purpose, and it has been agreed with the Government of Tasmania that it shall provide the same amount. It is proposed to produce aluminium ingots from local bauxite. I am glad that it is to be a purely government concern run by the Commonwealth and Tasmanian governments in conjunction. Many thousands of workers in my electorate are vitally interested in the aluminium industry, particularly those employed in aircraft  production and in the extrusion plant at Granville. When this proposal is put into effect, we shall no longer foe dependent upon overseas supplies of aluminium, and the fact that the industry will be under government control will foe a guarantee that it will not close down after the war, as might happen if it wore controlled by private enterprise. Millions of pounds have been invested in the Australian aircraft production industry, and the many thousands of workers employed in it are anxious that the continuity of their employment shall be assured. As was pointed out by the Minister for Supply <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> when introducing the bill, theestablishment of the aluminium industry in Australia is vital to the defence of the country, not only during this war, but also after the war. The Minister for Munitions <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> explained how serious the position was some time ago when there was only three weeks##'## supply of aluminium in the country. When I was a member of the War Expenditure Committee, we visited the works at Granville, and the manager, pointing to a small quantity of aluminium lying in a yard, said that that was all they had with which to carry on the industry, and his was the only firm engaged in fabrication at that time. He then took us to another part of the premises where there was a dump of scrap aluminium. Honorable members will recall the campaign to obtain scrap aluminium from anywhere, even the halt, the lame and the blind. Amongst the heap of household pots and pans there was an artificial limb passed in by a cripple. We all know that aluminium imports were limited severely by the sinking of ships in the Pacific and other seas and by the fact that one British factory producing aluminium ingots was blown up by German bombs. That was one of the reasons prompting this Government to set up its own factory. I -know that the factory at Granville is controlled by the international cartel, Alcoa, and that two-thirds of the shares are owned and controlled by overseas interests. I have nothing to say in disparagement of the manner in which the owners have conducted the works. It is a credit to them ; they have materially aided the prosecution of the war. I understand that there was an agreement with the company that it would obtain its supplies of aluminium ingots from overseas. But we have learned our lesson. We cannot allow ourselves again to be in the plight that threatened us when supplies of aluminium were virtually non-existent. We must be self-reliant. Doubtless, there were influences at work, particularly early in the war, to prevent the setting up of the aluminium industry in Australia. How those influences worked has been referred to many times in this chamber. On one occasion, when I was dealing with the retarding effect of monopolies on the war effort in the early stages of the war, I pointed out that certain activities, including the manufacture of aluminium, were being held back until big interests were able to deal with them. The honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Breen)</inline> last night referred to a process for the manufacture of aluminium devised by certain engineers in conjunction with the Sydney Technical School. As a private member in opposition, during the Menzies regime, the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> referred to an engineer in Sydney who offered a certain process for the manufacture of aluminium to the then Director of Materials, who replied that the Government was not interested and referred him to Electrolytic Zinc and Metal Manufactures Limited, a private concern  in which ##'##he was interested. Those examples show that the previous Government was not interested in setting up the aluminium industry as a governmental activity, but was prepared to leave the industry to private vested interests. A group of people in Berrima, where there are bauxite deposits, was interested in a project for the establishment of a factory to manufacture aluminium. Among them were some engineers who formerly occupied fairly high positions in an aluminium factory in Yugoslavia and had brought the blue prints of that factory to Australia. That proposition was put to the Menzies Government. 1 saw the correspondence, including the reply of the then Prime Minister that the matter had been referred to  the  Director-General of Munitions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Essington</inline> Lewis, but nothing further about the proposition was heard by those people. Then there was the offer by an outstanding Australian engineer. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bradfield,</inline> who recently died, to act in an honorary capacity in developing resources of bauxite in Queensland which he, in conjunction with the Mines Department of Queensland, had tested and found to be 90 per cent, pure alumina. Unfortunately, his offer was not accepted, again showing that the Menzies Government was not interested in establishing a government factory. I am glad that this Government takes a different attitude. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ronald</inline> Charles came to this country at the invitation of the Menzies Government to report on the proposed establishment in this country of the aluminium industry. He is interested in the overseas combine and he was mainly interested in setting up a privately controlled factory. It was submitted to the then government that the overseas interests would establish, at the estimated cost of ##£##2,500,000, a factory for the manufacture of aluminium on the condition that at the conclusion of the war the plant be dismantled and sent back overseas. That was the catch. That shows that overseas interests are not concerned about the development of this country in times of peace. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>It has been proposed by the Opposition that the establishment of this industry should foe referred to the Tariff Board or some other body for further inquiry, but there is no necessity for that, because I have no doubt that the commission that will be set up to govern this enterprise will fully inquire into all aspects of the industry and ensure that the most modern plant shall be installed. It will not necessarily accept the plant offered by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ronald</inline> Charles. I hope that the commission will investigate the other propositions, including the one emanating from the Yugoslavian engineers. Now that Yugoslavia has been almost liberated by the United Nations, there should be ample evidence available from that country as to the type of plant in operation there. </para>
                    <para>It is important that this asset should be controlledby the people, because, if the industry were left to the control of private interests and dismantled after the war, as was proposed, the users of aluminium would have been saddled in the price of aluminium products with huge costs for the establishment of something which would no longer exist. Never again shall we believe that we can find millions of pounds to expend in a war for destruction, but nothing in time of peace for construction and the development of this country. This industry, among other secondary industries, . is not only essential to the development of this country, but also vital ##'##to its defence. Never again shall we allow ourselves to be in the position we occupied at the outbreak of this war, particularly when Japan entered the conflict, when we had to beg aid from overseas, and when, in the words of the Prime Minister, we had to start from scratch, with the great defence undertakings like the Cockatoo Dock and the Small Arms Factory almost motionless. The aluminium industry also is an important subsidiary to the aircraft industry, which must be developed in this country. The next war will be a fast-moving war and it will come from the north. The very fact that this industry will be in Tasmania may be advantageous, because Tasmania will be isolated. Tasmania has suffered considerably in this war because we have had to divert to the mainland not only industrial activity, but also man-power. After the war, aluminium will be needed not only as a defence material, but also for the manufacture of household and office equipment and in railway construction. Railways will have to compete against speedier methods of transport, and it will be necessary for the rail services to be accelerated, and that will entail lighter rolling-stock, for which aluminium will be needed. I feel sure, therefore, that there will be a considerable market for aluminium. The light car industry will be a further avenue for disposal of the product of this proposed factory. Other ways in which the products of that factory will be used could be mentioned. </para>
                    <para>This (bill cannot be challenged constitutionally. There will certainly be no challenge . from the Government of Tasmania, which is contributing one half of the cost. Tasmania is ideal for the development of the industry. Experts have approved of it. The hydro-electric power is cheap and, as in the other States, deposits of bauxite are available. The climate is ideal for the establishment of engineering activities. Moreover, it is only fair to Tasmania, which has lost so much of its man-power ito .the mainland, that the Commonwealth Government should take some steps to redirect manpower to that State.

                        <para>.- It is scarcely necessary for me to say that I am anxious to see the aluminium industry established in Tasmania. At the same time, I desire to ensure that it shall be established on a firm and satisfactory basis. An unanswerable case has been made for an independent investigation in order that honorable members may better inform their minds regarding the proposal. Many people are gravely concerned about the alleged satisfactory nature of this proposed undertaking. There is a definite lack of reliable information regarding the technical and economic aspects of the industry. The Minister for Supply and Shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> who introduced the bill, gave little or no information to honorable members about the proposal, and it is no wonder that a good deal of confusion and doubt exist regarding the practicability of establishing the undertaking on a satisfactory basis. I do not blame the Minister. Doubtless he gave to the House all the information in his possession, exceedingly limited though it was. Honorable members should ask themselves, not what Tasmania or Australia will gain from this industry, but what disabilities Tasmania and Australia may suffer if the industry be  established on a false foundation. I shall support the request for an independent investigation of the proposal in order that honorable members may obtain a better knowledge of it. An exceptionally strong case was submitted by the honorable member for Gippsland##'## <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> for this inquiry. He proved conclusively that neither the Minister nor his advisers had. much knowledge of the technical side of the industry. </para>

Towards the establishment of the aluminium ingot industry, the Commonwealth proposes to expend at least ##£##1,500,000. As a Tasmanian and an Australian, I am undoubtedly entitled to make an effort to ensure that the money shall be wisely expended in such a manner as to give some reasonable assurance of success. I must be certain that Tasmanian taxpayers will not be committed to pay interest on borrowed money for generations to come. I require all the information that I can secure on this subject in. order that I may cast an intelligent vote upon this most important proposal. If the House in its wisdom - or lack of wisdom - decides that it does not want an inquiry, I shall support the motion for the second reading of the bill. </para>

I am somewhat unhappy about the fragile promises that were made for the establishment of this industry in Tasmania. As has already been pointed out, a definite promise was made just prior to the last election. No strings were attached to it. When the Minister for Supply and Shipping was in Hobart on the eve of the last election, he stated definitely that the industry would be established in Tasmania and that the Government would set aside the sum of ##£##3,000,000 for that purpose. Undoubtedly the Minister dangled an electioneering bait. Huge advertisements were published in the Tasmanian press bearing the words, ##"##Vote Labour and secure the aluminium industry ##"##. But people were not told that Tasmania would be obliged to provide one-half of the capital. Now, with the election a matter of history, Tasmania is called upon to find ##£##1 for ##£##1. </para>

                            <para>- It did. I do not deny that. The first instalment of ##£##1,500,000 is provided ##'## in this bill. I use the words ##"## first instalment ##"## advisedly, because I am informed that the two Governments will not establish aluminium smelteries at the cost of ##£##3,000,000. As I may be wrong, I ask for an inquiry to be held into the Government##'##s proposal, in order that honorable members may inform their minds. If the establishment of the industry is to cost more than ##£##3,000,000, another call for money will have to be made on the Commonwealth and the State of Tasmania. </para>

                    <para>The Government may contend that it could not constitutionally establish this industry without entering into partnership with the State of Tasmania. That assertion will not bear examination. Last February, the Minister for Supply and Shipping stated that the bill had been printed and was ready for presentation to this Parliament, and no obligation had then been imposed on Tasmania to subscribe a proportion of the capital cost. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth may grant any sum of money that it sees fit to any State, and may attach thereto any conditions that it chooses. Under that provision, the Commonwealth could and should accept the whole of the responsibility for establishing this industry, as Tasmanians understood the Commonwealth would do when the promise was made prior to the last election. But what do we find? Tasmanian taxpayers will now be called upon to bear one-half of the financial responsibility for this undertaking, and a huge interest bill for many generations to come. 1 cannot understand why the Commonwealth asked Tasmania to accept a share of the responsibility, because the Commonwealth did not find it necessary to enter into an agreement with the State of Victoria, where the other section of the industry has been established. Without the Government of Victoria providing one penny, a part of the aluminium industry has been established in that State. If it is constitutional to erect fabrication works in Victoria, why is it unconstitutional to build a smelting plant in Tasmania? Tasmania can provide both the bauxite and the hydroelectric power for the industry. Huge quantities of high grade bauxite occur in Tasmania. In the Ouse district alone two million tons is in sight, and valuable deposits are also found in the Tamar and Campbelltown districts, and I am anxious to see it established on a sound foundation. Consequently, we must consider some of the points mentioned by previous speakers. </para>
                    <para>We must ascertain whether the aluminium industry has an established future in the markets of Australia and the rest of the world ; whether the development of magnesium and plastics offers a serious threat to aluminium ; and whether the fact that the world##'##s productive capacity has been multiplied several times to meet the demands of war will have any influence on the future of the Australian industry. Are there not, in those doubts, excellent reasons for an inquiry into the Government##'##s proposal? We must also consider whether Australia can produce aluminium which will be able to compete in price and quality with that produced elsewhere; whether Australian requirements are sufficient to keep the Australian industry going; and what protection will be required to ensure that no imported aluminium shall enter this country. We must not and cannot afford to depart from sound business principles. </para>
                    <para>A new world is in the making. If we are to share in its benefit which we all hope it will have to offer, our industry must be founded on a firm basis. I hope that the Government has examined the effects of international contracts and agreements upon this industry. What is the position of Australia in relation to the Aluminium Company of Canada? Early in the war, the Commonwealth Government, together with the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of Canada, entered into an agreement to erect an aluminium plant in Canada. Australia provided ##£##1,000,000 for the work, and the money could be regarded as an advance payment for aluminium to be supplied to this country. I believe that 20,000 tons of aluminium was to be provided during a period of six years. One-half of that period has already expired. How much more of that 20,000 tons still has to come to Australia I do not know. Advice that I have received from a Tasmanian Government official is thai in 1938-39 only 1,320 tons had been imported. At pre-war consumption rates it would take a long time to absorb 20,000 tons, but with the war emergency conditions of the last few years the situation may have altered completely. I desire more information on the subject. </para>
                    <para>The Minister, in his second-reading speech, said that after the war Australia would require approximately 6,000 tons of aluminium per annum. That envisages a consumption four and a half times greater than our post-war importations. Many new uses for this metal will undoubtedly be found, but whether they will require four and a half times our previous importations is another matter. We know, too, that magnesium is superseding aluminium for many purposes, but here again lack of information prevents us from exercising sound judgment. In these circumstances it would be highly advisable for the Government to order an independent investigation of the whole subject by a competent authority, including the future of magnesium. It is beyond question that the world production of aluminium at present exceeds world demand. American Government plants, apart from those operated by private enterprise, are producing as much aluminium as was used throughout the world prior to the war. Allied production of aluminium is now six times greater than the pre-war world demand. The plant at  Arvida,  in Canada, in respect of which the Commonwealth Government has expended ##£##1,000,000, produced 340,000 tons of aluminium in 1942. Last year it was producing at the rate of 1,000 tons a day, and provided 40 per cent.##"## of total Allied requirements. Over-production in the United States has resulted in two plants, which cost ##£##23,000,000 to establish, being closed down before reaching the production stage. To-day##'##s output of aluminium is far greater than the demand, and unless many more uses can be found for this metal the new industry is not likely to be the success we would desire. </para>
                    <para>We know, of course, that the aluminium industry is the basis of the aircraft industry and that that industry is basic to national defence; but with the cessation of hostilities, which we hope will not be long delayed, the demand for aluminium will shrink greatly. I should like to know whether there is any truth in the statement which has originated in America that magnesium is being used as an alloy to the degree of 80 per cent, or 90 per cent, of the finished metal. The plain fact is that we have not sufficient information on this subject to register an intelligent vote. It is particularly import tint that we should obtain reliable information concerning the increasing use of magnesium. No honorable member of the House has given us dependable information on this  point. </para>
                    <para>I direct attention to the following paragraph, which appeared in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Industrial Australian and Mining Standard</inline> of the 15th October, 1944 :- </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In our issues of 1st April, 1943, and 1st April, 1944, the likely damage to he done to other industries by saddling them with expensive light metal was pointed out. It was shown that production of the metal in the United States of America, where it can be produced at a fraction of the cost of manufacture in Australia, has increased from 521,106 tons in 1942 to 920,000 in 1943, and that during the last quarter of 1943 production was at the rate of 1,12S,000 tons a year, and has to be reduced. The main argument for the extraction of aluminium in this country during recent discussions was that we should make ourselves secure for defence reasons by having the industry here. The effective answer to this was that an ample stock of the cheap aluminium produced in America could be established here with a very small percentage of the huge sum mentioned in the bill. In any case, petrol has to bc imported, so a local aluminium supply would not make us self-contained in war-time. </para>

                        <para>With a world glutted with aluminium the proposal bids fair to commit the taxpayers to large losses and the industries which use aluminium as a raw material to unwarranted expense. With the cheapest steel and zinc in the world available in Australia it would be a pity to allow a political stunt to superimpose a high-priced light metal on manufacturers. The alternative is to add the losses of this undertaking to our taxation burden. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">If the Government were requesting the establishment of this industry as a purely defence measure it would be standing on firmer ground. We all know that in the earlier days of the war the Allied Nations were in . very great need of aluminium, but to-day the market is glutted. The industry cannot be justified, even on defence grounds, if we confine our outlook to the present war; but if Australia ever again became so isolated geographically as it was some time ago, an industry of this description would be of great value to us. We are justified in accepting as our motto, ##"## In our preparedness lies our safety ##"##. Any Australian government is under an obligation to provide for future defence needs, but if the measure is being put forward as a defence project, it is quite unjust to call upon Tasmania to contribute so heavily towards its establishment. In that circumstance there is no justification whatever for requiring Tasmania to contribute half the capital cost. </para>

                            <para>- Victoria has not been called on to contribute one penny piece towards the establishment of a fabrication plant in that State. Why then should Tasmania be called upon to contribute towards the establishment of the ingot manufacturing industry? The Tasmanian people are being asked to accept a double risk. First of all, our people are being called upon to contribute on a ##£##1 for ##£##1 basis with the Commonwealth ; and, secondly, they are being required to find between ##£##1,000,000 and ##£##1,500,000 to provide additional hydro-electric power for the industry. It is obvious to m( that there is a danger that the Tasmanian taxpayers may be called upon to pay interest, through many generations, on an expenditure of between ##£##3,000,000 and ##£##4,000,000 involved in the establishment of an industry which is required mainly for defence purposes. ##"##We have been told that the Wangaratta fabrication plant is owned by the Government, but will it be controlled by the Government? </para>

It is unsatisfactory to me that only the smelting plant is to be established in Tasmania. I consider that the whole industry should be located there. Competition will be keen enough, we all realize. I shall be happy if the Government will agree to an independent investigation of the whole proposal, in order to resolve doubts that have arisen in the minds of honorable members as to the justification for the expenditure of this money. Surely honorable members opposite do not desire to launch out on this project before important questions in regard to i  its  future have been properly considered. After all, we are public trustees. The people rightly expect us to safeguard the expenditure of their money, and to satisfy ourselves that new industries which depend upon Government funds shall have a reasonable assurance of success. </para>

                        <para>.- Normally every honorable member would welcome proposals from the Government for the establishment of important new industries, and would readily give their approval to such projects. If we could be assured that the proposal to establish the aluminium ingot industry in Tasmania was soundly based, we would quickly commend, it, for we would be glad to know that a State which had not hitherto enjoyed an undue proportion of the industrial development of the Commonwealth was to be the home of the new industry. We realize, of course, that new industries which are soundly based, provide employment for our people, and ensure industrial progress. 1 am certain, however, that the Government must have been impressed by the criticism of this measure. The Opposition is asking, firmly, that before this industry is established proper investigation shall be made to ascertain how it will stand in the face of future world competition. Our practice in the past, has been to give adequate tariff protection to new and economically sound Australian industries, because we believe that they are good national assets; but we have not been given sufficient information to justify the conclusion that this industry would have reasonable prospects of success, considered apart from its importance as a defence measure. We must pay some regard, of course, to the possibility of threats from aggressor nations in the future, and it may be that a strong case can be stated for the establishment of the aluminium industry in this country on security grounds. I do not wish to repeat the arguments of honorable gentlemen who have already competently put their views before the House, but I say without hesitation that a clear and compelling case has been made out for further inquiry, in order to justify our proceeding with this proposal. I base that, not merely on the fact that the Government itself has made so little information available to us; both the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> and the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Breen)</inline> who, obviously, have given a great deal of study to this matter, are in. direct conflict in regard to what they believe to be statements of fact. The honorable member for Gippsland, in a clear and interesting statement, informed us that, without further development in Australia, this industry would bc virtually in the hands of the overseas combine which controls the production of aluminium at the present time. The honorable member for Calare challenged that statement, and stated his view, .based on such information as he had - which, in his opinion, provided a complete answer. </para>

                            <para>- I accept that interesting statement. We are gathering information as the debate proceeds. I am certain that, at its conclusion, few honorable members will consider that they have such a complete picture of a projected new industry as they ought to have, particularly in view of their serious misgivings as to whether or not the industry can be conducted in Australia so economically as to permit it to compete on favorable terms with the production of other countries. The important question is not so much whether the honorable member for Gippsland is right and the .honorable member for Calare is wrong, or whether or not other honorable members have stated facts accurately but whether or not there has been that full presentation of the facts which would enable this House to make up its mind on such an important matter. But even that is not, to me, the phase of the highest importance to which this House should be devoting its attention. The international aspect has been comparatively untouched in the debate, although it was mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition. If we have a realistic appreciation of our place in the world, we know that Australia of itself can fill only a minor role. If we are to have any influence on the conduct of international affairs, there are two important ways in which it can be exercised, namely, asone of the components of the English-speaking group of nations, or, in the way to which we have become accustomed, as a unit of the British Commonwealth. In either of those two ways, we should have an influence and an authority out of all proportion to the number of our people. I do not need to dwell on that matter, because it should be clear to all honorable members. I fear that the Government is treading on dangerous ground, and is setting a hazardous course, when it adopts the procedure that has been followed in connexion with this measure. It may be convinced that it has ##"##all the information it requires to justify the establishment of the industry. Certainly, it has not yet given all that information to the House. But let us assume that it has taken all those precautions which a prudent government would deem necessary before embarking on such an important undertaking. It has not discharged its responsibility to the full, having regard to the significance of an economic development of this kind at the present stage in our history, and its possible repercussions on other English-speaking countries. From time to time in this place, the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has stressed the importance of the text of the Atlantic Charter. We know that the spirit of that document, and a good deal of its language, deal with future economic relationships between the peoples of the world. The whole spirit of the Charter is that there should be a freer and wider movement of trade between the peoples of the world. Those who have some knowledge of the recent political history of  President  Roosevelt and of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cordell</inline> Hull in respect of economic policies, can readily imagine that they have contemplated some lowering of world tariff barriers and a very much freer movement of goods than was the case immediately prior to the war. The Atlantic Charter was followed by a document a little more explicit in its terms, to which to-day Australia is a consenting party. The Leader of the Opposition has recited the terms of Article 7 of the Lend##'##-Lease Agreement made between the United States of America and the United Kingdom in February, 1942, and has pointed out that that article was adopted as the basis of an agreement between the United States of America and Australia. It sets out one of the international obligations into which this country entered. If honorable members will examine the text of it, they will see that the terms and conditions of the lend-lease arrangement were to be such as would not burden commerce between the two countries but would permit mutually advantageous economic relations between them and promote the betterment of world-wide economic relations. Later, reference is made to the appropriate international and domestic measures to be taken by both countries in regard to production, employment, and the exchange and consumption of goods, which the document describes as the material foundations of the liberty and welfare <inline font-style="italic">a*</inline> all peoples. It proposes the elimination of discriminatory treatment of all forms in international commerce, and the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers. Yet, deliberately, as we approach the conclusion of this protracted war, this country is about to establish a new industry, knowing that there is a world glut of the metal which it is proposed to manufacture, and that the United States of America and Canada are significantly involved in its world-wide distribution. That knowledge of itself, may not be. sufficient to deter us from proceeding with a proposal which we believe to be desirable from the stand-points of development and defence. But surely our commitments in relation to international obligations, and a realistic appreciation of what we may expect to be the state of mind of the governments in countries with which we are to-day on most friendly terms, should compel us not only to make the most searching inquiries, but also to see that the findings of that inquiry shall be made known to those countries. I should feel a good deal happier about the measure had I the knowledge that the Tariff Board had conducted a full investigation of the prospects of the industry, including an examination of its economics, and of world production, the present condition of world stocks and prices, and the relevant local and defence considerations, as well as all the other items that would be part and parcel of a full dress inquiry; and, having taken evidence for and against the proposal from interested parties, had published its findings in the full light of day, so that not only this Government and. Parliament, but also those other countries with which we must preserve the most friendly trade and political relations, might be fully informed of the reason for our making this important decision. That has not been done ; and so long as it remains undone we shall run the very grave risk of having Australia##'##s attitude and policy misunderstood by those other nations. Australia is not entirely a manufacturing country. It is true that, in recent years, all the emphasis internally appears to have been on industrial manufacture. During the war years we have given a great impetus to the development of our secondary industries, and our discussions in this place have been largely concerned with matters relating to them. But surely we have not forgotten that this is a great exporting country, which must rely on the satisfactory disposal overseas of its surplus primary production in order to maintain a sound internal economy ! If we accept as verity that we are largely dependent upon the successful sale of that surplus in order to have prosperity within this country, then we shall not by any deliberate act do anything that might jeopardize those world markets that are available to us. Yet, I submit, that is the very consequence that is threatened by the actions of the Government in this matter. We know that Great Britain, for example, has increased its primary production by more than 50 per cent, during the war years. It has expanded its acreage, and has produced additional foodstuffs in order to keep its people alive. I have heard it suggested that, having so developed its agricultural industries, it is determined to maintain them after the war, even should that mean the erection of high tariff barriers. That, perhaps, is a natural state of mind in the people of Britain, who have experienced the deprivation arising from a scarcity of foodstuffs. Similarly, it may be argued that our experience in trying to obtain aluminium in the early stages of the war impels us to the decision to establish this industry. But in doing that, we are disregarding the spirit of the Atlantic Charter and, in fact, the actual text of the lend-lease agreements. Are we to give only lip service to those undertakings? Is each country to take such economic action as would nullify them completely? Australia can ill afford to be the first country to move in the direction of the defeat of those important objectives. Yet that is what is being done. So I have very great uneasiness in regard to this measure. I do not condemn the establishment in Australia of the aluminium industry because, frankly, I would not claim to have the information on which a sound judgment could be based. Only by the inquiry suggested could honorable members be placed in a position to give a worthwhile judgment. But I am. even more concerned in regard to what I believe will be the repercussions in the  other English-speaking countries, particularly the United States of America and Canada, and to a less degree Great Britain, of an act of this kind which cannot be justified in their eyes without their perusal of a public and detailed document warranting the establishment of the industry, and which is performed in such a casual manner by the government of the day. It is still not too late for the Government to take the action suggested. I do not believe that the House is hostile to the creation of an aluminium industry in Australia, and if the facts were properly presented there might be overwhelming support for the project. We should be failing in our duty, having in mind the need to maintain healthy economic development, if we did not demand a full inquiry; and the Government will be failing in its duty to the people if it takes action likely to create friction with our friendly neighbours and trading colleagues by refusing a full and reasonable inquiry so that the reasons for its decision may be patent to all who are interested. I wish to impress this particularly upon the Attorney-General, who is also Minister for External Affairs. In that capacity he must have a very lively regard for what people in other countries may think of this proposal. Presented as it has been, it lays us open to the suspicion - indeed, to the resentment - of other countries which are looking forward to a post-war era in which industry will not be seeking the same high protection as before the war. The Governments of all countries will be seeking to discover ways in which the most economic production can be most widely distributed. Because this matter is so internationally important, I heartily endorse the amendment, and will give it ray full support. </para>

S. Robinson, who is head of the Aluminium Company of Australia. He is also, I understand, head of the British Aluminium Company. Limited. He accompanied the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> on his visit to America, and he has been identified with almost every political party which has been served by the financial group that he represents. I wish to give something of the background of this gentleman who seeks to control the aluminium industry of Australia, and to push the Government into doing something which, so far as I can judge, will be in the interests of the group which he represents. The Premier of Tasmania named him as the man whose advice on this project had been accepted, and whose recommendation had .substantially guided the Government. </para>

That is nothing against him. _ <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ANTHONY.-</inline> The balance of the biography mentions only -whom he married, and other personal and family details. However, it should be of interest to the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> and the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robinson</inline> is a member of the Union Club in Sydney, and of the Melbourne Club in Melbourne. Thus he appears to be a fitting associate for honorable members opposite. The Government##'##s proposal has been forced on despite protests from many quarters, and. in spite of requests that it be referred to the Tariff Board for investigation. The proposal is being pushed from behind by these interests. </para>

He is attempting to accomplish something - I do not say improperly - for the benefit of himself and the interests he represents, and not necessarily for the benefit of the people of Australia. I learn from another authority to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> S. Robinson is a director of the Australian Aluminium Company Proprietary Limited, which was registered in 1939 with a nominal capital of ##£##3,000,000. It is a subsidiary of the British Aluminium Company Limited (England), and Aluminium Limited (Canada) both of which are allied to Electrolytic Zinc and Metal Manufactures Limited, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robinson</inline> is also a director. The Minister for Munitions <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> is interjecting in defence of the Baillieu group, although in the past he has been loud in its condemnation... Now, he and his colleagues seek in some way or other to confer benefits upon this group. </para>

                            <para>- The interjection indicates that honorable members opposite have made a complete <inline font-style="italic">volte-face.</inline> I am not questioning the ability of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robinson</inline> as a business man. I confess, however, that I am afraid of his excellence as a business man in that he may look after his own interests, and not necessarily be so concerned about the national interest. If there is anything in the repeated allegations of honorable members opposite that big business interferes too much in politics, then this matter certainly calls for investigation. What is the position of the aluminium industry al the present time? It is true that about three years ago, when the party, of which I am a member, was in office, aluminium was in very short supply, not only in Australia, but also in other countries. We were calling in pots and pans and all aluminium utensils. In the United States of America, the Government was doing the same, as were the authorities in England and ils Germany. There was a world shortage, but owing to the enormous productive capacity of the United States of America and Canada the shortage has been overtaken, and there is now a stockpile of aluminium in the United States of America and Canada which is an embarrassment to both those countries. The situation which existed when we were in office, making desirable the establishment of an aluminium industry in Australia, no longer exists. Here is an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Chemical Market Review</inline> of the 25th September, 1944, issued by the Republic Corporation of New York City - </para>

                    <para>Officials do not know where to turn to make use of all the aluminium now being produced. In spite of recent production curtailment orders, the output of aluminium remains many times greater than in peace-time. </para>
                    <para>Whether these are facts remains to be established, not by statements made in this House, because the House cannot fairly determine the rights of a proposition like this. We endeavour to secure information wherever it is obtainable; we listen to statements by Ministers and experts who have made great research into a particular subject, but we have no opportunity to interrogate witnesses, collate information and present it as the Tariff Board has done for many years in respect of other industries. Therefore, it is important, if the sum of ##£##3,000,000 is to be expended, to know first whether the industry is necessary from the point of view of the defence of Australia, as has been stated by Ministers, and secondly, whether it is economically sound and practicable or whether we would be wiser to buy aluminium from Canada, the United States of America or Great Britain. For ##£##3,000,000 Ave could lay up a stockpile of aluminium which would probably last us for a couple of wars. But I am not suggesting that we should not go on with this project. I am not in a position to know, and I venture to say that most honorable members are similarly insufficiently informed. When the establishment of new industries was projected years ago, the Tariff Board was appointed to determine the very questions that honorable members have not the means to examine for themselves. The very cogent amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party indicates that we should do something in that direction. We should first examine, if we are going to manufacture in Australia everything that Australian workmanship and ingenuity can devise, how our overseas markets will be affected. We must reciprocate in some form or other. We cannot expect to sell our wool, butter and meat - and apples from Tasmania - unless we are prepared to buy from countries with, which we trade some of the commodities that they want to sell. Therefore, examination must be made of the commodities which can be best made in Australia and those which it would be best, from the point of view of economics and international trade, to buy from those countries with which we have trade relations. It is most vital from the point of view of the primary industries of Australia, and it is largely because of that I have risen to speak on this project, which calls for the expenditure of ##£##3,000,000 and is likely to have some very great effect upon our trade relations with other countries. It should not be entered into lightly, and certainly should not be entered into at the behest of some group which may have an axe to grind. I do not attribute altruistic motives to the gentleman whose record I have given. </para>

                            <para>- I am not. I do not give the Collins House group credit for altruistic motives. I think there is some self-interest behind this, and I want to know why the Attorney-General takes so much notice of those gentlemen. It may be a compliment to the gentlemen concerned or even to the Attorney-General himself that he does so, but it requires examination to determine whether the Attorney-General has not been over-influenced by the Collins House group and by the Baillieu group. This is not something to be lightly treated. I charge that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> S. Robinson, who went abroad with the Attorney-General and who was with him week in and week out and month in and month out in England as well as America had no official status. </para>

That is why, during the eloquent speech of the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> last night, I interjected that this project called for not an inquiry by the Tariff Board, but a royal commission. Now that the Minister assisting the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini),</inline> the author of <inline font-style="italic">Money Without Tears,</inline> is about to interject, I should like to know where the money is coming from. Are the taxpayers to be further taxed or is the money to be diverted from loan moneys, and if so are the people to be invited to contribute to war loans and have some of their contributions used on such a project as this which has never been examined by any competent authority in this country? </para>

                            <para>- That was three or four years ago, and conditions have altered since then when we had only a few tons of aluminium in this country, and ##'##there was a world shortage of aluminium to the point at which to-day the producing countries do not know what to do with it. As a matter of fact, I was talking to honorable members who have recently been to Canada, and they told me that the stockpiles of aluminium there were such that the Government did not know which way to turn to get rid of it. In the United States of America, the Government is now appealing to manufacturers to manufacture all kinds of aluminium commodities in order to use the excess production. This is what the <inline font-style="italic">Chemical Market Review</inline> of the 25th September last said - </para>

                        <para>Officials are urging the use of more aluminium In all types of products. Unless new uses for the aluminium are rapidly developed, the supply will continue to exceed demands. The War Production Board is encouraging the use of aluminium wherever possible.

                    <para class="block">So the position in America is that the authorities are trying to  encourage  the use of aluminium to get rid of their surplus. At the very time when that position exists in the world, when there is an acute shortage of labour, and when there are huge surplus stocks of aluminium in other places only requiring ships to bring it here, we are going to divert labour, material and money to an industry which could well be allowed to stand over until after the war. The Government has no regard at all for its responsibilities, particularly in view of the charges that have been made in this House in respect of this industry. I do not object to the industry going to Tasmania or anywhere else. As a matter of fact, if the industry is to be established in Australia the claims of Tasmania are very strong. So I am not biased. All I want to do is to ensure that when this industry is created its footing shall be on firm ground and that it shall not be simply a ##"## stooge ##"## for the Aluminium Company of Australia, the Aluminium Company of Canada, and the Aluminium Company of the United Kingdom, in all three of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> S.

In 1941, it was a matter of great urgency, because we could not get aluminium from the United States of America or anywhere else, and it was absolutely essential to go ahead with the production of aluminium then, just as to-day it is essential to go ahead with the production of synthetic rubber and other commodities vital to defence. We decided to go ahead because we were unable to obtain aluminium, which was essential, from the United States of America. If war comes again, we shall be dependent on other countries not for only aluminium but also rubber, oil ##'##and a number of other commodities which, regardless of what efforts we may make, we shall be unable to produce sufficiently. When we hear a quibble from the opposite side about our responsibility to make Australia self sufficient in defence, we are bound to point out that if we cannot obtain aid from powerful allies, particularly the United States of America, and are forced to depend on our own resources, we shall not be able to stand very long against a mighty foe such as we are fighting to-day. Wo must have outside aid. Although we have performed mighty deeds in battle and prod-notion, our own accomplishments alone in this war have not saved us. Only with the assistance of Great Britain and the United States of America has it been possible for us to retain Australia. Our dependence on them will continue in the future. Unless by some marvellous stroke of fortune, we discover oil in Australia, we roust depend on other countries for it. In addition, we must rely on other countries for supplies of rubber.

I am most anxious for this industry to be established. Yesterday, during this debate, I heard a cynical interjection to the effect that Tasmanians were sure to vote for the measure. But, to date, I have not ##'##heard any convincing argument against the establishment of the aluminium industry.

RYan). speaking of a proposal for the production of aluminium in Sumatra, advanced it- as an argument against Australia rushing into the manufacture of this metal. I disagree with his contention. The fact that the careful Dutch are prepared to establish an aluminium industry during the next few years, .because they cannot begin with the project immediately, must he a cogent reason for the foundation of the industry here. </para>
                    <para>Several honorable members referred to the proposed ownership of the industry by the Government of the Commonwealth and the Government of Tasmania. With that arrangement in this particular instance, I have no quarrel, although, like other honorable, members on this side of the chamber, I am not a warm supporter of government, participation in industry. Certain industries must be established, and if private enterprise is not in a position to do it, the Government must undertake the responsibility. On that point T have this criticism of the bill to offer. Tt is not proper that the disposal of this industry at any future date 3hall be subject to the approval of only the Parliament of the Commonwealth. When we have an equal partner in an undertaking, the partner should have an equal voice in the conduct of the industry, and in determining whether it should be sold. </para>
                    <para>The only other matter which has directly interested me is defence. One argument which weighs with me more than another is that of our international relationships. The subject should give us considerable, thought. I cannot subscribe to the view, which the honorable member for Flinders evidently holds, that in this matter we are under some obligation to stand aside because of certain commitments into which we have already entered. On the first occasion on which I spoke in this chamber I made it clear that I stand for international co-operation, wherever and whenever possible, in every field for the purpose of promoting international peace. But each country must attend to certain things for itself, and I should like to direct attention to a statement published in the press recently. Issued by the Soviet Legation in Canberra, it contained a highly significant passage, as follows: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Russia bases its foreign policy on the strength of the Red Army. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That is a realistic approach to the subject of international relations after the war, and we cannot afford to ignore it. Every country, while subscribing to every possible measure for achieving international co-operation, must see to its own defences. I agree that Australia could not have survived in this war if we had been left to stand alone, and that will apply in the future. But it is nothing short of a miracle that at no time during this war were we entirely cut off from the rest of the world. I see no guarantee that in our lifetime we shall not again be involved in another war. I shall do everything I can to prevent it. Such concessions as lie in my power as a representative of the people will be made towards this consummation of our hopes; but we cannot allow our hopes and dreams, as we did in the last few decades, to override our sense of what is probable, and what, we must at all costs be prepared to meet. If this industry be established, aluminium will be one item that we shall not require to bring from overseas in war-time, sacrificing precious ships in doing so. Therefore, I hope most devoutly that this industry will be established. Strangely enough, I have no particular axe to grind in this matter. Every honorable member will agree that the right of Tasmania to be the home of the undertaking is not to be spoken of as ##"## claims ##"## in this case. In the present circumstances, Tasmania is the only State that can provide the conditions necessary to make the aluminium industry a success. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Gippsland made a most telling contribution to this debate. In my opinion certain aspects of the Government##'##s proposal demand further investigation. In the interests hot of the proposed industry alone, nor of the State of Tasmania and the people of the Commonwealth, but in the interests of the Government also, this inquiry should be conducted. I suggest, probably in my  guilelessness,  that the Government would be wise to accept the amendment submitted by the Leader  of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden).</inline> If necessary, let the Government make it a condition that the inquiry shall be completed within three months. I am opposed to any long delay in reaching a decision. Procrastination has been one of the treacherous things with which we have had to deal in the past. ##"##Whilst supporting the whole idea of the establishment of this industry, I warmly urge that the House should ask the Tariff Board to secure information which at present is only vaguely held by many honorable members and not at all by others. The Government, in its wisdom, should accept the amendment which is in the interests of all concerned. </para>

                        <para>.- The purpose of this bill is to establish the aluminium ingot industry in Tasmania. A commission of four persons is to be appointed to inaugurate and manage the enterprise. The Commonwealth Government and the Tasmanian Government will each contribute ##£##1,500,000 to the capital of the concern. It has been stated that the Commonwealth representatives will be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> V. Smith, secretary of the Department of Supply and .Shipping, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wark,</inline> of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and the Tasmanian representatives will be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> R. Benjamin, manager of the newsprint manufacturing enterprise of Tasmania, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williams,</inline> Director of Mines of that State. It would appear that only one of those four persons has ever had any practical business experience. What strikes me as most remarkable in this set-up is that, although the two governments will subscribe ##£##3,000,000 between them, no provision has been made for a Treasury representative to be a member of the commission. Usually, when large sums of pu##'##blic money are to be invested in an enterprise of this kind, care is taken that a Treasury official shall be appointed to the managerial body. I hope that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> will take special notice of my reference to the omission to make provision for such an appointment in this case. At least it can be said that no harm could be done by, and much good might follow, the appointment of  a  Treasury representative to the commission. I hope that, at a later stage, the Government will accept an amendment to provide that such an appointment shall be made. </para>

                    <para>When it was first suggested, some years ago, that the manufacture of ingot aluminium should be undertaken in Australia, there was a world shortage of this vital metal, due, of course, to war conditions. That is no longer true. We have been informed that the productive capacity of the United States of America is now 1,1S0,000 tons per annum, whilst that of Canada is 500,000 tons per annum. Over-production ##'##in America has become so serious that the output of the American factories has been reduced by 33 per cent. It is estimated that the Australian post-war demand will be 6,000 tons of aluminium per annum. Our prewar consumption was only 1,700 tons annually. Without doubt, the post-war use of aluminium will be much larger than our pre-war use of it, but we should know, with more assurance, what the position is likely to be prior to entering upon this project. </para>

It is pure hypocrisy to suggest that expedition in the establishment of this industry is necessary for the security of Australia or for the earlier winning of this war. Nothing that we can do in regard to this industry can contribute in any way to the winning of this war, but, unless we are careful, we may do something that will hinder the achievement of that most desirable end. If we rush into this industry, we ##"##will divert man-power from other essential industries.

All honorable members have received numerous letters from their constituents concerning the need for more man-power for essential food production industries. One of these is dairying. We must maintain maximum production in this industry in the interests of both the Commonwealth itself and our Allies. Only to-day I received a letter from the wife of a dairyman in my constituency who is at present in the forces, telling me that although her husband is B class, and 45 years of age, she cannot obtain his release, and is therefore obliged to continue to try to carry on a dairy farm with the help of only one daughter fourteen years of age. That is not an unusual case. It is for this reason, among others, that I say that it is not serving the best interests of the war effort for the Government to proceed with this enterprise at this stage. </para>

                    <para>There is another important aspect of the whole proposal which should be inquired into by a responsible and independent authority, such as the Tariff Board. It may be, though at this stage I do not say that it will be, detrimental to the export industries of Australia to proceed with this project at present. Such action may seriously interfere with the post-war export prospects of not only our primary industries, but also some of our secondary industries which hope to gain a footing in world markets after the war. </para>
                    <para>It has been put to us that if the Government establishes this industry under government control, aluminium production in Australia will be free from the influences of the international cartel which has had such an important effect on aluminium production in other countries. I consider that it will be impossible to keep this industry free from the influences of the international cartel, which, as honorable members know, has practically crucified those outside the cartel who have endeavoured to manufacture ingot aluminium abroad. It is worth noting, however, that although the Government is taking this step to establish ingot manufacturing in Tasmania, the Australian Aluminium Company controls the fabrication plant at Granville, near Sydney, where one of the largest forging hammers in the world has been installed with the help of government funds. I do not believe that anyone ever envisaged the possibility of that great hammer being handed over to the representatives of one of the most concentrated financial groups the world has ever seen. I understand also that the fabrication plant at Wangaratta is under the control of the same company. Of course, we know that one of the close associates of this great citadel of finance in Australia, which also has world-wide contacts, has accompanied a member of this Government on his journeys overseas, and has been instrumental in introducing him into the best circles of the highest social life of the capital cities of the United States of America and Great Britain. He is representative of the people who will control this industry and to whom assets paid for by Commonwealth funds are to be released. I believe I am correct in saying that only one small fabrication plant in Australia is at present operating outside of the combine. I suggest that the handing over of the fabrication plants in the Commonwealth to the combine will absolutely strangle this industry at birth. The ingot manufacturing branch of the industry will have no power to struggle effectively against the cartel, which will be able to fix prices to suit itself; and the industry will ultimately come under private control, as did the carbide industry in Tasmania, in circumstances which the Minister for Repatriation so eloquently explained to us yesterday. The industry was eventually taken over by the Government of Tasmania, which could not manage it and had to hand it to private, enterprise. </para>

                    <para>I shall give to the House information concerning the history of the Australian Aluminium Company - its shareholders, associates, and directors. In November, 1936, a company was registered, styled British Aluminium (Australia) Proprietary Limited, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Fraser and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> J. C. Bult, of 360 Collinsstreet, Melbourne - more popularly known to my friends on the Government benches as ##"## Collins House ##"## - were the first directors. In 1939, the name of the company was altered to Australian Aluminium ##'##Company Proprietary Limited, and it had its registered office at 360 Collins-street, Melbourne. At, this time, it was announced that one-third of the capital was being supplied by Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia, and that the balance was being supplied by overseas interests, who were reported to be Aluminium Limited, of Canada, owned and controlled by the Aluminium Company of America - Alcoa - and British Aluminium Company Limited. A search at the titles office revealed that in April, 1940, the shareholders were: Electrolvtic  Zinc Company of Australasia Limited; Metal Manufactures Limited; British Aluminium Company, Limited; Aluminium Limited, Montreal, Canada; and Aluminium Limited, Geneva, Switzerland. Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Limited, and </para>
                    <para class="block">Metal Manufactures Limited held approximately one-third of the capital, whilst British Aluminium Company Limited also held one-third, and  the  balance was held by Aluminium Limited, Montreal, Canada, and Aluminium Limited, Geneva, Switzerland. I may mention that Aluminium Limited, Geneva, Switzerland, is the organization through which the American company carried on its business in Norway, Germany, Italy and Japan. The directors of Australian Aluminium Company Proprietary Limited, in June, 1940, were <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Stewart, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Fraser, John Seymour Toulon, William Sydney Robinson, Lawson Greene Bash, Norman Warren Waterhouse, and Leslie Vickery Waterhouse. Alternate directors were <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Massy-Greene, Henry St. John Somerset, and Aubrey John Clifton Bult. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lawson</inline> Greene Bash is an American citizen, whose address was given as Montreal. Together with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norman</inline> Warren Waterhouse, he represents the interests of the Aluminium Company of America - Alcoa. The remaining directors represent between them the interests of Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Limited and British Aluminium Company Limited. A search at the Titles Office on the 30th June, 1941, indicated that Aluminium Limited, Geneva, had disappeared from the shareholding register. Apparently, this shareholding had been transferred to Aluminium Limited, Canada. The position of the company then was: Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Limited, and Metal Manufactures Limited, 150,000 ##£##1 shares; British Aluminium Company Limited and Aluminium Limited, Montreal, Canada, 150,000 shares each. The directors were the same as they had been at June, 1940, with the exception that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> S. Robinson had retired from the board and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Massy-Greene, who previously was an alternate director, became a full director. I understand, and the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> has made it perfectly clear, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> S. Robinson, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Massy-Green, and many of the other gentlemen mentioned, are members of what is called the Collins House group, which in the past has been anathema to the Government ; yet the Government has demonstrated openly to-night that that is no longer the case, but that in reality these people belong to the same brotherhood as the Government and should be treated in the best possible way. The articles of association provide that two directors shall be nominated by British Aluminium Company Limited, Aluminium Limited, Canada, and Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Limited and Metal Manufactures Limited. It will thus be seen that four of the six directors of the company to which the Government has seen fit to hand the fabrication of aluminium in Australia, are directors of overseas corporations which are tied up with the great aluminium cartel. The shareholding discloses that Australian Aluminium Company Proprietary Limited, as at present constituted, is controlled by nonAustralian interests so far as its capital and directors are concerned. Both British Aluminium Company Limited and Aluminium Limited, Canada - which is owned by Alcoa - were members of the original aluminium cartel formed in 1904, when the price of aluminium had fallen to the lowest figure on record, namely, ##£##60 a ton. They were also members of the same syndicate or cartel formed in 1909. On the outbreak of the 1914-18 war, aluminium was selling for approximately ##£##85 a ton, but during that conflict it rose to ##£##220 a ton, through the instrumentality of these patriotic gentlemen. A very large development of the American and Canadian production was financed out of war profits. The price did not fall below ##£##100 a ton until 1922, and it was more or less maintained at that figure until the outbreak of the present war in 1939, when it was pegged at ##£##110 sterling a ton by the British Ministry of Supply. The international aluminium cartel is world wide, and operates in all the producing countries with the exception of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Even in Nazi Germany Aluminium Limited of Geneva - which until some time in the war was tied up with Australian Aluminium Company Proprietary Limited - held large interests, particularly through interlocks with the German I.G. Farben Industrie, the great German dye, chemical and metal trust. It will, therefore, he seen that the controlling interests in Australian Aluminium Company Proprietary Limited represent two of the oldest and strongest members of the great international combine. Since the fall of Prance and the attack on Pearl Harbour, the aluminium industry has been increased stupendously. Millions of pounds of British, Australian and American money has been poured into it. It is reported that Australia has invested ##£##1,000,000 in Aluminium Limited, Canada, for the development of power schemes. The production of Canada has been increased to 500,000 tons per annum, the whole of it monopoly-produced. The production in the United States of America has been increased to 1,180,000 tons per annum, 95 per cent, of which is produced by Alcoa. The debates in the Canadian Parliament last year clearly stated the policy of the cartel in relation to the protection of this vital industry. This is the largest combine for the production of light metals in the world. Curiously enough, the present Government has a particular flair for cultivating combines of this sort. Only recently, we were told that Courtaulds Limited is to be established in Australia for the manufacture of rayon and nylon. It is a part of the great world rayon combination, and prior to the war had cartel agreements with the rayon combine in the United States of America as well as with that other monopoly, I. G. Farben Industrie, Germany. It may interest honorable members to know that I. G. Farben Industrie was such an enormous concern before the war that it had 163,000 persons on its paysheets.  These are the interests to which the Australian industry is being handed, without proper protection. An inquiry by the Tariff Board into the agreement is absolutely essential. That body should investigate the handing over of the fabrication plant to the company whose history I have given to-night, and the persons whose personal history was given this afternoon by the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony).</inline> I am not in a position to say whether or not any other areas in Australia should be developed. I received this afternoon a telegram from northern New South Wales, suggesting the development of hydro-electric schemes and bauxite deposits in that region. I cannot say whether or not these have a preferential right to be developed before the resources of Tasmania or any other part of the Commonwealth. But I do contend that there should not be a handing over of this industry to any part without a proper investigation of the resources of all parts; and the Tariff Board is the proper body to make that investigation. It should inquire as to whether or r.ot the aluminium industry could he carried on more economically and with better chances of successful development in the post-war period than could many other industries. Australia has not unlimited man-power. It is stupid  for the Government to consider, as many Ministers have stated during the debate, that the Commonwealth must bc absolutely self-sufficient. It is impossible for 7,000,000 people to be self-sufficient in relation to all of their requirements. If we embark on such a policy, it will not be long before we shall revert to the self-sufficiency represented by the oyster middens of the aborigines at Port Jackson prior to the arrival in Australia of the white man. There should be a proper selection, of the industries we are to establish, and a determination should be reached as to whether or not those chosen will utilize our man-power in the best possible way. </para>
                    <para>For the reasons I have given, and particularly because of the possibility of the industry being strangled by a great combine, I consider that the closest investigation by the Tariff Board is warranted before the bill is proceeded with further in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - A significant feature of this debate is the fact that the Government has studiously refrained from supplying those facts and figures which are essential if the House is to reach a considered decision. The Government has merely said that it would be a good idea to make aluminium in Australia because there are bauxite deposits and electric power here. The Government has avoided acquainting the House with the fact, as did the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden),</inline> that certain other essential ingredients in the manufacture of aluminium have to be imported. How much else the House has not been told we, not being experts, do not know. Therefore, it is proper that the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> should have moved that the measure be postponed until the proposal can be referred to the Tariff Board for investigation and report. The status of the Tariff Board is well established, and no authority in Australia is better qualified to make an inquiry into the issues involved. There is no real urgency. Government spokesmen, in order to give weight to their arguments, have stated that the manufacture of aluminium in Australia would be a contribution towards the country##'##s war effort. A lurid picture was painted by the Minister for Munitions <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> of the scarcity of aluminium ingot at one stage during the war, and he argued that it would be much better to manufacture the aluminium here. The facts which he presented are, less the trimmings, substantially correct, but no one with any real knowledge of the position believes that the manufacture of aluminium in Australia, by the time it would be possible to begin manufacture, could be any contribution to the country##'##s effort in this war. Insofar as the establishment of an aluminium industry has any relation to defence, the Government must be thinking in terms of the next war. So far as this war is concerned, the diversion of labour, materials and machinery on the vast scale necessary to establish the industry could only represent a substantial subtraction from the country##'##s war effort. In addition, it would be necessary to ask manufacturers in allied countries to produce for us certain intricate machinery which at present we cannot manufacture here. Those overseas manufacturers would have to suspend the manufacture of certain weapons of war while they made for us electrical conversion machinery, ##&amp;##c, necessary for the establishment of the aluminium industry, and this so that we may be prepared for the next war. That is not a good enough reason for asking Parliament to vote money which can be obtained only by appealing to the people to increase their contributions to the next victory loan. Insofar as we may have been remiss in not having provided ourselves with the aluminium needed for this war, nothing is achieved by crying over spilt milk. For the present, there is a stockpile of aluminium in America upon which we can draw to the amount of thousands of tons. The House should not be misled into believing that the Government##'##s proposal has anything to do with the war effort. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>As for the post-war period, I wish to see established in Australia all the industries which it would be reasonable to establish. I look to the balanced development of Australia##'##s economy. I know that the basic industries are those associated with the land, but I hope to see grow up side by side with them secondary industries which will provide us with the requirements of peace and war, and which will give employment to the consumers of our primary products. However, I do not want to see established uneconomic industries merely so that we may boast that they are here. I do. not, for instance, wish to see established an aluminium industry if it can be done only by imposing a tremendous cost burden upon the public. I realize that, since we are so dependent upon the export of our primary products, we cannot afford to close foreign markets against those products. If we set out to produce here everything that it is possible to produce, regardless of cost, there will be an inevitable reaction abroad which will result in the closing of markets against us. It is true that we can produce aluminium here; nobody denies that. It is true that Germany can grow wheat, but while we could grow it at 4s. a bushel, it was costing Germany 12s. a bushel to grow. It is true that we can produce aluminium here at costs which are fantastic in comparison with those in countries more favorably situated for the production of this metal. The Government has brought before us an example of that economic nationalism - which was the subject of criticism, derision and contempt when practised by those nations which are today our enemies. This same economic nationalism has, in a thousand speeches, been arraigned as one of the chief causes of the war. ##"##What does the Atlantic Charter mean? ##"##What do the pledges  regarding freer trade between the nations mean, if we, applying a policy of economic isolation, decide to close our country against the products pf other nations, including our sister dominions, when those countries are much more favorably situated to produce certain commodities than we are? I am not competent, nor is this Parliament competent, to estimate the prospective requirements of Australia in aluminium ingot after the- war, and it is with the post-war period (hat we are concerned. Not only are wo unable to estimate the prospective consumption of aluminium in Australia, but we do not know what would be the minimum economic unit of production, yet those two factors must be related. We have not been told what will be the probable cost of production of aluminium here. We have been told nothing of other metals or plastics which, after the war. may compete in the market against aluminium. These facts are relevant to the proposal before the House, a proposal which involves the expenditure of ##£##1,500,000 of Commonwealth money. If the Government##'##s scheme be adopted it will possibly have the effect of closing certain overseas markets to our primary products, which are the natural products of Australia. The policy of the Australian Country party calls for the establishment in Australia of new industries which will make for a balanced economy, which will attract that larger population which is so necessary, and which will support new consumers of our primary products. We do not agree, however, that we should rush in to establish an industry merely because a Minister walks into the House with a proposal, and insults us by failing to put before us information to which we are entitled. We are invited to write a cheque for ##£##1,500,000, and it looks as if the Commonwealth will also have to find the other ##£##1,500,000 which ostensibly to be provided by the Government of, Tasmania. Seeing that (here is no urgency in the matter, the proper course is obviously to refer the proposal to the Tariff Board, and then to bring it before the House again at a more appropriate time, when the House will have before it the information to enable it to reach a proper decision. </para>

                    <para>I know that there is no more popular course than to stand up, either in this House or in the Domain, and make a virulent attack on trusts, combines and monopolies. One can always get a cheer by doing that, but I also know that there are some highly technical processes which must necessarily be carried out on a vast scale, so that there is no alternative to government ownership other than ownership by companies which, because of the large amount of their capital, arc described as wealthy companies. I see no sense in standing up one day and attacking the Government for nationalizing interstate airlines, and the next day attacking companies which, while admittedly highly capitalized, are also in possession of those technical facilities which are necessary for certain manufacturing processes. I say to my friends who are for nationalization of industry that we should welcome the establishment in this country of certain industries, first, proved to be economic and, secondly, established in such circumstances that they are controlled in respect of prices and activities along lines which are for the public good. I know from the experience I had when administering the Department of Air that there are few industries more involved in a technical sense than the aluminium industry. I recall that in the course of our programme to manufacture Beaufort aircraft we were seeking certain tubular sections for those aircraft. The designers had chosen a tubular section of peculiar character. The British manufacturers were unable to supply it and we had to turn to the alternative source of supply - the United States of America. We placed orders with one of the greatest aluminium companies in that country, but after having expended 250,000 dollars in endeavouring to manufacture a certain kind of tubular extrusion according to the specifications, it had to confess that it was unable to manufacture it, and we had to wait until the British manufacturers were able to supply us. When an industry is so intricate in some of its processes that a great American company with millions of dollars of capital and great experience is unable to make an extrusion we take long odds if we brightly say that we need merely to vote so much money and set up a Government factory in order to succeed. Quite clearly snore than money is needed in some of the modern industrial processes. What the trades call ##"## know how ##"## has to be . added to the money. I am not prepared to Relieve that, because the aluminium fabrication plants in the Commonwealth arc owned by a company known as the Australian Aluminium Company the capital derivation of which has been explained by some of my colleagues, that is entirely bad and that the right thing for the Government to do is to take it over and run it. I should be unable to argue that that should be done and at the same time argue that it is entirely bad that the Government should acquire and operate the interstate airlines. Every activity in this country, whether it be the conduct of airlines or the manufacture of aluminium or anything else is under the control of the Government and, insofar as any activity is against public good, it is not only the duty but also the power of the Government to take such steps as are necessary to correct the position. I, as one who believes in private enterprise as against nationalization of industry, much prefer that this industry should be established with Australian capital and Australian labour and with all the prospects of success that would arise from the ingenuity of great Australian privately-owned industries such as Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. To proceed with the manufacture of aluminium ingots instantly can mean no more than a subtraction from our war effort, and to proceed with it at all, without first acquainting the Parliament with the results of a most thorough investigation, by the most competent authority, unquestionably the Tariff Board, is a grave mistake and in conflict with the traditional policy of this Parliament in respect of proposed new industries during at least the last ten or twelve years. I am wholeheartedly in support of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party. </para>

                        <para>- I submit that the House should accept this bill which gives effect to an agreement entered into by the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Tasmania for the establishment in Tasmania of the aluminium ingot industry. In many instances, the attitude of honorable members opposite has been one of qualified support for the bill, but, in other instances, it has been one of complete negation, and some of the arguments used, I submit, if given effect to, would only result in the indefinite postponement of this project. In  1941  the Menzies Government, which was supported by both parties now in opposition, decided that the aluminium ingot industry should be established in Australia. Now, in order to delay its establishment by the Curtin Government, it appears that some honorable gentlemen opposite desire a further investigation. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I quite admit that the need for ingot aluminium is not what it was then, but any one who believes that after this war, we shall be able at once to beat our swords into ploughshares, is very much mistaken. We should like to be able to do so, but we must be prepared to defend this country##'##. We were caught napping in this war. But we must not be caught again. We have made this agreement with Tasmania after investigation by one of the greatest experts in the world, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ronald</inline> Charles. I suppose that he is associated with one of the aluminium companies. If an international cartel controls the production of aluminium, the main experts available will be under its control. I know nothing about <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ronald</inline> Charles except that he was selected by the Menzies Government to advise it. </para>

It was not just a Cabinet secret; it was announced to the world, and negotiations were entered into with, or invited from, private interests in this  country; but, apparently, nothing came from them. We intend to carry out the agreement with the Tasmanian Government. Already there has been delay and we want to get on with the job quickly. </para>

                            <para>- Two or three honorable gentlemen opposite have constructively dealt with that aspect and I shall come to it later. We are satisfied that we have the raw material, the power, and all the other requirements for the establishment of the industry. We are not rushing into the matter. The commission to be set up under the bill will have all the evidence at its disposal and will determine step by step what is to be done in the establishment of this project. At one time during this war, the Commonwealth had only three weeks##'## supply of aluminium. The Opposition has made much of the fact that the supply position now is not what it was, but that situation cannot endure. The emphasis laid on the international combine or cartel shows that that vital supply could be kept away from this country at any stage by the financial interests controlling that cartel. If this hill be passed, the Commonwealth will have sufficient time to consider every aspect of the industry, including its development past the ingot stage, and to ensure its working in the most economic manner. Good quality bauxite is available in adequate quantities accessible <inline font-style="italic">io</inline> transport, and the necessary power at reasonable cost comparable with thai in other parts of the world will also be available. The cost of labour too is favorable. The previous Government set up a Commonwealth Copper and Bauxite Committee which reported the existence of adequate bauxite deposits in Australia. Then it had the report made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ronald</inline> Charles, the British expert. The Menzies Government also announced that it had decided to establish the aluminium ingot industry in Australia. After that, private enter-prise showed little or no desire to establish the industry, and failed to do so. This Government is convinced that if we left the development of this industry to private enterprise, there would be no aluminium ingot industry in Australia. We are not prepared to have further delay. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> went to considerable trouble to obtain the information which he presented to the House. I think he himself knows that that information had little to do with the establishment of the aluminium ingot industry and concerned more the process that will be adopted in the development of the industry. I think that the honorable member would be the first to admit that some of the information which he used must have been supplied to him by a party with business interests in this concern - a party interested, not only in- the process of manufacture, but also in the prospect of the sale of bauxite from certain leases. I do not complain of that. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member was most emphatic that the industry should be established, and that the Government should take care not to be at the mercy of a world combine for the supply of certain parts of the process. He referred to natural cryolite. According to the information supplied to me, cryolite is also being produced synthetically. As the honorable member stated, the natural article comes from Greenland##'##s icy mountains, but synthetic cryolite now seems to be made in all countries producing aluminium. In fact, the synthetic product which the honorable member showed to the House last night, was manufactured by Sulphates Proprietary Limited of Melbourne. </para>

If the material is not available from this firm, the manufacture of the relatively small quantity required, could be developed from other sources - from indigenous raw materials - without great expense or difficulty. Honorable members will understand that I do not claim to possess any special knowledge of these matters; I am only supplying to the House information furnished to me by the secretary of the department, who will be  chairman  of the proposed commission. The honorable member for Gippsland may rest assured that because of the vital importance of this industry, the Commonwealth Government will not allow itself to be dependent for constituent materials on any combine or . monopoly, either local or abroad. </para>

It would not help him or an international combine to have the Government of Tasmania, which administers the affairs of that State, and: the Government of the Commonwealth, which has supreme power to control imports and exports, controlling the manufacture of ingot aluminium. The Commonwealth Government could prohibit the importation of aluminium into Australia. The Government would hold the whip hand over persons who have to use the raw material. </para>

He did so as the result of a decision by the Prime Minister and in his capacity of adviser to the Commonwealth Government, But his services had nothing to do with the production of aluminium, on which he is not advising the Government. It. is true that at one period <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robinson</inline> placed at the disposal of the Menzies Government and the Curtin Government the services of two technical officers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keast</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hey.</inline> I regret this unfair attack on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robinson,</inline> but it affords me the opportunity to say that in Great Britain and the United States of America he rendered great service to this country, particularly in the procurement of aircraft and other urgent supplies for war purposes. He has also served the British Government in the capacity of adviser, and when he returned from his mission, he was publicly thanked for his services to Australiaby the Prime Minister. He assisted us in 1942 when we were desperately short of aircraft, munitions and other supplies. </para>

                            <para>- Would that be a reprehensible thing? The establishment of this portion of the industry is a very necessary step in the post-war air defence plans of Australia. Under this legislation no private person or company will have any interest in the project. The extension of the project into States other than Tasmania for undertaking other portions of the process, or into the field of fabrication or to obtain bauxite, are all matters that will be investigated by the commission. It is true, as the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> suggested, that the aluminium cartel has been all-powerful in the past, and no doubt that is one of the reasons why Australia was left so short of aluminium in 1941. But there is no reason why that position should continue. I believe that some of the information furnished to some of the critics of the bill was supplied by overseas interests. The object of the Government in establishing this industry is to make Australia independent of outside sources of supply for its requirements of aluminium. The honorable member for Eawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> referred to Australia##'##s obligations under the Atlantic Charter. </para>

                            <para>- These international arrangements must be read very carefully. The documents and agreements are most important, but they do not prevent - and here I agree with the honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) - a nation like Australia from providing for its own defence in the postwar period. One of the post-war plans is for a world security organization, and in that connexion, the production and control of aircraft will be of fundamental importance. No doubt Australia will play its part in that matter. For that purpose, it seems best that Australia should no longer be dependent upon overseas sources for its requirements of aluminium. In war-time those supplies may be cut off. </para>

                            <para>- The Government is already doing that. It is the duty of Australia and New Zealand - the outposts of European civilization in the South-West Pacific - to make provision for the manufacture of their own aircraft. If that is to be done effectively, and we are to have proper insurance against a disaster such as the one which nearly befell us three years ago, the manufacture of aluminium in Australia is surely one of the steps that we should take. </para>

                        <para>.  - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - Questions regarding the release of internees have been asked in the House during this sessional period by the honorable members for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Conelan),</inline> Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> and Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser).</inline> In view of these questions, and of other questions asked in the Senate, it is desirable that a comprehensive picture be given regarding the release of internees in Australia, in order to clear up doubts and misunderstandings which otherwise may arise. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>There has been criticism regarding the release of Italian internees, but much of it is ill-founded,because it is based on an improper appreciation of the policy governing releases, and does not pay any regard to the economic necessities which have made the policy of releases essential. Aliens employed in various forms of industry fall into four different classes: (1) aliens who have never been interned, and who remained in industry; (2) aliens resident in Australia who were interned and have been released; (3) aliens who were held in Australia at the request of overseas governments, and who have been or are being released; and (4) enemy prisoners of war allotted to farmers and employed on rural work. </para>
                    <para>I shall deal with these classes of aliens more fully, and shall give to the House a summary of the position regarding the employment of the aliens in each of the classes. </para>
                    <para>Class 1. - The principal cause of complaint is against the employment of the Italian element in our population. The fact is that 7,051 Italians, not being a security risk, have been permitted to live at large throughout the war. Their employment has been entirely a matter for the Man Power Directorate, except in very few cases in which some form of restriction has been necessary. Some of these 7,051 Italians are members of the Civil Aliens Corps, which includes also aliens released from internment. </para>
                    <para>Class 2. - The number of Italians, both aliens and naturalized British subjects, released from internment up to the end of October this year, is 3,510, of whom 3,799 are aliens and 711 are naturalized British subjects. The figure 2,799 represents the total number of all Italians who have been released and are available for the Civil Aliens Corps or private industry. The nature of their employment has been governed by three factors: (ti) if physically eligible, they have been drafted to the Civil Aliens Corps; (fc) where medically unfit for the Civil Aliens Corps, they have been placed at the disposal of the Man Power Directorate for employment, subject in some instances to the approval of the Director-General of Security; and (c) a small number have been directed to return to their homes, as being medically unfit for any employment by reason of age and infirmity. Many released internees became medically unfit after being in the Civil Aliens Corps for a time. A number of Queensland Italian internees who were experienced workers in the sugar industry have been released temporarily from the Civil Aliens Corps for work in the sugar-fields of north Queensland, following the strongest representations hy the Food Production Executive. </para>
                    <para>Class 3. - Under a War Cabinet decision, internees from the Straits Settlements and the United Kingdom became eligible for release and employment in Australia. Individual releases were made by the Minister for the Army, after a decision had been made by the Home </para>
                    <para class="block">Office. The number released in this way to October, 1944, is 487. The majority were released for work of national importance, but a considerable number were aged and infirm people, not capable of working at all.  Some  of them have been employed in the Civil Aliens Corps. In addition,  some  hundreds of internees from the United Kingdom and the Straits Settlements were released for service in employment units of the Australian Military Forces. More recently, Cabinet##'##s decision was extended to cover the release  of  all overseas internees in Australia not having a security risk, at the discretion of the Minister for the Army. </para>
                    <para>In July, 1944, the Government appointed the Overseas Internees Investigation Board, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hutchins is the chairman.##"## The board has recommended the release of approximately 100 internees, some of whom have, in addition, wives and members of their families in internment camps. The release of these internees is being implemented. </para>
                    <para>Internees released are medically examined, and those found fit are enlisted in the Civil Aliens Corps. It is the Government##'##s policy not to release any internees for whom suitable employment and living conditions cannot be found. </para>
                    <para>Class 4. - There are 11,842 prisoners of war now employed in prisoner-of-war control centres or hostels on rural work throughout Australia. They have been allotted to the various States as follows : - </para>
                    <para class="block">

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> in July, 1944, informed the federal executive of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen##'##s Imperial League of Australia that prisoners of war would not be allowed to remain in Australia after the war. </para>
                    <para>I emphasize that former internees are employed on work of national importance because of the grave shortage of manpower. It is far better that they should be usefully employed if no security risk is involved, rather than that they should remain in internment camps and be a  charge upon the nation. They are not depriving any person of employment, because our man-power shortage is so great that employment exists for tens of thousands of additional persons. </para>
                    <para>On the question of whether or not certain aliens from abroad will be allowed to remain in Australia after .the war, I say that no person will be allowed to remain unless he or she is likely to make a desirable citizen, and no prisoner of war will be permitted to remain after the conclusion of hostilities. Arrangements will be made for internees from abroad who have been released in Australia to be returned after the war to their country  of origin. Cabinet approval has been given for the Minister for the Interior to consider, on their individual merits, applications by any white former internees released in Australia for permission to remain in Australia, on the basis that - <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> the applicant has been certified as a refugee alien; (o) nothing detrimental is known against him; and (c) the Minister is satisfied that the applicant is likely to make a desirable citizen if allowed to remain in Australia. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline>
                made his second-reading speech on the 20th September last. On the 29th September, the honorable member for Gippsland

                asked him this question -

            </quote>
            <para class="block">The honorable gentleman promised that all documentation in connexion with the matter would be made available. This includes especially what has been referred to as the Keast-Hey report, which was made as the result of an investigation by Messrs. Keast and Hey, of the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia </para>
            <para>Limited.  Earlier in the evening, I mentioned the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> S. Robinson, who, I understand, was a director of that company. Thus it will be seen that the gentleman who was sent, to America to make investigations, and subsequently reported to the Government, was, in fact, an employee under the direction of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> S. Robinson. I do not know what he may have said in his report; but it dealt with the establishment of a ##£##3,000,000 industry, and the various costs which it would be necessary for the Government to meet. We are entitled to see that report, especially in view of my earlier statement, as well as the very definite promise of the Minister for Supply and Shipping. I presume that it is a voluminous document, which honorable members would need time to assimilate. Continuation of the committee stage of the bill immediately upon its production would make that action farcical. I therefore request the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> not only to produce##'##  the  document but also to report progress until honorable members have had sufficient time to study it. </para>

At the time, the only reports I knew of were the Charles report and the report of the Copper  and  Bauxite Committee. I  find  now  that a  report was also  obtained from Messrs.

I do not object to those reports being examinedby honorable members, but I do not want the passage of the bill to be delayed. </para>

                        <para>- I have given the substance of the main report, and a promise was given that it would be made available in the committee stage. I should like to make as much progress as possible with the bill to-night. I suggest that perhaps one clause might be postponed until later, and in the meantime honorable members could examine the reports. I can make available to honorable members the Charles report which was obtained in 1941, and a summary of the Copper and Bauxite Committee##'##s report. I have not seen the Keast-Hey report, but I am informed by the secretary of the department that it is a short one. As an undertaking to produce the reports was given by my colleague, I shall honour it. </para>

                    <para>I can appreciate the point raised by the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> insofar as he is seeking the fullest measure of information on this proposal. It is ##'##unfortunate that the Minister for Supply and Shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> who introduced the bill, cannot be here now because of sickness. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> is at some disadvantage in handling the measure. However, it is an amazing thing that some honorable members opposite should be prepared to do their utmost to prevent the passage of the bill. I cannot accept as genuine some of the reasons which they advance for delaying the measure. The point taken just now by the honorable member for Richmond may have some merit, but the fact remains that the Government##'##s proposal has been examined by experts, and I shall resist at. every stage the efforts of honorable members of the Opposition to prevent the bill from being passed with the least possible delay. Ever since I have been a member of this Parliament all measures designed to establish industries in Tasmania have been opposed by the representatives of the larger States. The honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Guy)</inline> had the courage to come over and vote with the Government on the second reading of the bill, and I give credit where credit is due. But the representatives of the larger States, whatever their motives, are doing their best on the pretence of soliciting information, to prevent the passage of the bill. I am prepared to accept the assurance of the Government that a thorough examination of the proposals has been made by experts. I hope that the Attorney-General will not agree to the postponement of the bill, which ought to be passed by this chamber as quickly as possible. The Senate is waiting for business, yet the honorable member for Richmond and others are stone-walling the bill, doing everything possible to impede its passage, simply because it proposes to establish an industry in Tasmania, the most suitable State for the purpose. I trust that the Attorney-General will not agree to postpone any of the clauses. </para>

                    <para>. - At last it looks as if the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> proposes to make some concession to reason. It is customary, when measures of this kind are before Parliament, to make available to honorable members all the information in the possession of the Government. On this occasion that has not been done. Certain promises were made by the Minister who introduced the bill, but they have not been honoured. As for the anti-Tasmanian complex mentioned by the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard),</inline> I assure him that it exists only ##'## in his own imagination, and his references to the matter are purely for home consumption. It is usual for the committee to know, before it votes money, to what it is committing the taxpayers. In the absence of full information, the Attorney-General cannot ask the committee to pass the clause approving the agreement, nor the clause appropriating money for the carrying out of the agreement. The honorable member for Bass mentioned experts. Only last week, it was shown conclusively that the Government is about to embark upon the nationalization of interstate airlines in defiance of the recommendation of its experts. I should not be surprised, if we are able to obtain the reports on the aluminium industry, and have time to read them, to learn that a similar##'## state of affairs exists in regard to this proposal. If the reports of the experts support the Government##'##s proposal as we have been assured by ##"##Ministers, those reports should have been produced earlier so that members of the Opposition would have no cause for complaint. The fact is that the Government is trying to get the bill through without laying its cards on the table. The Attorney-General, when he was a Justice of the High Court would, I am sure, have indignantly repudiated the suggestion that he should arrive at his verdict before hearing the evidence and seeing relevant documents. Nevertheless, he is now asking the committee to agree to this bill without knowing the facts. Not one report of any kind has been produced in support of the Government##'##s proposals. We are asked to be a lot of good little boys, and to believe in Grimm##'##s Fairy Tales and in the story of the Babes in the Wood; to believe, in fact, that only the most angelic actions are likely to proceed from the Government. There have been other occasions on which we could hear wings flapping when Ministers were speaking, and we had a good idea that the feathers were not white. I submit, therefore, that the two vital clauses of the bill must be postponed until honorable members have had an opportunity to study the report. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Bowden) and the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> have taken a keen interest in this matter. I suggest that they, and two members of the United Australian party, should examine the reports and, if they are satisfied, other members of their parties will accept their##'## assurance. That is not too much to ask. </para>

                    <para>. -  This is one  of  the toughest things I have even seen in my life.  For  hours we argued that certain evidence should be produced, and we were told about the typing and copying difficulties, but no sooner is it agreed that the reports should be produced than copies are produced and distributed to every honorable member. I have never seen the equal of this in parliamentary history. Every honorable member now has before him two reports, one headed ##"## Summary of Conclusions of Copper and Bauxite Committee ##"## and the other, ##"## Report by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ronald</inline> Charles - The Production of Aluminium Ingot in Australia ##'## ##"##. There is such a thing as overdoing it, and this is one of the occasions on which I regret that we are so civilized. A couple  of  hundred, years ago we should have had a better method  of  dealing with anyone responsible for such tactics than the method of mere protest. It is a thundering pity that we cannot adopt that method of procedure now. So I simply place on record my protest. I have not the foggiest idea who is responsible. It is unfortunate that the Minister for Supply and Shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> who presented this bill, is not here, but it is beyond the faintest shadow of doubt that someone has tried to force this bill through without producing to honorable members vital evidence, which was available. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> may be satisfied, but I regard this as one of the most remarkable performances in my experience of this Parliament. During the second-reading debate, member after member on this side protested that he was unable to give proper judgment as to the necessity for and the value and consequences of this industry, because he had not been supplied with adequate information. We pressed for an inquiry by an impartial body which could take evidence from those who favour the establishment of this industry and those who argue against it. Now we are due to consider the bill in committee after having had to agree to the second reading in the absence of the evidence that would have enabled us to form a proper view. We have now been given two reports which we must digest at this late hour in order that we may be able in the morning, after all the other clauses have been dealt with, consider the appropriation clause. Even now we are not in possession of all the information available to the Government, because we are told that there is a more detailed report, of which only four copies are available for distribution to that number of favoured honorable members. The Government has been either most casual or utterly contemptuous in its treatment of honorable members. I am amazed at its attitude. Our requests for information were brushed aside during the second-reading debate with all sorts of assurances. We have the information for which we asked during the second reading presented to us just as we are about to begin the committee consideration.. I am reminded by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> that the contract was signed in April. The Government had from then until now to supply the information needed by honorable members to deliberate on this proposal, but we were denied the information necessary to enable us to exercise an informed vote on the second reading. It may be unkind to the Attorney-General to cavil at his production of this information at this late hour, but we have a responsibility as the parliamentary representatives of the people to protest against such cavalier treatment. </para>

                <para class="block">I stated earlier my belief that it is necessary that, as so much Commonwealth money will be invested in this project, the Treasury should be represented on the commission. I have glanced through the Hey report and it seems that some of the estimates are very empirical. There is no doubt that most careful checks on the expenditure are required. The only way in which the expenditure maybe properly checked is by having a representative of the Treasury attending the meetings of the commission. It is futile to say that the Treasury will be able adequately to supervise the expenditure in any other way. In this project, commitments may be entered into involving vast expenditure which might not be undertaken if the Commonwealth Treasury were represented at the discussions of the commission. The amendment is not critical of the bill ; it is helpful, and will improve the measure. </para>

                    <para>. - Following the suggestion which the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> made earlier in the debate, I discussed this matter with the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> and he expressed the opinion that the Commonwealth Treasury prefers to have its interests watched, not by a member of the commission, hut by an officer associated with the work of the commission. The Government is not able to increase the personnel of the commission in the manner suggested by the honorable member, because the agreement with the State of Tasmania provides for a commission of four members, and the acceptance of the amendment would destroy the agreement. I agree that the Treasury should be closely associated with the operations of the commission, and that will be done in the manner which I have indicated. The Treasury officer will act as watchdog over the expenditure of public money. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is regrettable .that ##'##a representative of the Treasury is not a member of the commission. Expenditure on this undertaking will total ##£##3,000,000. The sum of ##£##1,500,000 will be provided by Commonwealth taxpayers generally, whilst a similar amount will be paid by taxpayers resident in Tasmania. Consequently, expenditure by the commission should be checked by an officer who will be more than a mere watch-dog for the Treasury. However, I realize that the agreement cannot he varied to meet that requirement, and I can only express my regret that this matter was not foreseen when the agreement was being drafted. </para>

                <para>If clause 10 be postponed for the time being, clause 4 should also be deferred. But since we are expected to speak on clause 4, I take this opportunity to protest at the manner in which this important subject has been presented to this chamber. Honorable members should have been afforded an opportunity to examine these reports without bias, because most of us approach this matter with an Australian outlook. ##"##We have no personal axes to grind in either approving or opposing the bill. We simply require -information in order that we may best determine what should be done in the interests of Australia. Earlier, I pointed out that circumstances surrounding the presentation of this project call for careful thought. Honorable members have not been given a fair opportunity to acquaint themselves with the details of the bill. This afternoon, I mentioned the names of certain individuals who, it is suggested, have some vested interest in forcing the Government to expedite the passage of the measure in case something should leak out, and the bill not be approved. </para>
                <para>The Parliament of Tasmania had to approve this legislation, which was submitted to it on the 19th April last. Even in the State legislature the bill was not supported unanimously by honorable members. Members of the Opposition called for a report, and asked for an inquiry, and the Launceston <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> published a news item entitled ##"##Aluminium Bill Approved - Move for Inquiry Defeated ##"##. That occurred six months ago. The Government of Tasmania did not authorize a public inquiry into the proposal, even though the Opposition pressed for it; and now, no information has been given to the House of Representatives, even though the Opposition has asked for it. The only conclusion is that some reason exists for this cloak of secrecy. I propose to read an extract from the speech of the Leader of the Opposition in the Tasmanian Parliament, because an endeavour has been made to convey the impression that all the Tasmanian people are just gasping for this bill. The report states - </para>

                <para class="block">Evidently the same hasty tactics were adopted in the Parliament of Tasmania as those that are being adopted in this chamber, because the Leader of the Opposition protested against being called on at five minutes##'## notice to deal with the bill. The people of Tasmania may be committed to the expenditure of millions of pounds more than they anticipated. The procedure adopted in the Commonwealth Parliament by a Labour government is almost parallel with that adopted in the Tasmanian Parliament by another Labour administration. In view of the allegations made in the debates to-day and yesterday, it is the duty of the Government to protect the interests of the Treasury to the maximum degree. The money required for this project cannot be found by any easy method. It will have to come from either taxation or loans. If it comes from loans - and that is what unundoubtedly will happen - it will be a part of a huge sum of probably ##£##150,000,000 which the Government will raise for war purposes and other requirements. In short, the people of Australia will be called upon to subscribe the money. It may be said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> V. Smith, who is to be  chairman  of the commission, is quite capable of safeguarding the interests of the Commonwealth, but. we should remember that he is already  chairman  of the War Disposals Commission and secretary of the Department of Supply and Shipping.

We understand that whenever possible the meetings of the commission are to be held in Tasmania, so that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> will be under some difficulty in that connexion. </para>

                    <para>.- The committee accepted the offer of the Attorney-General to postpone clause 10 on the condition that the remainder of the bill could bc proceeded with, and no reasons have been advanced why that arrangement should not be honoured. The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> read certain passages from a report which appeared, last April, in the Launceston <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> relating to a debate in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. I point out, however, that the bill relating to the aluminium industry which was, at that time, before the State House was subsequently passed by it. Later it was also passed by the Legislative Council of Tasmania. Labour has only four out of the eighteen representatives in that chamber, which shows that the anti-Labour members of the chamber must have supported the bill. The agreement contained in the schedule to this bill was signed by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> on behalf of the Commonwealth, and by the State Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cosgrove)</inline> on behalf of Tasmania. In the circumstances I can see no reason why we should not approve of this clause. If the agreement were amended in any way a new measure would have to be submitted to the Tasmanian Parliament. I point out to honorable members that similar reasons to those which have been advanced against this proposal were advanced years ago against the proposal to establish the newsprint industry in Tasmania, in which substantial sums of Government money are invested. Probably the reason why anti-Labour members of $he Tasmanian Legislative Council agreed to this scheme was that the Tasmanian newsprint industry has been so successful. We all know that that industry is to be expanded. There has been no attempt to ##"## steam-roller ##"## this measure through the Parliament. The suggestion that transport difficulties might make it hard for the  chairman  of the Commission to visit Tasmania frequently is ridiculous, for it is possible in these days to travel from Melbourne to Tasmania by air in a couple of hours. I hope that the clause will not be postponed. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony),</inline> in discussing this proposal, mentioned the names of certain Australian business men. Of course, he has a right to do that if he considers such a course necessary. But I have personal knowledge of some of the men whose names were mentioned. I consider that I have a responsibility to tell honorable members what I know of them, in order to counteract any adverse interpretation of the criticism to which they have been subjected. I have personal knowledge of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> S. Robinson and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Massy Greene, whose names were mentioned by the honorable member for Richmond. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robinson</inline> is a member of one of the most respected families in Victoria. He is one of four brothers, each of whom has made his mark in the public and commercial life of Victoria.  His  eldest brother, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> F. Robinson, is an outstanding personality in the textile industry. Another brother, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gerald</inline> Robinson, is prominent in business circles in Victoria. The other brother, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Robinson, was at one time known to some of the older honorable members of this chamber as the member for Wannon. He is to-day one of Victoria##'##s leading solicitors. After his term of office as member for Wannon in this Parliament, he became Attorney-General in Victoria, and rendered distinguished  service to the State. These four brothers are sons of a sister of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, the first Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Robinson was at one_ time financial editor of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> S. Robinson also, at a later stage, filled that position. Some of the men whose names have been mentioned reside in my electorate, and for that reason also I consider that I have an obligation to place these facts before the House. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> S. Robinson has become an international financial figure. Some honorable members may attempt to attach a sinister significance to that. To my mind, it certainly means that he is a man of very great capacity. He has been accepted as a friend and, indeed, an adviser, by such a prominent and eminently respectable person as the Prime Minister of Great Britain. I have not an intimate knowledge of his business activities, but I recall hearing, as a member of a former government of the Commonwealth, that in the years before the war he had been prominently and, indeed, dominantly associated with the establishment of the aircraft industry in Australia, at a time when there appeared to be very little prospect of a financial return to those who invested their capital in the enterprise. He helped to persuade fellow industrialists in Australia to provide the finance that was required to establish the industry, so that it would be an important and, indeed, an essential adjunct to any future Australian defence programme. </para>

The industrial relations that exist between the men and the management are entirely satisfactory. Completely disinterested parties have stated to me that the organization represents a model arrangement between the employees and the employer, ifr. <inline font-style="italic">Holt.</inline></para>

                <para>I make these observations, because we should have in proper perspective criticisms made, no doubt, in good faith and from a sense of responsibility, but which may have the effect of casting a cloud over, not only an individual, but perhaps a whole family which has served Australia well. </para>

Curiously enough, he represented the electorate of Richmond, the present member for which will agree that it would not be likely to return for nine years one in whose capacity and probity it had not confidence. Later, he served for fifteen years as a member of the Senate. During the war years he has rendered valuable, and, I believe, honorary assistance to the Government in a variety of capacities.

It is obvious that those will  be powers only insofar as they are not subject to any direction given upon any matter of either policy or detail, by the Minister of State administering the legislation. My objection is that the very vice of which I previously spoke in respect of the power of the Coal Commissioner is repeated with emphasis in this bill. The powers of the Coal Commissioner were made subject to any direction as to policy, given by the Minister administering the act. Similarly the powers of the Aluminium Commission are to be subject to any direction given by the Minister of State of the Commonwealth in respect of any matter of detail or policy. The Parliament is asked to commit itself to a vicious principle, when it is asked to agree to the establishment of an organization that will be subject to complete political control in respect of any detail of its business. </para>

                <para>I can expect no help from the Parliament on my second point, because the Government, which so often has spoken about the principles of democracy, seeks to impose its will upon every aspect of life in the country, and, in relation to this industry, upon every branch of its progress and policy and every technical and other detail of its administration. Although I approve of the establishment of the industry, I take this opportunity to object to the way in which the Commonwealth Government seeks to engage in it although the Constitution, in general terms, prohibits the Commonwealth from engaging in business. This is a direct engagement in business by the Commonwealth. It seems to me that the Commonwealth will seek to defend its right to enter into this agreement by saying, ##"## The State has complete power to make such an agreement ##"## ; and if  it3  power be challenged, it will have recourse to the justification that the aluminium industry is essential for the defence of the Commonwealth. It is obvious that the industry has no real relation to the present war. It can have relation to the post-war period, and a relation to defence, only insofar as it may be said that any basic industry is related to the defence of the country. In modern warfare, it is exceedingly difficult to draw the line as to what form of industry the </para>
                <para class="block">Commonwealth may not be able properly to say is directed to the defence of th##«## country. 1 warn the Parliament that this seems to be the preliminary to a further adventuring by the Commonwealth into industry. If the agreement can be supported under the Constitution - upon which point I do not offer an opinion- then it seems to me a logical step that any other basic industry can be related to the defence plan; and if an agreement can be made with a State, one can be made also with an individual. By making an agreement with an individual or a State, the Commonwealth may be able to defend its investment by saying ##"## This is related to the defence of the country ##"##. If that be so, it is not easy to see why any form of economic life cannot be similarly related. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> has suggested that the Commonwealth should engage in the fabrication of aluminium. If it can do that, I see no limit to its power to enter any industry by means of an agreement linking it with a State or an individual. Upon both grounds, I object, not to the purpose contained in the bill, but to the form of the agreement. </para>

                    <para>. - I have not yet had much time to examine the Hey report, but what I have already examined makes it appear that there is in it a lot of dynamite which will blow up somebody. I first direct attention to a letter dated the 1st December, 1942, from British Aluminium Company Limited of Oakleigh Manor, Shropshire, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> J. Keast, c/o British Aluminium Company Limited, London. The letter purports to give certain information regarding the cost of producing aluminium. If that information was ever in the letter, it has been excised, because no longer is it there. The letter reads - </para>

                <para>We have not had much time to give you the information you require, but I enclose herewith the following schedules as prepared in accordance with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morrison^</inline> instructions to me: - Capital costs, 20,000-ton Alumina plant with notes; capital costs, 10,000-ton Aluminium plant with notes; alternative capital costs of Aluminium plant if power is generated and not purchased.

The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> has made a discovery, and we ought to prospect the find a little further. I am not a bit enamoured of the bill, not because I am opposed to the agreement, but because I think that there ought to be a proper inquiry. I have had some experience of Labour governments, both State and Federal. and I know that if you want to obtain approval for  a  real, healthy monopoly you must go to a Labour##'## government. You would have no chance with a government drawn from honorable members on this side of the House. Take, for instance, the proposal for developing the Yampi Sound iron ore deposits. It was proposed that an agreement should be entered into between the Government of Western Australia and the Commonwealth Government, only in that case the Commonwealth Government would not play. That agreement, had it been made, would have given the Japanese 100,000,000 tons of iron ore. The Labour Government then in office in Western Australia was prepared to do all sorts of things to help the Japanese. The actual _ development was to be done by a British company registered in Australia, with a Yankee manager and a Portuguese secretary. It was an extraordinary set-up. </para>

                    <para>. - This bill provides for the establishment of a great, new industry in Australia at an estimated cost of ##£##3,000,000, yet neither the Minister in charge of the bill nor his experts can say what will be the cost of producing aluminium. Attached to this report, which has been put into our hands, is a letter from the British Aluminium ##'##Company in which mention is made of the cost of producing aluminium, ##"## . . . excluding interest on capital . . . based on our own costs, and costs can vary enormously according to the ore used . . . ##"## That is the most empiric form of costing that I have ever seen, but then, to crown everything, no cost is shown at all. There is an estimate of the cost of plant, and also an estimate of ##"## red mud disposal ##"##. It seems to me that this is a ##"##muddy##"## sort of agreement, one which has never been properly examined by the Government. An attempt has been made to rush it through the House. We have had to drag the report out of the Government, and the operation was as difficult as that of dragging out a man##'##s wisdom teeth. The Government did its best to suppress the report. It is proposed to commit the country to vast expenditure, yet we are not told what the cost of production will he. When I proposed that a Treasury official be appointed to the commission to watch expenditure, the Government refused to consider it. Why the Attorney-General will not postpone further consideration of the bill until to-morrow morning so that honorable members may study the reports, I cannot understand. The attitude of the Government in this respect is on a par with its attitude regarding this whole proposal. Discussion has been stifled as far as possible, and now, when the report has been finally made available, it is evident that the Attorney-General knows nothing of its contents. Notwithstanding the fact that a promise was given on the 17th September last that the reports would be made available, only six copies of this particular report have been placed before ns. I should like the Attorney-General to say why more copies were not prepared. He knew that the honorable memher for Gippsland had asked for the report last night or. if he did not know, it is a reflection on his secretarial assistants. On the matter of this vital report the Attorney-General misled us when he was speaking earlier this evening. He said first that it was a short report, and then he suddenly discovered that it was a long one. That shows how much study he gave to the report, and probably Cabinet studied it just about ##&gt;##as much. This attempt to push through the bill without proper study or consideration is unfair to the Parliament and to the people. Parliamentary sessions are few and far between. It would be better if they were more frequent so that, more consideration could be given to the business of the country. The Attorney-General should adjourn this debate straight away so that more copies could be made of the report, and so that honorable members might read it. through before the House meets to-morrow. </para>

                    <para>##[##11. 13 J.  -  I have given every assistance I can to the committee. Earlier in the evening it was pointed out by the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> that the Minister for Supply and Shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> had promised that certain reports would be made available when this bill was being considered in Committee. The reports were not previously called for, although it is true that last night the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> referred to the KeastHey report. I then gave directions that copies of the Charles report and of the summary of the Copper and Bauxite Committee##'##s report should be prepared for all honorable members; all that has been done. This evening the honorable member for Richmond asked me about the Keast-Hey report, a technical document, and the few copies available have been distributed. Even my adviser, the Secretary of the Department, has not now a copy. It was suggested by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> that the fairest way would be to postpone clause 10 while the machinery clauses of the bill were agreed to. Then, discussions on clause 10 could be resumed later in the light of such information as might  be obtained from an examination of the reports. I had agreed first to postpone clauses 4 and 10, but it was agreed that full discussion could take place on clause 10. I am both willing and anxious to do that. I ask the committee to proceed with the rest of the bill to-night. </para>

Indeed, I did not know of its existence as a separate report until to-night. I do not consider that it is necessary that every report received by the Government should be made available to honorable members. The report referred to provides the ground for some estimates. It has been pointed out that further  information might be available either from that report or from some other source, and I shall look into that matter. </para>

I have told the committee the reason why the Treasurer does not desire that a Treasury official shall be appointed to the commission. I wish to assist the committee, and I ask it to assist me by passing the rest of the bill to-night, so that to-morrow morning the whole measure may be completed in the light of the information obtainable from the reports.

                    <para>. - I think that the objective of the honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) can be attained if the bill is left as it is. This is a clause in a Commonwealth law. The schedule to the bill is an agreement between the Commonwealth and Tasmania. The object of clause 9 is to prevent the Executive Government of the Commonwealth from consenting to the sale of any part of this undertaking without reference to this Parliament. Similarly, the power of the Executive Government of Tasmania to consent to any such disposal should be conditioned by the necessity to obtain the consent of both Houses of the  State  legislature. If the honorable member will look at the clause, she will see that there is a condition against the sale or disposal of any part of the undertaking. It cannot be effected until approved by both Houses of the Parliament. That does not mean that it could be disposed of without the consent of the Parliament of Tasmania. </para>

Otherwise, that power would be vested in the commission on which the Commonwealth Government would have a majority of members. Therefore, this limitation of the power  of the commission is a limitation referring only to the Commonwealth authority. Why should there not be a provision that the consent of the State Parliament also must bo obtained before any sale can take place? </para>

Paragraph 4 (c) provides thai the commission shall have power to determine the processes to be employed for the production of ingot aluminium. Will the Minister give a specific undertaking, along the lines indicated by him earlier, that before any work is done in the manufacture of aluminium, every system of processing will be fairly and impartially investigated ? </para>

                    <para class="block">The Wine Export Bounty Act, which was promulgated in 1939, had a currency of five years and is due to expire or. the 2St,h February, 1945. The Government has given consideration to the question of the continuance of the act after February next, and, in view of the importance of the wine industry to the economic life of Australia, and particularly to certain districts, the population of which is composed chiefly of returned soldiers from the 1914.-1S war, it has decided that the act should not be allowed to expire. During the past five years, the wine trade has passed through a period unparalleled in its history, inasmuch as it has practically lost an export trade of approximately 4,000,000 gallons a year but has not felt any immediate adverse effect, for the local market expanded owing to war-time conditions and the general prosperity of the community to such a degree that there has been no accumulation of stocks. In fact, the local market has absorbed the quantity sold thereon prior to the war, plus the equivalent of the quantity exported in pre-war times. </para>
                    <para>It is not anticipated, however, that the increased sales on the local market will continue on the same scale when conditions return to normal, and there is no doubt that, in the post-war period, the Australian wine industry will have to look to overseas trade to absorb some portion of its production. The wine trade has made representations##'## to the Government for the continuance of the act for a period of ten years, with certain other amendments, but, in view of the difficulty of anticipating, at this stage, when the war will finish, and the conditions that will exist in the immediate post-war period, the Government has decided to continue the operation of the present act for a period of two years. The proposal for the continuance of the act for this comparatively short period is not to be taken as an indication of the Government##'##s intention to withdraw, at the expiration of the two-year period, the assistance rendered to the industry by the act. As a matter of fact, the bill is a protective measure which ensures the continuance of the bounty pending examination of the conditions likely to confront the industry in the immediate post-war period. It is unlikely that those conditions can be thoroughly examined before the 28th February, 1945, but, if this bill were not introduced, the bounty on wine would lapse automatically on that date. The extension of the act to the 28th February, 1947, does not necessarily mean that the Government will allow the act to remain in its present form until that date. The Government will introduce amending legislation to meet the postwar problems of this industry at an earlier date if the necessity arises. As honorable members are well aware the act provides for a bounty of1s. a gallon on fortified wine exported, and the amount of money standing to the credit of the trust fund from which the bounty is paid is ##£##708,285. There is, therefore, no shortage of money with which to pay bounty on all wine that may be exported during the next two years. </para>

                        <para>.- In recent weeks a campaign has been in progress in New South Wales and other States in connexion with the Government##'##s banking policy. It does not appear to have reached great dimensions in New South Wales, but to-day I received about a dozen telegrams from supposed constituents of mine on this subject, and they are so interesting that I bring them to the notice of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> particularly, and the Government, generally. These telegrams refer to a change of banking legislation which may take place in the near future. Peculiarly, although the telegrams ostensibly come from different people in different parts of my constituency, they were all lodged at and sent from the telegraph office at Five Dock between 3 and 3.5 p.m. The first I received was from the organizer of the United Australia party in my electorate. Evidently he canvassed the electorate for names to attach to the other telegrams, because among the names I recognize those of supporters of the Opposition party. This appears to be a deliberate attempt sponsored by the parties opposite, the private banks and other interested organizations or persons to undermine the people##'##s confidence in this Government and to destroy the unity of the people which must be preserved for the battles that still lie ahead. I am amazed that such a campaign should have the backing of a party which is held by some to be reputable. I think the Government should immediately investigate the activities of the people who are fostering this campaign, which has resulted in my colleagues and me receiving many letters and telegrams signed by every Tom, Dick and Harry who have been induced by the organizers to subscribe their names to statements in ignorance of their contents. So that this campaign shall be nipped in the bud, I urge the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> and the Treasurer to say definitely just what this Government has in view with regard to banking legislation. I am prepared to support the policy which will be placed before the Parliament. </para>

Instead of trying to undermine national unity and the prestige of this Government, the honorable gentleman and his colleagues would do well to hide their time and carefully study the banking proposals when, at the appropriate time, they are placed before them. Appropriate action ought to be taken in the meanwhile to prevent the already overworked postal employees from being saddled with the needless labour involved in handling the letters and telegrams to which this objectionable campaign is giving birth and to prevent the needless waste of valuable newspaper space on furtherance of vicious propaganda, which is a disgrace to every party and person associated with it. The whole campaign is in keeping with the fascist tendencies of certain newspaper interests and other bodies determined to do all within their power to bring about the downfall of probably the best .government this country has enjoyed. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise only because of the extraordinary statement made by the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly),</inline> who has discovered that Fascists are responsible for the campaign. It is customary for Communists to call everybody who is not a Communist a Fascist. I hope that the honorable gentleman will not fall into that rash habit. Wo all are receiving protests. I do not know many of the persons who have sent protests to me, but some I do know; they are not members of a political party, but they send their protests with good reason. I have had letters and telegrams from many kinds of people who are genuinely alarmed at the prospects outlined by certain Ministers in interjections in this House and otherwise, that Australia##'##s banking system will be socialized and the Commonwealth Bank Board abolished. There have been inspired statements to that effect in the press, and wild utterances by irresponsibles in the Ministry that now that Labour has the power it will socialize whatever it wants to. The honorable member himself, if he had money in a bank which he thought would be interfered with, might think it wise to transfer it to another bank. One of my correspondents, a retired bank manager, says, ##"## I point out this to you in case you are supporting this action: it is most unwise to centralize all banking in one concern ##"##. The very fact that there is competition among trading banks is a spur to efficiency and an aid to business because few small enterprises can carry on without overdrafts. A government bank is usually a soulless thing mainly concerned with national finance and with no interest in the individual customer. It may be too large to interest itself in individuals. Any person who has been in business, or conducted an enterprise, in which he has utilized the services provided by a bank knows that the outlook of private banks is not uniform, that a bank which may grant an overdraft 1o one person may refuse the same facility to another person. We know also that the banks render valuable service to the business community, and to private individuals in facilitating travel, and in other directions. Therefore, it is useless for the honorable member to rail against people who may be genuinely alarmed. The responsibility for such unrest lies at the  door of the Government, because it is responsible for public uncertainty with respect to this matter. Although Parliament is about to go into recess, the Government, has not issued an official statement concerning its policy in relation to banking. There may be some sinister motive behind the statements that there are to be certain changes. What changes exactly does the Government propose to make? If the Treasurer would reveal the Government##'##s intentions, the honorable member for Martin would not he worried in the way he has indicated. </para>

                            <para>- That sort of talk would go on in caucus. I know that in caucus the majority of honorable members opposite are only fettered deaf mutes, and do not dare to speak on anything but simple tub-thumping matters. However, the honorable member for Martin raised this subject, and placed responsibility for the action of which he complained, upon a political party which he alleged had a Fascist origin. He knows that perfectly good citizens are alarmed by the statements made on the subject by the Treasurer and the less responsible Minister for Transport. </para>

                        <para>.-Some months ago I had occasion to refer to the construction of a building at. Bankstown by a man named Fitzpatrick, and in endeavouring to bring the matter to a head I became involved in a brush with the Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman).</inline> In view of the high esteem in which I held the Minister, J regretted that incident very much; but I knew that certain influences were at work which tended to compromise him in that matter. In fact, overtures had been made to me with the object of deflecting roe from my duty in the matter, and that was followed up by threats to i ii v political future. The delay in the policing of relevant regulations embarrassed me as the representative in this Parliament of that district, because the matter had been brought to my notice by local people and members of branches of l lie Labour party; whilst the boastful attitude adopted by the individual concerned was creating the impression, which was entirely unwarranted, that he enjoyed immunity so far as the enforcement of the regulations was concerned. In consequence, a situation arose in th##«####&gt;## district which was intolerable to me as iti? representative in this Parliament, and also as a supporter of the Government, particularly as I had been asked to support applications for permits to build homes on behalf of persons who were living in deplorable conditions. Some of (hern were living in brick kilns, and others in fowl houses. Only this week the circumstances of a family of twelve persons living in a 14-ft. tent in the same district were brought to my notice. Honorable members will appreciate the invidious position in which I was placed in relation to this matter. The only way in which we can get people to put up with the restrictions and sacrifices imposed on them to-day owing to war conditions is by ensuring that everybody shall be treated equally under the law, and no favours extended to any individual, no matter how wealthy or privileged he may appear to he. My attitude in that matter has since been vindicated, because this individual was convicted on two counts of having committed breaches of the National Security Regulations. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">But a more serious aspect than the breaking of the building regulations is the matter of the source of the materials used in the structure. I received information - I did not disclose it to the House at the time - relating to the source of certain materials. I realized that proceedings of a serious nature would probably be instituted against this individual, and I was anxious not to prejudice the case. Therefore, I handed the information to the proper authorities. I realized also that any delay would prejudice the proceedings, because certain of the property involved was movable, and evidence could be destroyed. Commonwealth authorities who are responsible for policing the building regulations, and officials of the Bankstown Council, who are charged with the supervision of building construction, may be examined regarding the source of those materials. I should like to be informed why the proceedings have been obstructed and delayed, and I trust that the Minister will fully inquire into this aspect. </para>
                    <para>The other matter has been referred to the War Expenditure Committee for inquiry, and also to the Crown Law authorities, and I understand that a report from the committee has been submitted to the Attorney-General. I have no doubt that the right honorable gentleman will act in this matter as promptly as he did in the other. Three months had elapsed before the case came before the Attorney-General, after I had submitted it to the Department of War Organization of Industry, but the right honorable gentleman, within 24 hours, instituted proceedings. I am confident that he will act just as promptly on the report of the War Expenditure Committee. However, nearly twelve months have passed since I first directed the attention of the authorities to this occurrence. I touch upon the matter this evening only because I desire to make a personal explanation about my own position. Prior to the previous proceedings, I was informed that attempts would be made to undermine me politically in my constituency. Since -the proceedings were launched, a definite campaign has been organized against me, and I feel bound to refer to it in this chamber. As a part of the campaign to undermine me, poisonous propaganda has been circulated by this individual in my electorate, and a lying and scurrilous letter signed by him has been sent to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> the Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman),</inline> the secretary of the New South Wales Executive of the Australian Labour party, which is the governing body of the movement in New South Wales, and the secretary of the Reid Electoral Council. These letters have also circulated in this House and throughout industries in my constituency. I was not aware of what was happening until some time later, when a loyal supporter directed my attention to it. The letter imputed all kinds of motives to me, and I cannot permit it to pass unchallenged. This individual has attempted to intimidate me in the performance of my duties to my constituents and to this House, but I am not deterred by his efforts. Others are associated with this campaign because the letter itself was prepared by a skilled hand. Although this gentleman may possess sonic native shrewdness, he has not the ability to produce the phrases which occurred in the letter. Obviously, a very subtle and skilful hand is behind it. I have some idea of the identity of the author, but, as proceedings are pending, I shall not disclose it.  I  am handicapped to a certain degree in not being able to give the whole of the details, but I hope, at a later stage, when the proceedings have been completed, to refer to them and to the attitude of some of the persons associated with this individual in trying to obstruct the course of justice. It is an offence to aid and abet a wrongdoer, and any one doing so may be guilty of being an accessory after the fact. Some of the people who are associated with this individual in his activities, or who are trying to cover their tracks, should know better and may receive their deserts. </para>
                    <para>I must refer to one phase of the matter which greatly concerns me. Certain phrases which occur in that letter relate to material which I gave some time ago in strict confidence to security officers of the Commonwealth. That information could have been handed to this individual only by some one associated with the Security Section. That  i3  a serious offence. </para>

                            <para>- I exonerate the present Director of Security, because I am sure that he would not approve of the handing out of this information. Incidentally, I gave  the  information to the Security Service during the regime of  a  previous government.  When  the Attorney-General is investigating this matter, he should seek  to  elicit how this individual is able to circulate a letter in the manner which I have described, and to include in it confidential matters relating to security which should not be used for political purposes. This individual stated  to  the press, and also in this  letter, that,  bo  was one  of my political supporters. To  that  assertion I give the lie direct. To my knowledge, he has never supported or financed me politically. In fact, I understood that he supported (mother organization whose activities are more  in  keeping  with  his reputation. In  is 11 v  event, whether  he  was my supporter or  not,  he  is not  immune from the  law. That  sort of thing does not ##"##go down##"##  in  Australia, although it might  ##"##go  down##"##  in  other countries.  The  Labour movement, of which I am a member, would not stand for anything of  that  nature. I am confident that the Attorney-General will expedite this matter which already has been long delayed, and see that the channels of justice in this country remain clear  and  unpolluted. </para>

I have received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maurice</inline> Francis, of the Macquarie broadcasting network.

I cannot understand the action of the censor, because the matter does not disclose information that may be of value to the enemy. But it definitely affects the parents of unfortunate men who have met their death in carrying out the normal exercises of war.

The whole of the information necessary for a thorough investigation of the facts is contained in the statement that I have made. This letter would not have come into my possession unless the facts were as stated. The Government should prevent a repetition of this conduct, so that proper consideration may be shown to the parents of airmen who lose their lives in the service of their country. Officers who refuse to supply travel priorities in these circumstances should receive a severe reprimand, so that their mistake will not be repeated.

                    <para>I have particulars before me of two other cases that I have no intention to discuss at present, because the Acting Prime Minister is not. at the moment in a position to obtain, the information which I require, but I shall supply him wilh the details and discuss them with him at a later date. There is another case, however, which I should like him to refer to his ministerial colleague. About ten months ago I referred to the case of Sergeant Martin, and recently 1 brought the case of a man named Wilkinson to his notice. There is clearly something seriously wrong in the administration of the medical services of the Army. In both instances the medical officers had diagnosed the complaints of those men. wrongly, and had imposed certain restrictions which, upon inquiry, had to be completely lifted. As the result of action taken in this House, these men were re-examined and their complaints were diagnosed in the correct way. As isolated cases of the* kind come to the notice of members of this House, I am led to believe that many other cases to which little publicity is given occur. I shall read a statutory declaration .by Gunner A. C. Coombes, who enlisted on the 21st October, 1939. and served for three years in the Middle East and niue months in New Guinea. The following is his sworn declaration, dated the 19th November: - </para>

                        <para>On my return from the Convalescent Home at Bowral on the 0th November, 1944, I was sent to 103rd Australian Convalescent Depot, at Ingleburn. As my wound was still discharging, I reported to the medical officer, who issued an order that I report for daily dressing to the regimental aid post. On Friday, the 10th November, 1944,- I was ordered on a route march, on which I refused to go. and so was paraded before the captain, wlm reprimanded me and told me not to let it occur again. On Tuesday, the 14th November, 1844, I was again ordered out on a route march, and on advising the sergeant that I did not feel up to marching, he told me to lodge my complaint on my return. During the evening I collapsed and was taken by ambulance to the above address, where I was operated on last Friday, the 17th November, 1944, making two internal operations in less than eleven weeks. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is a similarity between this case and that of Sergeant Martin, because of the fact that his illness prevented him from going on a route march. He was ordered to proceed on that march while his wound was still discharging. Obviously, he was under medical treatment, and some days later he collapsed. He was operated upon for the second time, and thus underwent two operations in less than eleven weeks.

                            C. Coombes consulted me to day. He complains that he was operated on for appendicitis in 1940, and has been operated four times since for complications of that operation. He has scars on his abdomen, which substantiate this fact that he has been operated upon on several occasions, and has an unhealed wound at present from an operation. He states further that he has had malaria on numerous occasions, and is at present taking atebrine.

                    <para class="block">Apparently this soldier should have been under close medical observation, and should not have been ordered to go upon a route march, but, as happened in a couple of other cases to which I have referred, the medical officers of the Army did not take the necessary interest in him, and he suffered accordingly. It is useless for me to bring cases before the Acting Prime Minister, unless he intends to take action in regard to them. It is useless for him to call for a report, and, having received it, completely forget the matter, as has been done in respect of Sergeant Martin, whose case I brought before this House ten months ago. This is a case of more recent date - the 11th November last. I plead with the right honorable gentleman to do something in regard to this unfortunate man, and to see that the members of the medical section of the Army shall not be completely soulless in their dealings with those who come before them. They may have an answer to this case, but on the face of it I cannot imagine what it could be. The man had an unhealed wound, and should have been under close medical control. He had had two operations in eleven weeks for a bowel obstruction following an appendectomy operation. He enlisted in 1939, and should have received the maximum consideration from the Army doctors. He was ordered on a route march, and when he said that he was in such a state of health that he could not go, was reprimanded, by his captain and told not to offend again in that respect. He was sent on the route march on the following day, collapsed, was taken to hospital, and underwent a further operation. </para>

                    <para>I endorse strongly the remarks of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> concerning the Government##'##s proposed banking policy. I have the same realization of the seriousness of the matter and of the danger that lies in the use by honorable members of intemperate or extravagant language when dealing with the public concern that has developed in regard to the proposal of the Government in relation to banking legislation. It is said that the sheaf of telegrams and letters we have received is a direct result of a campaign instituted by the private trading banks. Certain of those institutions - I do not know how extensive has been the practice - have made no secret of the fact that they have circulated what they call their constituents - possibly their clients - and have told them of their concern in regard to the projected legislation. The Government cannot have this sort of thing both ways. Only yesterday, the Acting Prime Minister told the House that, despite the attempts by a highly influential newspaper - which, he said, would be read by approximately half a million people in the State of New South Wales - there had been a very lukewarm response by the public to its suggestion that telegrams and letters should be sent to members protesting in regard to the coal situation. If it. be the view of the Government that the public does not respond readily to suggestions of that kind, we are entitled to interpret the protests on the subject of banking that have reached us in such large numbers, as an indication of the very real concern which the people are feeling. I impress on the Treasurer my conscientious belief that, whatever may have been the action of the banks, there is no doubt that, at present, there is a very real fear and concern in the minds of many people that the programme of the Government will have a detrimental effect on the banking structure of this country. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline> misunderstands the situation, if that is his view. I have had my share of these letters. Their contents clearly show that, whatever may have been the original prompt ing which the writers received, they have written them in their own terms so asto express their own views. There is no uniformity about their tone or their context. It is noticeable, in my case at all events, that by far the greater proportion come from women. It is understandable that women whose entire savings and perhaps the bulk of whose resources are represented by bank deposits, and who do not understand very much about the niceties of banking practice or the vagaries of government or parliamentary procedure, should be alarmed at any radical change that may be contemplated in respect of accepted banking practice. This is only one phase of the practice that has developed within recent months. The Government is following a very dangerous course when it indicates in this House vital changes of policy without proceeding forthwith to carry them through by means of legislation. Only recently, there was an announcement in regard to the acquisition of commercial interstate airlines. The Government acted very unwisely in not delaying an announcement on that matter until it was able to present to this House the legislation by means of which it proposed to acquire those lines. Then, there would not have been the hiatus, causing uneasiness, that we are about to experience between the announcement and the implementation of the policy. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know what the Government has in mind, and I am not prepared, on the strength of the vague statements which have so far been made, to accept the proposition that any improvements will take place. If the Government has decided on the principles which it proposes to apply it should make a clear statement now. The Australian people are not prone to panic, and they can stand up to fundamental changes of government policy, but they are entitled to know what the Government has in mind. The people are afraid to-day that in place of the freedom which existed before the war to take a business proposition from one bank to another in search of financial accommodation, some other system will be instituted. There is a fear that the present satisfactory system by which a central bank exercises control over currency whilst private banks provide financial accommodation to private citizens will be replaced by a government monopoly directly created by the Government, and directly influenced by it. We do not have to go back very far in order to see how government-controlled banking systems have operated in other countries. For instance, when the Government assumed control of hanking in Germany, success or failure of one##'##s dealings with the banks depended largely upon whether or not one was sympathetically inclined towards the Nazi party. There is a fear in Australia that with direct political control the banking service will be influenced by the political patronage which the client of the bank is prepared to show to the governing party. </para>

                    <para>Mi-. HOLT. - It is my own observation. If the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> wants a letter on the subject I shall, as an elector, write him one myself. I do not. think that any political party should be placed in a position where it can influence the applications of private citizens for banking accommodation. The Government has a definite responsibility to the community to make known as soon as possible its policy on these matters. </para>
                    <para>I refer now to the overhaul of the National Security (Landlord, and Tenant) Regulations, which the Government has been considering for some time. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> told a deputation in February last that he would give consideration to a number of suggested amendments, and in June of this year he wrote intimating that six amendments would be put into effect. So far, however, no amendments have been made. I raised this matter during the last sessional period and the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs told mc that if the amendments had been promised it was time that they were made. I have since brought the matter to the notice of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> and have had discussion with the Parliamentary Draftsman. I now bring the matter to the notice of the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> for hi? consideration, because there can bc no justification for delay. </para>

                        <para>. - L bring to the notice of the Government the shortage of superphosphate throughout Australia, and particularly in Victoria. Because the island of Nauru has been occupied by the enemy for so long there is a shortage of phosphatic rock, hut we now have an opportunity to obtain supplies from Transjordania. At present, we are obtaining from North Africa phosphatic rock of very low content which is hard to process. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> said that, in the coming year, it would not be possible to sow as much wheat as we would wish, because of the shortage of superphosphate. The richest deposits of phosphatic rock are those in Nauru, the phosphatic content being about SO per cent. The deposits in Transjordania have a phosphatic content of 74 per cent. I know the Transjordanian country particularly well, where there is one deposit which is estimated to contain 16,000,000 tons of rock, which can be landed at Akaba for about half the price which we pay for phosphatic rock obtained from America. The Transjordanian rock is very friable and easily worked. Those interested in the deposit have offered to send a trial shipment to Australia, and thereafter to send monthly shipments at a reasonable price. Therefore, there seems to be no excuse for curtailing sowings of wheat next year because there is a shortage of superhposphate. In the Corio electorate there is a cooperative fertilizer company, one of the biggest phosphate processing companies in Australia. In its factory eight or nine employees, for weeks at a time, refused to handle a machine to mix superphosphate and sulphate of ammonia which were urgently required for the growing of potatoes and other vegetables. The Government took no action against them, although the other employees of the company continued to work. The men in question claimed that the work was dusty. That may be. Farmers who use fertilizers know that it is dusty. </para>

                            <para>- Working conditions are worse in the cement-making factory near Geelong. The machine can be closed after the sulphate of ammonia and superphosphate have been placed in it, thereby reducing the dust. Other men have to work in dust and under bad conditions. That applies to many men in the Army who, in addition to working under unpleasant conditions, are in constant danger of losing their lives. The Government submitted a programme to the people for the greater production of vegetables, and yet it allows eight or nine men to hold up production. </para>

I should be prepared to do some work in the factory, as was done by New Zealand farmers on one occasion when wharf labourers refused to work. The New Zealand lumpers have not forgotten the lesson that they then learned. It would be a good thing if the shareholders of the company were to teach the men to whom I have referred a salutary lesson. The Government should not allow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gazze,</inline> who apparently has been ##"## nozzled ##"## by the British Phosphate Company, which has large deposits of phosphatic rock in North Africa, to hold up all attempts at trial shipments from other sources. If the phosphatic rock to which I have referred is as good as has been claimed, it should be of great value to the primary producers of this country. It is the duty of the Government to see that a trial shipment is imported, in order that the growth of vegetables and other primary products may be encouraged. </para>

However, I shall refer to the subject mentioned by the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly),</inline> the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White),</inline> and the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt),</inline> namely, the Government##'##s banking policy, and the alleged fears prevalent in the community as to what the effect of that policy is likely to be. I have before me a circular letter which was sent out by the manager of the National Bank of Australasia in a country town in Victoria to all clients who have overdrafts at that branch. I have been informed by the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Russell)</inline> that hundreds of such letters have been circulated in his electorate. The similarity of the letters is amazing. Apparently the same typewriter was used to type the addresses, and the wrong initials of the honorable member for Grey were put on  30  or  40  envelopes. Evidently, the letters were all despatched by the same organization. The circular which I have before me states - </para>

                    <para>One man who received this letter wrote to his representative in the Commonwealth Parliament stating that he owed. ##£##80 to the bank, and added that his neighbour, who also had received a circular from the bank, had formed the impression that the bank would sell up his property if the threatened legislation came into force. In writing to his federal member, the man said : ##"## This circular letter has worried me very much because my boy is in the Army and it is my intention that,, on his return, he should take over the place and clear off the debt##"##. He concluded by asking if there was any truth in the statements contained in the circular. As Acting Prime Minister, I say that, in my view, this organized propaganda engineered by the private banks of this country is doing a great disservice by affecting the morale of the people in this most critical year of the war. </para>

                    <para>Mr.FORDE.- Whilst I do not say that it is intended to be subversive, there is no doubt that it is calculated to undermine confidence in the Australian Government, which is responsible for organizing and financing the war effort of this country. Proposed banking legislation will be considered by the Government early in the new year in accordance with the promise made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> and I expect that that legislation will be placed before Parliament shortly after a decision has been reached by the Government. When that is done, honorable members will be given a full opportunity to debate it. At present, I am unable to say, and no private banking company is able to say, precisely what will be the nature of that legislation. I cannot give details of it at present, but I can give an assurance that the people of Australia will find that any changes in the present set-up of our banking organization will not be in any way detrimental to the interests of the public, borrowers, or depositors. There is absolutely no justification whatever for the fears that have been engendered by this propaganda, which is being disseminated throughout the community to-day for party political reasons. I sincerely hope that those people who in past weeks have been busily engaged in spreading this propaganda will cease their activities and will show that spirit of co-operation with the Australian Government that they consider the working-class sections of the community should show, and I believe are showing overwhelmingly at present. </para>

                        <para>- Had the bill been approved the Commonwealth Parliament would have had power to legislate on each and every aspect of aviation including aviation within each State. The power would not have been limited (as it was and is) to interstate and overseas air traffic and to the carrying out of the international aviation conventions. No government decision was reached as to how the power of aviation would have been exercised if the referendum were carried. </para>
