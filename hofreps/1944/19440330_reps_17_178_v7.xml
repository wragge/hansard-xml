I am sorry that I have to inform the honorable member that, at the moment, the stocks of snaring wire are sufficient for only 25 per cent. of the requirements. I. suggest that the honorable member advise those concerned to reduce their orders upon the manufacturers to that percentage. If they do, that quantity will be supplied to them. </para>

                        <para>- State authorities and officials of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court were consulted, with the result that Mr. Mooney, an industrial commissioner, was sent to Kalgoorlie, where he called a conference of all the parties concerned and subsequently requested the men to resume work, which they did. He then made an examination of the territory within a radius of 100 miles of Kalgoorlie, in which wood-cutting operations were conducted, and later sent his decision to me for signature. I am satisfied that the anomalies which gave rise to the dispute have been removed, and I hope that there will not be further trouble. </para>

Does it not appear that bottles are available for much less essential purposes than those mentioned? Is it not natural that chemists should wonder, therefore, why they are unable to obtain supplies ? Will the necessary action be taken to make adequate supplies available? </para>

As these machines are used in the raising of vegetables and fodder crops for dairy cattle, and, according to my information, the failure to supply them has been caused largely by shortage of man-power in the factory which makes them, will the honorable gentleman make a full inquiry, and take up with the Minister for Labour and National Service the matter of providing adequate manpower ? </para>

                            <para>- This matter has been concerning my department for a con,siderable time. The Controller of Agricultural Machinery is taking it up with the firm  concerned. Only recently the operations of that firm reverted from munitions production to the production of rotary hoes. When manufacture was recommended, a ##'## large accumulation of orders for new hoes had to be overtaken. An attempt has been made to speed up operations in order to meet the demand for new machines, and it is hoped that the firm will be able to manufacture before long the spare parts that are so essential. The honorable member may rest assured that I have the matter well in hand, and will do all that I can to meet the situation. I am confident that, the Minister for Labour and National Service also will assist in the fullest degree. </para>

As a result of the allegations made by Hewson to the Assistant Minister for Commerce, Stevenson was removed from his position, his home was raided, and he was subjected to certain other indignities. He was deprived of his position, and this inquiry, which has cost about ##£##20,000, was instituted. By the finding of the commissioner, Stevenson has been completely exonerated, and the man who laid the charges has been branded by the commissioner as unreliable. </para>

What is to happen to the officersmentioned by the honorable member is a matter for the Department of Commerce and Agriculture to decide. As for the expenses incurred by persons who have to engage legal assistance to represent them at inquiries, the practice is that the Solicitor-General and his officers consider whether the expenses incurred were reasonable, and whether, in the light of the finding of the commissioner, they should be met by the Crown. In many cases the Solicitor-General recommends that the Commonwealth should bear the whole or a part of the expenses, and the Government accepts the recommendation. Beyond this, I am not concerned in the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the honorable member for New England for the information which he has given the House. The Army Education Officer delivered a lecture to the troops based on the contents of an address given by Captain Martin some time previously. I cannot see anything wrong with what Captain Martin has dene. In my opinion, it is very gratifying to find that, away up at Port Moresby, the troops . are being entertained .by persons having the necessary educational qualifications with addresses that are not of a party political kind, but are of national importance. </para>

                        <para>. - The Opposition has evidently taken the view that, since it cannot prevent the passage of this bill, it will applaud the general principles, while condemning the financial arrangements embodied in the measure. That attitude will deceive no one because, when the party opposite was in power it failed to put into force amy unemployment benefit scheme. I regard this bill as one of first-rate importance. A few years ago, the introduction of a measure of this kind would have been hailed with cheers by millions of Australians, and it would have been discussed by groups of interested people in the streets. What a change  the war has wrought! However, the war must end, and afterwards hundreds of thousands of workers will swarm back to peacetime industries. For the time being war has banished the spectre of unemployment from the land. The Government has displayed commendable courage, initiative, imagination and sympathy in dealing with the people##'##s problems by bringing down so early in the life of this Parliament a measure, the worth of which as an instrument to ensure their security, the workers, although they have little need for it now, will appreciate. Social security is dominant in the minds of the masses to-day. The old orthodoxy taught that property was the reward of virtue, and poverty the penalty for improvidence, drunkenness or vice. It was said that governmental interference with the unhappy state of the poor was wrong, and that it did more harm than good. That left the poor open to exploitation by the social parasite and the tyrant. Indeed, Adolf Hitler, and his satellites, during the upsurge of fascism in Germany seized upon that outlook and taunted the capitalistic countries for their failure to improve the social standard of their people. Hitler and his gang rose to power mainly through the ravages of unemployment and poverty in Germany. If, is generally conceded that the morale of democratic nations, so badly shaken, has never fully recovered .from the depression of 1929-33. Therefore, these socialistic and betterment measures will help to improve and sustain the morale of our people. The depression came about through the failure of governments in all parts of the world to interfere with what they called the natural processes of economy. All intelligent people realize that now. These matters must have been prominent in the minds of Winston  Churchill  and Franklin Delano Roosevelt when they met in fateful days on the 10th August, 1941, in the Atlantic on H.M.S. <inline font-style="italic">Prince of Wales</inline> and  the  U.S.S. <inline font-style="italic">Augusta,</inline> for the purpose of cheering the hearts and fortifying the peoples of the civilized world opposed to the Axis. They met, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> told us, ##"##to give all people, especially the oppressed and conquered peoples, a simple, rough and ready war-time statement of the goal towards which the British Commonwealth and the United States mean to make their way##"##. The eight-point declaration of these great leaders of men, soon to be called the Atlantic Charter, was a restatement of democracy, but it expressed fervid hopes for the future happiness and social benefit ##'## of the peoples of the world. The fifth clause of the charter sets out - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Atlantic Charter therefore set the future course for the democracies, and the part of it that is directly relevant to this debate concerns social security and freedom from fear, and want. The Atlantic Charter was, in fact, a serious and formal confirmation of what the leaders of the British Commonwealth of Nations promised for the post-war years. The declarations in it, exalted by the name of charter, shine like a beacon light to guide the democracies through the years. Unfortunately, political promises are not always kept, but the Curtin Government will not forget that Labour##'##s policy is social progress. What shape the new  order will take I need not venture to explore, but I say that a great many things of fundamental and far-reaching importance must take place in this country. We must push on with reform, and we must keep our promises to rid the world of the twin evils of fear and want. This bill gives some expression to the spirit of clauses, 5 and 6 of the Atlantic Charter. The time for simple platitudes about individual initiative has passed, and we must rebate our ideas to the conditions and problems of contemporary life. In normal times, there is always a reservoir of unemployed, and I think that this will always be the case. For a few years after the war ends there will be very few people out of work, but, as the years pass on and normalcy is reached, natural causes of unemployment will have their effect. Unemployment may be caused by failure of crops, by droughts, by floods, storms and the like, which dislocate business and throw people out of work for varying periods. Factories may close down in one place and open in another. Employers may install laboursaving machinery and re-organize their plant. New industries may force old industries out of existence. Then, also, many industries are seasonal in their labour requirements, demanding thousands of workers at some period of the year and having no need of them at other times. </para>
                    <para>This is a kind and benevolent measure. The community has great need of it. It will be an everlasting blessing and assistance to many single women or those women, who have not the assistance and protection of a breadwinner. In that regard I read to the House a letter dated the 23rd March, which has just reached mc. The letter is a strong argument in favour ofl such a bill as this. It reads - </para>

                            I happen to bo a single woman entirely dependent on myself for a living. Since the 12th January I have been unemployed through illness. I have had three weeks in hospital, and have had to have treatment as an out-patient since  my discharge. I will not be able to return to work for some time yet. Well,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williams,</inline>
                            the position is this. What relief or assistance can I obtain while I am unable to work? My hospital treatment must be paid for. I have not been allowed any concessions on account of unemployment. As I pay tax when I am working, I think I should be entitled to some kind of assistance in my present position.

                        <para class="block">Social services seem to provide something for almost every other kind of thing, but the Government appears to close its eyes to the plight of the single woman situated as I am. </para>

                    <para class="block">Could there be any more cogent reason or better argument for bringing this bill into force? I have to tell the writer that there is nothing for her at present, but that when this bill becomes law, if she is still ill, she will be able to receive an allowance which will go some way towards relieving her distress, and,  if  shecannot find work, she will also be able to receive a weekly payment. Th.e bill will have great advantages for the Australian people. It is a part of the Government##'##s plan to ensure security from want. It raises the standard of living in this country. The measure will banish from the minds of Australians the terrifying fear of unemployment, and give to the worker the self-assurance and self-respect that every human being should have. </para>

                            <para>- Well, it will give him a far better dole than the Government which the honorable gentleman supported gave them. It will give him something substantial. The measure, above all, will go a long way towards ensuring that the precious children of this vast and undeveloped continent will never suffer the shame and degradation which seared the souls of the children of this country during the depression. Honorable members should not forget that high social standards in this country, and freedom from want, will be appreciated abroad, and will induce decent immigrants to bring their families to Australia. This bill makes a fine contrast to the miserable dole and drastic means test of the past. In the eyes of the workers it will stand as a monument to the wisdom and sympathy of the Curtin Government. </para>

                        <para>, - When the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> was introducing this bill, he intimated that the Government was impelled to formulate the legislation not only because some form of economic security was necessary in Australia, but also because the present was the most opportune time to give effect to such a proposal. With these two propositions, ##"##few people will disagree.  But agreement with ,them does not imply agreement with the method proposed in the bill. Indeed, the application of the wrong method might even destroy the very element of security. No scheme of social security can be worth while, and have permanent results, unless it is based upon a comprehensive view of the whole situation. The progress in social outlook in Australia during the past has largely been a process of ##"## bits and pieces ##"##, without that comprehensive view. In considering whether the Government##'##s proposal conforms to that view, I have sought assistance from the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Beveridge, to which reference has already been made in this debate. Although this document is referred to as the  ##"## Beveridge report ##"##, and is signed only by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Beveridge, the report, in fact, is the joint effort of a number of persons who were selected because of their experience of the workings of the social economy of Great Britain for some decades. </para>

                        <para>The first principle is that any proposals for the future, while they should use to the full the experience gathered in the past, should not be restricted by consideration of sectional interests established in the obtaining of that experience. Now, when the war is abolishing landmarks of every kind, is the opportunity for using experience in a clear field. A revolutionary moment in the world##'##s history is a time for revolutions, not for patching. </para>
                        <para>The second principle is that organization of social insurance should be treated as one part only of a comprehensive policy of social progress. _ Social insurance fully developed may provide income security; it is an attack upon want. But want is only one of five giants on the road of reconstruction and in some ways the easiest to attack. The others are disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness. </para>
                        <para>The third principle is that social security must be achieved by co-operation between the State and the individual. The State should offer security for service aud contribution. </para>
                        <para class="block">The State in organizing security should not stifle incentive, opportunity, responsibility; in establishing a national minimum, it should leave room and encouragement for voluntary action by each individual to provide more than that minimum for himself and his family. </para>

                        STEWART.The urgency for security against industrial and social vicissitudes, irregularity of employment, and the loss of wages due to illness, is not new-. A great deal of criticism has been levelled against the text of the Versailles Peace Treaty, but not a great deal of objection has been taken to section 13, which declared that it was quite impossible to contemplate a. system of permanent, worth-while peace unless it was based on a condition of social security among all the nations of the world. Nor will very much criticism be levelled at the peace conference for having followed up that declaration by creating an##'## International Labour Office, with a charter to see that the declaration was put into operation among the constituent members of the League of Nations. The Minister, like myself, has had an opportunity to represent Australia at the meetings of the International Labour Office at Geneva, and I am confident that he will, agree with me that if all the instrumentalities of the League of Nations had attacked their tasks with the same vigour and success as did the International Labour Office, there might have been less universal criticism or condemnation of the League of Nations to-day. In the more .human atmosphere of the International Labour Office, free from the trappings of diplomacy and international politics, lies a greater hope for world peace and harmony than rested in the even more august sections of the League Assembly. Therefore, I am pleased that this Government is following the precedent established by its predecessor of continuing Australia##'##s membership of the International Labour Office.
                    </para>
                    <para>I am even more gratified that the Government has seen fit to delegate one of its senior Ministers to attend the forthcoming conference of the International Labour Office. Too often have we seen, when these conferences have been pending, the tendency to send a clerk from the High Commissioner##'##s Office in London to represent Australia at Geneva. True it is that there has always been serious competition for election as the workers##'## representative at those conferences, because, strangely enough, the conditions attaching to the appointment of a workers##'## representative have always been made attractive. Apart from the payment of expenses associated with the journey, the representative was reimbursed for loss 6f wages during his absence from Australia. I have no complaint of that. It is the only way in which we can ensure that the voice of the workers shall be properly heard at those conferences. I am in agreement with it. But whilst we make that provision in selecting a workers##'## representative, we ought not to be content to ask, when considering the appointment of an employers##'## representative, ##"## Who is likely to be roaming around Europe when this conference takes place, and who will find it most convenient to drop across to Geneva for a week or so?##"## I congratulate the Government on having appointed one of its senior Ministers to represent Australia at the forthcoming conference of the International Labour Office.

                    <para>Having thus testified to its confidence in the International Labour Office, the Government should treat the conventions of that body with equal respect. For many years the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has been a severe critic of Australian governments for what he claims was their failure to ratify some of the conventions adopted by the International Labour Office. In his capacity as a justice of the High Court in 1936, he pronounced judgment that the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the limitations of the Constitution, was competent to enter into international conventions, and the act of doing so endowed the Commonwealth with power to legislate on those subjects, even though the Constitution did not give to it that specific power. I refer particularly to the case in which the Commonwealth Government instituted proceedings against Goya Henry, an aviator, for a breach of the Air Convention. A portion of the judgment of Justices Evatt and McTiernan, constituting a part of the majority decision of the High Court in this case, read - </para>

                            <para>- I have already explained that. The view was that the Commonwealth was restricted to the power of recommendation to the States. That was the intimation which I was instructed to convey to the conference in 1935. A year later, the High Court pronounced against that view and its decision is now the law of the land. One of the judges who made that very definite recommendation is the Attorney-General of the Curtin Government. Therefore, it might not be inappropriate if we ask the Government to implement several of the conventions which are not altogether irrelevant to the bill. </para>

                            <para>- 1 introduced the 40-hour working week in my own commercial activities without waiting for the Government to act. In. 1927 the International Labour Conference adopted a convention relating to sickness insurance, and the recommendation was that all member States co-operating in that convention should introduce systems of contributory insurance against loss of wages due to illness. The voting on that occasion was 97 for and 9 against. The Commonwealth Government representative, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, then High Commissioner in the United Kingdom, and the workers##'## representative, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Culley,</inline> of Tasmania, a former member of this House, both voted in flavour of the convention. In the light of the judgment I have cited, and the opinion expressed by the present Attorney-General, it is not unfair to suggest that the Government should have adopted the principle of contributory sickness and unemployment insurance, for those authorities declare that it is competent to do so. The voting of government representatives in favour of conventions surely implies responsibility to give effect to them. </para>

                        STEWART.That is not true. The judgment I cited was apposite to my argument. In 1934 the International Labour Conference adopted another convention recommending that the principle of compulsory contributory unemployment insurance should be adopted. The voting on that occasion was 84 for and 8 against. The Commonwealth representative at that conference,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline>
                        McLaren, then official secretary to the High Commissioner in the United Kingdom, and the workers##'## representative,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline>
                        W. Roche, of the Australian Federated Storemen and Packers##'## Union, both voted in the affirmative. I do not forget that the Prime Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline>
                        has been a delegate to one of those conferences, and so have the Minister for Labour and National Service
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline>
                        and . the Minister for Supply and Shipping

                        If the Government has such great respect for the findings of international labour con ferences I suggest that it should consider whether or not it is bound to give effect to a contributory insurance scheme in preference to a scheme based upon  Treasury finance. World-wide experience is at the disposal of the International Labour Office. It cannot be suggested that these conferences would seek to exploit, in any way, the workers of the world. In fact, I know of no conferences which consider the views of the workers so carefully, and which are less tolerant of the exploitation of the working classes. The conferences that have considered this subject realize that the giving to the workers of a vested interest in these schemes by means of their contributions, is the only chance of ensuring security for them. As such schemes were in force in Great Britain before the##'## international labour conferences declared in favour of them, I propose to make a few comparisons which will reveal the security of the British workers under their schemes. I was surprised to hear the honorable member for Bass
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline>
                        say last night that the British scheme of contributory unemployment benefit had broken down. He said that the British Government had found it necessary to provide ##£##110,000,000 from the Treasury to enable the scheme to be maintained. Although such an amount may have been provided, it is fallacious to say that the scheme has broken down. When the depression occurred in Great Britain, the scheme had surplus funds amounting to ##£##22,000,000. The fund would have continued to accumulate surpluses if the Government had not called upon the scheme to accept obligations which were never contemplated in the actuarial calculations on which it was based. In effect, the Government said to the management of the scheme, ##"## Use up your ##£##22,000,000, and when it is gone come to us and we -will give you some more ##"##. In other words, the Government used the scheme as a vehicle for disbursing unemployment relief on a basis that was never contemplated when the fund was established. No inherent weakness was revealed in the basis of the fund.

                    <para>We have already been informed during this debate of the very insecure foundations of certain social security schemes of the past, but some of the details are so telling that they will bear repetition. I point out that when this scheme iB agreed to, the total financial commitments of the Commonwealth Treasury in relation to our social services will be actually greater than the total of our annual Consolidated Revenue in the pre-war period. The workers of this country may well consider that circumstance. They have been promised freedom from fear and want, but measures such as the one before us are not likely to provide it for them. In Great Britain the unemployment insurance scheme is  amassing  funds at the rate of more than ##£##70,000,000 a year. </para>

                            <para>- The funds are standing to the credit of potential beneficiaries. An official document that has been issued by the British Ministry of Labour states that for the thirteen weeks ended the 25th Septem##'##ber, 1943, the total income of the unemployment insurance fund was ##£##19,900,000, but the total outgoings, in the same period, were only ##£##621,000 in benefits and ##£##600,000 in administrative costs, making the total outgoings less than ##£##1,250,000, although the income was nearly ##£##20,000,000. Contrast that position with the state of affairs that is likely to arise under this bill. The Government##'##s plans are entirely dependent upon the competency of the Commonwealth Treasury to provide, year by year, the money needed to maintain the fund in a solvent condition. Some honorable members seem to be complacently, blissfully and innocently confident that under the terms of the measure passed by this Parliament last year, providing that an ##'##amount of ##£##30,000,000, or one-quarter of the total revenue from income tax on personal exertion, shall be devoted to social welfare purposes, everything will be all right and that practically any calls may be made upon the fund. I remind such honorable gentlemen that we do not need to delve far into the history of this country to discover that legislative measures which have provided for payments from Treasury funds to meet social service commitments have not been at all satisfactory, because events have proved that Treasury finance has been inadequate for the purposes. We have the classic example of the serious reduction that had to be made in invalid and old-age pensions and similar social services in 1931 because of the inability of the Commonwealth Treasury to find money to maintain payments at the then existing rates. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J##"##.</inline> T. Lang was Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales, he found it impossible at one stage to continue to pay subventions which had enabled certain friendly societies to meet their obligations to aged members. The friendly societies decided, there and then, that they would no longer depend upon Treasury funds to meet their needs. They increased their rates of contribution so that they would be able to meet their obligations to their members who reached the age of 65 years. </para>

                    <para>They found the method of Treasury finance quite unreliable. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bertram</inline> Stevens was Treasurer of New South Wales he found it necessary to repeal certain legislative provisions for Treasury contributions to the Public Service Superannuation Fund. The present Treasurer of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKell,</inline> is having a severe fight with the public service organizations of that State at present over that fund, and millions of pounds is involved. These instances show how unstable any social security service must be which is dependent upon Treasury finance. It was said during the debate last evening that this is really a contributory scheme, because the workers, who are the potential beneficiaries, are required to pay income tax from which the funds for the scheme may be drawn. </para>

                            <para>- J am glad to have the Minister##'##s endorsement ofl the argument that was used last night, but I do not admit its validity. I do not agree that any scheme can be truthfully called contributory if not all of the potential beneficiaries shall contribute and not all of the contributors may become beneficiaries. However, for the sake of a few comparisons, I shall assume, for the moment, that this may be described as a contributory scheme. The Treasurer, in February of last year, introduced a measure which provided for substantial increases of the rates and range of income taxation. In justifying the application of the taxes to incomes in the lower ranges he declared that the incursion into this field of income tax was being made not for war purposes, but for the specific purpose of providing social services. Presumably the measure before us is a sequel to the honorable gentleman##'##s statements on that occasion. Let. us, however, consider the benefits that are inherent in some other forms of contributory insurance and also in the Beveridge plan. Documents which the Treasurer distributed with his financial proposals in February, 1943, when the new income tax was introduced, reveal to me that the increase of the income tax required from a single man without dependants on ##£##150 a year was not less than 4s. a week. A man with a salary of ##£##200 a year was asked to pay an additional 5s. 8d. a week. A man on ##£##5 a week - in the basic wage range - was asked to pay an extra 6s. 9d. a week. On an income of ##£##300 u year the additional amount was 9s. a week; on ##£##350 a year it was 12s. a week; and on ##£##400 a year it was 14s. Sd. a week. What social security benefits have been provided in return for those contributions? These are: A funeral benefit fund for old-age pensioners; liberalization of the mater.nity benefit - which would not be of much use to single mcn without dependants - and unemployment and sickness benefits, but only for those whose income is less than ##£##1 a week,- above which the benefits ##'####'##ave to bc correspondingly reduced. </para>

                    <para>Let, us consider what could be done under a full-blooded scheme of contributory insurance. I refer again to the Beveridge plan. I hope that honorable members will take a note ##"##of the solidity and reality of the social security inherent in a scheme of that kind, and compare it with the lack of security in a measure such as that which we are now discussing. First, while the figures in relation to increase of income tax, or the social security contributions, are fresh in mind, let us consider the contributions which, under the Beveridge plan, it was proposed should be exacted from potential beneficiaries. The weekly contributions would be the same from everybody; there would bc no discrimination; all would pay and receive the same. That is a good policy in any social security plan* If the Beveridge plan were brought into operation, the weekly contribution would be 4s. 3d. I have pointed  out that in  Australia, under  the legislation  that  waa passed last year, even a man on ##£##150 a year is to-day paying 4s. a week more ti) an lie paid previously. </para>

I desire a comparison to be made between the catalogue of benefits under it, and that which I read a few minutes ago. A man with a wife would receive ##£##2 a week in respect of unemployment, sickness, and training benefit. The training benefit would apply when a man was unfit for work of one type and was trained for work of another type; during the training lie would be entitled to ##£##2 a week for himself and his wife.

                    <para>Having dealt with general principles, let us study some of the specific provisions of this measure. Just now, I was challenged by the Minister when I said that a person of 67 years of age who remained in industry would be compelled to make the contributions provided,but, by reason of his age, would be disentitled to participate in the benefits. I, in turn, challenge the honorable gentleman to controvert my statement. In fact I shall cite a concrete instance in support of it. A man of my acquaintance who is 67 years of age has not retired, for the reason that he cannot qualify for an old-age pension, not yet having satisfied the twenty years residential qualification. That applies to many thousands of workers in Australia, who, to-day, by reason of the war effort, have been recalled into industry. This man is a British subject, and has been resident in Australia for approximately eighteen years. As he cannot qualify for the old age pension, he is compelled to remain in industry. He is required to contribute to the social security scheme, although not entitled to participate in any of its benefits. But an alien who arrived in this country twelve months ago, whether he was 26 years, 36 years, or 46 years of age, or any other age under 65 years, would immediately be qualified to obtain all the benefits. The Minister might examine that position in committee. A more extraordinary provision is that which effects sex discrimination. I have always understood that honorable members opposite were great sticklers for the elimination of all sex discrimination. I recall very heated exchanges in this chamber during the passage of the Women##'##s Employment Board Bill, which was designed to remove the existing discrimination between male and female workers. Yet clause18 of this measure makes the following provision :  - </para>

I presume that the object of the provision is to place the ordinary housewife outside the scope of this legislation. I have no particular objection to that. <inline font-style="italic">##[##Extension of time granted.##]##</inline> But provision is already made in the income stipulation. Under this proposed legislation a married woman employed in a cannery - and 2,000 women were dragooned into canneries recently - would not be entitled to draw benefits if she were injured, although she had been contributing week by week throughout the period of her employment. An even more extraordinary provision is to be found in clause 28, which reads - </para>

I have a great deal of sympathy with the Minister and the officers who are charged with the responsibility of formulating a scheme of unemployment benefits for seasonal workers. I have had t.00 much to do with the problem not to appreciate its inherent difficulties, but the Government has not solved the problem by requiring the Director-General to investigate the domestic accounts of thousands of seasonal workers. It would be a physical impossibility for him to do so. In any case, why should the accounts of the seasonal worker be investigated when it is not proposed to do this in respect of the miner or the wharf labourer, or any other kind of worker who also might be idle for three mouths of the year? </para>
                    <para>For the reasons I have given, I cannot support the bill in its present form. I shall vote for the amendment in the hope that the ground may he cleared for the introduction of a scheme of social security which will more nearly approximate the Beveridge plan. The question may be asked : Why not take this scheme now as something to go on with ? I know the difficulty of trying to inaugurate a contributory pensions scheme after a noncontributory one has been in operation for years. Therefore,##"## I prefer to wait until we can formulate a really dependable and comprehensive scheme of social security which will be financed from a fund to which every potential beneficiary will contribute, and from which every such contributor may, in due course, draw benefits. </para>

However, the scheme was pigeon-holed ##'##because the Government said that it could not find an amount of ##£##2,000,000 which was needed to put it into effect. Even in its earlier stages, the present scheme will probably cost a great deal more than the estimated cost of the one introduced by the previous Government. The present scheme may ##'##cost between ##£##15,000,000 and ##£##20,000,000 a year, and the Government has made provision for financing it in the National Welfare Act.

It represents a. further instalment of the Government##'##s plan to afford social security to all who are in need. The rates of benefit provided in the bill are identical for both unemployment and sickness. The scheme includes all females between- the ages of 16 and 60 years, and males between the ages of 16 and 65 years, who have resided in Australia for at least twelve months immediately prior to application and who are not qualified to receive a service pension, or an invalid, ##©##Id-age or widow##'##s pension. To obtain unemployment relief a person, in addition, must, be available for, and willing to work. For sickness- benefit the claimant must produce a doctor##'##s certificate, and demonstrate that he has suffered loss of earnings up to the amount of the benefit he obtains. The rates of benefit provided for both schemes are as follows: - </para>

It is estimated that the annual cost of the sickness benefit, based on a 4 per cent, absence due to sickness, and after allowing for the waiting period and the means test, will be about ##£##8,500,000. </para>
                    <para>I support the measure as a first step towards the provision of full social security for all the people. I should have liked to see the benefits even greater, but I realize that the Government has to meet heavy expenditure arising out of the war. I look forward to the time when a full living allowance will be paid to every ##"##unemployed person. The Government is pledged to a policy of jobs for all after the war. If it fails in this, it should provide a full living allowance for those out of work. We are pledged, also, to give effect to the Atlantic Charter, which provides for freedom from want and freedom from fear. There is no greater fear in the minds of a great many people than the fear of sickness, unemployment, and poverty. It is the desire of the Labour Government to ensure that fear shall he eradicated. One way in which we may ensure that is by ensuring full employment for every person willing and able to work. ##"## Jobs for all ##"##, the slogan on which this party was elected to power by an overwhelming majority of the .people, should be our slogan for all time. The right honorable Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has moved an amendment which, if carried, would, as it were, place this bill in the discard in favour of some contributory scheme. Coming from the. right honorable gentleman, who was Attorney-General in the Administration which passed through both Houses of this Parliament the never-proclaimed national insurance legislation, and who gallantly resigned from the ministry in protest against the failure to proclaim that legislation, the amendment is peculiar, because, by the turn of the political wheel, the right honorable gentleman himself became Prime Minister and had years in which to bring that legislation into practical effect. It ill becomes him now to try to force this measure into the discard in order that there may be brought down a measure similar to that which he could have brought into being: The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> is strongly in favour of a contributory scheme along the lines of the British scheme. He pointed out thai under the British scheme great funds are amassing from contributions by the workers. I direct the attention of the honorable member to the fact that that money is only a book entry and has been reinvested in war loans. The people will have to be taxed in order to reimburse the funds in which between ##£##300,000,000 and ##£##400,000,000 has accumulated, From one fund of ##£##20,000,000 the contributors have received only ##£##1,000,000 per annum. I do not see the difference between the British scheme and the National Welfare Fund scheme. The workers are taxed to provide the money in the National Welfare Fund and very little of the fund has been used for the purposes for which it was raised. The money, like the money in the British funds, is being invested in war loans and, of course, the people will have to be taxed to reimburse the fund. To that extent the scheme is contributory. </para>
                    <para>I should have preferred that there were no means test in relation to sickness benefit. All taxpayers will be contributing to the fund. Even middle-class people who are being taxed very heavily cannot afford to pay for private medical attention and hospital treatment as they could in the past. Unemployment benefit is different and there should be some means test to qualify for it. I should have liked to see the administration of the sickness benefit scheme in the hands of the friendly society movement, which has developed ro great proportions in this country. The friendly societies have all the experience and all the facilities needed to administer and police this scheme, and it would be better to employ their services i ban to set up another huge administration and add to the bureaucracy. That is the manner in which the British Government administers its scheme, lt would also have been much more appropriate if the Government had not limited to ##£##1 the amount, which recipients of sickness benefit may receive from friendly societies  without it. being taken into consideration as income under the means test. Seeing that the members of friendly societies have to make their contributions to those societies as well as to the National Welfare Fund. I should say that at least they should be entitled to draw their full benefit from both. That would be##'## an encouragement to the thrifty section of the community. If the Government decided to use the friendly societies to ad minister this scheme, I think that it could be administered much more cheaply than will otherwise be the case. Friendly societies, owing to the fact that their operations are restricted because of actuarial limitations on the risks they may take, would need to be subsidized or indemnified against the additional risks that they would have to take in carrying out ibis legislation. Nothing should be done to whittle down the friendly societies as, unfortunately, they have been whittled down in New Zealand since the introduction of social security. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Manchester Unity Journal of</inline> -Ve?/; <inline font-style="italic">South Wales</inline> of the 1st July. 1943, the <inline font-style="italic">New Zealand Official Year Book</inline> of 1942 shows that since the introduction of the Social Security Act of 193S the number of lodge members has dwindled. Total membership in 193S was 113,709. compared with 1.09,S59 in 1939. and 104,446 in 1940. In order to show that the decline in membership of friendly societies in New Zealand has not been due to war conditions, I cite the fact that, during the -war, membership of friendly societies in Australia has steadily increased, as is shown by the following table:- </para>

                    <para>The friendly societies sprang up in Great Britain to deal with the health of the people as did Starr Bowkett societies to deal with housing. Under the capitalist system industry had given little consideration to either the health or the housing of the workers with the result that the workers, in order to protect themselves, created both movements. Both have reached high standards of efficiency, and it would be a tragedy if anything were done under this legislation to whittle down the activities of the friendly societies; but there is a real danger that they will be whittled down, as they have been in New Zealand, unless they are protected. The protection I suggest is the placing of the administration of the sickness benefit scheme in their hands. The manner in which Starr Bowkett societies in New South Wales were indemnified by the Government of New South Wales against the added risk that was imposed on them by the Government in order to carry out a home purchase scheme provides a good example of the way in which friendly societies could be indemnified by this Government against added risk that would be imposed on them if they administered this legislation. The Starr Bowkett societies were guaranteed an indemnification amounting to ##£##20,000,000 for the additional risk that they ran, but they were so sound that the State Government has not been called upon to pay one penny in indemnification. </para>
                    <para>Regarding medical services, I hope that the Government will, take into consideration the employment of salaried medical officers to issue certificates. </para>

                            <para>- The bill provides that the Director-General may call for a certificate from a particular medical officer. I envisage the utilization of the services of the medical officers of friendly societies, or government medical officers. The care of the people##'##s health should not be left to private enterprise. The medical profession should not have to fear economic insecurity, or rely upon private gain. In friendly societies, medical officers would have no incentive to grant medical certificates without justification, because they would receive no additional remuneration for it. They would be paid an over-all fee for their services. If we encourage a system of private profit in the care of the people##'##s health, abuses may arise. Fortunately, the medical profession in Australia is on a high plane, although some abuses have been exposed in the past. People have been given purposely wrong advice, and operations have been per formed unnecessarily. In one celebrated case, a doctor advised many patients that they were suffering from tuberculosis, and subjected them to expensive courses of treatment. If we do not give careful consideration to this aspect, abuses may creep in. Even at the present time, some workers who absent themselves from their employment for a few days manage to get a medical certificate declaring that they were ill. If a medical practitioner has no incentive to grant a certificate without justification, abuses will not arise. </para>

                    <para>In the policing of unemployment schemes, the Government should utilize the officers of the Department of Labour and National Service, because they have records showing whether a person is able and willing to accept employment. I urge the Government, in dealing with sickness, to give earnest consideration to the preventive side. After all, this bill deals merely with effects, and does not treat causes.  Much  of the sickness, or so called sickness, in the community is avoidable. Often sickness is caused by our way of living. Whilst I shall not moralize on that view, I point out that our method of living under modern conditions tends unnecessarily to undermine health. The Department of Information should launch a campaign to educate the people to safeguard their health, and improve their way of living. The advertising columns of newspapers are utilized extensively by the vendors of patent medicines, but counterpropaganda is not published. A few days ago the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> announced that many patent medicines are fraudulent, but the vendors are extracting from the people colossal amounts of money. Surely, some way can be found to counteract those advertisements! For example, the public could be informed, through the newspapers and by broadcasting stations, about the advantages of a balanced diet and proper nutrition. People should be encouraged to promote their physical fitness, and should be educated in such matters as infant health, maternal welfare, dental and medical care, and proper housing conditions. The time will come when the Government must take its courage in its hands and deal with national health generally on a broad basis. Ill-health leads to great suffering. Without good health, one loses much of what is worthwhile in life. </para>
                    <para>The Government, when introducing a medical scheme, should utilize the services of young doctors who are now performing wonderful work in the Army, the Navy, and the Royal Australian Air Force. They are anxious to be given an opportunity, on their return to civil life, to devote their services entirely to the interests of society. The medical profession should be guaranteed economic security. Many doctors have financial worries, and their health is suffering because their services are at the disposal of their patients for  24  hours a day. Under a national health scheme they would be paid a salary commensurate with their training, knowledge and experience. They would have time for leisure and research. At present, many medical men realize that a good deal of the medical science which they apply to-day, is out of date. If they had economic security, they would be able to devote themselves to research and keep abreast of new developments. Sister Kenny had to go abroad before her method for the treatment of infantile paralysis was recognized. If the medical profession were subsidized in the correct manner, new discoveries in medical science would be properly investigated and the benefits would be made available to our people. The derivation of the term ##"## doctor ##"## is ##"## teacher ##"##. The real function of the doctor is to teach the rest of the community how to preserve their health. With proper education, many people could retain their health. The salaries paid to doctors under a national health scheme should not be skimped and the doctors should be given facilities to go abroad and study. The Chinese have a system under which a doctor is paid on the basis of the number of people he keeps in good health. Under the system operating in Australia, a doctor##'##s living depends upon the amount of sickness in the community. I should not like to see develop in Australia what has happened in other parts of the world under the system of private enterprise in the medical profession. Honorable members will be interested in the following news item from the United States of America a few days ago:- </para>

I regret that the Government is foisting a dole under the cloak of unemployment and sickness insurance upon the unfortunate people of Australia. Surely, during the depression, the people had sufficient experience of the dole! Why does the Government desire to make them repeat that experience? Let us  examine the method that the Government has adopted to finance this proposal. Whilst I agree, in principle, that something must be done for unemployed persons, the method which the Government has chosen to finance the scheme leaves much to be desired. The world is not without experience of this matter. A contributory scheme for unemployment and sickness insurance is the only means of preserving a man##'##s self-respect and dignity. Great Britain has a contributory system of insurance which provides a model for the guidance of any government of a dominion. New Zealand, also, has a contributory form of insurance which does not compare favorably with the British system, but is much better than the method that the Government has adopted </para>

Honorable members will recollect that when the present heavy income tax rates were imposed in 1943 the Treasurer furnished us with a table setting out the rates payable under the tax legislation then in force and the proposed new rates, and told us that the new taxes were intended to make provision for social services. I direct attention to the following table which sets out the weekly increase of the amount of income tax that people were called upon to pay at that time :  - </para>

In my opinion the English scheme is infinitely more generous. We should bear in mind, too, that the Beveridge plan has been definitely proposed for adoption in Great Britain.

The Beveridge plan, however, is much more generous in the scale and range of benefits than is the plan provided in this bill. Even when we add to the benefits now being proposed the benefits that are prescribed in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Bill, which will shortly come before us, the comparison is highly favorable to the Beveridge plan. For a payment of 14s.8d. a week in Australia we are told that our invalid and old-age pensioners will bp granted some additional sickness benefits. It is argued, too, that the liberalizing of the maternity##'## allowance is part and parcel of this scheme. Surely honorable gentlemen opposite do not contend that an increase of the maternity allowance will be of any particular benefit to unemployed persons. The unemployment and sickness benefit will apply to persons whose income does not exceed 20s. a week. Those benefits are not to be compared with the benefits being provided under the Beveridge scheme in Great Britain. Yet they will cost our people three times as much as the benefits under the Beveridge scheme. </para></talk.start><para>Even if we concede the point, which we do not, that this is a contributory scheme, it is not nearly so generous to our people as are- contributory schemes in operation in other parts of the world. I bring to the notice of honorable members the following remarks which appear in paragraph 21 of the Beveridge report :- </para><quote><para>The first view is, that benefit in return for contributions, rather than free allowances from the State, is what the .people of Britain desire. </para></quote><para class="block">Unfortunately this Government is applying a policy which will have the effect of breaking down the spirit of independence in our people, and of ruining personal prestige. That must be the result of the handing out of largess and charity. Our people do not want charity; they are entitled to receive their social service benefits as a right and not as a charity. That they desire to preserve their free and independent spirit has been proved conclusively by a recent gallup poll which indicated that by far the majority of Australian people favour a contributory form, of unemployment and sickness insurance. The provision of a dole system may result in the disappearance of the last vestige of independence of spirit in the working men of Australia. Paragraph 21 of the Beveridge report continues - </para><quote><para>This desire is shown both by the established popularity of compulsory insurance, and by the phenomenal growth of voluntary insurance against sickness, against death and for endowment, and most recently for hospital treatment. It is shown in another way by the strength of popular objection to any kind of means test. </para></quote><para class="block">Unfortunately, the scheme set out in this bill will perpetuate the means test, which is a most objectionable feature of our social service legislation. We should abandon that principle in relation to social service legislation. T commend that remark to honorable members opposite who, on many occasions in this chamber, have condemned the application of the means test to the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. We certainly should not permit that, principle to find a place in any new social security measures that we pass. </para><para>I ask honorable members opposite to consider the advantages of the social service plan that has been applied in New Zealand. The Curtin Government has recently concluded a treaty with the Eraser Labour Government of New Zealand in relation to matters of high political moment and of international importance, yet it is not prepared to cooperate with the Government of the sister dominion in relation to employment and unemployment although, obviously, that is a matter on which there should be the closest collaboration among members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. It appears that this Government is more concerned about gaining a little political kudos, and greater franchise support, from the people than it is about applying a really effective social ##'## security programme. The social security measures of New Zealand are based on a registration fee of ##£##1 a year from each male person over the age of 20 years, 5s. a year from male juveniles between the ages of 16 and 20 years, and 5s. a year for all females over the age of 16 years. Tho New Zealand scheme tends to develop a spirit of independence in the people but that cannot be  claimed  for this scheme. In New Zealand a specific tax##"## of 2s. 6d. in the ##£##1 is made on all salaries and wages and the proceeds are devoted to social security measures. The funds in New Zealand are gathering strength and the New Zealand Government is receiving substantial benefit from them. But under the scheme of this bill the Commonwealth Government will be drawing, at all times, upon public funds. The first draft of ##£##30,000,000 has already been made. It is estimated that the social security measures in New Zealand will cost ##£##15,700,000 next ##'## year, of which only ##£##4,100,000 will come from general revenue. That is a substantial pool upon which to draw. The Government expects this scheme to cost ##£##2,000,000 for every 1 per cent, of unemployment, plus ##£##8,500,000 for sickness benefits. It was designed to meet the possibility of a further depression. The Ministry claims that, having learned the lesson taught by the previous depression, when unemployment was at a very high level, they are devising means of avoiding the hardship that was then caused. No Government could avoid a similar depression, because it was worldwide. Therefore, legislation must be enacted to make provision against it. In 1933, the percentage of unemployment was 25.8. If another depression were to occur in Australia, and the percentage were again to reach that level, the cost to the Government under this scheme, on the figures which it has supplied, would, he not less than ##£##50,000,000. In days of peace, we can look to the percentage of unemployment fluctuating. However, I accept the average of 9.5 per cent. which has been stated. That includes all seasonal unemployment, which represents approximately 4 per cent. of the total in any year. On that basis, the cost of providing the proposed benefits would be approximately ##£##20,000,000. In addition, certain social services will continue to operate. The approximate annual costs will be : Invalid and old-age pensions, ##£##23,250,000; widows##'## pensions, ##£##2,250,000; child endowment, ##£##12,500,000 ; maternity allowance, ##£##2,250,000; funeral benefit for old-age pensioners, ##£##250,000; pensions for returned soldiers of the last war, ##£##10,000,000; free medicine, ##£##3,000,000; and administrative expenses, ##£##350,000.Repatriation benefits and pensions for soldiers of the present war will impose a much greater liability on the Government than has been imposed under those heads since the last war. Conservatively, one might estimate the cost to be ##£##10,000,000. That would make the grand total ##£##63,620,000; and, with the addition of ##£##20,000,000 in respect of unemployment, it would be ##£##83,620,000. It is obvious that the old-age pension will be increased markedly in the years to come, because of the increasing number of persons in the upper ages. The Treasury expects to receive ##£##91,000,000 for the year ending the 30th June, 1944, from tax on incomes over ##£##400 a year. The States will have allocated to them 20 per cent. of that amount, in return for their having vacated the field of income tax. Therefore, even at the present high rate of taxation, the Government will have a deficiency of ##£##10,000,000 after discharg ing its liability in respect of social services. The promise has been made that taxation will not be maintained at the present level after the war. If I know anything of the Government##'##s industrial supporters, they will want taxation to be removed from incomes under ##£##400. If such a demand were granted, the tax on incomes above ##£##400 a year would have to be increased, or the Government would have to resort once again to the use of bank credit; and taxpayers would receive only the miserly benefits provided in the bill in return for the contribution of 14s. 8d. a week. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2368</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZO</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">COLES, Arthur</name><name role="display">Mr Coles</name></talker><para>- It cannot be miserly if the cost of all social services is to he ##£##83,620,000. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2368</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KNX</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HARRISON, Eric</name><name role="display">Mr HARRISON</name></talker><para>- They are miserly in this bill in comparison with the benefits proposed under a contributory scheme in England, for the payment of 4s. 3d. a week. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2368</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZO</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">COLES, Arthur</name><name role="display">Mr Coles</name></talker><para>- The honorable gentleman means that they could be provided more cheaply ? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2368</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KNX</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HARRISON, Eric</name><name role="display">Mr HARRISON</name></talker><para>- Definitely.

Then why provide for the dole of 25s. a week for the unemployed? The prospect for a soldier who returns from the war after having fought for the maintenance of decency and freedom, is a gloomy one; he will receive a rude shock when he learns of the provision for a dole of 25s. a week, instead of the elimination of unemployment. The Government argues that these men will be fully employed, and that consequently there will be no need to grant preference to them in employment. Yet, at the same time, it says, ##"##We will have a bit on the side; we will make provision for a dole of 25s. a week in case we cannot provide all the work that will he needed ##"##. The passage of this legislation must warn the soldier that he will not return to the conditions that he is fighting to establish. But that is not the whole story. Honorable members opposite objected when I described the unemployment benefit as a charity. If it be not a charity, then it must be a right. Why, then, subject to a means test an applicant for it? Why employ Gestapo tactics in order to effect the disclosure of domestic details? Obviously, it is not to be a right; because, if it were, a means test would not be applied. </para></talk.start></continue><para>There is an important omission from the bill, in consequence of which returned soldiers will be vitally affected, and I ask the Minister to give consideration to the matter in order to avoid injustice. The definition of ##"##income##"## does not contain any reference to soldier pensioners, other than in connexion with special or service pensions. The men who receive service pensions, being unemployable, obviously will come under this scheme. But a soldiers##'## pension is also paid on account of disability. I have always been under the impression that the pensions of soldiers are sacrosanct. Honorable members know that they are not regarded as income for purposes of taxation, and that they cannot be gar.nisheed. Yet, under this bill, they are to be regarded as income, and the amount received will determine what payment will be made to a soldier who is unemployed. The soldier offers his life and, if he does not make the supreme sacrifice, may become mutilated in defence of this country and all its interests. That is not -recognized by the bill. This is characteristic of the approach which the Government makes to returned soldiers in all the legislation that it introduces. I hope that the Minister will make amends in that regard. If not, I shall move an amendment designed to give to returned soldiers the benefits of this legislation. The definition of income does not exclude a soldier##'##s pension. But it does exclude maternity allowances and child endowment payments. I have no fault to find with that. I suppose they are excluded because the Government believes that the wife and mother has done her duty to her country. Again, the definition excludes payments received as compensation for incapacity. The Government recognizes that money paid in the form of compensation is not to be regarded as income. Surely, however, the pension paid to a disabled soldier is compensation for his injury, so why should that not also be excluded from the definition of income? The man who stayed at home and earned high wages may, if he is thrifty, invest his earnings, and draw an income from his investments of, say, ##£##1 a week. Here, I ask honorable members to compare the wages earned by. the men who stay at home with the 8s. 6d. a day paid to soldiers, who are offering their lives to preserve the freedom and jobs of those who remained behind. Thus, the man who did not go to the war, but remained here and earned a huge income, may, under the bill, draw ##£##1 a week from his investment, and ##£##1 5s. a week compensation. The disabled soldier will be at a disadvantage compared with others after the war, because it is evident that the Government does not intend to give preference to returned soldiers. The Government##'##s proclaimed policy is jobs for all. The disabled soldier, who draws a pension of ##£##1 5s. a week, will have that amount regarded as income for the purposes of this bill, and 14s. a week will be deducted from his unemployment benefit, leaving him with lis. benefit only, or a total of ##£##1 16s., as compared with an income of ##£##2 5s. a week allowed to the man who stays at home. Surely that was not intended by the Government. Surely the man who has fought for his country and suffered mutilation should not be penalized in this way. A disabled soldier##'##s pension is not income. It cannot be garnisheed. Why should it be regarded as income for the purposes of this scheme? If the benefit of this provision were extended to the returned soldier, his total income would be only ##£##2 10s. a week as compared with ##£##2 5s. for the man who stayed at home. I should like honorable members opposite to deal with this aspect when they speak, but I am afraid that they will be silent. Already, the subject has, of course, been discussed in caucus, and the Government##'##s brutal majority has decided not to give any consideration to returned soldiers. If honorable members opposite do not feel that way about it, then let them stand in their places and say a word for the men who have- made it possible for them to enjoy the privileges at their disposal. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2370</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JVJ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MULCAHY, Daniel</name><name role="display">Mr Mulcahy</name></talker><para>- They also made it possible for the honorable member to enjoy his privileges. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2370</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KNX</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HARRISON, Eric</name><name role="display">Mr HARRISON</name></talker><para>- I recognize that, but I remind the honorable member that I served in a previous war, and I also served in an honorary capacity in this war.

It is part of their make-up to look forward to another period of mass unemployment in this country, and it ill becomes the. honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> to say that we are proposing to give the people the dole. I was unfortunate enough at one time to live in  the honorable member##'##s constituency where I saw people evicted from their homes and forced to live on the dole, with the honorable member doing very little about it. The dole then amounted to a few shillings, whereas the provision to be made for the unemployed under this measure will amount to pounds a week when family allowances are taken into consideration. In view of the honorable member##'##s criticism of the amount of benefit provided under this measure, it is well that I should remind him that when the Commonwealth was being administered in 1940 by a government of which he was a supporter and when there were still tens of thousands of Australians unemployed, a man with a wife and two children was receiving about ##£##1 7s., all-States average, in money and/or groceries by way of relief. If he were given relief work he was paid award rates in some instances, less in others. Depending on the State in which he lived, he might also have received firewood, some help in regard to housing, and some clothes for himself or his family. Queenslanders alone enjoyed unemployment insurance. Considerable variations in the lot of the unemployed from State to State were thus apparent. That  Li  an indication of what the Opposition has to offer the unemployed. The allowance provided in this measure of 25s. a week for an unemployed man is a big improvement on anything  that  the Opposition has offered or over would  offer.  -But I do not believe that people will have to live permanently on an unemployment allowance. I have enough confidence in the Government and the Labour party to believe that we, like the Labour Government of New Zealand, can organize the country against mass unemployment. The foundation of full-time employment is being laid by the Department of Postwar Reconstruction in the national plans that it is devising. Nevertheless, there may be a few people here and there who will be unemployed for short periods while changing occupations, and there will be others who ##'##will be temporarily laid aside by sickness. This measure contains provisions whereby they will be looked after. That is the very reason for the introduction of this bill. It is not designed to provide a full living allowance for all time so that people shall be deprived of the incentive to work. I, therefore, submit that the Opposition has built up its case on false premises in thinking that there will be mass unemployment after the war. The experience of other countries has proved that, far from costing millions of pounds more than the estimate, schemes of this kind cost very much below the amounts allowed for. ##'## The New Zealand Social Security Act came into force in December, 1939. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Next##'## Zealand Official Year-Book</inline> of 1943, the number of persons in receipt of unemployment relief were: - </para></talk.start><para class="block"><graphic href="178331194403305_24_4.jpg" /></para><para class="block">Payments for unemployed benefits decreased from ##£##434,497 in 1939-40 to ##£##138,528 in 1941-42. The progressive decline is a good answer to those who say that unemployment benefits will cost ##£##20,000,000 a year and that the scheme will break down of its own weight. New Zealand has a properly planned economy and works programme, and the people are provided with work at award rates. We can well learn from New Zealand and ensure  full-time  work for all. 1 am confident that we shall do that. I believe that the great masses of the people have the inalienable right to work and independence, and it is the duty of the Government to ensure that work shall be provided for them. The proper way in which to approach the problem is to ensure that there shall be no unemployment. A measure of this sort, however, is necessary to tide people over a few weeks should anything happen to break the continuity of their employment. </para><para>The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> ranks high among the financial brains of this country. In his capacity as Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, he has issued a booklet on social security and reconstruction, in which he deals with the method of finance employed in this scheme. I propose <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> read passages from that publi cation- for the education of honorable gentlemen opposite, because his arguments completely undermine theirs. He said - </para><quote><para>The advantages of financing social security from general revenue arc obvious. Insofar as general revenue is raised by means of direct taxation (income tax, estate duties, ##&amp;##c), the burden is being distributed in strict accordance with ability to bear it.

The Commonwealth Government##'##s National Welfare Scheme of social security is thus as financially sound as, and ever fairer than the best schemes based on the social insurance principle or the flat-rate social security tax.  The National Welfare Fund has been duly set up by Parliament and is as sacrosanct as the New Zealand Social Security Fund or the social security fund with which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Beveridge proposes to finance his plan. Every man and woman who pays direct or indirect taxes and contributes his or her labour to the nation##'##s well-being, as opportunity allows, has an indefensible right to the social security provisions of the National Welfare Scheme! Deprivations of those rights or whittling down of the terms of those provisions would be a breach of trust with the whole Australian nation. </para></quote><para class="block">That is a clear summary of the position. This scheme, far from being noncontributory, is more directly contributory than that suggested by the honorable member for Wentworth. I do not believe that the psychological effect on people of the belief that they are getting something for nothing, although, in reality, they are paying for it, is so very important. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2372</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>L0G</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RYAN, Rupert</name><name role="display">Mr Ryan</name></talker><para>- What are the honorable member##'##s views on the means test. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2372</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>6V4</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DALY, Fred</name><name role="display">Mr DALY</name></talker><para>- I believe the means test is desirable in some instances and not in others. Under this legislation there is to be practically no means test. In some directions the Government has done away with the means test. I intend to deal with that later. What I am concerned about now is the fact that, although members of the Opposition had professed agreement with the general principles of this bill, they are ##"##knocking##"## it, because their views as to the financing of the measure differ slightly from ours. The difference is not important because, when all the pros and cons are boiled down, our proposed methods and theirs amount to the same thing. Under their proposal, the contributions to the fund would be on a graduated scale. The contributions under this scheme are on a graduated scale. The only difference is that, whereas the Opposition would have the contributors make their contributions direct to a special fund, we obtain them through income tax. Work for all is the first consideration. Social security measures such as this bill are subordinate to that, but they are necessary to deal with special cases. A policy of full-time employment for all capable of work is necessary to promote the well-being, happiness and security of the people. It is interesting to note that the social security schemes in Canada, England, the United States of America, and New Zealand, arc based on a full-time employment programme. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I believe that this legislation will go n long way towards the establishment of a comprehensive scheme of health and other benefits. It is very liberal legislation ii:. that the time of benefit is unlimited. So long as a person is unemployed or ill he will be entitled to draw benefit. The provisions are also more liberal than any scheme of the kind that has previously existed. There are certain aspects of the matter with regard to friendly societies and permissible income which could be improved, but in no sense can this bill bo truthfully described as a dole. The provision of special benefit to a woman who looks after aged parents at home is a new departure and a considerable improvement. The scheme proposed by the Government compares favorably with unemployment and sickness benefit schemes in other countries. Even the Beveridge plan, of which we have heard so much in this chamber, has not been adopted by the British Government. There is no certainty that every recommendation in it will be given effect. Possibly some of them will be rejected by the British Government. Consequently, honorable members opposite should not regard the </para><para class="block">Beveridge plan as a gilt-edged scheme that has already been accepted and put into operation. </para><para>The scheme proposed by the Commonwealth Government compares favorably with the New Zealand system. In fact, the Commonwealth Government devised its scheme after having carefully studied the New Zealand plan. The benefits provided by the two are comparable, but honorable members should bear in mind the fact that contributions on a flat rate are applied to every one under the New Zealand scheme, and that is an unfair method of taxation, because it imposes a burden on those least able to bear it. </para><para>A person who receives an. allowance of ##£##1 a week from a friendly society, as a sickness benefit, will not be disqualified from receiving benefits provided by this legislation; but the average payment by friendly societies to sick members is about 2.1s. a week. Some friendly societies pay more than 21s. 6d. a week. The Minister should liberalize this allowance in  respect  of members of friendly societies. Probably friendly societies will have to expand in other directions in order to retain their membership and if they were allowed a little latitude it would help them to carry on the good work they have been performing for many years. I offer that suggestion to the Minister for consideration, and I hope that it will be given effect. </para><para>As this bill is a progressive step in the social legislation of Australia, I heard with regret the criticism which honorable members opposite levelled at the measure. Although anti-Labour governments had been in office for many years, they never introduced social benefits of this kind. Never have social benefits been so good as they will be when this bill becomes law. The Government will move with the times, and this legislation will be further liberalized in the future. Unfortunately, when legislation of this kind is introduced, some people immediately set out to knock it over. They pretend to discover all its weaknesses before it has been given a trial, and they roundly condemn it. This bill deserves a fair trial, and honorable members opposite should not attempt to undermine it. </para><para class="block">After it has operated for a time, weaknesses will probably be revealed, but our experience of the administration of the act and the devotion of particular attention to all the details will enable us to produce an improved article. Honorable members opposite should take a more liberal view of the bill than. they have to date. This legislation is long overdue. The only way in which to have a lastingand proper peace is by providing full time employment and social security for the people. Those essentials to the maintenance of peace are contained in this bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2373</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>L0G</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RYAN, Rupert</name><name role="display">Mr RYAN</name></talker><para>.- The people of this country will be in full agreement with the purpose of this measure, namely, the provision of unemployment and sickness benefits. The House will agree also that the measure should long ago have found a place on the statute-book. Australia is one of the few countries which has not provided either sickness or unemployment benefits. However, at long last, the Government has produced this measure. Whilst the objective is excellent, the measure itself is purely a palliative. It deals with effects and does not treat causes. To give a man a sickness benefit is not to restore him to health. Before we deal properly with sickness, we must get down to the root cause of it and take preventive measures. By doing so, we shall improve the health of the population, decrease a serious burden on the country and take a long stride towards increasing the general well-being of the community. Some years ago, the province of Ontario, in Canada, suffered a series of diphtheria epidemics, but by preventive measures wiped out the disease, and their incidence per 1,000 of. population has been reduced practically to nil. That successful campaign against epidemics has increased productive capacity, lessened misery, and reduced the burden on the finances of the State. Similar action could be taken in Australia. One of the first acts of the Government should be to increase preventive services. </para></talk.start><para>It is often said that the way in which to deal with unemployment is to have no unemployment. I agree with that view. Many honorable members opposite also believe that, in the ##"## new order ##"##,  there will be no unemployment. I invite them to examine this problem in a realistic manner. However efficient our national economy and legislation may be, there will always be some people unemployed. In 1939, unemployment stood at 9 per cent. A year later, when wartime activity was developed, unemployment was still S per cent. This year, when every available man is at work, unemployment. is slightly more than 1 per cent. So the problem will never be entirely overcome. There are various kinds of unemployment. The honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly)</inline> referred to mass unemployment. ##"##We hope that we shall never see mass unemployment again in Australia, but internal measures alone cannot prevent that dreadful scourge. It arises from factors beyond the control of this Parliament. Mass unemployment and a decrease of general economic activity throughout the world must have repercussions in Australia, and therefore affect employment in our own industries. In addition to mass unemployment, there is casual unemployment - the man who works intermittently; seasonal unemployment, which is always with us ; and technological unemployment, which is caused by industry changing from one form of production to another. No matter how effective the measures taken by the Government may be, we shall always have a fairly large degree of unemployment. I shall be surprised if the average figure of unemployment, even under the best condition.^ is less than 4 per cent, or 5 per cent. Probably the Government does not expect to reduce the figure below 4 per cent, in peace-time. </para><para>Whilst I agree with the general purposes of the bill, I am totally opposed to the financial basis of the measure. Surely it is time that we made the basis of finance for our social security measures a contributory system, and not a ##"## hand-out ##"## from Consolidated Revenue. At present, we are wading in the financial mire above our ankles, almost to our  knees.  If this bill becomes law, we shall sink in the ##"##mire up to our waist-line and I fear that we shall never be able to extricate ourselves. The financial basis of this scheme is the income tax collections of to-day and to-morrow. The steep graduations of tax impose excessive burdens on all classes of the people, but particularly on the high and middle income groups. Does the Government seriously believe that the present high rates of income tax will be permanent? Does the Government really consider that the basis of finance for this scheme is sound? High taxation is all right in war-time. The burden can be imposed on the people, because they know that the money is required for the conduct of the war. If tax collections do not meet requirements, they can be increased for the purpose of bringing in more money. If more money is required, more notes can bt: printed. Although that system may operate satisfactorily in war-time, it would be impossible in peace-time. The present heavy ##'##taxation cannot be retained after the war. Loans also must be restricted. When the war ends, the Government should cease turning out an immeasurable volume of bank credit. Before it is too late, because it will be too late if this bill becomes law, we should try to place social security measures on a sound footing. Like honorable members opposite, my heart is in the extension of social security. Because I am so keen, I want to see this matter placed on a really sound financial basis that will endure long after the end of the war. The only sound method of finance is a contributory system. By a ##"##contributory system ##"##, I mean specific payments into a fund out of which eligible persons may receive benefits. Contributions made by individuals will entitle them, in time of distress, to receive not a dole, but payments as a right. Various contributory schemes are operating in other countries. There is the tripartite system, which has advantages and disadvantages. The NewZealand system insists upon certain registration fees, together with levies on the earnings of the individual. Regarding the relative merits of those, systems, a great deal of argument is possible. For myself, I favour the New Zealand scheme. But either of those two systems is better than the present amorphous, weak and insecure system that the Government has adopted. No doubt the Government gave some consideration to the various methods under which social security <inline font-style="italic">measures</inline> could .be financed before it adopted the one outlined in the bill; but </para><para class="block">I suggest that it would have acted more wisely had it given greater attention to world experience in this matter. The tripartite contributory scheme of finance has been proved in many countries, among which are Great Britain, Eire, Bulgaria, Poland, Germany, Italy, Austria, and Queensland. A voluntary scheme of contributory finance in relation to social security measures has been applied in Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Switzerland, Holland, Denmark, France, Norway, Spain and Finland. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2375</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JVJ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MULCAHY, Daniel</name><name role="display">Mr Mulcahy</name></talker><para>-  Did the honorable gentleman mention Eire? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2375</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>L0G</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RYAN, Rupert</name><name role="display">Mr RYAN</name></talker><para>- I did. The basis of contribution in Eire is lOd. a week for each employee, 9d. a week by the employers in respect of each employee, and 5.310d. a week by the Government. The tripartite scheme has also been applied in Russia, the practices of which are of considerable interest to some honorable gentlemen opposite. The contributors to the social security measures in Russia are the business undertakings and the employees, and the three schedules which operate are: the standard schedule which applies to employees whose contributions are between 16 and 22 per cent. of wages; the privileged schedule, the contributions in respect of which are from 10 per cent, to 14 per cent, of wages ; and the special schedule, relating to employees in the higher salary ranges, whose contributions vary from <inline font-style="italic">7i</inline> to 12 per cent. Russia is said to be the home of modern ideas, and it is interesting to know that the Soviet Government has adopted the contributory system for social security services. It is somewhat odd that the Commonwealth Labour Government should have passed over the experiences of the countries I have enumerated which have accepted the contributory principle and found it to be most satisfactory. The contributed funds in those countries are assisted by votes from consolidated revenue, but there is a definite personal contribution by the beneficiaries. On this point I bring to the attention of honorable members the following paragraph which appears in the Beveridge report: - </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>There are some to whom pursuit  of  security appears to be a wrong aim.

The plan is one to secure income for subsistence on condition of service and contribution and in order to make and keep men fit for service.

Some honorable gentlemen opposite have argued that the Government##'##s scheme is based on personal contributions. That is true in the very limited sense, that every person in the community contributes to the revenue by taxation. Even the widow puts in her mite. But the sense of personal contribution is necessarily vague and undefined. Let me illustrate my point: No doubt the Minister in charge of this bill enjoys now and again, a nice juicy lamb cutlet for his lunch.

The estimate of any one honorable member would be as good as that of any other honorable member in relation to unemployment, but on the basis of 5 per cent, of unemployment in the years following the war, the amount involved would be ##£##10,000,000, making a total of ##£##18,500,000 under this legislation. Repatriation commitments are likely to require ##£##12,000,000 per annum and pharmaceutical benefits are estimated to cost ##£##3,000,000 per annum. Our total commitments therefore under all of these headings may be ##£##75,000,000 per annum. The Government, of course, has certain other health services in mind to which I have given some study. An estimate of their cost has not been made; but the amount expended in this country to-day on medical and hospital services is approximately ##£##21,000,000 a year. If health services are taken over by the Government, I cannot believe that the expenses will be much- less than that, and very likely they will be higher.

The Government also has in mind other schemes, which I consider ought to be brought into operation at some time, such as the medical inspection of school children,  which to-day is extremely inadequate and badly conducted; and; - one of the most important undertakings - child welfare, upon which no amount is being expended. There is also the further suggestion that the Government is likely to subsidize house rents on behalf of the poorer class. This would involve an expenditure of millions of pounds a year. Apparently, we shall be faced before long with a social security bill, plus fixed commitments in respect of the national debt service, amounting to ##£##160,000,000, ##£##170,000,000, or perhaps  ##£##1S6,000,000.  Does the Government consider that income tax provides a sound basis for the financing of these schemes? Is the income tax to remain at the present high level? One knows what is likely to happen; indeed, it is happening now. Because of the enormous burden of income tax, the people, despite the desire to do their best in the interests of the country in time of war, are going slow in all classes of society. That is apparent in the business and professional world, in the coal mines, on the wharfs, and in every class of society. I cannot imagine that the Government wishes that state of affairs to continue. If it does not, then it must reduce the present enormous burden of tax, which destroys the incentive to work harder and make more income. It is entirely wrong to have income tax as the basis for the financing of any social scheme. The Government should accept the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, and bring this and subsequent schemes on te a contributory basis. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2377</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JS9</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BREEN, John</name><name role="display">Mr BREEN</name></talker><para>.- A great American statesman is credited with the statement, ##"##You can fool some of the people all the time ##"##. That appears to be the basis of the attitude of the ##"## Old Guard ##"## of the Opposition towards these proposals. The experience of the last elections ought to have taught them that the number of people who can be fooled is constantly diminishing. The leading members of the Opposition composed the Government which preceded the present Administration. They had many opportunities to formulate schemes of social service, embodying principles similar to those of the scheme now before the House, hut did not at any time attempt to implement them. Now, tinder the guise of allegedly constructive criticism, they are endeavouring to repeat the performance they consistently gave while in office, in connexion with the concrete proposal which is before the House. They shelved the only scheme that appeared likely to reach fruition, and are attempting to subject this scheme to a like fate. One does not need to have political perspicacity to realize that the amendment for the withdrawal and redrafting of the scheme is merely a demonstration of the principles which, from time to time, have been expounded by members of the Opposition, when urging that the victims of the present economic system should not be a charge on the community. Their philosophy is that of the old Roman capitalist class typified by Cato - that the old and the infirm should be thrown to the lions, or should be destroyed by other means and buried. That is the philosophy of modern capitalism, the advocates of which always o##'##bject to social service schemes being a charge on industry, anl urge that they should be contributory. Time and again, the present Government has affirmed its ability to provide full employment for the people of Australia. It has drawn attention to the fact that, in war-time, there is no limitation on the finance which the nation can provide for the conduct of its affairs. That is in contradistinction to the state of affairs in pre-war days, when employment and unemployment were conditioned by some mythical financial balance in the banks of Australia or other countries. Such an economic policy prevailed in this country under anti-Labour governments. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2377</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JRJ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BOWDEN, George</name><name role="display">Mr Bowden</name></talker><para>-  Also under Labour governments. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2377</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JS9</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BREEN, John</name><name role="display">Mr BREEN</name></talker><para>- The present Labour Government has stated that it can provide full employment for all persons who are employable.

The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> condemned it, on the ground that a person who remains in industry after he has passed the age of 65 years will not be entitled to participate in its benefits, even though lie ##'## has made contributions to it for a period. Under the economic system visualized by the ##'##Government, there should ##'##be no need for a person who has reached the age of 65 years to continue in industry. If his financial status enables him to live without drawing the old-age pension, there is no need for a social service dependent on taxation to make provision for him ; and if the economic system which operates after this war functions so efficiently that such a person need not discontinue his employment in order to qualify for the old-a##&amp;##e pension, that will be a fulfilment of the promise of the Government to provide full employment for all. On such  trivialities have the arguments in condemnation of the scheme been advanced. Its critics might base their future political philosophy upon a qualification of Abraham Lincoln##'##s aphorism, a modern version of which could be that you cannot fool the same people all the time. Our friends might well learn that lesson, and thus contribute more beneficially to the political, social and economic advancement of this country, than they are contributing by trying to ride opportunity with hands and ##'##heels, caring not whether the country benefits so long as their prospect of winning the prize of occupancy of the treasury bench is thereby improved. </para><para>A feature of this scheme which has aroused a certain degree of criticism relates to the casual rural worker. One who has arrogated to himself only lately the right to speak on behalf of casual  and  seasonal workers has criticized the the Government on the ground that it proposes to launch an inquisition of the whole of the earnings of those individuals before agreeing that they should come under the scheme. Any one with a knowledge of rural employment realizes that Ifr. <inline font-style="italic">Breen.</inline> many rural workers are to-day self employed. Many- small farmers contribute to the pool of casual labour for rural industries. Some farmers who are now fairly well to  do started as shearers or bush workers. They acquired land, and, as they accumulated some cash, spent##'## less time working for wages and more time on their farms, until finally they had no need to hawk their services as seasonal workers. It would be very difficult to devise a formula, to which no one could object, for applying unemployment benefit to casual workers. The bill provides that if the income of a seasonal worker for the year is not sufficient to enable him to maintain himself and his family, he may receive unemployment benefit. If but few casual workers come under the scheme, so much the better for them, and for the community generally. In the past no section of workers has been so degraded as the casual bush workers. Wages in rural industries have always been lower than in secondary industries, and the casual nature of .their employment made their existence precarious. When an opportunity presented itself for them to obtain permanent employment, they seized it with both hands, which is one reason why so few seasonal workers are available now. </para><para>This scheme has been devised as something supplementary to the Government##'##s general economic plans. We all hope that, there will not, be much unemployment after the war, and that the money in the National Welfare Fund will be sufficient to satisfy all demands, even at the comparatively high rates proposed. I, for one, trust the Government to do the job properly. Most of the money in the fund will, I believe, be devoted to the payment of sickness rather than unemployment benefit. That was recognized by those who drew up the scheme, and that is why the means test is to be applied to income, rather  than  to  property.  Under previous schemes an unemployed person was required to liquidate his assets, and even to sell his home, in order to provide himself with the necessaries of life, before he could qualify for unemployment benefit. That will no longer be required of him. The Government expects that there will be full  employment for all persons willing and able to work, but it recognizes that it must carry on under the capitalist system, in which the motivating force is production for profit. In time of war the system is capable of providing employment for all who are willing and able to work, and, in the change-over from war to peace, seeing that it is in some measure a selfrepairing system-, no radical alterations of the basic principle will be necessary. The Government hopes that no revolutionary change of the economic system will be required to enable it to apply its policy. That is why the Government has brought down a scheme which does not provide full sustenance for the sick and unemployed, but only enough to tide them over while the economic system is being adjusted to peace-time conditions. With all its faults, this is an honest attempt to ensure that starvation and degradation do not accompany temporary periods of unemployment. Bearing in mind the schemes that have been tried in other parts of the world, and also in Australia, there is good reason to hope that this one will prove successful. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2379</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KHL</name.id><electorate>Melbourne PortsMinister for Labour and National Service</electorate><party>ALP</party><role /><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLLOWAY, Edward</name><name role="display">Mr HOLLOWAY</name></talker><para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - The amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mir.

Were the amendment to be accepted, the Government##'##s scheme would suffer the same fate as the national insurance scheme which, after costing the country so much money, was finally left at the doorstep of the Government. I ask honorable members to cast their minds back a few months to the time when the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> introduced the National Welfare Bill, the purpose of which was to establish a National Welfare Fund. He was sneered at by honorable members opposite, who said that the bill was merely a piece of window-dressing for the forthcoming elections, and that nothing would come of it. Now, when they find themselves snared in their own political cunning, they clamour against this measure . because it is the fulfilment of the promises which the Treasurer then made. It is evidence of the Government##'##s determination to keep faith with the people, and the Opposition does not like it. Honorable members opposite hate a government that does things. They were prepared to carry on year after year, spending public money on inquiries and the preparation of reports, and then pigeon-holing them. . This Government is determined not to pursue a policy of postponement, which always means defeat. The people cannot exist for ever on promises. </para></talk.start><para>The Leader of the Opposition did not expect his amendment to be accepted, but he knew that if it were it would mean the end of the Government##'##s proposals. They would come to nothing, just as did the national insurance scheme introduced by a previous government. The right honorable gentleman, in his remarks upon this bill, said that it was impossible, to provide more than the people of the country produced. I do not think that any one will argue with him on that point. It is so elementary that I shall let it go without further comment. Then he said that the benefits cannot really be free. Well, no one gets anything free. None of the benefits provided under our social legislation is free. Those who receive benefits have earned them by serving their country for years, and by paying their taxes. Every time a child sits down to his breakfast he is, in the form of the tax paid on some of the things he eats, contributing for future social benefits. The community as a whole pays for the benefits received by industry under our fiscal system, but too often the benefits are collected exclusively by the great captains of industry. Thousands of pounds are paid out of revenue for maintaining scientific research laboratories, but, here again, the##'## benefit often goes almost entirely to those who make fortunes out of industry. The great mass of the people get work, certainly, but their balance-sheet at the end of the year shows them to be in exactly the same position as at the beginning of the year. I have said in other places to people who would have contradicted me if they had been able that  80  per cent, of the Australian people are listed as wage or salary earners on the pay-roll of some employer and that  90  per cent, of the  80  per cent.  exist on or below the bread-line, one-third being much below it. All pay taxes in some way. That is why we must continue to finance social legislation in the way adopted at the outset, namely, from Consolidated Revenue. Every one contributes, both directly and indirectly, to Consolidated Revenue, according to his capacity. I can remember that when the first Labour government of this Commonwealth placed social security legislation on a sound basis, Australia was hailed all over the world. I was asked to several round-table conferences at Geneva and London to outline the methods adopted by Australia in financing and otherwise dealing with social legislation. We were then regarded as being in the vanguard of social reformers, but, as the result of two or three decades of Nationalist, United Australia party and all kinds of tory control, we remained just where we were 30 years ago, whereas the countries that had been following in our wake caught us and many of them passed us. I remember a great judge of the Arbitration Court saying publicly. ##'##*##'## I was proud a few years ago that Australia was in the vanguard of social reform, but I am afraid it has lost its place to-day##"##. That place was lost owing to the long reign of anti-Labour governments. We say that in the interests of humanity and justice we must continue the existing method of spreading the cost of social legislation. The last piece of social legislation should be the best. I will prove that this is the best. I would prove in debate on the platform with .the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> or any one else, that there is no other piece of similar legislation better than this. That honorable members opposite realize that fact is shown by the poor quality of their ammunition. They had to rely on the Beveridge report which some day may, but I doubt it, become legislation. Before it can do so it will have to run the gauntlet for six or nine months of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. I should not like to bet that many of its recommendations will be passed into law. Honorable gentlemen opposite quoted extensively from the Beveridge report, but they put forward nothing in actual operation today which is better than this legislation. 1 do not say for one moment that this legislation is as good as we should like it to be. We do not claim that it will bring economic security to the people. All we claim is that it is just a little contribution towards economic security. It will bridge those gaps which we cannot close so completely as we should like. We do, hope, however, that the percentage of unemployment will, as the result of good administration, be less than ever before. We hope also that, as the result of medical research by the Commonwealth Department of Health and the National Health and Medical Research Council, the sickness rate will be diminished. Neither unemployment nor sickness, however, can be eliminated. That is why this measure is necessary. I do not believe that any system of society could be conceived in which there would not be gaps which would have to be bridged by legislation of this character. Our aim to-day is to reduce the black spots which mark our society to the irreducible minimum. </para><para>The right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> introduced into this debate a Dark Age term. It was bad enough for him to use the shocking phrase ##"##master and man##"##, but I was disgusted to hear him use the -word ##"## pauperism ##"##. Fancy a man of the right honorable gentleman##'##s intelligence using in these days of enlightenment the word. ##"## pauperism ##"## ! It reminded me of an incident which occurred about fifteen years ago when, before I entered this Parliament, I was a member of the Victorian Council of Public Education. At a meeting of that council, I moved that all text-books used in State elementary schools should be provided free, and a professor from the University of Melbourne said, ##"## Pauperism ! Fancy introducing pauperism into our country ! ##"##. I assure honorable members that every member of that council was as disgusted with that professor then as I was yesterday with the right honorable member for Kooyong, for whom I have always had the greatest respect. What we are proposing is not pauperism. It is not even charity. Everybody, regardless of his place on the social ladder, pays taxes, and those taxes in the aggregate form the exchequer from which we draw to pay for this social legislation. I have heard the right honorable member for Kooyong say in this chamber and outside that one of the canons of taxation is that people should pay according to their ability. That is the principle which guides the imposition of taxes in this country, and it is why we say that social legislation should be paid for from the funds which are paid into the Consolidated Revenue by the people for expenditure on their behalf. I come now to the kernel of the Opposition##'##s contention that unemployment insurance and sickness insurance should be on a contributory basis. The conservative elements of the community say that those who directly derive benefit ought to pay for that benefit from their wages ; in other words, that the workers, while they are working, must themselves ensure that they shall not be in want when they are not working. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> destroyed the fallacy of the three-party contributory system, whereby payments are made by the employees, the employer and the Government, when he pointed out that the employees##'## contributions, being made directly out of wages or salary, reduce their standard. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2361</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KV7</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">STEWART, Frederick</name><name role="display">Sir Frederick Stewart</name></talker><para>- He did not say that at all.

As a matter of  fact,  the honorable member made some extraordinary statements. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Only  one  attempt  has  ever been made by a Commonwealth government to introduce  a contributory  scheme. In 1938, the  Lyons  Government sought the advice of experts in Great  Britain,  actuarial  computations were made, and  the  National Insurance Bill was  introduced. But  the benefits were so  miserable  and  the scheme  was so  costly that the public protested against  it, and the  Government hurriedly dropped##'##  it.  In fact, there was even  a ##"##bust-up##"##  in Cabinet and some Ministers threatened to resign if the scheme  were not  abandoned. The scheme proposed  by  the Curtin Government spreads the burden over all the people, and those who derive an advantage, from the employment of people help to pay for it. Surely the ##"##captains of industry##"##, who spend large sums of money upon the maintenance of machinery, should help to  maintain  their human machine. Honorable members opposite did not complain when university professors secured the support of the Trades Hall, in a deputation that waited on a State Premier, to ask for a grant of ##£##50,000 for the erection of a new building. They did not cry, ##"## Pauperism ##"##, although that money was subscribed by people, rich and poor, by way of taxes. They do not complain when the reports of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research are made available to wealthy ##"##captains of industry ##"##, assisting them to add to their riches. But the salaries of the scientists who furnished those reports are met from income tax collections. Nearly everything which makes it possible for industry to enrich itself comes from taxes subscribed by rich and poor alike. In many ways we subsidize ##"## captains of industry ##"##. We admit their imported machinery free of duty, although people pay excise on their tobacco and alcohol. If the Government assists to keep industry going, it should also maintain the human wreckage broken on the wheels of industry. </para><para>The Social Security Committee recommended this basis of finance. It is only right and proper that every one should share in the cost of the scheme. Another advantage is that this is the cheapest method of administration, because it spreads overhead costs. Although the honorable member for Parramatta read ##"## slabs ##"## from the Beveridge report, he did not refer to the cost of the administration of the scheme in Great Britain. I shall refresh his memory. In 1939, the costs were as follows: unemployment, 10 per cent.; health, 17 per cent.; pensions and other benefits, 5 per cent. The cost of the administration of invalid and old-age pensions, widows##'## pensions, child endowment, and maternity allowances in the Commonwealth last year was 1 per cent. I do not contend that the cost of administration will not rise when the unemployment and sickness benefits scheme begins to operate, but I am##'## sure that any increase will not be substantial. It certainly will not rise to 17 per cent. The Government prefers to make as much money as possible available to the unemployed and the sick, rather than create an enormous department which would be necessary under the tripartite system, employing thousands of officers to keep records. The cost of that organization would be about 20 per cent. </para><para>The basic principle for financing the scheme was unanimously recommended by the Social Security Committee. It travelled to all States and took voluminous evidence. Members almost shed tears when witnesses explained the necessity for this legislation. When honorable members opposite, who were members of the Social Security Committee, signed the report they apparently believed that this legislation would never be prepared. </para><para class="block">They did not think that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> is so honest as he is. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2383</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JTY</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CAMERON, Archie</name><name role="display">Mr Archie CAMERON</name></talker><para>- They did not i Link that the Treasurer was so weak ! </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2383</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KHL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLLOWAY, Edward</name><name role="display">Mr HOLLOWAY</name></talker><para>- They did not know that he is politically honest and gives effect to his promises.

The Minister in charge of the measure said in his speech in reply, that soldiers who were unemployable received consideration from the Repatriation Commission. I point out that a soldier who haslost an arm, or a leg, or an eye, may be granted a war pension, but he is nevertheless at a disadvantage in seeking employment, and men who have suffered disability because they have engaged in active warfare in the defence of their country should not be required to labour under any disability that we can remove. The war  pensions which soldiers receive are not regarded as earned income for taxation purposes, and are not assessable as such. I can see no reason why the benefits which disabled soldiers receive under this measure should be considered as income. Men who have suffered the disabilities I have enumerated are obviously at a disadvantage when applying for jobs in competition with hale-and-hearty individuals, who, perhaps throughout the war period, have been employed in munitions factories and the like and have not undergone the risks attendant on active service. Take the case of a soldier who has lost a leg. He is paid a pension of ##£##1 17 s. 6d. a week, plus an allowance of  0s.  If my amendment be agreed to he will receive a benefit of 3s. 6d. a week under the provisions of this bill, but as the bill stands, he will receive nothing, whereas a man who has not been on active service and who, having retired from work, is in receipt of ##£##1 5s. a week, will be entitled to ##£##1 a week, which will bring his income up to  ##£##2  10s. a week. Surely a returned soldier is entitled to some consideration from the Government! It is gravely anomalous that an enemy alien, who may be interned at the present time, will merely have to establish the fact that he has been domiciled in Australia for twelve months in order to become entitled to the benefits of this legislation, and will thus be in a much better position than the returned soldier who has lost a limb. The Minister has not controverted that submission. If my interpretation is wrong, I should be put right; but I do not think that it is. Returned men should be given the opportunity of at least ##"## breaking even ,J with those who have remained behind, invested their money, and had the advantage of the conditions which have been made possible by the sacrifices of the soldiers. If the Government is prepared to expend ##£##73,000,000 on social services, surely it should not quibble at a slight increase for those whose war services have made it possible for this scheme to be financed. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2385</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JVA</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MORGAN, Charles</name><name role="display">Mr MORGAN</name></talker><para>. - The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> has raised a point which demands serious, and sympathetic consideration by the Minister. The treat ment of returned soldiers is a matter that is divorced from party politics. This legislation  is  most far-reaching, and I am somewhat amazed at the complacency of the committee generally towards  it.  The Minister should no##'## set himself the task of .having it passed without amendment. If the honorable gentleman cannot agree to the present proposal,  he  should  at  least promise to  give  sympathetic consideration to it. Many returned soldiers receive double  the  amount that has been suggested  as the  limit  in this  case.- It is not  proposed##'## that  the full pension shall be taken into consideration, although that is an aspect  that  might well be considered. Different Ministers for Repatriation, when the subject of an increase of  service pensions  has been under consideration,  have  always stressed that  these  are granted purely on a disability  basis,  and are regarded as compensation for injury that has been sustained. Under this measure, a returned soldier  who  becomes unemployed or ill, will be expected to make provision for himself by means of the disability pension, which had been granted for entirely different reasons. I agree with the  honorable  member for Wentworth that returned soldiers should not have discrimination practised against them. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2385</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KZR</name.id><electorate>Balaclava</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">WHITE, Thomas</name><name role="display">Mr WHITE</name></talker><para>.- I support the amendment. I am sorry that this matter was not considered by the committee of returned soldier members which has deliberated upon many repatriation matters in the past. I have participated in those deliberations, and have found myself in complete agreement with points raised by Government members on the committee. When an honorable member advocates in this chamber the cause of returned soldiers who cannot urge their own case, the Minister ought not to accuse him of exerting pressure. Last night, I was associated with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Curtin) when, from the platform of the .Town Hall  in  Melbourne, the right honorable gentleman, addressing those who had assembled in support of the First Victory Loan, paid an exceptionally high tribute##'## to the services of  Australia##'##s defence forces, and said that they would  not  be forgotten in any way. They certainly were forgotten when this legislation was framed. A soldier does not receive a pension because he has fought in the war, although some honorable members consider that he does. If an entitlement board decides that he has sustained some disability which impairs  his effectiveness in his work, he is granted a pension, the amount  of which varies according to the measure of his disability. No pension, however high, would compensate him for the loss of a leg or an arm. I was Minister for Repatriation for a period, and for a long while have been associated with various phases of repatriation. I have found that the man who experiences the greatest difficulty in obtaining employment is the one who is partially blind. Returned soldiers know that those who suffer from facial disfigurement learn that for them the field of employment is very restricted. Yet the person who is in that category, and receives a pension on account of it, is to be disqualified##'## partially from the benefits of this scheme if he happens to be unemployed. It is useless for the Minister to say that the Repatriation Department will look after him, because it will not d,o so. Any government possessing common sense, let alone compassion or a sense of justice, would accept the amendment without cavil. Why accuse of insincerity the honorable member who has. proposed it? The men affected are to-day taking risks which members of this chamber do not take. It is a pity that this building was not bombed once or twice. Had that happened, honorable members might have more appreciation of what the fighting services are experiencing daily. Those men are not in the position to plead their cause to-day; but later, if they consider that their rights are not being properly regarded, and that many of the promises made to them were hollow, they will exhibit anger and disgust. The matter need not Be debated at length. Had it been discussed##'## and urged by honorable members who comprise the unofficial committee of##"## returned soldiers, surely the Government##'## would##'## have accepted it. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2386</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KHL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLLOWAY, Edward</name><name role="display">Mr Holloway</name></talker><para>-  I cannot accept the amendment; but I freely undertake to discuss the matter with the Treasurer. </para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2386</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZO</name.id><electorate>Henty</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">COLES, Arthur</name><name role="display">Mr COLES</name></talker><para>. - I sincerely commend the amendment to the consideration of the Minister. The honorable gentleman must have overlooked one point in connexion with the pensions of soldiers. This Parliament has accepted the provision in a repatriation measure, that if a soldier is bodily disabled he shall receive a full pension of ##£##2 10s. a week. The amendment merely seeks to provide that a soldier who has had a disability pension granted to him because of a war injury shall, when unemployed for the time being, be raised to the status of one in receipt of a full pension of ##£##2 10s. a weekThat request is very reasonable. In my opinion, the whole of a soldier##'##s pension should be left out of account in the consideration of income for the purposes of this legislation. The amendment having been proposed by certain soldiers. I am willing to support it. A man who had returned from this war with a disability could be unemployed and because of the pension in respect of that disability not receive the sustenance allowance fixed by this bill for a person unemployed. I commend and support the amendment, and urge the Minister to give consideration to it. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2386</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>L0G</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RYAN, Rupert</name><name role="display">Mr RYAN</name></talker><para>.- For the purpose of other legislation, a disability pension is not regarded as income, and I cannot see why an exception should be made in this measure.

Some of those who criticize me have not done as much for the returned soldier as I have) but I am not claiming any kudos for what I have done. As I have said, a special act should be passed to ensure that every returned##'## soldier of t is war, and every returned soldier of the last war who did not receive justice from previous governments, will now receive that to which he is entitled. However, the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Bill is not the one to which the returned soldier should look for justice. This measure is designed to provide a small benefit for persons who are unemployed or who, because of sickness, are unable to work. The returned soldier is in a different category. If he is disabled, he must be assured of a pension that will enable him to live in comfort for the rest of his life. If he is not disabled, but falls sick or becomes unemployed, then he will come  under this scheme. The returned soldier has a special claim, on the people of Australia, and I feel sure that the Labour Government will grant him what he is entitled to. Previous governments made all sorts of promises to the returned soldier, but did##'##, not keep them. He was to be given preference, but in actual fact the preference was worth nothing, and there were no jobs to be had. During the depression, thousands of returned soldiers were walking the streets begging for a meal. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2387</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JTY</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CAMERON, Archie</name><name role="display">Mr Archie Cameron</name></talker><para>- And there was a Labour government in power. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2387</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JSW</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BRYSON, William</name><name role="display">Mr BRYSON</name></talker><para>- The conditions which existed at that time were the outcome of the policies which the honorable member for Barker consistently supports.

Every returned soldier should be assured of a job. When he is having one meal, he should be in no doubt as to where the next one is to come from; otherwise, this Government will have failed in the same way as previous governments failed. The soldier is called upon to risk his life. Many have lost their lives. Numbers of the men who return are maimed, having lost a leg or an arm or an eye. It is the duty of the community to see that such men shall be able to live in comfort for the rest of their lives. This bill proposes that a payment of 25s. a week shall be made to a man who is out of work, but that is not enough for an unemployed, disabled soldier. He deserves something better than that.

To treat a disability pension as income is utterly indefensible. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> defined it properly when he said that a disability pension represents an attempt by the country to restore to the disabled soldier something that he has lost. It never has been looked upon as income. If a man loses a leg at the war, his disability is computed at so much. If his leg could be restored to him, there would be no question of a money payment at all, but because that cannot be done, a certain sum of money is paid to him, either at so much a week, or in a lump sum. </para><para class="block">The proof of that lies in this fact : there are returned soldiers in this country with incomes of thousands of pounds a year, but they still draw their disability pensions. That makes it clear that the disability pension is not paid to enable a man to keep himself, but as compensation for something that he has lost. I ask the Minister to look on it in that light, and to grant this small concession. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2388</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JTY</name.id><electorate>Barker</electorate><party>ALP</party><role /><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CAMERON, Archie</name><name role="display">Mr ARCHIE CAMERON</name></talker><para>. -  I support the amendment.

For a government which claims the great depth of charity and breadth of generosity that this Government claims to adopt an attitude like this is indeed a sad state of affairs. The honorable member for Bourke having imported past history into the argument - it was not imported by anybody on this side - my mind goes back over 25 years and I remember well that the only Labour Government which reigned during that time was the one which saw fit to cancel preference to returned soldiers; that was in 1930-31. Since the Government lately has shown a lot of concern about my administration of departments - especially since##'## the censorship row began - I ask Ministers to examine what I did as Postmaster-General in 1938 on behalf of the temporary returned soldier employees of the Postal Department. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2388</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>- Order ! </para></talk.start><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2388</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JTY</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CAMERON, Archie</name><name role="display">Mr ARCHIE CAMERON</name></talker><para>- It is all germane to this clause.

This is a matter on which there should be no doubt in the mind of any honorable member. Whether or not we have reached the stage at which, as we read in the Book of Esther, once anything is ordained by the King of the Assyrians, it cannot be altered, I do not know, but we have heard too much from the treasury bench during the last couple of weeks about the immutability of legislation.

It has the power to do so under the defence power. So much for that, which is quite apart from this bill, under which the Government intends to clip the pensions paid to disabled soldiers if they should become unemployed. Those who are most susceptible to unemployment are those with facial disfigurements or missing limbs, for whom opportunities of work are few. The honorable member for Bourke is not aware of what was done in the Repatriation Act. He talked about starving returned soldiers walking the streets looking for work during the depression. The depression hit every country, and every country took its own corrective measures. In not one of the measures taken by this country were the pensions of returned soldiers considered for taxation. This bill has been hastily drafted and considered. It is a pity that the returned soldier members of Parliament who know the background were not asked to put forward a proposal. I think that they could have made one that would have been acceptable to all. It is not sufficient for the Minister for Labour and National Service to say that he will tell his colleagues about this matter. Parliament will rise to-morrow for a long recess. I think that we should meet at least every quarter. ##"##We cannot have Ministers churning out dictates and the bureaucracy making national security regulations without supervision or check.

This is not a party political issue. All honorable members are greatly concerned for the welfare of the returned soldiers. There has been an oversight in the drafting of this legislation, and a misunderstanding of the principles on which war pensions are based. War pensions are laid down on a disability##'## basis, and have no relation to the economic position of the recipient. They are given for the purpose of compensating a returned soldier for a war disability. Consideration has been granted to members of friendly societies because they contribute perhaps for years for the unemployment or sickness benefits that they are entitled to receive. The same principle may be applied to returned soldiers. They bought their pension, probably more dearly than members of friendly societies, because they paid for it with pain and suffering. This is the proper place in which to decide the issue. The bill deals with unemployment and sickness benefits, and should contain any special provisions relating to benefits for returned soldiers. I feel strongly about this matter. Many honorable members on this side of the chamber would like to support the amendment. The amount of money involved is only small, and will be provided from the National Welfare Fund. In my opinion, ##'##an entire war pension should be allowable, but the honorable member for Wentworth suggested the moderate sum of 25s. In fact, the whole of the benefits which people receive from friendly societies and trade unions should not be taken into consideration when these benefits are being bestowed. Miners receive benefits, for which they contribute, up to 35s. a week; consequently, they will not derive much advantage from this legislation. Unfortunately, this matter has arisen late in the session, but that should not preclude the committee from giving full consideration to the issue. If the bill passes in its present form,##'## months will elapse before this matter can again receive consideration. The Minister ha3 not said definitely that he will recommend it to Cabinet, and, after all, others have to be considered in the making of a decision. It is in committee that an oversight can bo corrected. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2392</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KHL</name.id><electorate>Melbourne PortsMinister for Labour and National Service</electorate><party>ALP</party><role /><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLLOWAY, Edward</name><name role="display">Mr HOLLOWAY</name></talker><para>. - I inform the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> that I am not arguing the merits of the amendment. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2392</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KV7</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">STEWART, Frederick</name><name role="display">Sir Frederick Stewart</name></talker><para>- Will the Minister postpone the clause? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2392</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KHL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLLOWAY, Edward</name><name role="display">Mr HOLLOWAY</name></talker><para>- No. I want the committee to complete its consideration of the bill.

To agree to the. Minister##'##s proposal would be to consent to an abrogation of the authority of the Parliament. The proper course for the Minister to take is to ask the committee to postpone consideration of the clause so that the amendment may be carefully considered by Cabinet. The Minister has said that Cabinet will meet on Monday or Tuesday, but Parliament will not then be in session, and, in fact, it may not meet until next August, or even September. As all the members of Cabinet are available for a meeting, I urge the Minister to call them together to consider this proposal at once. I greatly regret that the Minister for Repatriation suggested by interjection that if the Opposition pressed this amendment to a division it might cause the defeat of the purpose we have in view. Upon reflection, the Minister must realize that it would be unwise to persist in that attitude. The amendment is equitable or it is not equitable towards ex-servicemen. If it is equitable it should be adopted. In the interests of fair play, I urge that it be considered immediately on its merits. Surely that id a reasonable proposition. On the merits of the case, I remind honorable members that, during the 25 years that repatriation legislation has been in force in this country, innumerable amendments have been made to it; but one fundamental that has remained unchanged is that soldiers who have sustained a continuing disability in their war service should receive a compensation which should be in no sense related to their private means or other income. That principle has never previously been challenged. This is the first time that the pernicious principle of the means-test has been applied to war pensions. That the application is indirect does not alter the fact. The situation that we face is this : So long as a former serviceman suffering from an assessable disability is in employment, his income is greater by the amount of his pension than is the income of a fellow citizen doing the same work who does not suffer from a continuing war disability. Let us assume that the disability of the ex-serviceman has been assessed at ##£##1 a week, and that his pay in his civilian job is ##£##5 a week.  His  income is ##£##6 a week.  His  fellow citizen, doing the same kind of work, who has sustained no war disability, has an income of ##£##5 a week. Successive Parliaments have accepted as equitable the principle that ex-servicemen shall be compensated in this way in respect of war disabilities. But if this clause be agreed to in its present form the effect on the -ex-serviceman will be to rob him, when he falls out of employment, of the benefit which it is proposed to grant, for in such circumstances the fellow citizen who suffers no war disability and the citizen who suffers from a continuing war disability would both be on the same footing. In view of the fundamental principle which has hitherto been observed in this country in relation to war pensions, the Government##'##s attitude is entirely indefensible. As a matter of fact the ex-serviceman should he entitled to the greater consideration if unemployment should befall him. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2393</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KHL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLLOWAY, Edward</name><name role="display">Mr Holloway</name></talker><para>- The provision in this bill is similar to provisions in other pensions schemes.

Take the position of two men, who have each lost a leg, one through war service and the other through accident in civil employment. Again I shall keep to simple figures. The ##'## ex-serviceman has a pension of fi a week in respect of his disability. For the sake of the argument I shall put down the civilian##'##s compensation at ##£##300 cash. Assume that both individuals lose their employment. The fact that the civilian received ##£##300 compensation in a lump sum would not be invoked in order to assess his right to benefit under this bill, but the ex-serviceman who receives his compensation by means of a weekly payment would find that his compensation would be reduced. Surely the Minister must agree that that is unjustifiable. I submit, therefore, that it is most unreasonable for the Minister to ask us to agree to this clause on his promise that he will . submit the representations to Cabinet for later consideration. The subject should be considered at once. We do not accuse the Government of any sinister motive in haying failed to include in the bill a provision such as the honorable member for Wentworth is asking for. I have been a member of cabinets which have had to consider shortcomings disclosed in bills during a parliamentary debate. .The shortcomings may have been due to pure oversight. We <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> not suggest that the Government has any nefarious design in respect of ex-servicemen, but we ask that the unsatisfactory state of affairs which has been revealed, shall he remedied at once. The committee is indebted to the honorable member for Wentworth for having brought this point to notice. I hope that the Government will accede to our request. I hope also that the Minister for Repatriation will not seek to place the responsibility on the Opposition for the defeat of the proposal, if that should happen on a division. Ex-servicemen should not be penalized in that way. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2394</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KQK</name.id><electorate>Corangamite</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCDONALD, Allan</name><name role="display">Mr MCDONALD</name></talker><para>. - I deplore the fact that passion has been shown in discussion of a subject that should have been considered on strictly non-party lines. Probably there has been a complete oversight by the Government of the point raised by the honorable member for Wentworth. I do not believe that Cabinet deliberately decided not to insert the provision  which the honorable member for Wentworth has now proposed. A member of a friendly society who, during years of thrift, industry and foresight, has contributed to a fund which will yield him ##£##1 a week in a time of sickness is being assured that his thrift shall not operate against him in relation to the sickness benefit prescribed in this bill. But contrast his ##'##case with that of a ##"## digger ##"##. He, by reason of service, sacrifice, suffering and war injury, becomes entitled to a pension. As the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> said, a man who loses a limb suffers a capital loss for which no monetary payment will fully recompense him. This matter should go before the Cabinet afresh. Scant justice will be done to the soldier, and members of the Ministry will do less than justice to themselves if the bill passes without providing that the man who has sustained injury on war service shall be on a footing at least equal to that of the citizen witu whom lie daily comes in contact. </para></talk.start><para>I regret that I have to rebut certain statements of the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost).</inline> I do not think that I shall be accused of partisanship, because my attitude when repatriation legislation was before the House is well known.

Therefore, the Minister##'##s proposal is that this hill shall be submitted for the Royal assent in its present form, on his undertaking, not that he will recommend to Cabinet the acceptance of the amendment, but that he will have the matter considered by Cabinet. If the honorable gentleman were prepared definitely to undertake that Cabinet would see that the provision was inserted before the measure became law, the attitude of members on this side, and I am sure of members opposite also, might be entirely different. </para></talk.start><para>What is involved in the amendment? There are two sections of the bill which deal with income qualification or dis qualification. The definition clause, with which we are dealing, specifically exempts from the calculation for income disqualification all moneys received from the maternity allowance or child endowment. Later, provision is made for further exemptions: A member of a friendly society who is entitled to certain sick benefits because of his contributions to it, is to be entitled to an exemption of up to ##£##1 a week. At the discretion of the Director-General of Social Services, sick benefits paid by other persons and bodies, such as trade unions, are also to be exempt. Surely we shall do less than justice to ourselves and the soldiers if we permit investments in friendly societies and trades hall funds to carry an exemption of ##£##1 a week, and refuse to apply the same principle to the investment of a soldier in the service of his country! Let us assume that a member of a friendly society is entitled, under his contract with the society, to sick benefit of ##£##1 10s. a week. Under this legislation, he will have deducted from his sick benefit the amount in excess of ##£##1, and will thus receive a sick benefit of 15s. a week. Likewise, if a member of a trade union, under a contract with the provident fund, is entitled to a sick benefit of ##£##1 10s. a week, ##£##1 of that will be excluded when his income is calculated, and 10s. will be taken into account, reducing the benefit of ##£##1 5s. to one of 15s. But if a soldier has a contract with, the Repatriation Department, under which his sick benefit is assessed at ##£##1 10s. a week after very close investigation by one or other of the statutory tribunals, that fact will debar him from any participation whatever in the benefits of this scheme. But he is not to bc exempt from the payment of the income tax, which honorable members opposite describe as a contribution to the fund from which the benefits are to be payable. With that clearly in mind, the Minister can no longer deny that it is not reasonable to ask this Parliament to pass the legislation in its present form. It would be easy for members of the Cabinet to meet, and make a decision. This proposal has not come ##"## out of the blue ##"## ; the amendment was moved in the Senate some weeks ago. Consequently, the Government has had ample time in which to consider it. AVe are prepared to agree to the postponement of the clause until to-morrow. The bill could then be finalized in the form desired by the Government. </para><para>The definition clause, in addition to jiving complete exemption to maternity allowance and child endowment in the calculation of income, also provides - </para><quote><para>The calculation of income shall not Include, in relation to a person qualified to receive sickness benefit, any payment made in respect of incapacity, in respect of which that person is so qualified. </para></quote><para class="block">That is capable of two interpretations, and I should like to know which is thecorrect one. It could mean that a person entitled to claim sickness benefit is also entitled to have an unlimited income without prejudicing his claim for the sickness benefit; alternatively, it could mean that he is entitled to the gross payment of ##£##2  53.,  namely, the benefit of ##£##1  5s.  plus an allowable income of ##£##1. I hope that the Minister will state what is intended. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2396</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JNX</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BARNARD, Herbert</name><name role="display">Mr BARNARD</name></talker><para>.- 1 admit that, prima facie, there is some merit in the case submitted by the Opposition. But as the matter has already come before the Senate, and the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> declined to accept it without further examination, I cannot see any reason why the Minister in charge of the bill in this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> should depart from the assurance that the matter would be considered by Cabinet, with the object of doing even-handed justice to all. The Opposition claims that the amendment does not involve party politics. I am not altogether sure that the statements of honorable members opposite since dinner have not clearly displayed that tendency. The honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McDonald)</inline> said that the matter should be viewed dispassionately and without heat, yet not two minutes later he evinced every inclination to engage in physical combat with the Minister for Repatriation##'## <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost),</inline> after admitting that he had attempted to ##"## bait ##"## the Minister to say something off which the honorable member might score. The amendment ought to be examined, in order that its implications might be revealed. In every measure that has come before this Parliament since the present Government has been in office, even-handed justice has been meted out to the soldiers. After all, this measure is designed to bestow benefits upon a certain section of the community. It is not designed to benefit, in particular, returned soldiers in receipt of pensions. They are provided for in the Repatriation Act. However, if their interests are affected by this clause, the matter should be examined so that justice may be meted out to all, whether they be returned soldiers or not. </para></talk.start><para>The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> made great play <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the fact that Parliament is shortly going into recess, and will not meet again for some time. That does not matter a bit so far as this scheme is concerned, so long as the bill is passed by Parliament, Honorable members know quite well that several months will be required  to  prepare the machinery for giving effect to the scheme. That is why it is necessary to pass the measure now, so that, when the act is proclaimed, it may immediately be put into operation. </para><para>This is just another of the occasions upon which the Opposition is seeking to make political capital out of the returned soldier. It did so in connexion with the Repatriation Bill which was before the House some time ago. It forced into the measure a section providing for preference to returned soldiers, although it was utterly irrelevant to the measure and gave the returned soldier exactly nothing. I desire to place on record my opinion of the tactics pursued by the Opposition in connexion with this bill. Members of the Opposition have consistently used the returned soldier as an excuse for making attacks upon the Government. They have done so ever since they have been in Opposition. I hope that the Minister will not yield beyond saying that the matter will be examined.

The clause provides that benefit shall not be payable to any person who is a direct participant in a strike.

It states that benefit shall be payable to males between the ages of 16 and 65 years and, in the case of females, between the ages of 16 and 60 years. The assumption is that, at the age prescribed, the person ceases to become an active industrialist, and becomes an old-age pensioner. If he does so, there can be no complaint regarding his exclusion from the benefit, but we know that many people continue to work after they reach pensionable age. Indeed, only a few months ago, the Government appealed to men over 65 to return to industry. People of pensionable age who continue in employment also continue to contribute, by the payment of income tax, to the National Welfare Fund, out of which unemployment and sickness benefits are paid, yet it is proposed in this clause to exclude them from participating in such benefits. I hope that that is not intended, and that an appropriate amendment will be moved. It may be that the person who remains in industry after he has passed the age of 65 does so, not because he has responded to an appeal by the Minister or because he prefers to do so, but because he cannot conform to the requirements entitling him to an old-age pension. He may not possess the residential qualifications, or other income or property possessed by him may be a disqualification. He, therefore, must remain in industry and, remaining in industry, he will be subject to the income tax from which this measure is to be financed and yet disentitled to derive any benefit in time of unemployment. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2398</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KQB</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SCULLY, William</name><name role="display">Mr Scully</name></talker><para>-  What age does the honorable member suggest? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2398</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KV7</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">STEWART, Frederick</name><name role="display">Sir FREDERICK STEWART</name></talker><para>- So long as he is making any contribution towards the fund from which this measure is to be financed he should be entitled to benefit. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2398</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>009MC</name.id><electorate>Fawkner</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLT, Harold</name><name role="display">Mr HOLT</name></talker><para>.- Two aspects of this clause call for some comment.

I have known of engine-drivers, wheelers, and a few key men deciding that they would not work and thereby holding up a large number of other men. Are the few men the direct participants in a strike, or are all the men affected to bc regarded as direct participants? Are some of them direct participants, and some indirect participants? In 1940. when the Government desired to increase the output from a certain dockyard in Sydney all the men except half a dozen key men turned up for work on a particular day. Because it happened to be a holiday the management had to pay double time to 98 per cent, of its employees, who were ready to work, but could not do so because perhaps half a dozen others in key positions failed to attend for employment. With due respect for the legal knowledge of the honorable member for Reid, who said that clause 3G rectified the difficulties we foresee in this clause, I consider that that clause is one of the worst in the bill. Labour governments, from time to time, introduce dragnet clauses of this description into legislation. They say, in effect, to some poor civil servant: ##"##There you are Jones, Smith, Brown or Robertson. You have complete power. Get on with the job.##"## Obviously, particular qualifications should be prescribed in a bill of this description. I am not a lawyer, but I have always understood that the first objective in drafting legislation was to make the intentions of the measure clear. The language of legislation should be so concise that even he who runs may read and understand the intentions of the Parliament. Such clarity is missing from this clause and also from clause 36. Here and there we catch glimpses, through the fog of Government policy, of the new order about which honorable gentlemen opposite say so much. We see suggestions that the boss bureaucrats intend to toll the proprietors of industry in this country what they shall do, and their employees when, where and for how long they shall work. The people are to be told not only the industries in which they may work, but also those in which they may not work. This bill gives a clear indication of an intention on the part of the Government to provide that 65 years of age for men and 60 years of age for women shall be regarded as the respective ages for retirement. I do not believe that our democracy will accept any such direction. I do not deny that I am one of those who find a certain degree of pleasure in work. Other people also find pleasure in their employment. I remind the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost),</inline> who is laughing, that the time is coming when both he and I will be missing from our places in this House. Probably the day will arrive when nothing will suit the Minister for Repatriation better than to roam about among the Rome Beauties and Cleopatras in his riverside orchard in Tasmania, and prune his trees or pick his fruit as the inclination seizes him. But apparently a director-general, or a person with some such title, is to tell the people when they shall work and when they shall cease work. It is not clear yet who will be the goose and who will be the swan; but if I were a betting man my money would be on the goose. I strongly dissent from the proposal that any individual, under any title, shall have the right, power and authority to say when the- men and women of this country shall cease work. Obviously, however, the Government is seeking to establish a general retirement, of men at 65 years and women at 60 years. So far as I can understand this legislation, it is not related to any particular part of Government policy, or to any particular Government scheme. The provisions of the bill have been dragged together just as an old Mallee hen drags a heap of dirt and leaves together in the spring in order to lay her eggs. The incubation from measures of this kind will not result in chickens which will be profitable to the Curtin Government. I believe that a very poor market will be available for chose chickens. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2403</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>009MC</name.id><electorate>Fawkner</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLT, Harold</name><name role="display">Mr HOLT</name></talker><para>.- Obviously honorable gentleman opposite do not appreciate the significance of this clause or the discussion of it would be much more lively than it is. I asked several pertinent questions earlier, but the answers that the Minister gave did not satisfy me in any respect. I do not believe that the men and women of Australia who are approaching the age of 65 and 60 years, respectively, will ##'## appreciate what the Government, is doing. The ##"## new order ##"## which honorable members opposite envisage will apparently have very little attraction for people who are in the late middle life. I cannot conceive of the great majority of persons now approaching the ages that I have mentioned being satisfied to withdraw completely from active occupations. We must bear in mind that the proportion of aged people in the Australian community is much larger than it was a few years ago. I vividly remember the former Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> stating in this house some years ago that in 40 years##'## time the proportion of elderly people to younger people in Australia would be double what it is to-day. This will be due not only to our present population trends but also to improved living conditions, better hygiene, and the more active life that people live in these days, compared with the manner of life a generation ago. The Government is proposing that, in the future, men of 65 years and women of 60 years shall be obliged to retire from active participation in industry for, at those ages, they will become ineligible for the unemployment benefits being provided in this bill. But many of our people will be most unwilling to retire at##'## that time of life on a meagre old-age pension, for H will mean that they will have to eke out a poor existence, although they will still be sufficiently healthy and energetic to engage in many steady occupations. We should not discourage them from continuing in active work. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2403</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JXL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">FROST, Charles</name><name role="display">Mr Frost</name></talker><para>-  If they are provided with employment, obviously they will not be unemployed. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2403</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>009MC</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLT, Harold</name><name role="display">Mr HOLT</name></talker><para>- Apart from the persona engaged in professional callings, many people who do cleaning and gardening work, or domestic service of one kind or another, will desire to continue their occupations, although perhaps less strenuously than in their younger years.

I believe that I am not doing the Minister an injustice when I say that he gave a deliberately ##"##woolly##"## explanation of the meaning of ##"## direct participation ##"##. There can be only one substantial test of whether or not a person is a direct participant in a strike. If he or she fails to resume his or her work in accordance with the award governing his or her industry, whether out of sympathy with others on strike, under instructions from a trade union secretary, or on principle, then, in the terms of this legislation, he or she should be regarded as a direct, participant in the strike, and should not be eligible for benefits given by a government which, if it has any sense of responsibility, is bound to uphold the decisions of its own tribunals. That is a simple test, upon which the committee should insist before agreeing to pass this legislation. If the Minister and the Government are not prepared to back up the decisions of their own tribunals, or those of State governments, by insisting that any such person shall bc ineligible for these benefits, then we on this side should not accept the clause as it stands. We have not been given such a clear undertaking as we and the country are entitled to expect. If people are to enjoy benefits from Government largess, surely it would be the height of absurdity if the Government were to make them available to persons who cease work in resistance to the award of a Commonwealth tribunal, and thus provide them with means to continue a strike! What could be a greater travesty of administration and justice? Yet that is implied in the explanation which the Minister has made. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2404</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KHL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLLOWAY, Edward</name><name role="display">Mr Holloway</name></talker><para>-  The honorable gentleman said that he could not understand my explanation. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2404</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>009MC</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLT, Harold</name><name role="display">Mr HOLT</name></talker><para>- That is all that I could infer.

But if a section of a workshop, factory, or any other establishment goes on strike, involving others who are not associated with the matter, and causing them to be out of work, then those others must not be ineligible. If the Director-General calls upon a man who is unemployed to take a job in an establishment, the employees of which are on strike, in a position vacated by a striker, that man can refuse and still be eligible. Surely that is plain enough ! </para></talk.start></continue><para>The honorable member also stressed that injustice was likely to be caused to persons over 65 years of age. I assure him that the Social Security Committee had those special cases in view. That is why the Director-General is to be given the power that is conferred upon him by clause 36. The honorable member is very clever at putting up straw men in order that he may knock them over. I know something of his debating ability. He has stressed the position of a man or woman, over 65 years of age, or 60 years of age respectively, who wants to continue at work. There are thousands of such persons. Their desire is justifiable and laudable, and is appreciated by every one. But why should they want a pension if they are physically and mentally fit to work? Neither this nor any other legislation could prevent them from working if they so desired. The honorable member##'##s argument is that if they work they are not eligible for unemployment benefits. That is true. A married couple would lose ##£##2 5s. a week. But if they obtained the old-age pension they would receive double ##£##1 7s., and in addition would be entitled to earn between them ##£##1 5s. a week. Therefore, financially, they would be better off if they obtained the old-age pension than they would be on the unemployment benefit. An age limit must be imposed ; otherwise, such persons would become unemployable and benefit continuously, thus making the operation of the enactment farcical. The picture is not nearly so bad as. it was painted by the honorable member. The person who suffers most is the immigrant who cannot satisfy the residential qualification. Clause 36 is intended to rectify that position. </para><para>The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> stressed what he regarded as an injustice. He said that he could visualize aliens who had lived in this country before the war and had been interned during the war being entitled to the benefits of this legislation. Surely any person whom, we accept as a citizen is entitled to all the rights of citizenship! Otherwise, this would not be a democracy. We boast overseas that we have no regard for race, creed or colour after we have admitted a person to citizenship of this country. If an alien, after his release from internment, returned to industry, he would be entitled to the benefits of this legislation. But before being entitled to sickness benefit, he would need to have been at work for a specified period and then to have lost his income. Would honorable members opposite let them starve?

The Minister is to be relieved of responsibility, and sooner or later questions will arise regarding the administration of this provision. Then the Minister will say : ##"## But Parliament agreed that these powers should reside, not, in me, but in the Director-General ##"##. I believe in the principle of ministerial responsibility, but that principle is being departed from here in a vital particular. Moreover, I demand that the people of Australia shall be not only free, but also equal, whether they be members of trade unions or not. This tyranny, this dictatorship, which is growing up under the cloak of trade unionism, is the very negation of liberty. It is utterly wrong to say to .a public servant that his reward shall depend, not upon how he does his job, but according to whether he pays toll to some tinpot dictator at the Trades Hall. This is a matter which demands the attention of Parliament. This kind of dictatorship is going just a little too far. and I should like to know how far these self-appointed dictators will be allowed to carry on their nefarious practices under this scheme. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2406</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JLL</name.id><electorate>New England</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">ABBOTT, Joseph</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name></talker><para>. - It seems extraordinary to me that a scheme which is designed to confer benefit upon people in need should refuse benefit to persons who require it at the very time when they are going rapidly down the hill of life. Let us consider the case of the man mentioned by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White),</inline> the British migrant 67 years of age. Because he has been in Australia for only fifteen or sixteen years, he may not draw an old-age pension, and because he is over 65 years of age he is not qualified to receive unemployment or sickness benefits. It is a poor excuse to say that the Director-General will have power to make or withhold payment in such a ease. To place such power in the hands of the Director-General would be most unfair to him, and to the applicant also. It would give to the Director-General power of life and death. The man 67 years of age, who has been in the country for only sixteen years, would have to wait another four years to qualify for the old-age pension. He may not live so long. The position should he placed beyond doubt in the act itself. It should not be left to the discretion of the Director-General, who may be so busy that months would pass before he  could give a decision in a particular case, and even then, if he granted the benefit, it would be on the basis of hardship. If the Minister is unwilling to accept the suggested amendment of the honorable member for Balaclava, I hope the honorable member will move an amendment and press it to a division. We may be defeated, but we shall have recorded our objection to the great wrong which it is proposed to do to a section of the community because of the stupid obstinacy of the Government. This is ;mother example of the harm that may be done by rushing legislation through at the end of a session. This bill should have been dealt with long ago, when honorable members would have had leisure to consider it carefully. </para></talk.start><para>Clause agreed to. </para><para>Clause 16 (Sickness benefit). </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2407</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K9G</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">JOHNSON, Herbert</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name></talker><para>.- 1 draw the attention of honorable members to the conditions which this clause proposes to apply to men who become incapacitated from industrial diseases. The clause states that every person who satisfies the Director-General that he is temporarily incapacitated for work by reason of sickness or accident shall be qualified to receive sickness benefit. That in its general application- might be quite all right, but the bill provides no limit in respect of unemployment benefit although it does impose a limit in respect of sickness. The case I desire to place before the Minister concerns some men in my electorate known as the ##"## burnt-out ##"## miners, who are suffering from silicosis or tuberculosis. According to the latest statistics, they number less than 600. The miners in Western Australia have developed the Mine Workers##'## Belief Fund in which there is considerable wealth. It is governed by an act of the State Parliament which provides that a miner who, as the result of medical examination, has been warned out of the industry shall be accorded compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Workers##'## Compensation Act of Western Australia, and that, when that compensation has been exhausted, he shall receive a. pension from the Mine Workers##'## Belief Fund. But the act also provides that he shall make application for the invalid pension. A single man, if the invalid pension is granted, receives ##£##1 7s. 6d. a week from that source and 12s. 6d. a week from the Mine Workers##'## Belief Fund in accordance with the statute of Western Australia, making a total income of ##£##1 19s. 6d. a week. A married man and his wife, if they are both pensioners, receive ##£##3 19s. a week. The position of those ##"## burnt-out ##"## miners is unique. They are totally different from men who have, because of their advanced age, acquired an old-age pension, but at the same time have retained good health. The miners are forced to undergo a periodical medical examination, and men who are found to be suffering from silicosis are prohibited from taking further employment in a mine. Only those with experience know how quickly that dread disease robs a man of his health. The point on which I wish to focus the Minister##'##s attention is the difference between these pensioners and the others I have mentioned. The major part of their pension is taken in the purchase of medicine needed to keep them alive. The Mine Workers##'## Relief Fund has plenty of money, and the board of directors which is representative of the mine-owners, the miners and the State </para></talk.start><para>Government  and is elected by ballot of the respective organizations, being wholly Sympathetic with these men, is not only willing, but also most anxious to assist them. It would be a splendid thing if those burnt-out miners could receive from the Mine Workers##'## Relief Fund whatever the board of directors is prepared to allot to them without that payment affecting the amount of sickness benefit under this scheme. I have seen these sufferers in winter-time in more than one district of Western Australia- forced to sleep in an armchair before the fire because they cannot sleep in a bed owing to the fact that a recumbent position brings on fits of violent coughing which make sleep impossible. Doctors in every district have prescribed as the only method of relief brandy and cod-liver oil, an expensive medicine. The Minister may say that this is not the appropriate measure in which to deal with these people, and that t!:ey should be dealt with in an amendment of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. I am prepared to accept whatever  avenue is open so long as those people get the financial relief that they so greatly need and which is so long overdue. Ever since I have been a member of this Parliament I have been bringing all the influence within my power to bear on successive ministries in the hope  that  they would see the justice of these men##'##s claims, and I have been no more successful than was my predecessor, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Albert</inline> Green, who, for the many years during which he represented Kalgoorlie, carried the same banner as I am carrying. </para><para>Honorable members opposite  who  are holding up almost every clause of this bill by suggesting this and that amendment are giving no more than lip service to the workers.

It was left to the Labour party to bring it down, notwithstanding that the parties opposite had more than twenty years in which to do something of the same sort.

I never saw a more awkward, colt to get into harness than that Labour Government. A great deal of coaxing was needed to get it there.

You cannot have sickness benefit unless you have a sickness benefit fund from which the benefit is to be paid, unless the Government has gone completely Douglas-credit, or something like that. It is all very well to talk about what the Government is doing under this- clause. I am one who has a good measure of patience, and I shall still be in this chamber when the day of reckoning arrives.

This afternoon, the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> challenged my contention that the family income would be taken into account in the granting of sickness benefits. 1 cite clause IS in support of my contention. That is one reason for opposing the retention of the clause. There are also stronger reasons. Does the committee realize the full implications of the clause? If an unmarried woman works in industry and pays her income tax, she will be entitled to the benefits provided by the bill. But if a married woman works in industry and pays her tax, the Director-General may decide that her husband is able to maintain her and, in that event, she will be disqualified from participating in sickness and unemployment benefits. Scores of thousands of wives, whose husbands are now in the fighting forces, are working in industry and are receiving high wages. They will have the privilege of paying for these benefits, but will be denied the privilege of enjoying them. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2409</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>BV8</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CALWELL, Arthur</name><name role="display">Mr Calwell</name></talker><para>-  Only while the war lasts ! </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2409</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KV7</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">STEWART, Frederick</name><name role="display">Sir FREDERICK STEWART</name></talker><para>- So we shall be grossly unfair to those married women only while the war lasts! The full injustice of this clause is revealed when we contemplate its application to the wives of our fighting men. Many of them are working in munitions establishments, and in the textile industry. The Director-General will have to make an investigation before any of those women will be entitled to enjoy these benefits. He does not have to investigate whether they pay their income tax. The Commissioner of Taxation will see to that. Although they will pay the tax, they will not be eligible for these benefits. The Director-General will have to decide whether the husband - a fighting man - is in a position reasonably to maintain his wife. If he considers that the fighting man is able to maintain his wife, she will get no benefit at all. But if he is not of that opinion, the inference is that the Government is not paying the fighting man sufficient to enable him adequately to maintain his wife. That is the position. I leave it to the committee to decide. If the Director-General considers that the fighting man is being reasonably paid, a wretched injustice will be done to married women in industry. I hope that the Minister will delete the clause. It has not even the grace of being necessary. Other provisions in the bill will exclude wives from participation in these benefits if the family income is adequate to maintain them. This is wretched discrimination against wives, who, not being content to sit at home, assist the war effort. Indeed, many of them are not allowed to stay at home because they arc hounded by the man-power officers. But if the Director-General decides, after having investigated the household budget, that the husband is reasonably able to maintain the wife, her interest in this legislation will be confined to the privilege of helping to pay for it. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2410</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>009MC</name.id><electorate>Fawkner</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLT, Harold</name><name role="display">Mr HOLT</name></talker><para>.- This clause reveals, in its most unhappy form, the weakness of a system of insurance without contribution. The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> has posed .for the Minister on a dilemma, with very sharp horns, and he has to decide upon which horn he prefers to become impaled. If the Director-General decides that the serviceman is not in a position reasonably to maintain his wife, she will be eligible for sickness and unemployment benefits. Then we shall have the extraordinary situation that, while the husband is absent and not able to look after his wife in her sickness or unemployment, she will have only this meagre provision available to her. I agree with the honorable member for Parramatta that it is difficult to understand the necessity for this clause, in view of the restrictive effect of other clauses when the family income is deemed to be adequate. I join with the honorable member in protesting against the inclusion of this clause in the bill. </para></talk.start><para>Other implications call for some clarification. What will be the position of a deserted wife? It may be technically argued that it is still reasonably possible for her husband to maintain her, yet in practice he is not doing so and perhaps shows great unwillingness to do so.

No director-general could hold that it .was not reasonably possible for a husband separated from his wife to maintain her. ##"## Reasonably possible ##"## is, after all, a very flexible phrase, which would give the Director-General a most facile escape, should he be looking for it in regard to an individual case. In fact, in the language of the clause as it stands, if the Director-General is satisfied that it is reasonably possible for the husband to maintain her, I imagine that he will feel very grave doubt as to his authority or responsibility to make provision for her. There is no reference in the bill to a case of this kind. We may have, as I suggest, a woman in the unhappy circumstance of having been deserted by her husband, the husband being in a financial position to maintain her, and therefore coming within the implication of the phrase ##"## reasonably possible ##"##, yet she herself is not able to receive any benefit. We have also this odd result, that a mother may be in industry, the husband away in one of the services, and a young daughter, with not the same needs to cater for, also in industry, but able to receive the benefits of this legislation in respect of both unemployment and sickness, whilst her mother, deprived of the companionship and support of her husband, is at the same time deprived of such benefits. In view of all these facts, the Minister will be well advised to withdraw the clause. He has his protection in other parts of the bill. The weight of argument which the honorable member for Parramatta has been able  to bring to bear should convince the Minister of the unwisdom of the clause. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2411</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>BV8</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Minister for Information</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CALWELL, Arthur</name><name role="display">Mr CALWELL</name></talker><para>. - The committee faces an extraordinary position.

Quite a number of matters concerning the illnesses of married women do not require to be dealt with here. It is surely not intended that they should be made the subject of legislation of this sort. It is true that to-day there are married women in industry, but that is only a passing phase. I hope that the honorable member for Parramatta and others opposite do not think that the Government desires to have as many married women in industry in the post-war world as there are to-day. Their argument arises from the supposition that the abnormal conditions of war-time economy will prevail in peace-time.

Earlier to-night I heard the same sort of speech from other honorable members opposite, but it was made in a much better manner.

I submit that we must treat every measure which comes before us in the light of its stated intentions, and that we cannot depend upon an assumption by a Minister. as to when it will come into operation. Therefore, we must expect this legislation to apply to the conditions which exist in this country to-day. The clause states - </para><quote><para>A married women shall not be qualified to receive unemployment benefit or sickness benefit unless the Director-General is satisfied that it is not reasonable for her husband to maintain her. </para></quote><para class="block">I put it to honorable members that almost daily our courts of justice are confronted with the task of making decisions of this nature, and that they find great difficulty in determining just how much a husband can be expected to pay to maintain his  wife.  I am afraid that the Director-General will have the greatest difficulty in deciding these matters. However, there is a further serious obligation upon the shoulders of the Director-General, and that is to determine whether or not we are paying our fighting men sufficient to enable them to maintain their wives. The Minister for Information said that in. his opinion the Director-General would find that we were not paying our fighting men sufficient for that purpose. If the Minister is satisfied on that point, I should like to know what he proposes to do about it. Surely the least we can do is to pay our fighting men sufficient to enable them to maintain their wives in reasonable circumstances. The Minister##'##s admission is a shocking one, but, of course, he is a minority in Cabinet, and I venture to predict that the Director-General will find in every case which he is called upon to determine that, because of Government policy, servicemen are being paid sufficient to maintain their wives. That leads us to the point that soldiers##'## wives working in munitions factories will be debarred from enjoying the benefits under this bill. The wife of any man, other than a member of the fighting services, will be able to enjoy the benefits of this legislation should her case be considered favorably by the Director-General. But because it is government policy that a soldier shall be paid a certain amount to enable him to maintain his wife in Australia, then the wife is to be debarred from participating in the benefits of this legislation. There is no other way in which the matter may be viewed. It is another injustice to returned men and their dependants. Many wives of servicemen have gone into employment, not from necessity but as a relief from worry. The husbands are overseas fighting. Time hangs heavily on the wives##'## hands, and they prefer to do what they can at the lathe or the bench in support of the war effort. </para><para class="block">While in such employment, they are taxed in order that a fund may be provided for the provision of social benefits, but they are not to be permitted to participate in those benefits. That is a grave injustice. That was never intended. It is another example of the hastiness with which the legislation was prepared. Proper consideration was not given to it. Its anomalies have been revealed in their ugly nakedness. It gives no consideration to the fighting man; on the contrary it penalizes him. Anything more incongruous it would be difficult to imagine. I ask the Minister to come to a determination which will be sound in judgment and good sense, will do a measure of justice to our fighting men and their wives, and will not place on the Director-General the responsibility of supporting government policy. The Minister for Information considers that our fighting men are not being paid sufficient to maintain their wives. Surely that is an indictment not only of the Government, but also of the country as a whole. The honorable gentleman has access to all the information that is available in connexion with the war effort, and occasionally produces a gem such as he has released to-night. There has been revealed a weakness in government policy in connexion with the payment of our servicemen which must ring throughout the country and be sufficiently publicized to compel the Government to do justice to the men who return. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2413</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KHL</name.id><electorate>Melbourne PortsMinister for Labour and National Service</electorate><party>ALP</party><role /><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLLOWAY, Edward</name><name role="display">Mr HOLLOWAY</name></talker><para>. - The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> has made another mistake.

It is not long since married women in this and every other English-speaking country, as well as other countries, had no right even to own property. The Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> said that this is a monumental measure. It is a monument certainly to a continuation of that attitude, because it implies that married women have no rights whatever. Looking through this measure, can we discover any discrimination against a married man, even .though his wife be wealthy enough to support him and fourteen other people as well? The husband has rights as a man, but a woman, because she is married, apparently has none. As  a  member of my sex I cannot do other than protest against the discrimination which the Government has, unwittingly perhaps, shown against women in this matter, and against continuing an injustice against women that has lasted far too long. Take for a moment the position of two persons in partnership in business, a husband and a wife. If the husband falls sick he is entitled to benefit under the bill, but the wife is entitled to none. If the Government persists in passing this clause it will deprive itself, in the eyes of women everywhere, of some of the credit that no doubt it will have gained by bringing the measure forward in its present form. I hope that the Government will withdraw the clause. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2415</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>L0G</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RYAN, Rupert</name><name role="display">Mr RYAN</name></talker><para>.- The honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid ##'##Lyons) has expressed exactly the thoughts which were in my mind.

They advocate equality of pay for men and women, yet they say that the position of a married woman is entirely different from that of a married man. I contend that women and men should be treated entirely on the same basis. The clause provides that a married woman shall not be qualified to receive unemployment or sickness benefit, unless it be not reasonably possible for her husband to maintain her. To be honest we ought to insert another clause providing that a married man shall not be qualified for the benefit, unless the Director-General be satisfied that it is not reasonably possible for his wife to maintain him. Why should we not insert such a clause?

The National Health and Pensions Insurance Act which was passed by Parliament in  1938  was a very different proposal from that now under consideration. In that measure women were conceded the same rights as men, and no conditions were imposed. The rights of women were secured, and if a woman were married she still retained her rights under the act. This clause is a standing disgrace to a Government that claims to be democratic, despite its similarity to a dictatorship. Ministers can neither explain nor excuse it. If they talked for a week they could not justify it. The clause furnishes further evidence of the fact that the measure was drawn up in a hurry. It is a jerry-built piece of legislation. It was never properly dove-tailed together, and it was never placed before caucus, according to what has been said to-day.

The Minister##'##s attitude to women in this clause reminds me of that of Hitler or Mussolini. He can see no place in industry for women in the post-war era. According to him, the employment of women in industry is purely a war-time phenomenon, a manifestation of an extraordinary situation, which will vanish with the ending of the war. I point out that there is nothing in this clause to limit its application to the period of the war. This is designed to be a piece of permanent legislation to provide unemploy-ment and sickness benefits. If what the Minister said earlier is to be taken as an indication of the state of mind of the Cabinet, it is quite clear what the Government intended when this clause was framed. It wishes to discourage married women from accepting employment in industry. Many married women of  40  or  50  years of age who have small domestic obligations prefer to work in industry rather than to remain at home. Are we to assume that in this clause the Government is expressing its disapproval of their participation in industry? I was struck by the Minister##'##s reference to this ##"## monumental legislation ##"##. Perhaps it is to be regarded as a monument placed by the Government over the tomb of women##'##s emancipation. As the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> pointed out, there is to be no corresponding limitation in the case of a husband.

I have never been able to understand why our schemes of social service should treat thrift and prudence as a crime for which some penalty must be exacted. Unfortunately, such a test is an almost inevitable corollary of a noncontributory scheme of social service. That fact alone should be sufficient for us to find fault with the scheme before us. If the great mass of workers believe that when this monumental piece of legislation finally secures the Royal assent, whether in the war period or in the postwar period, there will come great relief in the way of benefits in respect of unemployment and sickness which have been talked about so glibly in this chamber, they will be soon disillusioned. The clause says that only those people who are able to present to the Director-General evidence of their indigency will qualify for full participation in these benefits. A beneficiary under the age of eighteen years will find that the benefit payable to him will diminish in proportion to the amount by which his income exceeds 5s. a week. In the next class, those from 18 to 21 years of age are allowed an income of 10s. a week before the diminishing element intrudes itself. Likewise, adult beneficiaries, to the extent that they have an income of 20s. a week, with some of the exceptions mentioned to-night, are to have their benefits reduced. I know that it is futile to ask for any variation of this measure.

They become ill at work, and on proceeding home, immediately call in a doctor. In such cases, he will be the family doctor or a local doctor. Many checks operate in respect of such illnesses. For instance, wages have to be adjusted and sick pay approved. We can visualize many cases of persons who become suddenly ill at work. Perhaps they have continued working for some time after the first signs of illness, and later it may be found that they have pneumonia, or some such complaint. When the family doctorexamines a person in such circumstances, he will give a certificate, and, in doing so, will not charge for the certificate, but for attending the patient. When I spoke of the desirability of cheapening the procurement of certificates, I meant that so far as possible, in order to obtain a certificate, a person should not be obliged to incur expenditure in addition to the normal expenditure incurred in obtaining medical treatment. For instance, it would be preferable to accept the certificate which members of friendly societies are usually obliged to produce in respect of sickness benefit, rather than oblige a person to pay an extra fee solely in order to obtain a certificate for the purpose of qualifying for benefit under this measure. Likewise, when a person is taken to hospital following a sudden attack of sickness at work, a certificate from the hospital authorities would meet all requirements under the bill.

I do not know why they should be so unduly discriminated against. Legislation of this character is an added inducement to men to flock to the cities to obtain permanent employment in factories and other places, and so neglect those very necessary rural pursuits. The shearer is mostly employed at piece-work rates. If there is any class of worker who earns his living by the sweat of his brow, it is he. It may be said that he earns big money, but he pays heavy taxes and does a great deal of travelling, and his earning period extends over nothing like nine months in the year, except in isolated cases. Generally the season lasts for only four or five months, during which period his operations take him to two or three States. His travelling expenses are heavy, the work hard, but the pay good, because piece-work rates to-day are generally good, which is probably why we rarely hear of a shearer##'##s strike. With perhaps the smallest number of shearers that we have had for the last ten years, shearing operations were successfully carried out last year when Australia had more sheep than ever before. It is becoming more and more difficult to secure shearers. If more difficulties are placed in the way of their earning a living, they will forsake the hard work for softer jobs in places where the work will be permanent, and the average remuneration greater. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2421</page.no><time.stamp>12:23:00</time.stamp><name.id>L0G</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RYAN, Rupert</name><name role="display">Mr RYAN</name></talker><para>.The clause provides that the Director-General may postpone or cancel the payment of unemployment benefits to any person who becomes unemployed by reason of his misconduct as a worker.

That is not a flippant inquiry, because quite a number of social services are to draw their sustenance from the fund. The maximum amount which can be paid into the fund under the law as it stands is ##£##30,000,000 a year, but that amount will only reach the fund so long as the returns from income tax on personal exertion remain at ##£##120,000,000 a year or more.

The Social Security Committee had placed before it in Brisbane some very interesting evidence on the provision of vocational training, under pensions legislation. The attention of the committee was drawn to a number of cases in which vocational training had been carried out without undue encouragement by the department. I do not say that in a derogatory sense, but merely because the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions ##"##Act do not encourage the  Deputy  Commissioner to deal with vocational training. Such activities are additional to his ordinary work, and do not come directly within the scope of his duties. However, we were given evidence of case##&amp;## in which vocational training had been encouraged and had resulted in the saving of a considerable sum of money to the Pensions Department. The honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has asked who will pay for this vocational training or medical treatment. Undoubtedly, a certain amount of money will be required to finance vocational training activities, but I consider that it will be money well spent because ultimately it will mean a saving to the Treasury. Vocational training will serve to restore a sense of citizenship and responsibility, and, surely, that is something which should be encouraged by every honorable member. It was shown to us in Queensland that as a result of their training many young people had become useful and profitable citizens.  They had developed confidence in themselves and were far more valuable units of the community than they had been in the past. I commend the Government for including this clause in the bill. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2423</page.no><time.stamp>12:38:00</time.stamp><name.id>L0G</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RYAN, Rupert</name><name role="display">Mr RYAN</name></talker><para>.I have not yet had an answer to my question.

Obviously that sum is not sufficient to feed, house and clothe the recipient, and at the same time, cover the cost of vocational training or medical treatment.

From the standpoint of practicality, it is not wise to concentrate all authority to institute prosecutions in a Minister resident at Canberra or Melbourne, when offences may be committed all over the Commonwealth. That would be conducive to the creation of a bottleneck, and would not ensure the best administration.

                    <para class="block">Prior to the introduction of the price ceiling in April, 1943, increases of the retail price of tobacco and cigarettes of varying amounts from 45 per cent, to 55 per cent, were permitted. These increases were due to the imposition of higher customs and excise duties on tobacco, and not to increased costs of production or applications by the manufacturing companies for higher prices. If the added cost of duties be excluded, no increase has taken place, since the outbreak of war, of the manufacturers##'## selling price of tobacco. During the last twelve months a substantial increase has taken place in the landed cost of imported tobacco leaf. The average cost in 1942 of imported tobacco leaf used, exclusive of duty, was just under 20d. per lb. In 1943 it had risen to just over 26d. per lb. For the four months November 1st, .1.94.3. to February 29th, 1944, the average cost of purchases was nearly 46d. per lb. This represents an increase of about 26d. per lb. in the cost of imported leaf since 1942 and of about 20d. per lb. since 1943. Manufacturing companies have up to the present, absorbed substantial increases of costs of imported leaf, but the position has now arisen when they require some relief from these increased costs. In the absence of the price ceiling, it would be normal practice for the Prices Commissioner to increase the price of tobacco to meet the increased costs of imported leaf. Tobacco, however, is included in the regimen for the cost-of-living index, and is a widely consumed article. It has been decided, in lieu of a further increase of the price of tobacco, to provide the relief by way of a remission of excise duties. The basis on which the remission of excise is being arranged requires the companies to carry about half the increase of cost of imported leaf this year as compared with last year, and still more as compared with the cost in 1942. This involves the companies in a considerable increase of costs with a consequent reduction of profit margins. It is proposed that the reduction of excise shall take the form of a rebate of 4##£## per cent, on total excise collections. The current level of these collections is about ##£##17,000,000 a year, compared with a  pre-war  figure of ##£##6,200,000. The cost of the rebate will, therefore, be at the rate of about ##£##750,000 for the current year. The position will be kept under close scrutiny, and the rebate will be varied as required. As the price of imported leaf has averaged nearly 46d. per lb. since the 1st November last, it is proposed to make the rebate retrospective from that date. </para>
                    <para>This proposal does not affect in any way the assistance the Government is giving to local producers of tobacco. Increases of prices of a total of 26.5 per cent, in the local leaf have been permitted since the outbreak of the war. and the manufacturing companies have absorbed these increases without any increase of their selling prices. The Government is anxious to encourage the production of local leaf and the action now taken is designed merely to protect consumers from an increase of price that would otherwise be necessary because of an increase of the cost of imported leaf. At present tobacco is imported by the Division of Import Procurement and sold on arrival to the manufacturing companies on a basis of cash payments. The companies are thus being asked to finance the purchase of high-priced imports, and it will be possible to keep  a close check on the effects of the reduction of excise duty now made. Full information is available as to the amount and cost of the imported leaf, and the Prices Commissioner will make a periodic review of the costs and profits of the manufacturing companies. </para>

                        <para>. - The Opposition does not purpose to contest this bill, but I desire to make some observations upon it. We have been told that the Treasury is now collecting about ##£##17,000,000 a year in excise on tobacco, which is nearly three times as much as was collected before the war. Out of this large amount, it is proposed to give a rebate of ##£##750,000. I agree that there has been an extraordinary increase of the price of imported leaf - from about 20d. per lb. in 1942 to 46d. per lb. in February, 1944. Such a large increase must necessarily affect the price of manufactured tobacco. The amount of the rebate is not large in comparison with the amount of revenue collected, particularly having regard to what the Treasury is getting because of the increased price of manufactured tobacco. It would be unforgivable to increase further the retail price of tobacco at this time. People are paying more for their tobacco now than over before in the history of Australia. This not only affects those who require tobacco as a solace, but it also affects the quantity of tobacco available to members of the services. Even now, Allied soldiers are getting their tobacco for a fraction of the cost which our troops are required to pay for an inferior article. </para>

                        <para>.This measure requires some analysis. Over a period of six years, when I was Minister for Trade and Customs, I was responsible for many changes, up and down, of import duties and excise on tobacco. It is now proposed to give a rebate duty amounting to ##£##750,000, the rebate to be retrospective to September of last year. Before the war, collections of duty amounted to ##£##7,000,000 a year; now they amount to ##£##17,000,000. I recognize that the Government must have revenue, but I am surprised that an undertaking has not been obtained from the manufacturers that there will be an adjustment of price. </para>

                        <para>. - Last year, I called a conference which was attended by the Prices Commissioner and representatives of the growers and the manufacturers. At this conference it was decided to fix the price of local leaf at 3s. per lb., but it was found, after the leaf had been appraised, that the average price to the grower was only 2s. 5-Jd. per lb. I propose to discuss the matter with the Prices Commissioner and the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> with a view to ensuring that the growers will get the price agreed upon. I do not say that they were wilfully cheated, but, through the working of the appraisal system, they were deprived of a price which had been fixed. I am sure that the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Prices Commissioner will see that the amount by which the growers have been underpaid will be made up to them. </para>

                    <para class="block">As its name implies, this is a measure to provide free medicines to all people of the Commonwealth requiring them, and is a further instalment of the complete plan of social welfare services promised by the Treasurer (Mr.Chifley) last year, when he introduced the National Welfare Fund Bill, under which provision was made for a National Welfare Fund, out of which the initial costs for improving existing and initiating new social services would be met. Already some of these promises have been kept, such as improved pensions for invalids, aged and blind persons; a wider scope and increased benefits under the Maternity Allowances Act, with special help for pre-natal and post-natal care of both mother and children; new extensions of widows##'## pensions; funeral benefits for pensioners; the unendowed first child of the family of a widow, and the raising of the age of dependency of all children from fourteen to sixteen years. All these features of the plan are in operation. Other instalments which have been passed in the present period of the session include cash payments to persons temporarily unemployed, or suffering loss of income through sickness. The measure now before the House cannot be given effect whilst the present shortage of manpower and equipment exists, but the Government desires to pass the necessary legislation to warrant its planning the necessaryadministrative machinery as far as is possible, so that it shall be ready for immediate action when circumstances make that possible. </para>
                    <para>The bill provides that any person ordinarily resident in the Commonwealth, on presenting a prescription from a doctor, may have it dispensed free of cost by a qualified dispenser in any chemists##'####"## shop, friendly society or hospital dispensary, the cost of which shall be paid by the Government. Every care has been taken to ensure that medicines of the highest quality shall he supplied to the public. Clause 7 sets out to assure this by the adoption of a pharmaceutical formulary prepared by an expert committee. This formulary will cover all reliable and essential combinations of medicines, and will not be limited to any number of prescriptions. All. prescriptions of value may be included if  accepted by the expert committee. Insulin and anti-toxin will be included. Materials and appliances are also provided for. The Government is determined that all preparations of proven value shall be made available, including penicillin as soon as it is available. I am sure that all honorable members will be glad to know that the Commonwealth Health Department, under <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston##'##s</inline> control, has this position well in hand. There will be three committees under this act: A Formulary Committee to decide the formulae of prescriptions ; a Consultative Committee in each State to investigate all local disputes, matters of practice, ##&amp;##c, and to report to the Minister; and a Consultative Council to advise the Minister upon matters of policy. These committees will consist of men trained in, and associated with, the medical profession. A new feature is dealt with in sub-clause 4 of clause 8, which sets out that a person whose sickness is due to his own misconduct shall be entitled to the benefits. Clause 15 provides for special arrangements for persons in isolated areas where no doctor or chemist is available. Other similar systems have been examined so that we may improve and simplify this legislation and the methods  of its administration. It is intended that the system shall not become inflexible. The scheme is to be controlled by the Department of Health, which will guarantee that it will be progressive and scientific, and will be linked with, and have the advantage of, the research in which that department is engaged. It will be noted that any chemist, lodge or hospital dispensary may share in the work of catering for tie people under this scheme. At present, some States allow dispensaries to cater for all people who desire to deal with them, whilst others do not. I hope thai this anomaly will be rectified, and that State legislation will enable these dispensaries, which have done so much to meet the needs of the workers of this country, to trade without restriction. Wc shall need all the trained personnel available to meet the greater demand for medicine when the scheme is in operation. The medicines to be available under the scheme will be those contained in the Commonwealth pharmaceutical formulary which it is proposed will be compiled by a committee of doctors and chemists. Persons will have free choice of chemists, and will thus be able to have medicines dispensed wherever it is most convenient to them. Arrangements will be made with chemists to supply medicines under the scheme on the basis of an agreed price for each prescription in the formulary. It has frequently been said that other health services should have received attention before the one provided in the present bill. My answer to that contention is that the Government is not prepared to delay any portion of its plan merely because it is thought that other portions should receive precedence. Honorable members will readily appreciate that the prevailing conditions as to manpower and resources must largely determine the practicability of bringing into operation other sections of the national welfare plan. In regard to desirable projects, such as hospital services and the treatment of tuberculosis, which involve expansion of hospital accommodation and facilities, I assure members that the Government has for some time been examining these problems, and, as soon as possible, legislation will bc introduced to deal with them. We shall proceed on the basis of doing what we can as soon as practicable and no measure will be delayed simply because we have not been able to complete our arrangements. </para>
                    <para>One of the most important features of the Government##'##s proposals is the adoption of an entirely new method of providing pharmaceutical benefits. The basis of this method is the predetermination by a formulary committee of the full scope of the benefits to be supplied. This committee will be composed of experts representing the medical profession, pharmacologists and pharmacists, and will examine all known drugs and compounds, with a view to incorporating all those essential in the relief or cure of any known disease in a formulary from which any medical practitioner may order. It is not the intention to limit the inclusion of any drug or compound merely on the score of cost. The only  question asked will be, ##"##Does it contribute anything towards the medical efficiency of the formulary?##"##. In this way the Government hopes to achieve a high standard of efficiency in prescribing and expects to offset to some degree any increase of the cost of supplying expensive drugs by the elimination of redundant and useless drugs and by keeping the cost of administration down to a minimum. </para>
                    <para>The restriction of prescribing to a formulary is a departure from the accepted practice in the provision of pharmaceutical benefits, and it is very desirable that honorable members should be conversant with the reasons for the adoption of such a principle, and know something of the advantages that may be gained. The practice in Great Britain under the National Insurance Act is to allow doctors to prescribe ##"## all proper and necessary drugs ##"## which, on the face of it, looks like unrestricted prescribing. This does not mean, however, ##"## complete freedom for the prescriber ##"##, which has sometimes been claimed for the British scheme, because prescribing is hedged in by a great many instructions, to ensure due regard for economy in drugs and costs. If any prescriber does exceed the limit of his instructions he is promptly dealt with. The view has been urged that prescribing from a formulary limits the power of the prescriber to meet the individual requirements of his patients; but that is not so. Any conception that the formulary is merely a list of preparations to meet certain complaints is erroneous. The formulary is a list of drugs considered necessary in the treatment of the sick and injured, together with a range of formulae showing suitable combinations of drugs, rather than a list of prescriptions for certain complaints. It will be the prescriber##'##s responsibility to decide which compound is most suited to his patient##'##s requirements, and it will be the duty of the formulary committee to ensure the provision of an adequate range of drugs and compounds to meet the needs of the medical profession. But the liberty of the prescriber does not end with the choice of a suitable formula, for he is also able to alter the dose of any ingredient in a formulary compound. </para>
                    <para class="block">He may also decide that, owing to some idiosyncrasy of his patient, it is necessary to eliminate certain drugs from a formulary prescription. Furthermore, he is at liberty to prescribe the quantity of any drug or compound that should be taken. In fact, the only limitation is that the prescriber cannot increase the number or the quantity of drugs in any formula, but in view of the elasticity in prescribing already mentioned, this should not debar any patient from receiving the treatment he needs. </para>
                    <para>The advantages of this plan are, first, it will assist the prescriber by providing him with a formula which has been tested and proved, both as regards its chemical combination and its therapeutic value; secondly, it will assist our war-time drug supply situation by eliminating unnecessary and useless drugs; thirdly, it will avoid the necessity of creating a large administrative staff that would be necessary if every prescription written had to be independently priced, as would be the case if doctors wrote their own formulae. </para>
                    <para>There is another aspect of the benefits conferred by this bill that may be easily overlooked in any cursory examination of the clauses. I direct attention to clause 25 c, in which it is stated that an authorized person may take samples of drugs, medicines, ##&amp;##c, and clause 27 c, which provides that the Governor-General may make regulations prescribing the standards of composition or purity of pharmaceutical benefits. Although standards are set for most drugs, there has been nothing in the way of a systematic check on the quality of the drugs used in medicine, with the result that many medical men to-day are misled in their diagnosis because of the patient##'##s lack of reaction to treatment. Most chemists take every reasonable precaution to ensure the quality of their products by buying their drugs from reputable wholesalers and manufacturers. But what I am stressing is the fact that there is at present in Australia no adequate provision for the testing of many drugs in common use and in consequence the present standard of pharmaceutical service is not so good as it should be. </para>
                    <para class="block">That does not imply that members of the profession are at fault. </para>
                    <para>It is estimated that the cost of supplying the pharmaceutical service will be about ##£##2,000,000 in a full year. The service will be financed from the National Welfare Fund. Finally, the Government does not suggest that this and other social security legislation can give real economic security to the people. That can come only from full employment at full rates of pay, at a standard equal to the resources of the country. The legislation already passed will bridge the gaps which occur from time to time. Sickness and unemployment in some instances are inevitable. The date on which this legislation will become operative has not been decided upon but we want the right to provide the machinery. </para>

                        <para>. - It is a serious reflection upon the Government that we should be asked in the early hours of the morning to debate an important instalment of its national health proposals, and that, without even the courtesy of granting an adjournment of the debate to enable honorable members to study the implications of the bill and the second-reading speech of the Minister in charge of the measure <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> the Government intends to force it through the House. I object most strongly to the furtive way in which the Government is seeking to bring its national health programme into being. The health of individuals and of the nation is the most important subject that this Parliament could ever consider and it is disgraceful that we should be asked to consider it in these circumstances. The Government is the master of its own business, and it should be able to arrange the order of business in such a way as to allow a measure which so greatly affects the health standards of the people, to be debated in the full light of day. I propose to examine the bill from three aspects: First, whether the passage of this measure will materially improve the health of the community; secondly, whether the welfare of the sick will be seriously jeopardized by the limitation of the freedom of the doctor to prescribe for a patient exactly what medicine he regards as most suitable to restore a patient to health ; and, thirdly, whether the Government##'##s approach to this subject will assist, or retard, cooperation with the States and the medical profession in the formulation and implementation of a comprehensive national health programme covering the whole field of health and medical treatment. The only justification for the introduction of this measure in wartime would be that it is a most urgent and an integral part of the Government##'##s national health programme. The Government must establish that the supply of medicine to the public lags well behind other urgent national health matters and especially those health measures that would reduce the total expenditure on medicines. Otherwise, it must be convicted of a gross waste of public money. </para>

                    <para>The object of a Commonwealth health programme should be to prevent the incidence of disease, to provide for early diagnosis, and to make available efficient treatment before disease reaches the chronic and tragic stage. All enlightened medical teaching has stressed the necessity of making available to the people as a whole, in decentralized and convenient institutions, all the equipment necessary to provide early and accurate diagnosis of disease, which every one so greatly fears. In such a programme, the provision of a bottle of medicine is the last requirement. The Government##'##s approach to the health problem is exactly the reverse. It proposes to provide medicine first, before diagnosis, and before hospital and medical treatment. This is starting the national health programme in reverse gear. It would be equally logical to supply free coffins before free medicine. The Government has already provided free funeral benefits in certain circumstances, and its action under this measure in providing free medicine as the first step in a national health programme, is, perhaps, in logical sequence. </para>
                    <para>The amount that the nation would need to expend on medicine could be very considerably reduced if an orderly health programme were carried out by##'## the Government. Much of the funds that would be spent on medicine would be saved if an equivalent amount was expended in inaugurating a national health  plan along the lines that medical experience has indicated to be necessary. Such a plan would ensure the nutrition of pregnant and nursing mothers and children by reducing the cost of essential protective foods such as milk, oranges, ##&amp;##c. Priority in securing these essential foods, and, in fact, essential clothing for these women and children, should also be given. Otherwise they must stand in queues, or risk missing supplies altogether. </para>
                    <para>Let me illustrate the requirements of an effective health plan by dealing with the case of a common disease. Infantile scurvy frequently develops in children between the eighth and fifteenth month of life. It takes time to develop, and usually occurs in infants who have had solely boiled, pasteurized or dried milk. Latent scurvy, not immediately recognizable, may be made active by infection. The treatment for scurvy, both preventive and curative, is the supply of foodstuffs rich in vitamin C. If there were an abundant supply of orange, tomato, pawpaw, pineapple, or black currant juice, sufficient to give 30  mmg.  of ascorbic acid daily, children would not develop scurvy. The quantity necessary is roughly - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>If these quantities are not available, we are forced to rely on a very inferior substitute, synthetic  ascoribic  acid, which, in fact, must be used for a fraction of the number of infants who, for financial reasons, or because of geographical difficulties, or a shortage of supplies, cannot obtain those other juices. Under the Government##'##s free medicine scheme, I take it that the synthetic ascoribic acid, the inferior substitute, will be supplied free as a medicine. Surely, it is much more sensible to include in the formulary under the bill these indispensable concentrated juices, which are much more curative than the synthetic medicine, and would prevent the necessity for using ascorbic acid. For other infantile diseases, such as anaemia, rickets, tuberculosis and other infections, fresh milk and eggs are equally essential. </para>
                    <para>The Nutrition Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council has indicated in its last report that children from six months to five years of age must have three eggs a week, and pregnant and lactating women must have six eggs a week in order to keep themselves and their children in health. The committee says, . further, that children under six years of age should have 10$ pints of milk a week; children from six to fourteen years, 7 pints a week; expectant mothers, 10$ pints a week; and invalids, 14 pints a week. It goes on to say that it is quite useless to give medicines for the treatment of various diseases if these quantities of milk are not available. The committee urges that positive action must be taken concurrently with the introduction of meat rationing to ensure that infants and children, pregnant and lactating women, and invalids will have the quantity of milk recommended by their medical advisers, even if nonvulnerable groups are restricted. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Boyd Orr referred to the position in Great Britain, where first things are placed first and not last.

                        <para>What has been the effect of this on the national health? Let us take the children first. Their diet has been improved and I think we are safe to say that there has been a corresponding improvement in their health. One of the first signs of improvement in the state of a child##'##s nutrition is that he grows faster. And our children are growing faster. The Health Department in Glasgow reported early this year that boys of thirteen years of age are more than J in. taller and more than 2 lb. heavier than boys at the same age in the five years before the war. What about mothers? You can judge the health of mothers best by the infant mortality rote - that is, the number of children who die before the age of two years. The two things which do most to cause a high death rate are bad housing and bad feeding. Now, owing to the war, housing is worse and overcrowding is worse, but the infant mortality rate has fallen. In England, the average rate in the five years before the war was 57 per 1,000; in 1942, it had fallen to 48. In Scotland it was 77 per 1,000 on an average in the five pre-war years: in 1942, it was down to 69. </para>

                    <para class="block">Last week I described the effect of ample milk and foods on the health of mothers in preventing stillbirths and miscarriages, ensuring the health of new-born children, and reducing the mortality and incidence of crippling diseases. Honorable members will recall that I mentioned a daily addition of 30 oz. of milk, 1 egg, 1 orange, 3$ oz. of canned tomatoes, 1 oz. of cheese, 1 viosterol capsule, and two  tablespoonsful  of wheat germ. This brought dietary levels up to moderate requirements. Of all those##'## foods, one viosterol capsule is the only thing that is provided under this bill, and people might not obtain even that if it be a proprietary line! Only one of six foods which are absolutely essential to reduce infant mortality and build up the health of mothers is mentioned. Eight at the beginning of our national health scheme something should be done about this omission. It should take precedence of everything else. </para>
                    <para>The National Health and Medical Research Council recommends a scheme for the controlled distribution of milk. This system would supply customers in the priority group with the quantities of milk that they order - the quantity recommended by their medical advisers. This raises the question whether milk should not also be regarded as being on the same plane as medicines. If they are indispensable to recovery, they should be supplied on the same basis. </para>

                            <para>- In 1935 the Government of which I was a member expended ##£##250,000 for the purpose of providing additional supplies of milk for the people. On that occasion, the Commonwealth induced the States to take an interest in the matter. The present Government has appealed to the States for co-operation in various matters; but the Minister in his second-reading speech gave no indication that the Commonwealth intended to seek the assistance of the States in its scheme to provide free medicine. In addition, the Government of which I was a member helped1 to finance the King George V. Memorial Hospital, which is the bast equipped institution of its kind in Sydney. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the question of the order in which the medical programme should be outlined and implemented, Surely .the order must be the prevention of sickness, if possible, by the maintenance of people in health through nutritive food and hygienic conditions of life. For this, the best foundation must be a healthy mother and healthy children, and this must go back to good1, suitable and abundant food. The health value of diet, its power to start  vigorous  growth, in children to make blood and bone, and to give strength of sinew and nerve, depends upon the quantity of protective foods consumed. These protective foods, like milk and eggs, are rich in vitamins and minerals. It is just as valuable to get these out of a bottle of milk as out of a bottle of medicine, which, in the last analysis, is composed of the same mineral and vegetable constituents. </para>
                    <para>Preventive medicine is a most important aspect. During the last 40 years, great advances have been made in preventive methods and, as the result of  achievements  in this sphere, huge territories throughout the world, especially in tropical areas, have been rendered habitable with an almost negligible amount of sickness and an extremely low death-rate. I see nothing in the bill to indicate provision for immunization against diphtheria and the use of anti-typhoid serum. They are required for maintaining the  health  of the people. What does the Government propose to do? I am afraid that the Government has begun at the tail end of the organization instead of at the head. When I began to practice 40 years ago, diphtheria was a most deadly scourge amongst children in Australia. Deaths numbered many thousands a year. With the discovery of the diphtheria serum and later with the introduction of immunization, the death-rate fell until now it is very low. The onset of. infectious diseases should be countered by prophylactic treatment, such as immunization against diphtheria, and the use of anti-typhoid serum. I am not clear whether the bill provides for these. </para>
                    <para>If health cannot be maintained and sickness intervenes, the most important items in their proper order are skilled diagnosis, correct treatment, and hospital accommodation with adequate equipment to ensure recovery. Provision of medicine is one part of this treatment; but it is useless without the other factors. What are the relevant positions of the adequate supply of these various factors? I find that the Social Security Committee has indicated in its sixth report that the pharmaceutical service in Australia at the present time is adequate for any reasonable expansion in the dispensing of medicines that are needed. Although the Government has tackled only provision for the dispensing of medicines, the committee reports that the other essential factors, such as hospital services, are hopelessly inadequate. The committee points out, on page 54 of its sixth report, that there is a deficiency of 6,690 beds in general hospital services. We need 64,000 beds and we have barely 57,000. There is a very big deficiency in the convalescent homes. The committee was struck with the number of elderly people with chronic diseases accommodated in beds for acute cases because there was nowhere else to go. These prevented acute cases being treated as early as possible, and lengthened the ultimate time of their stay in hospital and the quantity of medicine taken. In mental hospitals there was a deficiency of 6,994beds. Of maternity hospitals the committee stated that, apart from a few, the facilities were conspicuously lacking in the proper standards for ensuring the safety and future health of mother and child. This position, of course, increases the quantity of medicine that must be taken by people not able to be properly treated in hospital. In the case of tuberculosis, the committee set out on pages 49 and 50 of its report that the position was hopeless. There was a deficiency of 2,963 beds for tuberculous people, assuming that two tuberculous cases died for each bed each year. It has been proved beyond question that where the tuberculous parent remains at home there is double the rate of infection of children. Consequently, we have a vicious circle of more medicine being necessary for these, more hospital accommodation and more ill health and infection of the general community by reason of our failure first of all to have proper accommodation. In addition, the committee says that the maintenance of nutrition in the families of tuberculous persons is an essential factor in the prevention and control of tuberculosis. Therefore, we come back again to the original question. We must deal with the prime factors of health before wo can hope to deal with ill health. That is axiomatic. There is no short cut. All of these suggestions would limit the quantity of medicine that would ultimately become necessary to the people, would improve the birth-rate, lessen infantile and maternal mortality, tend to reduce sickness, make diagnosis more accurate and assist substantially in improving the health and longevity of the people of our nation. </para>

                    <para class="block">We are left in the dark as to the formulary. I, myself, have always prescribed individually. It will be found that the most successful practitioners and specialists always do so. Are patients to pay for these prescriptions as well as the fees of the specialists? Let me give two instances : A very common mixture is ##"##mist.gent.alk##"##. This is used really only as a basis for treatment. Certain cases would need the addition of a sedative like potassium bromide or a laxative like cascara. If there is such an addition to the formula, the patient would apparently then pay for the mixture, or the doctor would give the patient two bottles and the Government would pay for two bottles of mixture instead of one. Take another case: Big proprietary houses like Burroughs Wellcome and Company (Australia) Limited, Parke Davis and Company or Shering Proprietary Limited, whose research establishments have cost them millions of pounds, and who employ some of the greatest chemists in the world, specialize in special standardized drugs. Take digitalis - the great heart tonic which has been used for many hundreds of years. Digitalin is the alkaloid of digitalis, or the active principle. In tincture of digitalis, the strength of this active principle varies, so one of these chemists has made a preparation called digoxin, which is absolutely standard, but it is a proprietary medicine and a patient would have to pay for it. Or take the case of certain skin lotions: The purity of the drug makes all the difference to the result of treatment. Special firms specialize in certain drugs. What does the bill provide in that respect? Surely, rather than have a formulary, it would bo better to have a costing system with the chemists, for which they would be paid according to what was used. The chemists are willing to install this costing system at their own expense, but if the Government believes that it should do it to safeguard completely its own financial position, the estimated cost is ##£##30,000. Therefore, from an insurance point of view, it is worth 1 per cent, to assure the wisest and most satisfactory expenditure of ##£##3,000,000 on medicine - a matter which may determine one##'##s life or death, or the continuance of chronic ill health, or whether one##'##s cure is rapid or slow. </para>
                    <para>The third point is: Does the bill ensure co-operation with the medical profession and with the States? ##'##Cooperation with the medical profession is indispensable to the success of any national health scheme. Unfortunately, the Government##'##s approach to the matter is very clumsy. In the Senate the Government inserted clause 16 in the bill, which was not in the measure originally, but which as it stands, as the Minister in the Senate interpreted it, practically opens the door wide to the nationalization of ##'##the medical profession. Clause 16, which, as I have said, was inserted by the Senate, is worrying members of the medical profession. They are quite agreeable to the special conditions of remote villages and settlements where there is no doctor, being met in this way, but they believe that unless there is some qualification, this provision may be the thin end of the wedge of nationalization of the medical profession. Doctors arc willing to discuss this whole question on its merits, but they are strongly of the opinion that a vital step such as this should not be taken when more than one-third of the members of the medical profession are on active service and have no opportunity to examine whatever scheme may be put forward. When this matter was discussed by the present Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> whilst he was Minister for Health and Social Services, with members of the medical profession and chemists, the Minister said quite plainly that in his opinion it was quite wrong that such a step should be taken in war-time. This is a matter which cannot be tackled without the full cooperation of the medical profession, and that full co-operation will not be given by medical men if they suspect that they may be double-crossed, or that the interests of the men who are away in the fighting forces will be prejudiced. My own strong view is that the nationalization of the medical profession would cause a deterioration of the calibre of its future personnel. The best men would go abroad as was the case with members of the engineering profession before the secondary industries of this country were built up to such a degree that they offered reasonable opportunities for employment. At that time, our best engineers went overseas and helped to build up the industries of Brazil Malaya, China and other countries. Only one out of every twenty remained in this country. The same thing would happen with the medical profession under a scheme of nationalization. In my opinion the health of the people of this country is so important that the medical profession should attract the highest quality of service. When I become ill, I invariably seek the best medical advice available, because I realize that my health is at stake. It would be dastardly for any legislature to take action which would result, in placing the health, and perhaps the lives, of the people of this country in the hands of men in whom they have no confidence. In any case, how would such a scheme operate? Obviously it would not be possible for the work of medical men to be divided into shifts of say eight hours. Is it suggested that a child should be left half-bom, or a wound halfstitched? What would happen in the case of doctors who were called upon to travel great distances to see their patients? In such cases the double journey, together with the time devoted to attending the patient, might involve a stretch of 24 or 36 hours without a break. The success of medical men to-day lies in the fact that they are able to devote continuous personal attention to their patients. Many patients are alive, to-day because their medical practitioner was able to visit them eight, ten, or twelve times within 24 hours when they were desperately ill. In that way a doctor is able to watch for the first sign of a flagging pulse or an alteration of condition. New men attending a case at the end of every eight hours could not acquire full knowledge of a patient##'##s ailment, nor could a number of men treating one case have the same personal interest in the patient. </para>
                    <para>In regard to co-operation with the States, the Government has not stated whether it has discussed this measure with the State health authorities. That is an extraordinary state of affairs in view of the fact that the new powers which the Commonwealth seeks to acquire at the forthcoming referendum include power to deal with ##"##health in co-operation with the States ##"##. Health administrations must endeavour to get as close as possible to patients, and to the cause of disease. Disease and cause of disease in human beings can be treated satisfactorily only by the man on the spot, and so the administration of health must begin with the local governing authorities and rise through the State system to be finally co-ordinated by the Commonwealth controlling body. That has been recognized in the history of cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States during the last twenty years. In 1923, the question of ensuring co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States on health matters was raised at a Premiers##'## conference, and as a result of the ensuing discussions we have had annual meetings of the health officers of the various States and of the Commonwealth ever since. When there was a danger of the Commonwealth branching out into research activities, in dependently of the States, the then Commonwealth Government, of which I was a member, brought into being the National Health and Medical Research Council. Since then, that body has coordinated all the medical research activities of Australia. Its report upon the whole question of health follows the line that I have taken in the course of this speech. It insists that the questions of primary importance are the nutrition of mothers and children, and then of other members of the community, appropriate hygienic housing and living conditions, ample hospital accommodation, skilled medical attention and, finally, the provision of appropriate medicines. I suggest to the Government that it should follow the advice of that body which has no politics, but has great knowledge and experience. </para>

                        <para>.- I regard this measure with mixed feelings and some misgivings because I believe that it has no substantial scientific basis, nor do I believe that there has been any great demand for it. During the whole of the time that I have been a member of this House, I have not received a single request for a scheme such as this. However, the Government has brought the measure forward as a preliminary instalment, of a comprehensive national health and social security plan. Personally, I should have preferred a full-blooded scheme of national health and social security, and I regret that the Social Security Committee has been more or less by-passed in regard to this matter. That committee has done excellent work and already legislation based upon its reports has been passed. This is a matter which could well have been considered by that committee in relation to the larger subject of national health and social security and so brought into its true perspective. I have been unable to ascertain just where this proposal originated. It is being ushered into the world by ##"## Drs.##"## Chifley, Holloway and Fraser, but I should be interested to know just who fathered it. In my opinion the scheme should have been brought forward in a more scientific manner, instead of in  thi3  half-baked fashion. I should have preferred a wholesome dish, well cooked and with the right ingredients. No  doubt, many anomalies will arise in connexion with this scheme. I hope that the Government will review it after it has been in operation for a period, with a view to placing it on a more scientific basis. There must be consideration of who will really benefit. I was rather surprised to note that before the scheme was introduced, certain outside vested interests were consulted. The Pharmaceutical Guild has adopted the principle, and has come to an agreement as to the prices that will be paid by the Government for the medicines supplied. Before that arrangement was made, the matter might have been further investigated and an arrangement made with the friendly societies; because the statistics in relation to their operations disclose that they can dispense medicines at a cheaper rate than is fixed under the arrangement with the Pharmaceutical Guild.

                        <para>The high price of drugs is shown in the big increase in our drug account, but the expenditure is beyond the control of the board and is due largely to the scarcity caused by the war. </para>
                        <para class="block">Despite those factors, they are able to dispense medicines at a rate considerably less than will be paid to private vested interests under this scheme. I note with satisfaction that the Government has brought the friendly societies within the scope of this measure, and that the Minister has intimated that the different State Governments will be asked to enlarge the activities of the friendly society dispensaries, which are limited under the existing State law. I realize that the Commonwealth cannot make provision in that regard because the matter is one purely for the States. The Dispensary and Medical Board, from whose report I have quoted, embraces numerous societies which are operating in the district. In 1943, the average membership was 3,147 ; the number of patients was 33,848 ; the number of prescriptions was 60,084; and the average number of prescriptions per member per annum was 19.09. That works out at an annual levy of 12s. per member, his wife and family. At the rates which are to be paid by the Government the comparative cost would be <inline font-style="italic">##£##21s.</inline> 3d. per annum. The initial rate in New Zealand was lower than the existing rate of 3s. 3d. Therefore, the prices payable under this scheme are likely to increase, and the total cost of it will probably be considerably greater than the estimate. Other items, too, have to be considered. An after-hours fee of1s. will be added to the cost. There is also an agitation for the early closing of chemists##'## shops in some States, and that may ultimately increase the cost of medicines. The Government should give serious consideration to the utilization of the machinery of the friendly societies, because they have a democratic basis and are operated on the mutual instead of the profit-making principle. The societies that I have cited have a panel of 27 doctors, and the members of them may make their own selection in respect of prescriptions and medical service. I hope that the Government will preserve in every waythe rights of the friendly societies, and will do what it can to avoid a repetition of the experience of New Zealand, in which the tendency was for the membership of the friendly societies to be reduced as the result of the operation of the scheme of social services. Under the bill, the rights of friendly societies and their dispensaries have been recognized, and they will be reimbursed for any loss that they may incur. On its face, that appears to be all right. But we have to bear in mind that many friendly society dispensaries, being principally workers##'## organizations, are operating in localities which are convenient to the needs of the workers ; many of them have bought land and erected dispensaries in back streets. Under this scheme, the natural tendency will be to have a prescription dispensed at the nearest chemist shop. The private chemist has his business premises in a central position, or handy to a railway station. In New Zealand, there has been <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> falling off on this account of prescriptions dispensed by friendly society dispensaries. ##'##Therefore, it is essential that the representations of the Commonwealth to the various States shall prove successful if friendly societies are to be preserved. I urge the Government to use their administration in connexion with the scheme generally, including the policing of it. If a huge organization, employing many hundreds,be set up, another vested interest will be created, and the chemical combine will share the benefit with the departmental officials. With drugs, as with many other things of which we partake,the more we have the more we want. I have seen many new drugs come and go. To-day, it is M and B; tomorrow, penicillin; and next week, perhaps, something else. </para>

                        <para>Press reports have consistently indicated that the Government intends to proceed with the introduction of a scheme of social insurance based upon the New Zealand plan of social security, but of a non-contributory nature. Friendly societies will not oppose the introduction of a scheme which will extend to all sections of the community the benefits they already give. This has been their ideal for many years, and it only requires the correct legislation and government co-operation to make this ideal a ##"##practical and working reality. However, we find a lack of readiness to accept the advice and experience of our friendly society leaders, but a leaning towards schemes which will give certain monetary benefits, and if persisted with to the fullest, extent will cause irreparable damage to the friendly society movement. . . . </para>
                        <para>During the first two years of social security, New Zealand membership decreased rapidly. Friendly society membership in 1938 was 113,709. In 1939, it receded to 109,059, and in 1940 to 104,436. This has still further receded, until to-day the total stands at less than 100.000 members. Almost every activity in which friendly societies are interested has commenced to decline. A striking example is the Wellington District Manchester Unity Hospital Association, whose membership has decreased each year since 1938, when the total membership was 1,786, until in 1942 the membership was 1,230 only. </para>

                        <para>.- I protest emphatically against the action of the Government in forcing this bill through the chamber at this hour of the morning. I stronglyobject to its bulldozing tactics. The few members who remain in the chamber are listless, and the measure should receive the close attention of all honorable members. One is now almost past astonishment at the actions of this Government. This scheme for the provision of free medicine is premature. I am in favour of free medicine when it can be properly distributed, and properly used by the public, but that is not possible under this proposal. The Government should withdraw the bill and re-introduce it at a more suitable time. It is significant that the Social Security </para>

                    <para class="block">Committee  was  not consulted by the Government, although it had been charged with the duty of drawing up plans for social services, and particularly medical services. The committee had been in negotiation with the medical profession and had arranged for the setting up of a medical planning commission, which had travelled over a great part of Australia and elicited facts of much importance, including many relating to pharmaceutical services. I suspect that the Government did not wish to consult the Social Security Committee lest that body should report unfavorably upon its proposal. I suggest that this scheme, which the Government is now seeking to foist on the country, is the offspring of a companionate marriage between the Director-General of Health and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> without benefit of clergy or medical advice. As a matter of fact, in the preparation of the scheme no one was consulted who had any immediate interest in the problems involved. There was certainly no consultation with members of the medical profession or with chemists. Who has ever asked for a scheme of this kind? The people do not want it, because they are far better off now than they have been for years, and are well able to afford to buy medicines. The chemists do not want it, so why has it been brought along at this moment? The idea occurs to one that it is a nice piece of window-dressing. The Government says to the public, ##"## Look what we are going to do for you. We have a great deal of money - here, take some of it ##"##. It is hard to believe that, at a time like this, when there is so much expenditure to be met, the Treasurer can have surplus cash burning a hole in his pocket; but apparently that is the case. The Minister for Labour and National Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> has said that the scheme will cost ##£##2,000,000 a year. I suggest that he is over-optimistic. At the present time, 20,000,000 prescriptions a year are made up for the public. It is almost certain that the number will be increased, because people will ask for more when they do not have to pay for them. The estimated average cost of 20,000,000 prescriptions is 2s. each, whereas I understand that the average cost of prescriptions at the present time is about 3s. The Minister has  said that a system of free medical service for the giving of prescriptions is also to be introduced, and that, too, will cost a lot of money. It may well be that the total cost will eventually be as much as ##£##6,000,000 or ##£##7,000,000 a year. Why should all this money be spent on something which is unnecessary? There are other services upon which it could be much more profitably expended. The first is the provision of better hospital facilities, as advocated by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline> A survey made by the Medical Commission showed that there is a shortage of 16,000 beds in hospitals throughout Australia. Great numbers of people have to wait months before gaining admission to a hospital. A part of the money might also be diverted to combating tuberculosis. The death rate in Australia from this disease is rising. We are fortunate in having, perhaps, the best climate in the world, yet the death rate from tuberculosis is higher than it  ought to be. In Ontario, Canada, the death rate from tuberculosis has been reduced from 80 per thousand to 16 per thousand. Deaths from tuberculosis in Australia have increased from 40 to 46 for each 100,000 of the population since the war began. In the treatment of that disease there is a field for the expenditure of money to great advantage. The Government may say that it cannot provide labour and materials for the construction of sanatoriums, but it could provide cash benefits to the dependants of persons undergoing treatment. Or it could subsidize a system under which milk would be distributed free to children, or it could extend the existing child welfare system. Instead of expending money in these directions, which would be of real benefit to the community, the Government proposes to expend large sums in providing free medicine which is not required by the people. </para>
                    <para>I turn now to certain principles underlying this measure, which, in my opinion, are wrong. For instance, the scope of the medicines to be made available will bc limited to a pharmaceutical formulary. I speak, not as a medical man, but as one who has consulted with doctors on this matter, and  understands  their view. Hot one doctor in 100 issues the same prescription for the same disease in different persons. A doctor takes into account the personality of his patient, the particular form of the disease, and even has regard to the locality in which he lives. All these things influence him in prescribing the medicine for his patients, but under this bill a doctor will be tied down to a limited formulary. Another point which arises relates to the administration of this legislation. The administration will be vested in the Commonwealth Department of Health. From that fact two important considerations emerge. First, in any medical service the cash benefits should be divorced from the administration of health services. That is to say, the technical aspects of health should be entirely separate from the cash benefits. </para>

                            <para>- Yet  this  bill means the introduction of a form of salaried medical service. I know the dilemma in which the Government finds itself. The main objection to this scheme was that it imposed a means test, inasmuch as a person who required medicine would be called upon to pay a doctor 7s. 6d. or 10s. 6d. for a prescription, and it was t,1 ought that that might prove a hardship to persons in poor circumstances. The Government did not wish to force any sick person to pay 10s. 6d. for a prescription which would entitle him to receive a free bottle of medicine, and so it decided to include in the hill a provision that prescriptions should be issued free in certain circumstances. At the time, I do not think that it was realized that that amounted to the setting up of a salaried medical service. Obviously, no person who feels unwell will ask a doctor to prescribe castor oil. He does not know whether he should have castor oil or, say, insulin. He goes to the doctor and says, ##"## Doctor, I am not feeling well, and I think I ought to have some medicine ##"##. Obviously, before the doctor can prescribe he has to put him through a thorough medical examination. That is borne out by clause 22, read in conjunction with clause 16, for clause 22 lays down that the doctor shall conduct an examination. </para>

                            <para>- It is a lovely idea, but I do not want it in such circumstances. The fact is that, if the Government sets up doctors to carry out these examinations, it will be setting up a salaried medical service. I look forward to the time when we shall have a national medical service, but it cannot be established without due consultation with, and the concurrence of, the profession, and full working out of the details. It cannot be established in an underhand way. The whole proposal has aroused the medical profession, which very naturally resents that at the time when negotiations are proceeding on the very subject of the establishment of a national medical health scheme, such a scheme should be introduced by back-door methods. This scheme means nothing but the beginning of a salaried medical service. For that reason, this proposal should be taken out of the bill or so modified that the fears of the medical profession and my own fears may be set at rest. It is premature if not unnecessary. I think that the time will come when it should be brought in, but that time is not now. Planning for the future, especially for the future of medical services, is like working out a jig-saw puzzle, as any one who has studied this problem knows very well. This provision should be the last piece of the whole puzzle instead  of  the first. When the rest of the pieces have been set in place it will fit in very nicely, but at present there is no place for it to fit into. </para>

                        <para>.- 1 believe that in another place <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> said that particular medical services could not be called a part of a long line of services but were a piece of a circle which would have to be completed piece by piece. This measure is a part of that circle which in due course will be completed. From the arguments of honorable gentlemen opposite, if one believed them, one would be led to regard the dispensers of medicine as nothing but ##"## crooks ;:, and to believe that medicine was unnecessary; but I believe there would be a tremendous outcry from the public if the Government banned the dispensing of medicine on the ground that it was not necessary. It is necessary, and will always be necessary in some instances. This measure is only a part of a scheme, the purpose of which will be to reduce to the limit disease and ill health by preventive medicine and other essential measures, in measures to protect the health of the people many factors count, among them being not only medical attention and curative medicine, but also preventive medicine, improved housing and working conditions, and healthy surroundings for adults and children. I could list many other needs, but those suffice for now. The scheme embodied in this measure will, in the long run, prove to be a valuable unit of a comprehensive medical and national health scheme. The Governmentrealizes that there is a tremendous shortage of hospital beds and other facilities necessary for the care of the sick. Tt would like to be able  to embark on the provision of hospital accommodation for every one in need of it and all the other needs which would make for a more healthy people, but the limitations on the availability of labour and material imposed by war and the necessity to fight the war to the finish prevent it from doing all that it would like to do. Whatever it can do. notwithstanding the war, the Government is determined to do. This bill incorporates one of the things that it can do and is determined to do. I do not want honorable gentlemen to run away with the idea that this bill is a new departure. Free medicine is the vogue in other countries, for instance, New Zealand, and some States of the United States of America. No evidence has been adduced to show that the system has been abused. As a general rule, people do not ask for medicine unless they are in need of it, and I do not think that it is likely that the people, except a few who are always seeking some panacea or other, will be likely to abuse the privilege that the Government is extending to them by this means. On the contrary, this measure, if it be properly administered, will do away  with  many abuses, and. I should like honorable gentlemen opposite to bear that aspect in mind. </para>

                    <para>For years, friendly societies have been providing for their members a free medicine service on a smaller scale than that which this Government proposes to provide and which should have been provided many years ago by its predecessors. The friendly society dispensaries now face a serious problem as to how they shall maintain their membership and continue in business. I shall submit on behalf of the friendly societies a suggestion which, with the Government##'##s approval, will enable them to continue their good work. Although I intend to speak on behalf of friendly societies, I believe that their members will not suffer in any way under this scheme, because they will receive probably greater benefit than hitherto. </para>

                            <para>- The Government will be doing in a bigger way what the friendly societies have been doing, and, in considering a big national scheme of this character, one cannot allow oneself to be influenced against it by consideration of organizations which have been doing the same work on a smaller scale. At the same time, we must let down these societies as lightly as possible. We can do so by assisting them to continue their good work on a modified scale. In some States, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, friendly society dispensaries are not allowed open trading rights. This Government, should ask the State Governments to extend those rights to those  dispensaries. Such laws are entirely a matter for the States. I urge the Government to do all it can to persuade the State Governments to amend their laws in order to give assistance to the friendly societies in that direction. By doing this we shall enable them to retain a very large proportion of their existing membership, and carry en almost as effectively as they have done in the past. Of course, the friendly societies themselves must make greater efforts to sell their wares, as it were, to the people as a whole, and endeavour to offset the disadvantage at which they will find themselves in relation to the Government##'##s scheme by offering more attractive concessions to the average person. Certain other aspects of the operations of friendly societies##'## dispensaries have been brought to the attention of the appropriate Minister; and I have no doubt that he will give those matters careful consideration. I understand that the wishes of the friendly societies in respect of man-power representation on the board have already been met; and I have no doubt that other matters raised by honorable members on this side relating to the future operations of friendly societies##'## dispensaries will receive due consideration. We should do all we can to help those dispensaries because they render valuable service to many people. At present they serve about 20 per cent, of the people. I support the measure. It is a step towards the establishment of a comprehensive medical scheme, and those responsible for bringing forward these proposals are to be commended. I believe that in the years to come our people will look back upon this measure as the first, and probably the most progressive, step ever made by any government in this country towards conserving and improving the health of the people. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member said that this measure represented the first step towards such a scheme. Actually it is a part of such a scheme, because it provides for the engagement of doctors to diagnose complaints and to prescribe for patients; and it provides that the prescriptions themselves shall be farmed out by the Government at the Government##'##s expense. In essence, therefore, this is a part of a medical health scheme, and the Government##'##s introduction of the measure represents a breach of faith on the part of the Minister for Labour and National Service. The British Medical Association accepted his word, and thereby was deprived of any opportunity it might have had to give advice to the Government on these proposals. The association was thus deprived of the opportunity to combat unfavorable features of these proposals, or to take steps to challenge evils, which, as experts, they foresee will arise under this legislation. Having originated as the result of a breach of faith on the part of a senior Minister of the Government, this scheme can hardly be expected to be successful. To say the least, I am surprised that a Minister of the standing of the Minister for Labour and National Service should break faith in this matter with such a reputable organization as the British Medical Association. </para>

                    <para class="block">The hill will provide another feast for the bureaucrats. It will enable them really to spread themselves. By this clause, they will be able to draft regulations as a doctor drafts prescriptions; and such regulations, I have no doubt, will be almost unlimited. We are reaching an extraordinary position when, apparently, the Parliament itself is not prepared to accept the responsibility of laying down the terms and conditions of a measure of this kind, but prefers to surrender that responsibility almost entirely to the Public Service. In this case, we are saying, in effect, to the bureaucrats : ##"## In this measure we have set out in broad principle what we wish to do, and we now hand over to you full responsibility for its administration and extension.##"## Recently, I read a book en titled <inline font-style="italic">The New Despotism,</inline> in which I came across the following remarkable observation : - </para>

                    <para class="block">That statement can be applied to Australia; but bureaucratic control is becoming a menace in this country only because the Government and Parliament are prepared to give increasingly greater powers to public servants. When we pass a measure of this kind which deprives Parliament of the right to set out the terms and conditions under which the bill should operate, we are simply asking for trouble; and I have no doubt that in due course we shall reap as we sow. </para>
                    <para>Whilst this bill is supposed to be designed to improve the health of the people, that, object could be achieved in many better ways than by providing the benefits here proposed. One of the ways which comes readily to mind is better hospitalization. More than 6,600 additional beds are required in general hospitals throughout Australia, whilst hospitals treating tubercular patients require an additional 3,000 beds. The Government designed this scheme without first having consulted the medical profession and others who have a profound knowledge of conditions affecting the health of the people. Without the advice of experts, the Government, produced this bill out of the blue, enunciated a few general principles and left the Public Service to ##"## carry the baby ##"##. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Gaha)</inline> have emphasized the necessity for an increased flow of migrants to Australia, and we are told that the Australianborn are our best immigrants. The rate of maternal and infantile mortality is still too high and requires investigation and preventive methods. Instead of tackling that problem, the Government has introduced this bill, because it will be popular with the people, and, therefore, a vote-winner. In reality, it is a continuation of the dole, giving to the people something for nothing. </para>
                    <para>The purpose of the bill is to make the Government popular, and no regard has been paid to the method of financing the scheme. Representatives of the medical profession, whom the Government did not consult, declare that the proposal is unsound and unworkable, and limits the freedom of the medical practitioner in prescribing for a patient. Any action of the Government that will restrict the freedom of a doctor in treating his patient certainly will not benefit the patient. Being charged with the maintenance of the health of the community, doctors should not be subject to any interference in the discharge of their high obligations to citizens.- But the Government, in order to win votes, is prepared to restrict the freedom of doctors. </para>
                    <para>The Government has never attempted to explain its proposals for financing the scheme. The Opposition would like to know whether the cost will be ##£##1,000,000 or ##£##20,000,000, but the Government does not appear to know. It is asking the Parliament to present it with a blank cheque to cover the cost of the experiment. Unemployment and sickness benefits will absorb the whole of the ##£##30,000,000 that is paid annually into the National Welfare Fund. How does the Government propose to finance its scheme for providing free medicines? The object of the Government is ##'##ultimately to establish its own dispensaries and it will be quite happy in. distributing bottles of coloured medicine to the people. The colour of that medicine will certainly be red. </para>
                    <para>What benefits shall we receive from this indefinite and undefinable proposal? Clause 7 provides that the pharmaceutical benefits shall consist of ##"## uncompounded medicines, the names of which, and medicinal compounds the formulae of which, are contained in a prescribed formulary to be known as the Commonwealth Pharmaceutical Formulary ##"##. The public will be entitled to a free bottle of medicine. The bill provides also that a person shall not be disqualified from receiving any pharmaceutical benefit by reason of his sickness having been caused by his own misconduct. That is very interesting. A person will be able to make himself sick as many times as he pleases, and be certain of getting bottles of coloured medicine. I visualize anold man saying to his great-grandchild : ##"## You see, my dear, that red bottle of medicine on the shelf? It was given to me in 1944 when a Labour Government was in office. By 1947 a United Australia party government had replaced it, and gave me a blue bottle. The yellow bottle of medicine was given to me when I had jaundice, and the green bottle was presented to me when I had a neutral disease ##"##. Great-grandfather will be able to recount his medical history from a glance at the coloured bottles of medicine on the shelf. </para>
                    <para>Clause 9 provides that - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Where any person has received any pharmaceutical benefit in accordance with a prescription or order therefor, that person shall not be entitled to receive the pharmaceutical benefit again on that prescription or order unless a direction to that effect in the handwriting of the medical practitioner concerned is included in or added to the prescription or order in accordance with the regulations. </para>

                    <para>When a doctor writes a prescription at the present time, the patient may use it as many times as he requires. The bill will alter that practice, because the patient will have to obtain a new prescription from the doctor whenever he needs another bottle of medicine. For the first prescription, the patient pays the doctor a consultation fee of 10s. 6d., and each bottle of medicine costs him 3s. 6d. When this bill becomes law, the patient will receive free medicine, but will pay the doctor 10s. Gd. every time he requires a prescription. The scheme appears to be so advantageous to the medical profession that I marvel thai doctors have not hastened to accept it. Plainly, a patient may obtain only one bottle of medicine with one prescription. If the patient requires six bottles of medicine, he must visit his doctor half a dozen times The chemist will be obliged to enter that prescription half a dozen times in his books. There is no doubtabout the waste of man-power, that is likely to be caused by the bill. It is an extraordinary measure. I am rather concerned that the Minister has been so niggardly in setting out its merits. He should certainly have spread himself, whereas he has not done justice to it at all. Clause 16 contains the arrangements for the provision of medical services. It is as follows : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into an agreement (oi##&gt;## such . terms as to remuneration, allowances and otherwise as he thinks fit) with any medical practitioner providing that the services of the medical .practitioner shall be available without charge to members of the public for the purpose of furnishing prescriptions and orders for the .purposes of this Act. </para>

                    <para class="block">Here we visualize a doctor sitting at his desk, with his .pen behind his ear - and be will have plenty of time to put it there - with a line of people queued up outside. The doctor says to Johnnie, ##"##What ##'##is wrong with you, Johnnie?##"## and Johnnie replies, ##"##I do not know, but mother says I have got adenoids##"##. So the doctor writes out a prescription for adenoids and turns to Sally, saying, ##"##What is the matter with you, Sally?##"## Sally replies, ##"## I do not know, but mother says I have a terrible headache ##"##, so the doctor writes out a prescription for aspirin. Then grandfather comes along and says he has rheumatism, and the doctor writes out a prescription for rheumatism. The doctor will not examine those people and find out their complaints, because he is only there to write out prescriptions, of which he will have a long list for the various diseases. When he thinks he has given enough of one kind, he may turn to another list for the sake of variety. The more I look at the bill, the more I marvel at it. Clause 17 provides - </para>

                        <para>. - It was not my intention to speak on the bill, especially at this early hour of the morning, but I could not keep silent after hearing the paltry contribution of the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> to the debate. After listening to his stupidity during the afternoon and again in the early hours of this morning, I realize more than ever the great necessity for free medicine or free pharmaceutical services. The first person who should seek to benefit from the provisions of the bill is the honorable member himself. If I were a pharmaceutical chemist I should prescribe for him a bottle of arsenic, and if I were a medical practitioner I should prescribe for him detention in a lunatic asylum. It is remarkable to hear such expressions regarding this bill from any members of this House. At one time I thought that it must have been an accident that brought the honorable member so near to political oblivion at the time of the last general election, but evidently the electors of Wentworth knew the capabilities of the honorable member, and probably that was the reason why he was almost excommunicated from this House. He said that this was an extraordinary bill. It is, because for the first time in the history of Australia it offers free medical service to the people. The extraordinary part is that at last, after 40 years, we have a government which is prepared to realize the necessity for building up a healthy and virile population. The honorable member for Wentworth spoke of hospitalization. We are putting first things first. By giving to the people a free medical service we shall in some measure be able to relieve our congested hospitals. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - I wish to reply briefly to certain statements made by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline> First, I agree that in normal circumstances, a scheme such as this would not have been introduced as the first instalment of a comprehensive social security plan. However, I made it quite clear in my second-reading speech, that more important matters such as the provision of facilities for the treatment of tuberculosis, increased maternity ward accommodation, and improved hospitalization generally, could not be dealt with at the present time owing to shortage of man-power and materials. This scheme, however, is something that can be inaugurated now, and I cannot believe that the people of this country will refuse to accept free medicine just because the Government is unable at present to introduce a comprehensive hospitalization scheme. </para>

                    <para>The right honorable member for Cowper treated honorable members to a very interesting and instructive lecture about the need for certain types of food for children. That does not concern this measure at all. I remind the House that for twenty years at least another medical man in this chamber - I refer to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> - consistently advocated the provision of free milk for children, but his representations received little encouragement from the right honorable member for Cowper. We all agree that there is a need for certain types of foods for children, but the provision of these foods would not eliminate the necessity for a pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The right honorable member then proceeded to say quite confidently that there were half a dozen well-known and very necessary drugs which would not be included in the formulary provided for in this measure. How does he know that they will not be in the formulary? So far. nobody knows exactly what drugs and preparations will be listed in that formulary. </para>

                    <para>It has been alleged also that this scheme was prepared without consultation with the medical profession; but how could I  have given a promise to the British Medical Association had I not been in consultation with its representatives? That promise was made in 1942, and has been kept. The fear that is expressed in regard to clause 16 is that it is the first step in the nationalization of the medical profession; but I suggest that honorable members opposite are well aware that to-day hundreds of medical officers are working on a salary basis. In fact, quite a lot of them were appointed by the Governments of which the right honorable member for Cowper was a supporter. The right honorable member is well aware that last year I, myself, conferred with leading members of the British Medical Association and that those members agreed on behalf of their association to set up committees in the various States to consider the registration of refugee doctors. The result was that approximately 80 doctors were registered, and most of them are now providing a salaried service in certain areas of the Commonwealth which, owing to the lack of opportunity offered to a private practitioner, did not have the services of a medical officer available to them. For many years we have had salaried medical officers performing various duties. For instance, we have had a flying doctor service ona salary basis ; we have had salaried doctors doing quarantine work, serving on board ships, and attending to lighthouse staffs, and examining members of the various services when they go into camp and when they come out; yet the right honorable member for Cowper suggests that this is the beginning of a salaried medical service and apparently is prepared to fight clause 16 to the bitter end! The intention of clause 16 is to provide a medical service in areas in which no doctor is stationed at present. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> is inclined to be reckless in his statements, and one does not take notice of them; but I do take notice of the statement by the right honorable member for Cowper that I had made a promise to the  president  of the British Medical Association, and had put it in writing so that he could read it to a conference of the association, that there would be no nationalization of medical services during the war. I did make that statement. I stated the policy of the Government, and promised that the interests of the 3,000 medical men in the fighting forces would be protected. I said that the Government would ensure that the places of doctors who were away with the forces would not be taken by refugee practitioners. In my letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Sewell,</inline> I stated - </para>

                        <para>In reference to the question of nationalization of the medical services or a complete salaried medical service, and the fact that such a scheme may be introduced in the absence of so many medical men abroad, I can only say that no comprehensive scheme could be put into operation with so many men away, even if other organizing and/or financial difficulties could be worked out during the war. Hence I can assure you that no complete salaried service will be inaugurated during the war. But because amongst other special circumstances there are so many medical men going away, it will be necessary to adopt emergency methods to meet the circumstances thus created, such as employment of refugee doctors now in Australia, the redistribution of members of the medical profession left in Australia, and in some cases, employment of such members in salaried positions, and the compulsory fixing of areas of practice or service, ##&amp;##c., if and when necessary. At the moment, such emergency methods and more look like being necessary to meet civil and war needs, and when they are they must be and will be resorted to. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the promise which I made, and there has been no violation of it. Speaking to the  president  of the British Medical Association in Melbourne, after he had asked me for this letter so that he might take it to a conference, I said : ##"## I can give the promise on behalf of the Government that there will not be a major nationalization scheme while 3.000 men are in the forces, but not that no unorthodox steps will be taken ##"##. I pointed out to him that, whilst the Government could decide who should and who should not have steel, lead, copper and zinc, the principle of preference could not be applied when people were sick; all of them, whether they were civilians or soldiers, had to receive medical attention. I said that, when there was not a doctor in a district, we would find means of placing one there, and if he could not live on the fees that he received, we would pay him a salary. We paid salaries, bought motor cars, provided homes, and supplied instruments, in order that our people might have the medical attention to which they were entitled. If that be regarded as a form of nationalization, we have no apology to offer. If one more doctor is added to the 100 eminent doctors who are now salaried men in our service, the right honorable gentleman objects. </para>

                            <para>- That is all that this means, and the right honorable gentleman knows it. Two Commonwealth salaried doctors were employed in the Darwin hospital. When Darwin was raided, they, with three nurses, attended to 330 cases, after the first bomb fell and until  darkness  set in. That night, the hospital was bombed and the hot water and electric light services were put out of operation. Those two doctors completed what they had to do in the light given by hand torches held by the matron. Both of them received a decoration for the wonderful job which they did under fire, after many other persons had cleared out and left them, Whenever a doctor is not available, and it becomes necessary to implement this scheme, we will engage a medical man and pay him a salary. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have taken that provision from the New Zealand act. That dominion has given effect to the claim of the medical practitioners that their right to prescribe should be unrestricted.

                        <para>Holding this opinion we consider that it is . essential that in the acceptance of responsibility for the treatment of the sick the medical profession must be entirely untrammelled in regard to the therapeutic measures to be adopted. </para>
                        <para>For this reason we feel that the welfare of the sick would be seriously jeopardized by the adoption of any scheme which would limit the freedom of a doctor in prescribing for each of his patients exactly what medicine he regards as most suitable to restore him to health. </para>

                    <para class="block">I understand that the only objection of the Government to the adoption of this policy is that the installation of a costing system which would enable it to make certain that the medicines prescribed were accurately dispensed, would involve an expenditure of ##£##30,000. This scheme will cost at least ##£##3,000,000 a year. As the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> said, it may cost very much more than that. The experience of New Zealand was that the quantity of medicines dispensed and consumed increased by approximately  500  per cent, after the free medicine scheme was established. An expenditure of  ##£##30,000  would be reasonable in order to ensure that the drugs prescribed by the medical profession were dispensed in their entirety and without qualification by the chemist. That would constitute a really free medicine service. As the position stands, this will not be an all-free medicine service. The Minister has stated that payment will have to be made for any additions to the formula; the items prescribed may be reduced, but not increased. Medicines ought to be proscribed for individual cases. That has been the basis of the most successful practice. Success was achieved because more cures were effected, and in quicker time. The security and health of the community are paramount considerations. Nothing but the best is good enough for Australia. Therefore, I hope that the Government will accept what is the practice in New Zealand, which is in complete accord with medical wishes and advice. </para>

I asked the Minister a question regarding the implications of this clause, and he said in his reply that the provision would apply only to remote places where there was difficulty in obtaining satisfactory medical assistance. I am satisfied with his assurance. Apparently, the Minister gained the impression that I had said something derogatory about salaried medical officers. That is not so. I can speak in the highest terms of the work done by public health officers, but, regarding general medical practice, I am firmly of the opinion that the best results to the public will be obtained by the retention of the present system of individual practice. I do not doubt the high qualifications of public health officers, nor have I any doubt that they dp their work satisfactorily. I would be the last person to say a word against them. </para>

                    <para class="block">This measure has been introduced for the purpose of enabling more liberal treatment to be accorded under the Maternity Allowance Act to mothers in respect of multiple births. Honorable members are aware that the Government last year liberalized the provisions of the Maternity Allowance Act for the purpose of assisting mothers to meet the heavy financial commitments inseparable from childbirth. The means test was removed, the minimum allowance was increased from##'## ##£##4 10s. to ##£##5 and the intermediate rate was increased from ##£##5 to ##£##6. In addition, provision was made for the payment of an amount of 25s. a week in respect of each of the four weeks immediately preceding and following the birth of a child. This resulted in a total payment  of ##£##15 being made in cases where the mother had no other surviving children under fourteen years of age, ##£##16 where there were one or two other children, and ##£##17 10s. where there were three or more other children under fourteen years. </para>
                    <para>Section 5 of the principal act provides that a maternity allowance shall be payable in respect of each occasion on which a birth occurs and the child is born alive or is a viable child, but only one allowance shall be payable in cases where more than one child is born at one birth. Frequent representations have been made to the Government for additional payments to aid mothers in cases where multiple births occur, but in view of the provisions of the law it has not been possible to accede to the requests made. Expenses such as additional clothing and other equipment are undoubtedly much heavier than in the case of a single birth and there is greater necessity for employing domestic assistance. The Government now proposes that where a mother gives birth to twins the weekly amount of 25s. shall be increased to 37s. 6d., and in the case of triplets to 50s. This will result in an additional payment of ##£##5 in the case of twins and ##£##10 where triplets are born. The total amounts payable might be more clearly illustrated by the following table : - </para>
                    <para class="block">The estimated additional expenditure in providing this extra benefit is ##£##10,000 per annum. </para>
                    <para>As previously indicated, the rate of maternity allowance varies according to the number of ##"## other children ##"## born prior to the birth in respect of which a claim is made, who, on the date of that birth, are under the age of fourteen years and living, and are either the children of the claimant or of her husband by a previous marriage and are wholly maintained by the claimant or her husband or by both of them. The age limit of fourteen years is anomalous when compared with that of sixteen years for child endowment, widows##'## pensions, war pensions, seamen##'##s pensions and allowance and compensation payments. It may appear more inconsistent if, as seems probable, the normal school leaving age throughout the Commonwealth is eventually raised to sixteen years. The introduction of a uniform age for Commonwealth, benefits so far as children are concerned is most desirable, and to achieve this object for maternity allowance purposes would be comparatively inexpensive. At the most the cost would not exceed ##£##15,000 per annum. The bill, therefore, provides for an increase in the age limit for ##"## other children ##"## from fourteen years to sixteen years. </para>
                    <para>Section 9a of the Maternity Allowance Act which relates to the payment of a maternity allowance to selected classes of aboriginal natives of Australia empowers the Commissioner to direct that payment of a maternity allowance to an aboriginal native shall be made to an authority of a State or territory of the Commonwealth controlling the affairs of aboriginal natives, or to some other person whom he considers to be suitable for the purpose, for the benefit of the claimant. The term ##"## aboriginal native ##"## is regarded as meaning one in whom there is a preponderance of aboriginal blood. There arc many cases in which half-caste aborigines and, in some isolated cases, white persons are living as aboriginal natives on government stations, reserves and settlements.. In such cases, it would frequently be in the best interests of the claimant if the maternity allowance were paid to some other person for the benefit of the mother rather than that she should handle the money which is at times misspent either by the claimant or her husband. Provision has, therefore, been made in the bill to give the Commissioner power to do this in such cases as he may deem desirable to ensure that the maternity allowance is used for the purpose for which it is intended. </para>

                        <para>.- -After the lucid explanation of the bill by the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> the Opposition will not oppose the measure. Increasing the age of the dependent child when calculating the benefit to the standard age of sixteen is perfectly logical. The increase of the weekly contribution in respect of multiple births is also a feature of the proposal to which serious exception cannot be taken, because undoubtedly there is increased expenditure associated with multiple births. The only point that arises is that the Minister is not optimistic enough when he stops at triplets. He might have saved trouble at some later date if he had allowed the bill to go further. The provision dealing with the payment of the allowance to a delegated person, instead of direct to the mother, is one to which exception cannot be taken. Speaking generally, the only fault that I can find with the measure - and I believe that I speak for others also - is that this bill is about 40 years too late. </para>

                    <para class="block">A few days ago, a Supply Bill covering essential requirements for the first two months of 1944-45 was agreed to by this House. That bill has not yet been dealt with in the Senate. The Government has decided not to proceed further with it, but instead to ask Parliament for Supply for a period of three months. Accordingly, a bill for ##£##51,959,000, covering requirements for the first three months of 1944-45, is presented. </para>
                    <para>The provision may be summarized under the following heads: - </para>

                    <para class="block">The provision in the bill covers only the estimated requirements to carry on the essential services on the basis of the provision in the Appropriation Act passed by Parliament for the current year 1943-44. </para>
                    <para>The amounts set down for ordinary services represent, with minor exceptions, approximately one-quarter of the 1943-44 appropriations. </para>
                    <para>Excluding special appropriations, it is estimated that, in the first three months of 1944-45, the total war expenditure will amount to ##£##128,000,000. That is somewhat less than one-quarter of last year##'##s appropriations, as expenditure in the first three months is invariably below the average of the year. The sum of ##£##37,000,000 provided for war services represents the estimated amount which will be available from revenue receipts for the (first three months of the year, after making due allowance for other obligations. The balance of war expenditure will be met from loan appropriations. </para>
                    <para>As in previous years, provision is made for ##"## Advance to the Treasurer ##"##, the amount being ##£##5,000,000.

                    <para>No .provision has been made for any new expenditure except in respect of defence and war services, and there is no departure from existing policy. </para>
                    <para>Although the bill will .provide for requirements for the first three months  of the next financial year, I give to honorable members the assurance that Parliament will be called together earlier if necessary.

                        <para>. - When the question of Supply was originally discussed between the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and myself, the notion was that three months##'## Supply would be asked for. I consider that that is quite reasonable. After all, as I said the other day elsewhere, the Prime Minister should not feel under any great pressure of time in completing his important work overseas. I can very well understand that he would feel uneasy if financial provision for the necessary services had not been made for a period completely adequate to cover all the contingencies of his journey. So I have no objection whatever to the passing of this bill in substitution for that with which we dealt the other day. </para>

                        <para>.The Australian Country party takes no exception to the change of plans of the Government, and approves the proposal to grant Supply for three months. It is recognized that to seek from Parliament during March Supply for the months of July, August and September is to take an extraordinary step, and the granting of it can be justified on this occasion only by the circumstance of the visit of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> abroad, coupled with the assurance given by the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> - which I would have sought had it not been given - that if the- circumstances of war, or any other circumstances of special national import, should require such a course, the Parliament will be called together before the end of the present financial year. </para>

                    <para>. - The purpose of the motion is to obtain parliamentary appropriation for the expenditure of an additional ##£##10,000,000 of revenue for war purposes. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>When the budget was presented to Parliament in September last, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> estimated that the total revenue would be ##£##345,000,000. The budget was framed to provide an appropriation from revenue of a like sum, including ##£##167,000,000 for war purposes and the balance for other expenditure. Some of the revenue items will exceed the budget estimate. The estimate of ##£##64,000,000 for revenue from customs and excise may be exceeded by ##£##3,000,000. Sales tax, as the result of a larger volume of trade, due to the increased purchasing power of the community, may show an increase of ##£##1,500,000. Direct taxation, other than income tax, may bring in an extra ##£##500,000. Post office revenue is likely to yield ##£##1,500,000 in excess of the budget estimate. On the other hand, income tax cannot be reliably forecast at this stage. The Government hopes, however, that the budget estimate of ##£##192,500,000 will be realized. Other sources of revenue, together with savings of expenditure, other than war, may make an additional amount of up to ##£##3,500,000 available for war purposes. On the best estimates that can be made at this juncture, it is likely that the revenue budget will show an improvement of ##£##10,000,000, and it is this sum which it is now proposed to appropriate for war purposes. </para>
                <para>In the September budget, the Treasurer informed the House that war expenditure in 1943-44 would be ##£##570,000,000. Notwithstanding that the rate of expenditure to date has been below the proportion of the budget estimate for the expired portion of the year, the Treasurer is inclined to the view that the actual expenditure will reach the budget estimate. If there is any increase, it should not be very great. </para>
                <para>If the improvement of the revenue budget amounts to ##£##10,000,000, the effect of the proposed, appropriation will be to relieve loan account and to charge revenue account with an amount of ##£##10,000,000 without increasing the total expenditure. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to refer on this motion to a question which lias on two or three former occasions engaged the attention of Parliament, but still remains, so far as I can judge, unsettled. I refer to the internment of certain men because of their alleged association with the Australia First Movement. I am not concerned this morning to endeavour to determine the strength or weakness of the facts of any individual case. That is not my function, and probably Parliament would not consider that it was it? function, either. The circumstances which call for the  closest  and fullest inquiry by some properly constituted body are these: Right back in 1942, on the 26th of March, the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> made a statement - he was then the Minister concerned with internments - and that statement related to an allegation that sixteen or twenty persons, who were believed to have been associated with the so-called Australia First Movement, had been arrested and interned. Honorable members will recall the nature of the statement then made. I##'##-am nol for one moment saying that the Minister did not believe that the circumstances warranted the making of the statement. I merely point out that the statement indicated fifth column activity of the worst kind, including sabotage and conspiracy, and that was subsequently elaborated to include conspiracy to murder. On that date, with particular reference to the name of (his organization, the people of Australia were informed that a deadly plot bad been discovered, and that sixteen to twenty persons had been interned in order that the community might be protected. </para>

                        <para>- 1 am sure it did. The story was published under streamer headlines. It became a topic of discussion among 90 per cent, of the people within 24 hours. In fact, at that time, a number of persons, about sixteen 1 believe, were interned in the eastern States. At the same time, several persons were detained and interned in Western Australia. The allegation against those who were interned in the eastern States was, apparently, that they were associated with the Australia First Movement, and that they could not be, with safety to the public, left at large. Subsequently, prosecutions were launched in Western Australia, and convictions obtained, but in the course of obtaining them it became abundantly clear that the small group of persons in Western Australia had no connexion with the Australia First Movement in the eastern States. What they had done was to concoct a scheme to get. affiliated with the larger body, their desire being to tag on to it. </para>

                <para>After the internments had continued for some time, the Attorney-General made a statement in this House on the 10th September, 1942, in the course of which he made it clear that, on the material before him, there was no evidence that the Australia First Movement members in New South Wales were parties to the plans of the conspirators in Western Australia. He said - lt is reasonably  clear  that there was no guilty association between the Western Australia conspirators and the sixteen New South Wales internees. </para>
                <para class="block">I regret to say that the Attorney-General then went on to read a series of extracts from the correspondence of persons associated with the Australia First Movement in New South Wales, written from 1940 onwards until 1942 - each of a rather sinister kind, but not one of them, I am informed, written by one of the interned persons. </para>

                        <para>- I shall take one case to illustrate the gravity of the matter we are discussing - which is the right of the ordinary citizen to liberty in this country, unless deprived of it under due process qf law. One of the men interned is a solicitor. I happen to know him quite well, because he went through the university at the same time as I did. He had been practising as a solicitor in Melbourne for a long time. His association, so I am informed, with the Australia First Movement amounted to this : Some man who had secured appointment with the movement wrote to him and asked him to subscribe, and he forwarded 10s. 6d. as a subscription. </para>

                        <para>- He did, indeed. Never before was 10s. 6d. spent with more disastrous results. In due course, his name appeared as a member of the organization, on the strength of his having subscribed 10s. 6d. Then he was haled out of his home, imprisoned and put in an internment camp. He was there for month after month. In the camp he was compelled to perform the most menial tasks. Nothing worse could happen. All that time he was without charge and without trial. Subsequently, facilities were made available, and his case went before a tribunal. It recommended his unconditional release, and he was released - after being for months in an internment camp in his own country, of which he is a native of the second or third generation. </para>

                        <para>- What the Attorney-General says is illuminating. I have taken the case of this man, because it was explained to him that he had been taken up because he was associated with the Australia First Movement, and he was imprisoned and interned. So far as the charge was put to him, the whole occurrence arose out of his association with the Australia First Movement. He was interned for eight months, and then released unconditionally. Now the Attorney-General says that he was not one of the men to whom he referred. This means that not one of those letters cited by the Attorney-General contained a statement by the man I am talking about. I know this man, and I know something of the disaster which this has brought upon him. Other honorable members are more familiar with other cases, I know. Here is a man who for twenty-odd years was building up a practice as a professional man. He was taken out of his home, just as anybody might be. He was incarcerated in circumstances of immense notoriety. When he came out, what happened?  His  friends were gone, his practice was gone, his reputation was gone. Everything that was of importance to him had gone. We all are familiar with the cynical proverb which can do so much harm : ##"## Where there##'##s smoke there##'##s fire ##"##. People will ask him, ##"## Where have you been ? Oh, in an internment camp? Well, you can##'##t tell us that you would have been in an internment camp unless the authorities had some reason for it. Were you mixed up with the Australia First Movement?##"## ##"##Well, yes, I paid a subscription to it.##"## ##"##Oh##"##, they would say, ##"## those are the people who conspired to murder, and who entered into a treasonable correspondence with the Japanese - to become, in the truest sense, the quislings of Australia.##"## Just imagine the position of that man. I might have been in that position myself. </para>

                <para class="block">Anybody might have been. So far as I know, it is not suggested that there was at any time any real reason for this man##'##s incarceration. That statement by me may be true, or it may be untrue. I believe it to be true. It may be accurate, or##'## there may be inaccuracies as to detail; but, having regard to the notoriety of the occurrence, nothing will satisfy me and, I hope, other honorable members, which stops short of an independent investigation of these cases, with the payment of compensation, and the public clearing of their names, if it turns out that these persons have been unjustly used. </para>
                <para>I have received correspondence from another man in this category, a man who fought in the last war, and who had engaged in business in Australia in a certain line of production. He was whisked out of his house without a moment##'##s notice, and now his business is gone, and he is ruined. It is nothing to the point to tell me that because, after months of internment, he is released, that washes out everything. There can bo no greater or more permanent stain on a man##'##s reputation and his name for generations than that he should have been thrown into an internment camp in time of war. That is the proper place for people guilty of conduct even remotely Treasonable if the community is to be protected. But if, in .point of fact, it is true that one, two, three, four or what you will, of these men who were interned in connexion with the Australia First Movement were wrongfully interned when they were innocent people, then I say that just as the injury was done with all the notoriety of headlines so must the clearance be established with equal publicity. I do not want to elaborate that. Two or three of those cases, on which I have received correspondence, are strange cases, and if one wanted to go into them one might speak for an hour, but my purpose is not to convert this House into a tribunal. ##'## My purpose  i3  to ask the Attorney-General, who, after all, as I know, has an instinct for justice on these matters, whether he does not believe that, having regard to all the circumstances to which I have referred, he should set up a tribunal and say to that tribunal, ##"##Go into the cases of these men. Determine whether there were ever real reasons for their internment, and, if you find that there were not and that some great error was committed, bring in a report and we shall publish their names and clear their names and compensate them for the ruin that has come upon them ##"##. </para>

                    <para>. - ##&gt;##I do not intend to speak at great length, but I want to remind the committee of some of the facts about this matter. The details of this case are set out in a statement which I made to the House on the 10th December, 1942, shortly after my return to Australia from abroad. At that time there was a change of administration of the Security Service, and I took over from the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> There were these men to whom I can conveniently refer as the Australia First group. It consisted in the main of sixteen persons from New South Wale.?. There were also, as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> pointed out, other persons from Western Australia. First, in the case of the Western Australian internees, I said quite frankly -in that statement that there was no guilty association between them and the sixteen internees from New South Wales. I pointed that out for this reason: there had been a trial in Western Australia by the Chief Justice of the Western Australian internees. I think that four persons were tried before the Chief Justice. </para>

                        <para>- At that time of extreme crisis early in 1942, the military authorities certainly had just grounds for suspecting this organization of being ready to act the part of quislings in the event of Japanese success in North Australia. I think that that is an under-statement. </para>

                <para class="block">Director-General of Security and thu State  deputy  directors. The only function that I fulfil is to look independently into cases about which special representations are made. Nearly every honorable member has approached me at one time or another about matters of internment. As I pointed out in my statement, I have always leaned, perhaps at times more than I should have, in favour of liberty. I have taken the view that no man should be detained or have his movements restricted unless security is really endangered. In ##"##Western Australia, four persons were tried on a charge of conspiracy to take over the Government of Western Australia in the event of the Japanese successfully invading Australia. Nothing could have been more serious, especially at that time, and in such circumstances. The jury found that two of the accused persons were guilty and two not guilty. The two who were found guilty were imprisoned. It does not follow from that verdict that the persons who were found not guilty could safely be allowed their freedom at that time. I speak from memory, but I am confident that the Chief Justice of Western Australia, who was  chairman  of a special tribunal dealing with cases of internment, recommended the continued detention of the two persons who were acquitted, and they were kept in detention under National Security Regulations. </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable gentleman referred mainly to the cases from New South Wales. My view is that as danger to security becomes less in the course of the war, so the situation of every person under restriction must be reviewed from time to time. Detention of persons is a precaution. If the precaution is not necessary in the opinion of the competent authorities, the doubts should be resolved in favour of liberty. I stated that principle in the statement which I made on the 10th December, 1942. I ask honorable gentlemen at their leisure to read it. I have no intention to read the details of that statement now. </para>

                <para>I come now to the action of the Army authorities. Any Minister must rely on recommendations made by his officers, because it is perfectly obvious that he cannot have at his personal command the full details of any particular matter, and when he ordered their internment, the Minister for the Army acted on the recommendation of military intelligence. There was correspondence between the Western Australian group and the New South Wales group, and, in a moment of great national peril, the military intelligence authorities recommended to the Minister for the Army the detention of the persons involved. The Minister acted on that recommendation. With regard to the New South Wales men, their ##'## case was brought up by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> and I think other honorable gentlemen. The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> referred to some of the cases. I immediately caused a special inquiry to be made by a specially appointed committee consisting of the Director-General of Security, the  Deputy  Director of Security, New South Wales, the officer in charge of Military Intelligence in New South Wales, the Assistant Director at Canberra, and a member of the Security Service. They all joined in recommendations upon which I acted immediately. The result was that four of the New South Wales internees were immediately released. Only in four of the cases was it decided that full internment should continue. The majority were released under restrictions. Some of the reasons for the detention of the four were contained in the schedule of correspondence attached to my statement. The right honorable gentleman suggested that this correspondence consisted of extracts from letters written by others than those who were detained, but certainly the greater proportion consists of extracts from letters taken by the military intelligence authorities or the Security Service from the files of the persons who were detained. </para>

I am conscious of the fact pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition that it must be approached calmly and solely in the interests of national security. The extracts were from the letters written by those persons. There is no doubt whatever that at that time, judging by their own speeches and letters, a number of those people were not only ready, but were preparing, to act as quislings in the event of a Japanese invasion. </para>

                        <para>- It is obvious that in time of war mistakes occur from time to time in action to ensure national security. Internment was not invented by this Government. As soon as the war broke out the Menzies Government commenced to intern people. National security is supreme. The previous Administration set up tribunals to deal with cases of mistakes and alleged mistakes. The cases dealt with by those tribunals included the one mentioned by the right honorable gentleman. The man whom he mentioned apparently brought his case before one of the appeal tribunals and was subsequently released. In some cases men have been released although the appeal tribunals have expressed doubt on the point. The whole matter is looked upon solely from the point of view of the interests of national security. It is only right that I should bring to the attention of the right honorable gentleman some of the statements on which the authorities acted at that time. </para>

A meeting of some twelve members (selected) of the better elements in the Australia First Movement will be called early in the new year to discuss the proposal already suggested in the above few lines. It is hoped you will be prepared to co-operate with us in this new and perhaps difficult work. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members must realize where that course would lead. Some of the men who have been released have behaved themselves not only within the restrictions imposed upon them, but also as loyal Australian citizens should do. The last thing that they would like is the ventilation of the facts of their internment. One man in this group is in a different category. Although he had the right of appeal to the constituted tribunal, he would not exercise it. He applied to the court for release by habeas corpus, and failed. He would not exercise his right of  appeal,  although he was repeatedly invited to do so. He wanted a public inquiry into all the circumstances of his particular case rather than appeal to a tribunal which did not sit in public. That privilege could not be granted to him in particular. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps he could have been tried for treason. Perhaps it is still possible for him to be tried for treason. I cannot deal with the matter in an offhand- manner. It is serious. This man has an action for damages pending in the courts against the Commonwealth. He claims that certain acts that were done amounted to illegalities, and, therefore, I cannot possibly discuss the whole facts of that particular case. </para>

                <para>I deal with the whole of the Australia First group under two divisions. First, there is the Western Australian group, members of which were tried by the courts. Two were found, guilty of seditious conspiracy and two others were found not guilty, but their detention was subsequently recommended by the Chief Justice. The security officers are at present reviewing those cases. Some honorable members have written to me on their behalf. The second division is the New South Wales group, practically all of whom have been released, some of them unconditionally and others under restrictions. Finally, there is the case to which the Leader of the Opposition referred, namely, a solicitor who was not mentioned by me as belonging to this group. His was a case of which \ cannot, on the spur of the moment, give the House any details, but he appealed to the constituted tribunal. The Leader of the Opposition stated that the tribunal decided in his favour. I have no knowledge of that; but he was subsequently released. One important point which the Leader of the Opposition mentioned was the matter of compensation. Should the Commonwealth compensate persons who have been detained and who, when their cases are investigated by a tribunal, are released either unconditionally or under restrictions? Short of that. should the Commonwealth make a statement calculated to clear their names? I do not want the matter to be dealt with in a general or haphazard way. One must examine the facts of each case. Many of the persons concerned do not want the facts ventilated. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to consider the matter. I see the force of the contention. One man, an Australian writer, was released on my order immediately I became aware of the facts. I consider that the action taken in that instance was wrong, and T believe that the security officers were considering whether compensation should be paid to him. I am prepared to review the whole of the cases of men who have been released, when I get an opportunity to see ho,w they can be fairly wound up in the interests not only of themselves but also of the Commonwealth. That is how I approached the problem originally in dealing with difficult cases of security. One##'##s mind has to balance two things. First, there is the danger to the country of having at large persons who, at one time at any rate were prepared to act the part of quislings. Secondly, there is the presumption in favour of liberty, which is very dear to me. That is the position. </para>

                <para>I have told the House frankly about these cases. Some honorable members opposite have asked me about individual cases, and I am unable to give the information without fuller consideration. But broadly, the position is that nearly every one of the persons originally detained has now been released. But the situation of the country has also changed. One might release them in 1944, but it might not have been safe to have them at large in 1942. Some of them, perhaps, should not have been detained, but that is a reflection, not upon the Minister for the Army, but upon the efficiency of military intelligence officers, on whose advice he acted. The matter was reviewed as soon as was possible and an attempt was made to apply to every case the principles that I have outlined. A few mistakes may have occurred, but if so, they were honest mistakes. A real attempt was made to meet the requirements of justice. I do not object to the Leader of the Opposition having raised the subject. He has frequently brought cases of detention to my notice. I believe he will confirm my statement as to my general approach to this subject. </para>

                    <para>. - Counsel for the defence holds a very difficult brief. He has been eminently fair in respect of his observations on the subject, though he has placed undue emphasis on the cases of three men to the exclusion of thirteen others who were charged with subversive action but against whom there was no case. The right honorable gentleman practically confined his remarks to the three men. That may be good legal argument, but it. does scant justice to the thirteen men who were unfortunate enough to be caught in the toils. Let us try to reconstruct the conditions that obtained during the fateful ##"## ides of March ##"## when the Minister for the Army became so excited. The honorable gentleman does not usually give way to excitement, but on that occasion he was panic-stricken. In his most melodramatic manner he stated in this House that these individuals were members of a subversive organization of great strength, that they were prepared to welcome the Japanese to this country, and that they had compiled a list of Ministers and other public men whom they proposed to murder. The honorable gentleman also said that in the interests of the security of the nation he had taken strong steps to intern the leaders of the movement. From that moment there began the greatest travesty of justice in the history of this country. Immediately after the Minister##'##s statement was made, the names of these individuals were published by some outside authority, although the Minister had not mentioned them in the House. Against most of the persons concerned there was no evidence whatsoever ; yet their names were published to the world,  with the result that their lives have been ruined. They have been ostracized by their friends and acquaintances, they have been subject to public ridicule, and they have  been  interned. What has happened to these people is what happens to those who have been interned under Nazi and Fascist rule. They have been forced to perform the most menial tasks. In order to show how their lives have been affected, I shall read extracts from some letters that I have received. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> do not propose to mention the names of the persons concerned, but I am prepared to furnish them to the Attorney-General. </para>

It is of no use for the Attorney-General to say that he released certain individuals as soon as he was aware that they had not been engaged in subversive activities. That does not meet the needs of the case by any means. As soon as the Attorney-General realized that these men were guiltless he had a duty to perform in respect of them. He should have done everything possible to clear their name and to restore them to their former place in the community as decent citizens. But what happened?

Something should have been done at once to restore the good name of these people. Moreover, there is a sinister aspect of certain happenings in relation to some of them. By devious means the Government has tried to placate certain individuals by offering them a cash payment in settlement of their claims. In one instance, I believe, the amount was ##£##250. </para>

It would appear that a species of Dutch auction is being conducted in regard to the freedom and liberty of the people, the Government being prepared to restore liberty under certain conditions. These persons cannot regain the position which they enjoyed prior to their incarceration. Their release confers on them no advantage other than that of their liberty, because they have been robbed of their good name, ostracized by their friends, and held up to public criticism, disrespect and contumely. Men who have been wrongly arrested and interned can regain a measure of their former status only if a full statement be made clearing their names. They should also be reimbursed the cost of defending their honour and their good name, and should be paid compensation which would assist them to remould their shattered lives. </para>

                    <para>.-  After to-day, the Parliament will go into a long recess of probably five or six months. I deplore lengthy recesses. After the general elections were held last year, there was a short sessional period, followed by a recess of about four months. The present sessional period has lasted for seven weeks, and is to be followed by another lengthy recess. Many problems and grievances will arise between now and the next meeting of the Parliament, but rank-and-file members will not have the opportunity to ventilate them in the Parliament. There is a number of matters with which I have not so far been able  io  deal. I realize that, in granting Supply lo the end of September, honorable members gave consideration to the fact that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> will be out of Australia for many months. I give way to no one in my admiration of the personal self-sacrifice and devotion to duty of the right honorable gentleman during the present war, and I am sure that every honorable member wishes him well in the important mission that he is undertaking. But that is not a reason for the closing of the Parliament during his absence. The Prime Minister of Britain, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill,</inline> has travelled extensively on a number of occasions during the war, and the House of Commons has sat during his absences. The Government will have a good working majority in both branches of the legislature after the 30th June, and I know of no reason why the sitting should not be resumed shortly after the 1st July. The transaction of pub llc. business would thus be facilitated, and honorable members would be enabled to devote attention to matters which affect their constituents. The gesture of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> is generous on its face, but in the circumstances is not at all necessary, because the Government has a good working majority and does not need the assistance of the Opposition to enable it to carry on. Ministers should bear in mind that they are dependent on the rank and file of the party. If honorable members cannot meet the wishes of their constituents, they may lose their seats and the Government##'##s majority may disappear. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Honorable members opposite have referred to the Australia First Movement. Other more subversive forces are at work in the community, and they constitute a greater danger to the nation than do the few cranky individuals who constitute the Australia First Movement. Their influence is more sinister, particularly in industry. The supporters of an erstwhile renegade Labour leader - Trotsky-eyed revolutionaries - are seeking to obtain control of the key transport and food unions, with a view to paralysing industry completely. The Government has evidence that these disruptive forces are at work. For that reason, there should not be a long recess. If they had their way, this Parliament would never meet again. I hope that the Government will investigate their ramifications. </para>
                <para>The Villawood estate, in my electorate, was compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth for the purpose of having erected on it a large government establishment. The Prime Minister has promised that the matter of valuations in respect of property compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth from private owners will bo reviewed, but the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> who has control of the matter, will not alter the existing system, even though it has operated unfairly against many persons whose properties have been compulsorily acquired. The Villawood estate was subdivided and sold to intending home builders in the boom period of 192S-29. These were not the only people who were adversely affected by the subsequent financial depression. Many of them had not completed the payment of their purchase instalments and,##"## being unable to continue to make them, were compelled to allow their blocks to revert to the ownership of the original holders and suffer the loss of the payments which they had made. Others who had completed the purchase were compelled to sell their blocks at a sacrifice, because they needed ready cash t,o enable them to live while the breadwinner was unemployed. The valuations placed on the blocks by the ValuerGeneral of New South Wales are considerably less than the purchase price. A married couple, who are constituents of mine, purchased two blocks at ##£##120 each, intending to build a home on them. One of the blocks has been compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth, and the valuation placed on it for acquisition purposes is ##£##43. These people had not completed their payments, and had to continue the instalments on the remaining block. What they had already paid on both blocks was appropriated in order to meet the deficiency on the block resumed. Thus the original vendors will derive the benefit of whatever payment may be made by the Commonwealth. Although the acquisition occurred a couple of years ago, the Commonwealth has not yet seen fit to make any payment, despite the representations that have been made in that regard. </para>
                <para>A young lady who is contemplating matrimony had almost completed her payments, when her property was resumed at approximately one-third of the purchase price. </para>
                <para>It may be contended that boom prices were paid for these blocks of lami. Whilst some of the purchasers sacrificed their properties during the depression, and ##"## cut the loss ##"##, others continued to pay their instalments, in the expectation that eventually the land would regain its original value. This estate had a bright future, because the metropolitan residential area was extending in its direction. One gentleman sought a large site on it, intending to erect a factory, and provide homes in its vicinity for prospective employees. Had the Commonwealth not entered into occupation, the district would have become a settled suburb of Sydney. Therefore, it had an attractive value in prospect. Reasonable compensation should be paid for the land acquired, and the values should not be pegged at the low level of the depression years. The position would not be so bad if the intention were that the property should remain for all time in the ownership of the Commonwealth. But the control of the works is in the hands of Imperial Chemical Industries Limited, the big international chemical combine, and probably it is the only organization which will be able to take them over in the post-war period. As a matter of fact, there is already that tendency, because government employees have been dismissed and the permanent staff of the company has been increased. Eventually, the company will have the advantage of having obtained at a low cost properties compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth from private individuals, and will derive the benefit of an enhanced value, whereas the dispossessed owners will have to seek elsewhere for land on which to build homes. They have lost their savings, and will have to provide from ##£##100 to ##£##150 in order to obtain suitable home building sites in that district. Their experience furnishes strong evidence of the need for an alteration of the present system of fixing the values of properties which are compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>A widow or a retired person who may wish to purchase house property or a block of flats in order to obtain a regular income, is not permitted to do so unless the war loan investment is sufficient to warrant approval ofl the transaction by the delegate of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley).</inline> Yet insurance companies, which have large investments in war loans, are permitted to purchase large blocks of flats at a cost of thousands of pounds. Recently, a brewery company in Melbourne purchased hotel property of a value of ##£##500,000, without being obliged to make any further investment in a war loan. Constituents of mine, 1 have found, have not been able to purchase even a small block of land with a view to the erection of a home on it, because of the restrictions that are imposed. The question of valuations also comes into this matter. The ValuerGeneral of New South Wales makes valuations on an arbitrary basis, mainly for the purpose of rate collection. He does not attempt to examine the matter in detail; because, if a local governing body does not receive from the rates that are imposed the amount which it requires, it can increase the rate over the whole of the properties. Therefore, the ValuerGeneral##'##s assessment cannot he taken as a proper guide. I have here particulars of a very sad case, that of the wife of a serviceman. She resides in Bankstown, where, apparently, there are plenty of materials for the erection of buildings other than homes.

It is disgraceful that motor vehicles, tyres, petrol and man-power should be wasted in such circumstances. </para><para>I am disappointed that an interim report has not been presented to Parliament this session regarding the Government##'##s post-war housing programme. Who is supposed to be drawing up plans for post-war reconstruction? Certainly, Parliament has not been consulted in the matter. Members of Parliament are responsible to the people, and will eventually have to answer to them. We read in the press from time to time that it is proposed to do such and such a thing, but Parliament is given no information, nor are the Government##'##s own supporters. In January last, the annual conference of the Australian Labour party passed a resolution urging the appointment of a full-time Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, but nothing has yet been done to that end. We know that, in the United States of America, the Government##'##s post-war plans are well forward, and ##"## big business ##"## also has been drawing up its post-war programme. If the Government does not wish to appoint a full-time Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, it could, at any rate, appoint a parliamentary committee to deal with the subject. The State governments are making preparations now for the post-war period, and private members of this Parliament could be usefully employed on the same task. With the second front in Europe about to open, the war might be over before the House meets again. What a chaotic situation would exist if that were to occur, and our post-war plans  were not complete. The men and women in industry, and in the fighting services, expect us to have plans made for their transfer from war to peace time occupations when the war ends. I urge that, although the matter has not been attended to during the present sittings, the Government shall give urgent consideration to it, because the people of Australia and the members of the forces look to the Government for a lead in that regard. </para><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2468</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>L0G</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RYAN, Rupert</name><name role="display">Mr RYAN</name></talker><para>.- Two days ago when I asked the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> a question regarding the prices received by producers of .whole milk, I received what I consider to be a most unsatisfactory reply, one which indicated the complacency with which the Government views the situation of the dairying industry. The Minister said, among other things, that the price paid to suburban dairymen for home milk was at a record high level. I do not dispute that because I have not been able to go far enough back into the records to check the statement. But that is not the issue; the issue is that dairymen are not receiving enough. To say that the price is at the highest level ever reached proves nothing. All prices, whether of primary or secondary commodities, are at record levels.. The Minister also said that, generally speaking, this matter had not been affected by political considerations. I readily agree. I do not raise it for political motives. I recognize that the Government has done a lot to help the industry. But it has not done enough, and I want to ensure that more shall be done to make the industry more attractive. The Minister##'##s third contention was that the action taken by the Government in respect of this industry had proved satisfactory to the farmers. It may be commended by some farmers, but none in my district has ever done so.

The price of hay is now ##£##7 or ##£##8 a ton and the quality is inferior. We had the example the other day of one of the Senate Ministers who had to pay about twenty guineas for a suit of clothes. That is not evidence of his prosperity. It is only proof that people have to pay high prices in order to get clothes. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture will admit that the prices of all goods and services which the dairymen have to buy have risen appreciably since the war began. The cost of implements of all kinds has risen enormously. The cost of fertilizers is subsidized, but the subsidy is not sufficient to compensate farmers for the higher prices that they have to pay for fertilizers when they can obtain them. I have already referred to the increased prices of dairy  cows. The new award has forced up the cost of labour. In his reply, the Minister said that the Government was helping dairymen to-day by subsidizing the cost of concentrates. Excellent as that assistance is in theory, it is of no use in practice, because the farmers cannot buy concentrates in anything like sufficient quantities. The price of oats was reduced to 2s.1d. or 2s. 3d. a bushel. That would be a real benefit if oats were obtainable, but no one can buy oats.

Instead of following the practice commonly adopted in this chamber of talking in generalities, I shall present the Minister with some facts which I am sure he will be glad to get. Those facts are contained in the following statements of accounts, which all tell the same story, namely, that the price paid for whole milk is below the cost of production. Some of these statements were prepared by the Milk Board, so they should be authentic. The first two statements relate to two dairy farms of average size and the third relates to a large farm.

In regard to farms A and B no account is taken of overtime worked by both men and their wives, amounting to about 30 hours of the week in each case. There is no question, therefore, that the dairy-farmers in general are having a bad time. That applies equally to the producers of whole milk and the producers of milk sent to butter factories. I believe that the price of milk for butter-fat should be raised considerably above what it is to-day, but I do not desire to go into that matter now, because my purpose is to refer to the plight of the whole-milk producers. I fail to see why there should be a difference of 3d. a gallon between the prices paid to dairymen who send their milk to the Milk Board in Melbourne and the prices paid to those who send their milk to towns which are outside the metropolitan area, but which, nevertheless, take large quantities. The Government should inquire whether the same price cannot be paid to all. I think, too, that early consideration should be given by the Government to increasing the price. Regardless of what the Government may think, the fact remains that the dairying industry i? going downhill rapidly. Every day, farms are being sold, and are ceasing to produce milk. They are being turned over to grazing, which is less productive </para></talk.start></continue><para class="block"><graphic href="178331194403305_123_10.jpg" /></para><para class="block">and necessary at present than is dairyfarming.

The Japanese planned to make a thrust down the coast of Western Australia. The plot ##"## blew up ##"## in that State because that was the key centre. I am satisfied that the members of the Australia First Movement were fully aware of where the Japanese planned to strike. This is not simply a puff of wind. The movement was well organized in New South Wales and Western Australia. Until the security officers gathered in these men a quisling walked down George-street, Sydney, every day, stick in hand, called at a certain place and obtained money for carrying on his activities. He spread a little gossip here and there, and made derogatory remarks about this and that. The proprietor of the <inline font-style="italic">Publicist</inline> went out of his way to shove the newspaper into the hands of the public. Copies were left in trains and on ferries. Even during the depression, when quite substantial newspapers were experiencing difficulty in carrying on, this man was printing more and more papers every week. Where was the money coming from ? In the heart of Sydney, a fifth column was formed comparable with similar organizations in other countries. Surely honorable members opposite do not think that the wily Japanese imagined that all Australians were incorruptible, or that the tide of victory would run so strongly in their favour that they would not require a fifth column in Australia? The fifth column was organized, and the Government deserves credit for having smashed it. The Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> was accused of having rushed panic-stricken into the chamber to announce the detention of members of the Australia First Movement. I consider that the Minister showed great judgment in informing the public, through Parliament, of their detention. If the Government had allowed these quislings and ##"## stooges ##"## to carry on their plotting, honorable members opposite would have been the first to squeal to high heaven in protest. The Government has a much more responsible job in conducting the war than in worrying about the Opposition. The Government has to interpret the feelings of the people, and ensure  the safety of the country. The Government was completely justified in interning these people. Indeed, it has been very liberal towards the quislings. Honorable members opposite assert that innocent men were interned. They were undoubtedly Fascists, as every article that they wrote proves. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2472</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JLL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">ABBOTT, Joseph</name><name role="display">Mr Abbott</name></talker><para>- The Attorney-General said that some of them were innocent. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2472</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KGX</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HAYLEN, Leslie</name><name role="display">Mr HAYLEN</name></talker><para>- These people had a studied and deliberate plan to wreck Australia, and they received their rich deserts.

Their wives did not know- where they were until two days after their arrest. Another curious feature of the case is that the internments were made on the 20th March under National Security Regulations, whereas the men had been arrested some days previously. On the Sunday following their detention, and before it was made public, the names of the mcn were read from a Communist platform in the Sydney Domain and then published in two illegal publications, the <inline font-style="italic">Tribune</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Wharfie.</inline> The heading in one of the newspapers was, ##"## These are the traitors ##"##.

The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline> had a good deal to say about Fascists, ##"## stooges ##"##, and so on ; but I point out to him and to honorable gentle- men opposite that one of these men was an ex-bank manager and a man of letters, 73 years of age, who had no hostile intentions whatever against his country. Another was 57 years of age. Not any of them were young men. One was a returned soldier of the last war whose only connexion with the Australia First  Movement was that he had at one time written some poems for the newspaper <inline font-style="italic">Publicist,</inline> which was published by the movement. Other persons interned also had no real connexion with the movement. It is difficult to understand why the request for a trial by jury has been denied these persons, or why they have been treated so rigorously. The only connexion one of the men had with the movement was that he attended a meeting at Adyar Hall, Sydney, which prominent Communists attempted to wreck. He has said that he took his wife to the meeting out of mere curiosity. When the riot occurred there, he and his wife got away. When he read in the newspapers the following day that the speakers had subsequently concluded their addresses at the meeting, he thought it was a plucky thing to do and he offered to take the chair at a meeting in another suburb. That meeting was advertised but was never held. That man was accepted for a commission in the Royal Australian Air Force, but at 4 a.m. on the same day he was dragged out of his bed and thrown into an internment camp.  His  wife was not told where he was for a couple of days afterwards. The man##'##s business was ruined; he had to take his children away from school, his life assurance policies lapsed, and, although he had been enjoying an income from personal exertion of more than ##£##3,000 per annum, he was reduced to absolute poverty. After his release be accepted work in a munitions factory in the electoral division of Reid. He showed me a photostat of a letter signed by 170 of his fellow unionists who, being convinced of his innocence, had requested that he be given a proper trial. That petition was presented to the Minister for the Army by the honorable member for Reid. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2474</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KV7</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">STEWART, Frederick</name><name role="display">Sir Frederick Stewart</name></talker><para>- That man had not even met his fellow internees until they met in the internment camp. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2474</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JLL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">ABBOTT, Joseph</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name></talker><para>- That is true.

That, of course, is pure stupidity. The members of the Australia First Movement who were interned in New South Wales should be given a fair trial, and if they are found not guilty they should be compensated. Let us consider, for a moment, the position of some of the other members of the movement in New South Wales who were not interned.

One gentleman has advised me by letter that he has been living the life of a pariah almost up to the present time, scorned and abhorred by the people in the village in which he lives, because they do not believe that he is the innocent man he claims to be.

That he should be one of the gentlemen whom they selected to champion their cause in this Parliament, is quite understandable. Let us consider whether or not there is any similarity between the activities of the Australia First Movement, and the New Guard of which he was a prominent member - an association that he has never denied. The New Guard held similar ideas in regard to the way in which matters should be handled in this country. Those who controlled it did not at that time suggest the assassination of prominent persons in this country, but they did prepare a list of prominent men with whom they disagreed, their intention being to place them in confinement in the old Berrima gaol. Some of them visited the home of a prominent trade union official in Sydney, and showed a disposition to do physical violence to him because they disapproved of views which he had expressed.

At some time prior to the arrest of these quislings, two members of another political organization - Ratcliffe and Thomas - were interned. I cannot recollect the honorable member for New England and the honorable member for Wentworth having claimed that these men should be given a fair and open trial. They did not protest against their incarcerationby an anti-Labour government. Ratcliffe and Thomas were charged##'## with an offence, taken before a civil court, and sentenced to imprisonment for six months. When they had served their sentences, they were interned by an anti-Labour government, without any further charge being preferred against them and without any public trial being given to them. The honorable member for Wentworth now takes a different line. He said : ##"## One of these men was an air-raid warden ##"##. What does that prove? He also said: ##"## One was actually joining the Australian Imperial Force ##"##. The reason was, not that he might assist to defeat the enemies of this country, but that he might have wider opportunities and greater facilities to do the nefarious work in which he was engaged. The honorable member further said : ##"## Some of them have made donations to loans ##"##. Of course they have; that was a cunning way of covering up their activities. That does not prove that these men were not guilty of having engaged in the activities with which they were charged. That might be a very cunningly devised plan for the buildingup of evidence which would be produced at the appropriate time to clear them of any charge which might be made against them. Why does not the honorable member explain how he has been able to amass this pile of persona##]## correspondence with all these quislings? He and the honorable member for New England have evidently been on intimate terms with them, and were corresponding with them for a considerable time. If further inquiries are to be made, they might include an examination of the mass of correspondence that has been accumulated by these honorable members. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2477</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JLL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">ABBOTT, Joseph</name><name role="display">Mr Abbott</name></talker><para>- We will subscribe to that.

Of course, we know what happened when honorable members opposite were in power. A man named Philip Raoul Hentze was taken up, but a Minister of the Crown, who is now sitting opposite me, intervened, and the man was released a few hours later, and was not again apprehended. When Italy came into the war, there was a general round-up of unnaturalized Italians, who were interned without being charged with any offence. It was a security measure. This was done so that inquiries could be made as to whether or not they should be allowed their liberty. The honorable member for Wentworth, however, believes that if a suspected person is a retired business man or a bank manager no one should dare to interfere with him. If he moves in a select circle of society he should be treated differently from everybody else. Honorable members opposite said that sixteen persons were apprehended, and only three have so far been found guilty. What about the other thirteen, they asked? They are not so concerned, however, when the coal-miners are involved in a stoppage of work due to an industrial dispute. They do not say, ##"## Let us find out who is guilty ##"##. They say, ##"## Let us penalize all the coal-miners ##"##. If the hank manager had received a better education than many others, that is all the more reason to believe that he knew what kind of an organization he had joined, and what were its activities. </para></talk.start></continue><para>As a matter of fact, every one of these persons had the right to appeal against his internment, and all but one exercised that right. He preferred not to do so because he was probably afraid that additional evidence might be brought to light, and the man who failed to appeal is the one specially defended by the honorable member for Wentworth. Appeals  are heard by a tribunal presided over by a Supreme Court judge, and internees have the right to legal representation. Every effort is made by the Government to see that they are given a fair trial, but they are not given any sympathy if they are proved to have plotted against the safety of the State. If the Government has a fault in this matter, it is that too much leniency was shown. Honorable members opposite have had a lot to say at one time or another about those who allegedly make traitorous statements, but when their own political friends and supporters are involved, they rush to their defence, and assert that on no account must their liberty be interfered with. </para><para>I congratulate the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> on the action which he took in this matter, and upon the fairness with which the situation has been handled. He was confronted with a very difficult situation in March, 1942, when Australia was in imminent danger of invasion. And why was it in that danger? Because the honorable member for Wentworth, the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott),</inline> and others like them, were babbling about the sufficiency of the defences of the country when they knew perfectly well that Australia would fall an easy prey to any enemy which attacked it, because its defences had been so neglected. Instead of being concerned over the defence of . the country, they were concerning themselves with the protection of quislings. The Government has nothing to hide. When the facts are known, the people will realize that they made a wise choice in August last, when they returned the Labour party to power for what I have no doubt will be a period of many years. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2478</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>C7E</name.id><electorate>(Cowper</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PAGE, Earle</name><name role="display">Sir EARLE PAGE</name></talker><para>.- The Minister for Transport and External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> presents an interesting psychological study. He has demonstrated extraordinarily rapid progress in Empire sentiment and Australian loyalty. It is somewhat difficult to convince us of the genuineness of this change of sentiment during the period since the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act was passed. Listening to him now, one might think that he had always been the greatest protagonist of Australian defence, whereas everybody knows he was its greatest antagonist. One might think that he had always been in favour of the most active prosecution of the war, whereas everybody knows that he consistently opposed it. However, I do not propose to continue in that strain. </para></talk.start><para>This is the last opportunity we shall have for many months to make certain that production in this country will be maintained. I appeal to the Government to co-ordinate the efforts of various departments in such a way that no conflict will occur and no effort will be wasted. This morning, I gave to the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> a letter stating that a man, who had been told by the man-power authorities that. <inline font-style="italic">hi</inline> would be exempt from military service, had been grabbed by the military police while he was ploughing in his field. He leaves on ##'##his farm only his wife to milk 36 cows. She writes to say that she can get a schoolboy to help her during week-ends, but for the rest of the week she is without assistance. I told the Minister a fortnight ago that a warrant had been issued for this man##'##s arrest and on the 28th March he was taken away. In this instance, there was certainly lack of co-operation between the man-power authorities and the military authorities. </para><para>I again urge that something be done to provide motor tyres for primary producers who need them. I have here a letter dated the 27th March from a vegetable-grower at Port Macquarie. He says that he writes to me with reluctance, but that his application for two truck tyres has been refused, although he has a No. 4 priority.  His  property is 5 miles out of town, and 2 miles from the main road. If he has 2 tons of produce to transport, he can get a carrier to call for it if he himself takes it to the road. I beg the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> to take up this matter of the supply of tyres with the Acting Minister for Supply and Shipping during the recess, and try to arrange for the officials who control the issue of tyres to make exceptions in cases of extreme hardship or urgency. I have discussed this matter with various officials, and the suggestion has been made that increased facilities should be provided in the larger centres for the retreading of tyres, so that even if new tyres are not available, retreads may be obtained with which to keep vehicles on the road. </para><para>I also ask the Minister to confer with the Minister for Munitions and the Acting Minister for Supply and Shipping with a view to arranging for the establishment of pools of spare (parts in the larger country towns. In response to previous representations on the subject, I received a sympathetic letter from the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, who said he would get in touch with the official who handles this matter, but it seems to me that action is called for outside the department. In one northern district with a population of  52,000  people, most of whom are primary producers, all those concerned with the distribution of spare parts, such as farm machinery agents, garage proprietors, nominated one person to hold a stock of parts necessary to keep vehicles and machinery in operation. The suggestion was put to the authorities, but, so far, it has not been acted upon. In regard to this matter, and also in regard to the provision of producergas units, we consider that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and his officials should constitute themselves our champions. No one else understands our problems so well. All applications should be directed through his department, instead of having to go to a multiplicity of departments. </para><para>I wish also to say a word on the subject of potato-growing in the coastal districts, where crops are raised to meet a seasonal shortage of supplies from other places. One clause in the growers##'## agreement provides that those potatogrowers shall give a fortnight##'##s notice of when they will dig their crops, but they are peculiarly the victims of the weather. They cannot comply with that provision because, having given that notice, they may have their calculations upset. Rain may fall for a week or ten days, making the ground too sodden for potato-digging. That provision, which causes them a lot of worry, should be either eliminated or so modified as to exempt them. Another aspect is that these growers arrange their sowing in order that they may crop in the off season in other districts. They may have a good season one year and a mediocre the next, with a lot of small potatoes called ##"## chaps ##"##. They have a subsidy, but they would like an assurance of freedom to market when there is an absolute shortage. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2479</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KQB</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SCULLY, William</name><name role="display">Mr Scully</name></talker><para>-  I have discussed that very point with the Potato Board, which assures me that it will be able profitably to dispose of all grades of potatoes this season.

That is occurring within half a mile of Parliament House, and, I believe, inside Parliament House itself. The injustice of the position is increased by the fact that many of those who are being so employed are returned servicemen of the present war and married men with families to support. The basic wage in the Australian Capital Territory is  ##£##276  a year. That wage is based on the  formula laid down by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court as providing the absolute minimum for a decent existence. Yet, in the national capital, public servants and other Commonwealth employees are being paid ##£##264, some slightly more and some slightly less, ##£##12 less than the amount which,, according to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court##'##s investigations, is necessary for a minimum of decent existence. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2480</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JTY</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CAMERON, Archie</name><name role="display">Mr Archie Cameron</name></talker><para>- Is the honorable member referring to those who are non-unionists?

They are performing the work of clerks. The classification of ##"## assistant ##"## is contained in the Public Service determination governing the employment of members of the Public Service Assistants Association and the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union. There is also a classification of ##"## assistant ##"## under the determination governing the employment of members of the Federated Clerks Union who are employed as temporary clerks in the Commonwealth Public Service. But under that determination the classification of ##"## assistant ##"## applies only to females. However, I know of cases of married former soldier members of that organization who are being employed as assistants by the Public Service Board, although I can find nothing in the determinations covering them which allows their employment as assistants. I may be told that, although these employees are not receiving the basic wage which is appropriate to Canberra, they are receiving the Public Service base rate. I suggest that that is not an answer, because the fact remains that they are receiving substantially less than the amount which the Commonwealth Arbitration Court says is a minimum for a decent family existence. It is no satisfaction for a man to have said to him, ##"##We admit that we are not paying you sufficient for you to rent a house, clothe your family, buy food, and so on, but we would point out to you that if you lived somewhere else, 600 miles away, this would be quite sufficient, and you would have no complaint ##"##. That is not an answer. The policy is to ensure that any one employed by this Government shall receive at least the amount which is the decided minimum wage in the place in which he is employed, needed to provide him and his family with the amenities of a frugal existence. That principle is recognized by the Public Service Board in many other places than Canberra. District allowances are paid to Commonwealth employees who have to live in towns where the cost of living is higher than the average for Australia. For instance, to cite one case, in Balranald, a male  employee  receives a district allowance of ##£##20 a year and a female employee ##£##10 a year to compensate for the higher cost of living in Balranald. 1 think that if Canberra had a member in this Parliament this injustice would not have endured for a year, and  that  if. it had a member of the calibre of the member who represents Balranald, this injustice would not have endured for a day. But, because Canberra has no representative, this anomaly has continued year after year, notwithstanding various efforts which have been made to correct it. Various cases have been put for the establishment of a district allowance for Commonwealth public servants at Canberra. I ask that the Government review this position urgently, because to-day it is difficult enough for any one to exist on the basic wage, and it is a hardship and injustice to call upon any one to exist upon less. The matter is becoming more serious because the Public Service Board has increased over the months the number of persons it employs . under this classification as assistants. ##'##Some men who are so classified to-day are doing really responsible work which was formerly recognized as being worth at least the salary of a clerk. 1 ask the Government to give attention to this matter because, as I say, some of the men who are being treated so unjustly have returned from active service in this war and have the right to employment which will give to them at least the minimum standard of .a frugal existence. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2481</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K6Q</name.id><electorate>Wide Bay</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CORSER, Bernard</name><name role="display">Mr BERNARD CORSER</name></talker><para>. -  Some months have passed since the Government decided, in. the interests of the food requirements of this country and its allies, to establish plants for the dehydration of fruit and vegetables.

Yesterday ##[## received, through the courtesy of the Minister, an answer to my inquiries as to how the policy of dehydrating green vegetables is working out.

The numbers of dehydration plants that have been established by the Government for processing vegetables are as follows: - New South Wales,  6;  Victoria,  6;  South Australia,  5;  Western Australia,  2;  Tasmania,  5  ; and Queensland, nil; a total of  24. </para></talk.start><para>Some months ago, the Minister told me in answer to a question that the position of Queensland was rather different from that of other States in that the presence of so many servicemen gave the Queensland producers a local market. That was offered as an excuse for Queensland##'##s having been overlooked. But that position does not exist to-day. Our servicemen have passed on to other areas. I asked the Minister how many dehydration plants were in prospect and he gave me the following figures: - New South Wales,  8;  Victoria,  3;  South Australia,  1  ; and Queensland, nil. </para><para>I cannot understand why Queensland is being neglected. Being regarded as a primary producing State, Queensland has been neglected when the Government has established new secondary industries. When  36  dehydration plants are being erected, why should Queensland be overlooked? The post-war implications of this policy are serious. Various Ministers have indicated that after the war, government factories, now engaged in war production, will be utilized for the manufacture of peace-time requirements. Queensland will be forgotten again. In addition, plants for dehydrating fruit have been erected in various States - one in Victoria, four in South Australia, three in Western Australia, arid one in Tasmania. The plants in South Australia and Tasmania are capable of dehydrating either fruit or vegetables. This apparent discrimination against Queensland, which is not confined to the erection of the factories, is causing a good deal of concern. Replying to a question a few weeks ago, ##'## the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture declared that rice-growing would not be permitted in Queensland. He stated that State Ministers for Agriculture, at a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council, reached a ##"## gentleman##'##s agreement ##"## under which the production of sugar would be left to##'## Queensland and the production of rice would be left to New South Wales. Why must Queensland not grow rice? The civil population is unable to get supplies. Queensland is as much in the war as the other States. Its men are fighting side by side with troops from other States. In entering my emphatic protest against this discrimination, I urge the Minister to review the position and authorize the erection of dehydration plants in Queensland. Great opportunities are being lost because these plants are not available. When I returned from abroad a primary producer in my electorate offered me his onion crop at  ##£##2  a ton on the farm, because he had no means of processing or marketing them. In other States, onions were bringing a much higher price. Queensland deserves more encouragement than it is receiving from the Commonwealth. </para><list type="upperalpha-dotted"><item label="J."><para>do not adopt a parochial attitude and begrudge developments in other States, but I recommend the Government to consider the building of hydro-electric works throughout the country.

Hydro-electric power would increase production, stimulate enterprise and enlarge the rural population. As a post-war plan, it should commend itself to the Government.

I impress upon the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> the necessity for speeding up payments to wheat-growers for pool wheat. The payments which have been made, even on the guaranteed portion of the crop, have not been large. Indeed, some farmers find that the payments barely cover the cost of production, whilst other farmers complain that they are actually below the cost of production. Growers who suffered a crop failure last season urgently require assistance. I do not propose to repeat the remarks which I made on this subject on a previous occasion, because the facts are well known to the Minister. Briefly, the position is that many hundreds of growers, particularly in Victoria, are having the greatest difficulty in financing the sowing of wheat for the forthcoming season. They do not know how they will manage, because they had no returns last year. When I have tried to obtain assistance for them, I was reminded that the State governments have some responsibility in the matter. Whilst admitting that they have, I contend that the Commonwealth has the major responsibility and should make an approach to the States to assist, on a cooperative basis, those sections that are in need of help. Although the Parliament is about to go into recess, the Minister should not forget the plight of this unfortunate section and should take action to assist them as quickly as possible.

I hope that sympathy will be shown to them by the Government. </para><para>The Minister is advocating increased sowings of wheat so as to ensure ample reserve supplies for the purpose of meeting the post-war demand, which, every one believes, will be very great for a few years after the cessation of hostilities. 1 shall not amplify this point, because I spoke on this subject at some length recently; but I remind the Minister that the regulations controlling the sowing of wheat are rather rigid, and the stabilization authorities are refusing to grant licences to many growers who have plant and equipment for the sowing of increased areas. As the Minister may not be aware of what is happening, I urge him to take positive steps, within reasonable limits, to remove the restrictions. Many municipalities in wheat-growing areas are asking for the complete removal of restrictions for the period of the war and for some time thereafter. The suggestion contains considerable merit, and T submit it to the Minister for consideration. If he considers that the proposal would be too drastic, I commend to him the intermediate course of granting discretionary powers to those bodies that are administering the stabilization scheme. As another incentive to increased production, I strongly recommend an increase of the guaranteed price under the Scully wheat plan. I do not advocate a high price. Indeed, too high a price is not always a blessing to the industry because it has a bad effect. It produces fluctuations of values. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2482</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2A</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RANKIN, George</name><name role="display">Mr Rankin</name></talker><para>-  Land prices are also inflated. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2482</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>L1L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">WILSON, Alexander</name><name role="display">Mr WILSON</name></talker><para>- Too high a price leads to an increase of land values and working costs, which quickly offset any advantage that the farmer received from the high values.

While I am dealing with this subject, I desire to refer to the tactics that have been adopted by private enterprise, which is opposed to the continuation of the handling of wheat in Australia by the board.  Some  sections of private enterprise desire to revert to the old system. Under that system they had a wonderfully profitable time for many years and reaped rich rewards at the expense of the wheat-growers, who do not desire a return to such conditions. The farmers believe that they have achieved their objective, in part at least, by the establishment of the compulsory wheat pool. The methods that are being adopted by persons and1 organizations with a vested interest in a return to control of the wheat industry by private enterprise were  revealed during the recent campaign for the election of grower representatives on the Wheat Board. The private firms did their utmost to defeat certain individuals who were strongly supporting the existing policy. This is shown by the following circular issued by the Victorian Grain Agents##'## Association : - </para></speech>

                <para>In connexion with the election at present being conducted for the selection of a growers##'## representative on the Australian Wheat Board, certain incorrect statements are being circulated which must be refuted. </para>
                <para>In the issue of the <inline font-style="italic">S.A. Wheatgrower,</inline> dated  27th January, 1944, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maycock</inline> accuses the country agents of inefficiency. This accusation from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maycock</inline> is resented, as agents are doing all possible under trying conditions, to assist the Wheat Board to carry out its work in a satisfactory manner. In fact, the general manager of the Australian Wheat Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> H. Thompson, has expressed satisfaction at the manner in which agents have discharged their duties, and in the light of such statement, it is difficult to understand <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maycock##'##s</inline> unwarranted attack on South Australian wheat agents. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maycock##'##s</inline>
                    attitude is rather conflicting when later in his paper he mentions it would be a tragedy if the present members of the board were not returned. In this  regard,  we enclose a copy of a sharp rejoinder from the Minister of Commerce and Agriculture,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scully,</inline>
                    concerning the statements of one of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maycock##'##s</inline>
                    colleagues on the board as being ##"##Wild and Inaccurate##"##.

                <para>We cannot permit untrue statements reflecting upon the integrity of the service we render to growers to pass unchallenged, and would be pleased if you would take every possible step within the next few days to impress upon growers that agents are doing all possible to handle the business of farmers efficiently, notwithstanding that they are harassed with  all  forms of Government and arbitrary control, and are receiving less net remuneration than in pre-war days. </para>
                <para>It is hoped that growers will not be misled by the reckless accusations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maycock,</inline> but will select a representative who will not deliberately misconstrue the true position. </para>

                <para>Those circulars may be regarded as legitimate propaganda, but they certainly misrepresent the true position. From my inspection of wheat stacks throughout the wheat-growing States of Australia, I  am  able  to  say  that  the difference between  the  work done by  the  Australian Wheat Board and  that  done by private firms is all in favour of the board. Interests which are opposed to the pooling system carried their activities into the last federal election campaign and made a strong effort to secure my scalp. No expense was spared in publishing advertisements in country newspapers and in issuing circulars designed to withdraw support from me. Typical of these is the following circular - </para>

Tilt, Manager. </para><para class="block">There can be no doubt that the privately controlled firms interested in the wheat industry are doing everything they can, in both the political and commercial spheres, to regain the place which they once held, but I assure the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture that the wheat-growers desire the Australian Wheat Board to take over the whole of the handling and clerical work in relation to the wheat industry. I hope that the Minister will do everything in his power to ensure the success of these efforts. </para><para>I urge the Government to request the Department of the Army and the Manpower Directorate to make immediate and definite public statements concerning their future policy for the release of man-power from the Army for work in agricultural areas. A flood of statements of an indefinite and even contradictory character simply confuses the issues. The farmers do not know where they stand. I trust that all reasonable proposals for the release of manpower for work on the food front will be acceded to without delay. The mail of honorable members of this Parliament has been greatly increased by communications from people in rural areas who have been disappointed by the results of their requests for releases. I ask the Government to give prompt and sympathetic consideration to all requests for the release from war service of men who have been on the battle fronts for three and a half years or longer in order that they may return to agricultural work. Many of these men are war-weary, their health has been undermined by tropical diseases, and they are unable to perform their war duties as satisfactorily as they would desire to do. If they could be returned to their homes in rural areas they would regain their health and would be able to render far more satisfactory service to the nation. Their places in the battle line could be taken by younger men eager to see service. I am sure the people and the Parliament alike would approve of the release of such men. </para><para>Recently I directed attention to remarkable variations in the percentage of loans granted to applications made in the various States by the management of the Mortgage Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank. In New South Wales between 47 per cent, and 48 per cent, of such applications have been granted, whereas in Victoria the percentage is between 12 per cent, and 13 per cent., and in the other States it is even lower than that. It would appear that there is a lack of uniformity in valuations, or that in some States the basis of valuation is far too conservative. Another reason for the variation is, in my opinion, that the Commonwealth Bank has many branches in New South Wales which engage in ordinary banking activities. These branches were formerly units of the New South Wales Government Savings Bank which were taken  over by the Commonwealth. I am satisfied from my inquiries that the managers of these branches in New South Wales have a much better understanding of the needs of the rural community and make much more reliable valuations than do the authorities dealing with the Mortgage Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank in the other States. I suggest, therefore, that the Government should take steps to develop the Commonwealth Bank as an ordinary trading institution in the other States, so that the work done there may be as satisfactory as the work that is being done in New South Wales. Unless the operations of the Mortgage Bank Department be related more definitely to the needs of the rural community in the States other than New South Wales the people generally will continue to be greatly disappointed, and the development of our rural areas will be hindered. So far, the operations of the Mortgage Bank Department of the bank have been a great disappointment to many people. A beginning has been made. From the assurances I have received, I anticipate very great improvements in regard to both the method of making finance available and the rate of interest that is to be charged. </para><para>I commend to the serious consideration of the appropriate Ministers, and to the Government as a whole, the matters to which I have referred. I trust that before we meet again the Government will have acquiesced in the changes I have suggested. </para><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2485</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JTY</name.id><electorate>Barker</electorate><party>ALP</party><role /><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CAMERON, Archie</name><name role="display">Mr ARCHIE CAMERON</name></talker><para>. -  There are only two matters with which I shall deal. One of them relates to an aspect of the argument concerning the Australia First Movement. The type of job which has to be done can always be recognized by the class of workman who is sent to do it. The remarks of the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> did no credit to the Government, and were quite beside the point. The question is whether or not certain men who were interned had a fair trial. During the progress of this war, I have always, from both sides of this chamber, pronounced the dictum that there is a vital distinction between men in Australia who were enemy aliens when war broke out, and men who are naturalborn. If a man who is natural-born has something alleged against him of the nature of the allegation of two years ago, the internment camp is no place for him; the appropriate place is in the dock of the criminal court. If the Government has sufficient evidence to warrant a fraction of what was said by the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> on that occasion, then it had ample justification for preferring a charge under the Crimes Act, and in no circumstances should the man be dealt with by the softer but less understandable method of internment. A matter that has never been explained is how it happened that, as soon as these men were interned, their names were available to an illegal Communist paper ; all of them were published accurately in it. The hostility of the Communists to this particular section was well known. I am told by men who understand the position that in Sydney it was notorious. One is left with the awkward suspicion that perhaps the Communist party could tell the Government much more about how these people came to have charges made against them than the Government has been prepared to tell us. Perhaps the Government knows that. But that does not get away from the fact that there is a case to answer. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> admitted that one man remaining in internment had been offered certain terms, upon the acceptance of which the Government was prepared to release him. Another man who was released, was offered a sum of money. For what purpose? There could be only one purpose, namely, that he should forgo any rights he might have at law against the Commonwealth. That is not a nice admission, coming from the Attorney-General, who in these matters must speak on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. The matter cannot bc left where it is. It cannot be shelved by a volume of abuse, vituperation and muck-raking by Ministers or any of their supporters. These people were either guilty or not guilty of the offences with which they were charged. If they were guilty, some of them should have forfeited their lives. But if they were not guilty, then there has been a very grave and unprecedented miscarriage of justice in this country. There I leave the matter. </para></talk.start><para>The other subject to which I desire to refer, and that very briefly, is the use of some money during the recess. We have had one or two experiences during this sessional period which I hope will not be repeated. <inline font-style="italic">You,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Riordan,</inline> as  Chairman,  will report in due course to the House. I suggest that the Government, during the recess, should make arrangements to have the Speaker##'##s Chair shifted from where it now stands. It should be absolutely in the centre of the Government benches. In place of the Speaker##'##s Chair, there ought to be something in the shape of a tombstone, with this inscription: ##"##Sacred to the memory of Freedom of Speech, strangled 1.944, but not forgotten ##"##. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2486</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KZR</name.id><electorate>Balaclava</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">WHITE, Thomas</name><name role="display">Mr WHITE</name></talker><para>.- 1 hope that the Parliament will not be for long in recess. This is the place in which national matters should be discussed. It is not satisfactory to the people that they should be governed by fiats and codes issued by Ministers and by National .Security regulations churned out at great speed. Only in this place can matters be properly discussed with advantage to the nation. I hope that the Parliament will meet every quarter. A heavy burden will rest on the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> It would be better for hi,m to have the Parliament sitting than to be subjected to criticism elsewhere. </para></talk.start><para>I hope that the appropriate Ministers will give attention to several matters which, I believe, will arise during the recess. For many months, a report has been in the hands of the Government in respect of Australia##'##s future in relation to international and internal aviation. A summary of it has been published in the press, but no full statement upon the matter has been made to the Parliament. I have asked many questions, and have been told - and believe - that the report is held by the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford),</inline> because he has not yet succeeded in getting the Cabinet sub-committee, or the Cabinet as a whole, to deal with it. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> know that the present is a time of stress. Nevertheless, this is an important matter. It is closely related to Australia##'##s position in the world in connexion with air communication and, in fact, generally. If we do not plan now for post-war civil aviation, we shall be ##"## left at the post ##"##. </para><para>Hundreds of wives of Australian servicemen have been left in Britain, and questions have been asked in this Parliament with a view to learning when they will have the opportunity to travel to Australia. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> has stated that rapacious shipping companies are requiring exorbitant fares. That may be. I hope that they are not, although I believe that they are. But these people should not be the victims of the fares charged by shipping companies. Some arrangement should be made for their early transport. The Government of New Zealand must have to pay equal fares, yet I understand that wives of servicemen have been brought to that dominion free. The task should not be beyond the ability of the Australian Government. A large number of the men concerned are members of the Forestry Unit. Some of them have been demobilized; yet their families are broken up and separated, simply because a proper arrangement cannot be made. </para><para>Certain Australians who are members of the Royal Air Force and have completed a period of service in Britain, and certain Australian civilians, wish to return to their native land. When they inquire at Australia House as to the possibility of obtaining a passage, they are told to return in two years##'## time. 1 know that there is a long waiting list of persons who want to return to Australia. Nevertheless, that something is not done is evidence of considerable ineptitude. Australia can send troops overseas. Air crews leave this country regularly, and it is grand to see that they are taking part in operations in other parts of the world with great credit. When the vessels are sent back to Australia, passage on them should be granted to those Australians who wish to return home. May I suggest, too, that many hundreds of orphaned children of British servicemen be brought, to this country ? The Prime Minister has declared that he is sympathetic to that idea, but the matter seems to have been forgotten. I trust that at least the matters of stranded Australians and the wives of servicemen who have been left for so long in Britain will soon be adjusted. </para><list type="upperalpha-dotted"><item label="A."><para>third matter which has been quite unsatisfactorily dealt with is that of land acquisition. The Commonwealth has compulsorily acquired, in the Essendon district, a lot of land mainly belonging to poor people who had paid deposits on it. </para></item></list><para>The Prime Minister was impressed when the matter was brought to his notice, and promised that an inquiry would be held. Honorable members on both sides of the chamber cited cases of people .who had not had a fair deal. Later, however, we were advised that the existing practice was to be continued. The Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> claims that he acts on outside advice as well as on departmental values. If that be so, I can only say that the outside advisers must be twenty years out of date. Everybody knows that values have risen in that and other districts. The acquisition of the land of these people, who did not want to sell it and were left in debt in consequence, is altogether ludicrous. Just, if not generous, treatment ought to be meted out to them. </para><para>The Government has not a policy in respect of the building of homes for returned soldiers. I asked what had been the activities of the War ##'##Service Homes Commission for a period of four years, and how many homes it had built, and received the amazing reply that thirteen homes had been built for men who had fought in the last war and two for men who had fought in this Avar. I asked what staff the department had, and was informed that, allowing for men who had gone on service, the number was 123. There are a commissioner, six deputy commissioners, six architects, and a large number of clerks and typists. When I raised the matter in this House the Prime Minister said, ##"## We cannot make bricks without straw ##"##. We have heard lately of the intention to inaugurate a big building scheme in various States. Let us hope that that is true. Servicemen, when discharged on account of wounds or sickness, have to scramble with people who have more money, even to get a room in which to live. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> has shown the squalid conditions in which people have had to live in that city. There has been much talk by the crystal gazers employed by the Government, in regard to a wonderful post war world. The world of to-day is the post-war world of men discharged from this war. So far as they are concerned, the war is over; and they are confronted with a state of affairs such as they had never experienced up to the time of their enlistment: I know that the War Service Homes Commission is efficient. It built thousands of homes for men who returned from the last war. I exhort the Government to see that materials shall be made available for building schemes and other works in different parts of the continent, at least for the benefit of these men who do not strike, who cannot sit down and complain, and who undertake any duty, however hazardous, yet do not receive the pay of the ordinary working man. They are our real defenders, and Australia##'##s right arm, despite all the talk of what is done by the working man. They should be given priority in connexion with whatever houses may be built, and the Commission should be allowed to proceed with this work. </para><para>I have emphasized matters to which reference had previously been made. This has been a strenuous sessional period. I hope that Ministers will not consider that during the recess they will be immune from criticism. I assure them that if matters of urgency are not finalised there will be a strong clamour in the community. I suggest that they go ahead with these matters in particular. </para><para>Many members of the air crews of the Royal Australian Air Force, who have been kept in Australia for two or three years, want to get into action. It should not be beyond the power of those who arrange such matters to see that there shall be rotation of service. Many men have been serving excellently overseas, some of them in rather isolated units in Burma and India. When they have had a long period of service, and have completed a large number of operational hours, they should be exchanged with other personnel who are in Australia, and are waiting to take their places. I realize that they form a part of a great machine, and that therefore Australia cannot claim that they should be brought back <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> large numbers to this country. But at least, if a policy were laid down, and it was stated that in three years these men would have the right to return, and that others would  take their places after one operational tour or a specified number of hours, thatwould be heeded by the authorities overseas. The commanders of the Royal Air Force units in which Australians are serving would gladly, after the good service they have rendered, see that the change was effected. A generous attitude should also be adopted towards the mcn when they return. Because of the experience they have gained, they should be asked to submit reports in the light of what they have learned, and not be placed in more or less subordinate positions. Suitable positions should be kept open for them so that, when they return, full advantage may be taken of their experience. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2488</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRT</name.id><electorate>Wakefield</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SMITH, Albert</name><name role="display">Mr SMITH</name></talker><para>.- Honorable members are aware that medical practitioners in Australia have had heavy demands made upon them in recent years. A great many doctors are serving with the forces, and the places of some of them have been taken by refugees from overseas. I do not wish to cast any reflections on refugee doctors as a body. I recognize that we owe much to them, but there is cause for complaint against a few. I have brought this matter to the attention of Ministers, and have been told that it is a matter for the State authorities. Some of the refugee doctors who have come here to enjoy the shelter and amenities provided by Australia are now doing their best to pick the eyes out of other men##'##s practices. In one country town in the far north of South Australia, a refugee doctor entered into an agreement with a Statesubsidized hospital for a period of twelve months, but before the term was up he broke his agreement in order to take over the more profitable practice of a doctor who had joined the Army. I ask the Government to take the matter up with the .State authorities with a view to their ensuring that, when an agreement of this kind is entered into, it shall be honoured. In this case, great inconvenience was caused the local authority with which the refugee doctor had made an agreement which he subsequently broke. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2488</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>009MC</name.id><electorate>Fawkner</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLT, Harold</name><name role="display">Mr HOLT</name></talker><para>.- The Supply which was given to the Government earlier in the day will enable it to carry on, so far as finances are concerned, until the end of September. 1 sincerely hope that this does not mean that Parliament is not to be called together for a long time. There is abroad in the community consider able- disquiet at what is felt to be the unreasonable and capricious behaviour of bureaucrats. Almost daily, honorable members have brought to their notice cases in which it is considered that some department or official has behaved unreasonably or unjustly. The recent revelations regarding the prying of the censorship authorities into internal communications, not for the purpose of discovering offences against national security, but to discover evidence of almost trivial offences against war-time regulations, have been very disturbing to the public. They believe that their only protection lies in a parliament which meets regularly, and expresses itself freely. When I speak of bureaucrats, I do not refer to members of the permanent Public Service, for whom I have a great respect. It is significant that most of the complaints are about officials in the newly created departments, for the most part temporary officers, who have little or no previous experience of- public service, and who have not developed that capacity and judgment which characterizes the permanent official. The Government has appointed a committee  Which,  during the recess, will conduct, I hope, a far-reaching investigation of all phases of censorship. If it does its job thoroughly, and is frank insofar as the requirements of security permit, the public will be much relieved. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2488</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>BV8</name.id><electorate /><party>ALP</party><role /><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CALWELL, Arthur</name><name role="display">Mr CALWELL</name></talker><para>-  The newspapers will not get much out of it. </para></talk.start><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2488</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>009MC</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLT, Harold</name><name role="display">Mr HOLT</name></talker><para>- I hope that all aspects of censorship, including censorship of news items and of newspaper articles, will receive proper attention. I raise the matter now because some of the newer departments are apparently maintaining their own secret agents. The Government has taken the sound view that censorship is justified only on grounds of national security. The privacy of individuals should not be invaded by Commonwealth functionaries, and there should be no prying into mails m- telephone conversations, except in the interests of national security. In time  of peace, the Commonwealth was being constantly pressed by State governments to make known silent telephone numbers, so as to make it possible to track down persons who were committing breaches of State laws. The Commonwealth consistently took the attitude that the paramount consideration was to preserve the confidence of the public in the privacy of Commonwealth communications, and it resisted the requests. Of late, information obtained by the censorship authorities has been used to launch prosecutions in respect of breaches, not against national security as it is generally understood, but against war-time regulations. That is an improper use of censorship, and one that cannot help but cause concern in the minds of the people. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The particular matter to which I wish to refer came to my notice only recently. ##[## have been informed by a lady, a constituent of mine, who owns a block of six flats, that she recently had a visit from two officers of the Prices Branch. In July of last year, she was taken to the Fair Bents Court by a tenant, who sought a reduction of the rent of ##£##2 7s. 6d. a week for an unfurnished four-roomed flat with a garage, and the rent was reduced by 3s. a week. A few weeks ago, this lady, who owns the flats, and who lives in a villa next door, received a visit from two officers of the Prices Branch who arrived in a Government car, driven by a lady chauffeur. They asked if they could interview her and, though she was somewhat surprised, she assented. Then, to her astonishment, they put her through a sort of third degree on the ground that her next- . door neighbour had complained that she was creating a nuisance by playing the radio too loudly, banging an iron gate, and turning off the water, either to conserve supplies or to improve the pressure. One of the men took notes of everything she said. I suggest that if every department is to have a security branch of its own for the investigation of domestic complaints of this kind, which could very well be ventilated through the ordinary courts, if need be, we shall rapidly establish a gestapo-like organization of the kind which exists in Germany, Russia, Italy, ##&amp;##c. There should be an investigation of the activities of ##"## snoopers ##"## of this kind. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2489</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>DTN</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">EVATT, Herbert Vere</name><name role="display">Dr Evatt</name></talker><para>- They are under the control of the Prices Branch. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2489</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>009MC</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLT, Harold</name><name role="display">Mr HOLT</name></talker><para>- I am not complaining that the Attorney-General##'##s Department is at fault, but I am telling the Attorney-General that apart from the necessary organization that exists in that department and the service departments, we apparently have another department which is using its officers, not to check breaches of the prices regulations, hut to investigate domestic and trivial complaints. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2489</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>DTN</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">EVATT, Herbert Vere</name><name role="display">Dr Evatt</name></talker><para>- It is in the nature of war departments to aggrandize themselves, and we have to watch them and check them.

The electoral law provides for the preparation and distribution of a pamphlet presenting the case for and against any proposed alteration of the Constitution. The law contemplates that if Parliament decides that a proposal for the alteration of the Constitution shall be submitted to the people the instrument of government shall be used and public funds shall be employed to present equally to the people the case for the amendment and the case against the amendment. We know, of course, that within the command of the government of the day very wide opportunities of publicity and propaganda exist. I put it to the Government - and I hope that it will be proved from the treasury bench that it is not necessary - that just as the law provides that in the official pamphlet the cases for and against shall ##'##be equally submitted, that principle should be applied in respect of all mediums of propaganda and publicity within the command or under the influence of the Government. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2490</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>N76</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MENZIES, Robert</name><name role="display">Mr Menzies</name></talker><para>- Hear, hear! </para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2490</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>DTN</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">EVATT, Herbert Vere</name><name role="display">Dr Evatt</name></talker><para>- What does the honorable member want us to do? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2490</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>009MB</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCEWEN, John</name><name role="display">Mr McEWEN</name></talker><para>- I want the Government to give that assurance.

The demeanour of members indicates that public funds are to be used to present the Government##'##s case and that the public funds will be expended, except on the official pamphlet, only on the presentation of the affirmative case. We have heard a great deal about freedom of speech and democratic rights. Those .are the things we are fighting to save. We are fighting to save ourselves from the experiences of certain of the peoples of Europe. What is the history of the rise to power of the authoritarian governments of Europe? Totalitarian tyranny had its genesis in one unscrupulous party achieving power. The Nazi party in Germany did not achieve power as the result of an overwhelming vote of confidence by the people. Hitler edged his way into office. But once he controlled the public purse, he used the funds in order to suppress political opponents, and propagate the views of the Nazi party. When the people of Austria and the Saar were asked to vote on the question of self-determination, the ballot ##'## papers issued to them enabled them to vote in only one way. What difference is there between that kind of ballot paper, and the almost exclusive use of public funds to present one##'##s point of view? The difference is merely one of degree. The principle is identical. And that seems to be the principle which this Government will embrace for the purpose of ##"## bulldozing ##"## the people into voting for an extension of Commonwealth powers. Amazingly enough, the bill is described as a ##"##measure to guarantee democratic rights ##"##. No greater abrogation of democratic rights is conceivable than the use of money raised from taxpayers opposed to the proposal, in order to present only the affirmative side of the case. If the Government desires the people to give reasonable consideration to its proposals for constitutional reform, it must be free of any. charge of bias in presenting its case. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2492</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>DTN</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">EVATT, Herbert Vere</name><name role="display">Dr Evatt</name></talker><para>-  We are biased in favour of the proposal. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2492</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>009MB</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCEWEN, John</name><name role="display">Mr McEWEN</name></talker><para>- The Attorney-General is biased in favour of his point of view.

All other forms of social service are financed from the proceeds of a graduated system of taxation. The payroll tax falls with particular severity on the employers in industry. All employers in the primary and secondary industries are labouring under the unfair disability of this tax. They have to contribute a larger share than any other section of the community to the fund from which child endowment is paid. Many of them are engaged in other than war industries, the returns from which are quite small in these days, yet they have to continue their substantial contributions to the payroll tax. Many employees in the community are drawing large salaries and high wages, but are contributing far less through this tax than are the employers. I urge the Government to investigate this subject for I am quite satisfied that the continuation of the pay-roll tax cannot be justified on any substantial grounds. 1 trust that when the Treasurer is considering the financial programme of the Government for the next financial year he will conclude that this tax should be abolished. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para><para>Resolution reported. </para><para>Standing Orders suspended ; resolution adopted. </para><para>Resolution of Ways and Means founded on Resolution of Supply, reported and adopted. </para></speech><para>Ordered -</para><quote><para>That <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lazzarini</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out theforegoing resolution. </para></quote>

                        <para>. -  It is most extraordinary that these proposals should be submitted to us in the last hour or two of this period of the session, because obviously the matter must have been prepared some time ago. ##"##We have been presented with documents consisting of 92 pages of printed matter, which it would be impossible for any honorable member to examine at a moment##'##s notice. I have no desire to hinder the transaction of business, but I consider that honorable members are entitled to reasonable notice of the introduction of business, and to reasonable opportunities to consider the business that is submitted to them. These Supplementary Estimates have been, as it were, just thrown into the ring as the lights are going out, and we are expected to fumble with them in the dark as best we can. It is a little too rich for me and I emphatically protest against such methods. They are not fair to the committee. Honorable members are deprived of any opportunity to consider these proposed new works. Such a thing would not be done in a blacks##'## camp. </para>

                <para>The Estimates brought down by this Government in September, 1942, provided for an appropriation from revenue for war services, of ##£##140,189,000. A further revenue appropriation of ##£##20,000,000 was made in June, 1943. An additional amount of ##£##74,169 was provided under special appropriations. The total revenue appropriation was, therefore, ##£##160.263,169. Actual expenditure from revenue was ##£##158,890,555, or ##£##1,372,614 less than the total appropriation. No supplementary appropriation for war services from revenue is required, but it has been necessary in certain instances to re-arrange the war appropriation so as to provide for individual items in which the expenditure exceeded the original provision. The actual sum provided from revenue for war services in 1941-42 was ##£##10S,635,000. The corresponding amount provided in the previous year was ##£##65,092,000. </para>

                    <para>Apart from a machinery clause which provides that, at a referendum, a copy of the text of the proposed law shall be exhibited at service voting places, the bill has only two purposes. First, by a slight addition to the principal act, it provides definitely that only those members of the forces who are British subjects shall be entitled to vote under the special provisions of that act; and secondly, it extends the right of voting under those special provisions to members of the merchant navy, to accredited press correspondents, and to others employed or associated with the forces outside Australia or in Australia north of the 26th parallel. The reason for the first-mentioned provision is that, as the law stands, an alien member of the forces might lawfully claim a vote, although this  wa3  never intended by Parliament. When the original war-time electoral bill was prepared in 1940, British subjects only were accepted for war service, and it was not then necessary specifically to set out that only British subject servicemen would be entitled to vote under the special provisions enacted. Latterly, however, certain aliens have been admitted to the forces, and as  it  is deemed proper that the franchise should be restricted  to  British subjects it is now considered necessary  to  insert this provision. The only other purpose is to permit sea-going members  of  the merchant service, and certain other civilian personnel in forward areas, to record their votes in the same manner as members  of  the forces, It is considered that, in time  of  war, Australian sea-going personnel, as well as accredited press correspondents and others closely associated with the forces  in  the war zones, who have no other means  of  recording their votes, should be given the right to vote under the special arrangements provided for members  of  the forces. I commend the bill to honorable members, and urge its passage without delay. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that the Government recognizes the right to vote of some persons who would not ordinarily be given the opportunity to do so. Younger people, between the ages of 18 and 21 years are vitally interested in the referendum proposals, which may well affect their whole future. It is important that they should have an opportunity to vote. I should like to see this provision extended to munitions workers. </para>

                        <para>.- All those who are to vote should have an opportunity to learn what the referendum is about. Obviously, there will be serious practical difficulties in the way of making the issues thoroughly known. The Government has at its command a variety of service publications, through which it can make its views known to members of the services. It can arrange that key men holding particular opinions can move among members of the services, and place before them the opinion held by the Government. My enthusiasm for this measure is tempered by the fear that members of the services will not be given a fair presentation of both sides of the argument. The House should not be allowed to adjourn, perhaps until after the referendum is taken, without receiving an assurance on this point. There should be an opportunity for service personnel to study both sides of the argument in Government publications, and to hear them##"## discussed by speakers. </para>

                        <para>.- This measure provides, among other things, that the case for and against the referendum proposals shall be displayed in certain places where service personnel will vote. Such service publications as <inline font-style="italic">Sail., Wings,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Current Affairs Bulletin,</inline> come into the hands of members of the forces, and are more readily read by them than would be  a  notice posted on the wall. Those publications have been carrying explanations of the proposals for the alteration of the Constitution. I should like to receive an assurance that an equal opportunity will be afforded in the same publications for the presentation of the cases for and against the proposals. A pamphlet posted on the wall will not excite the curiosity of the troops, but they will read with interest comments on the referendum proposals published in service journals. The pamphlets and service publications containing reference to the referendum proposals will come into the hands of service personnel between the ages of 18 and 21. They will be entitled to vote, but other persons of the same age, including those in reserved occupations, will not be entitled to vote.  I  understand that it is a part of the Labour party##'##s platform that persons eighteen years of age and upwards should be entitled to vote. It is surprising that the Government has not brought forward a proposal to enable them to do so. I was under the impression that this was the point which the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> was trying to make. For my part, I do not agree that persons under 21 should have a vote. </para>

                        <para>.- It would be distinctly unfair if the information given to service personnel regarding the referendum proposals were weighted on either side. The issue should be fairly stated in service journals, for, after all, they do not circulate everywhere and servicemen in the operational areas have not the normal access to newspapers. But, in practically all camps and service schools, there are discussion groups, where the referendum proposals will bc earnestly discussed. It would be absolutely unjust if the Government##'##s view were to be put forward unaccompanied by the opposing arguments. <inline font-style="italic">Salt, Wings, Guinea Gold</inline> and certain other literature containing articles presenting both sides should be distributed throughout the units in order that they may be used as subjects in study groups.

                            <para>- It would perhaps enable us to get away earlier if the Government would give some indication of what it proposes to do. There is something sinister in its refusal to reply to the request for an assurance that there shall be an equal presentation of both sides of the case to, not only the people generally, but also, and more particularly, the troops, whose chance of studying the effect of the referendum proposals will be limited. This referendum will be different from the common run of referendums, in which the people have been asked to say ##"## Yes ##"## or ##"## No ##"## to simple and isolated proposals. At this referendum the people will be asked to say ##"## Yes ##"## or ##"## No ##"##, not so much to a proposed law as to  a  programme of political propaganda which is given greater weight by the fact that the Government has decided, with the approval of Parliament, to force the people to say ##"## Yes ##"## or ##"## No ##"## to the whole instead of, as on former occasions, to each proposal individually. It does not take much imagination to realize that lads of eighteen or nineteen, who see on unchallenged placards attractive proposals about repatriation, employment and unemployment, andso on, will consider them to be very desirable. Whilst I have no quarrel with the fact that the troops should be told the Government##'##s view, I consider that, at the same time, they should be told the other side and that both sides should be expressed in the various service publications and otherwise. Further discussion would be avoided and the convenience of honorable gentlemen opposite met if the Ministry would be frank with the committee and the people and show that it still possesses a spirit of fairness in its approach to a problem of this magnitude. </para>

                        <para>.- I am surprised that we have not heard a speaker from the Government in response to the representations that we have made. It is the responsibility of the commanding officers of units to ensure that the list of proposals shall be posted. I want to ensure that there shall be a proper presentation of the case for each side. It is not right that only the ##"## new world ##"## of the Government and its bureaucratic planners should be presented for the service voters to ponder. The other side must equally be presented. That is the responsibility of the commanding officers. </para>

It is only common sense that it should be. If that be not done, there will be such a clamour outside that the Government will be forced to heed it. </para>

The Government allows soldiers of eighteen to vote, but it disallows seamen of eighteen to vote although they incur equally great and sometimes greater danger. Why insist that a merchant seaman shall be 21 before he votes? A sailor of eighteen who braves the terrors of the seas is entitled to voting rights equally with a soldier who braves the perils of the land, especially on a proposal of this sort which involves his future. A sailor of eighteen is as intelligent as is a soldier of the same age and is equally able to absorb and analyse the propaganda that can so easily be placed before both by modern ingenuity. This is the time to interest these young men in the necessity for amending the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>.- The Government is not entitled to exclude the persons described in the clause, unless it has a good reason for doing so, and the Minister has not explained that reason. The case for the referendum will be explained to the troops by Captain Martin, who will have the prestige of being Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales. Many of our troops have been absent from Australia for four years, except for brief periods of leave, when they would not take an interest in politics. The Government will pay propagandists to present its case to the servicemen. </para>

The proposed new section provides that the commanding officer of a unit may be the returning officer for the purpose of receiving the votes of members of the forces.

                    <para class="block">The Empire Forestry Conference, held in Australia in 192S, recommended that the Australian universities be approached with a. view to granting a degree to any man who successfully completed an agreed two years##'## course in science at his university, together with the forestry course at the Australian##'## Forestry School at Canberra. The universities agreed to the recommendation, subject to the condition that suitable steps be taken to safeguard the curriculum of the Forestry School. It was decided that the most suitable means by which the curriculum of the school could be safeguarded would be the establishment of a board, consisting of the principal of the school, who is the Inspector-General of Forests, and a representative from each of the universities concerned. The board was formed in 1930 and is known as the Board of Higher Forestry Education. It also includes a representative of each State government. </para>

The act. in its present form does not, however, authorize such a course.

                        <para>.- This bill will place the Board of Higher Forestry Education upon a proper basis, and I hope that this body will perform successfully its task of protecting and extending our forests. For too long has the preservation of our forests been neglected. Re-afforestation, including the planting of softwood pines and other suitable timbers, has not been carried out upon a sufficiently big scale. I spoke of this matter a few days ago when I emphasized the necessity for preserving our forests and for preventing soil erosion. This bill is most opportune. </para>

                    <para>. -  The discussions earlier to-day have indicated that the House will be in recess for a considerable period. It may be that the House will not meet until after the referendum has been held. I do not know, and I do not suppose that the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> himself has positive information on that point. I shall not assume that the Parliament will necessarily rise for four or five months, but it is a very reasonable assumption that a great deal of the work of the referendum campaign will have been performed at least before this House meets again. I desire to take this opportunity to join in the protest that has already been made by at least five of my colleagues. Under the electoral law, as it stands, a pamphlet will be issued to each voter and both sides, for and against the referendum, will have equal access to that pamphlet. So far, so good ! That is a perfectly proper provision, and both sides will have an opportunity to state their views, which will go before each elector. But the course of the discussion and the interjections a little earlier, suggest that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> at least is under the impression that because this referendum is in relation to a bill passed by both Houses of this Parliament, it occupies some special position in relation to Government propaganda. It occupies no special position. It is quite true that the bill has been passed by both Houses; but that is only one step in the course of altering the Constitution. Standing by itself, it has no operative force at all. Nothing is complete; nothing has legislative effect until the people have spoken. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Consequently, it is idle to say that because the bill has passed through Parliament and, therefore, the first stage of the journey has been completed, the Government is entitled now to spend public money in support of the proposals contained in the bill, as if those proposals represented the will of the Parliament and should be supported as the law of the land. That view is quite wrong. The fact is, and it is of no use blinking our eyes to it, that each side has an equal right to present its views. </para>

                        <para>-hI adopt the language of the Electoral Act, which speaks of the majority in Parliament and the minority in Parliament. So far we have had a rich experience of minorities which were wrong in Parliament, but right when the referendum vote was taken. It may happen again. When we are engaged in an election campaign, each side has its own access to all commercial instruments of publicity such as newspapers and commercial broadcasting stations. They are there to be used at will. But, in relation to the national broadcasting service, this Parliament has for many years endorsed a practice which I regard as sound that the leaders of parties, or their representatives, shall have equal access to the service. As that practice has been regarded as sound in principle in relation to general elections, I commend to the Government its application during a given period in the referendum campaign. </para>

                <para>The next thing I wish to say is that no undue analogy can be drawn between the present and the past in regard to press publicity, because, when the last referendum was ##'##held in 1936 there were no government publications that could he used for propaganda purposes. To-day, there are several such publications.

I shall go to the country secure in my belief in the strength of the Opposition case. But the Opposition does not consider that publications printed and circulated at the country##'##s expense should put a one-sided case to the people. If these publications are used at all, both sides of the case should be printed. </para>

If the Labour parity cares to expend ##£##10,000 or even ##£##100,000, on the referendum, I shall have no quarrel with it. It is entitled to spend its own money on its own terms. But when the expenditure of public  money is in question, fairness requires and demands that the money shall be spent fairly and evenly in order that each side shall receive a hearing and that the people maybe qualified to give a calm and balancedjudgment. </para>

                    <para class="block">It would need a Philadelphia lawyer to read the signature. I raise the matter at this stage, because when the subject was being considered by the Privileges Committee at least one honorable member said that I should have had certain envelopes to support my contentions. I did not have one of this particular type. This is not the first occasion on which this has happened to my mail. The letter in question happens to be one written to me by my wife, and posted on the 28th March by my son at Nailsworth, a suburb near the centre of Adelaide, and it gets here to-day. I direct attention to the delay that has taken place in the transmission of the letter, and also to the opening of it. It was unfortunate that I had not kept the envelopes of other letters that had been opened by the censors from about last May when this sort of thing began, for I would then have been able to submit them to the committee. Although I did not happen to have one envelope of this particular type to submit to the committee, it is curious that, just as the report has been tabled, I have one to produce. At the moment I am not concerned about what is contained in the committee##'##s report, because I believe that the terms of reference agreed upon were extremely circumscribed and did not allow it to investigate certain aspects of this subject. But the matter cannot rest here. A fuller inquiry will have to be held. I now have indisputable evidence of the fact that I alleged prior to the appointment of the committee. What I said a month ago is actually taking place in the censor##'##s office to-day. Whether it is to be said that it is always, done by mistake, I do not know. No one has yet been able to explain why I alone among the honorable members who constitute the United Australia party in this House have been subject to this attention. </para>

                    <para class="block">In view of those statements I do not suppose that the honorable member suggests any collusion on the part of personnel in the district censor##'##s office, South Australia Line of Communication, in order to have his letters opened. I suggest to him that he read the report of the Privileges Committer3 before he criticizes the procedure in the censor##'##s office. The committee included members of all parties in the Parliament and it submitted a unanimous report. As to whether the district censor was right in suspending from duty an officer who had made an error, that is a matter ou which honorable members must form their own opinions. We all know that letters addressed to other people come to us in our mail by mistake at times, and it is quite easy to open a letter without looking at the address on it if it is one of a pile of  20  or  30  letters. Letters addressed to other people are often opened in error. If we do it, we are sorry. The censor has expressed his deep regret that the honorable member##'##s letter should have been opened in error and has suspended the officer concerned. </para>

                            <para>- The district censor took the steps that he thought advisable in the circumstances. I shall not pass judgment upon his action without a complete knowledge of the facts. What he has done shows the complete impartiality of the officer. I believe that the honorable member for Barker will be quite satisfied with the conclusions of the Privileges Committee on this point. Its report is unanimous. The committee took evidence from the communications censor and also the base censor. Surely that impartial report should convince all honorable members, as well as the people generally, that there has been no breach of the privileges of any member of this Parliament! I assure the honorable member for Barker that the Government stands for strict impartiality in connexion with censorship. When he has examined the report, he will be satisfied that all the members of the committee are of the same opinion as the Government. </para>

                        <para>. - I recall that this committee was set up to examine the question of the censorship of mail addressed to members of this Parliament. I understand that the report- states that the only censored letters placed before the committee had been sent from operational areas. The letter which the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> has just produced was not sent from an operational area and should be placed before the committee in order that a report in regard to it may be made. </para>

                            <para>- Had the motion for the printing- of the report been submitted earlier, we might have had an opportunity to study it. This matter of the censorship of mail of members of this Parliament should be cleared up. That has not been achieved by the evidence placed before the committee. Further evidence having been produced, it should be submitted to the committee. The preservation of the privileges of members in this respect is imperative. </para>

                            <para>The Commonwealth has carried out progressive inspections of the work. Any allegations of faulty construction probably allude to the weaknesses mentioned in 3 above. In addition, some difficulty has arisen from the use of unseasoned timber, a circumstance that has been unavoidable under the conditions existing. Reports indicate that the Army authorities interested in the vessels are satisfied in every respect and it is not proposed to institute any inquiry on the lines suggested. </para>

                        <para>n. - On the 22nd March, the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> directed a question, <inline font-style="italic">without notice,</inline> to my colleague the Acting Minister for Supply and Shipping regarding the shortage of B batteries. This is a matter which comes within the jurisdiction of my department and I now desire to inform the honorable member that the general shortage of batteries is known to my department and the disabilities resulting to residents of country districts are fully appreciated. The shortage, however, is due to the heavy requirements of the services and the difficulty in securing the man-power necessary to increase present production. J assure the honorable member that every effort is being made to increase supplies. </para>

                        <para>- The Director-General of Agriculture receives a salary only. This salary is not exempt from income tax. The Australian High Commissioner in New Zealand and the Australian Minister to the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics each receives, in addition to his salary, an allowance for representation to be expended in those countries on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. Neither the salary nor the allowance is exempt from income tax, but, in regard to the allowance, a deduction is permissible for so much of the allowance as is actually spent for the purpose for which it was granted. </para>

                        <para>- On the 29th March, the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> referred to an advertisement which had appeared in the February issue of <inline font-style="italic">Army,</inline> dealing with Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, and asked whether it was the policy of this particular magazine to take sides between industrial workers and employers. I advised the honorable member that this magazine was not a governmental publication, but that I would have the matter investigated and furnish him with a reply. I am now informed by the publisher of <inline font-style="italic">Army</inline> that available advertising space in the publication is limited by policy to seven pages per issue. Such firms as Atlantic Oil, Shell Oil, I.C.S., (##&amp;##c., have been refused space because of this ruling. Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited have advertised in every issue of <inline font-style="italic">Army</inline> since the publication##'##s inception and have a right to space by contract. The publisher states that, when interviewed by the union representative, he indicated these facts, and added that the only variance to these rules to date would be in the April issue, when an extra advertisement would be carried for the war loan through a special representation which had been made by the Controller of Government Advertising. The publisher also states that the union representative mentioned a union advertisement in an exploratory manner, but no definite offer of advertisement was made by the representative, nor was it requested that special arrangements for such an extra advertisement should be considered by the publisher. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The publisher stated further that the union representative asked for an editorial paragraph to be printed in reply to the advertisement. The publisher stated that he refused this request on the ground that he had clearly and deliberately added the word ##"## Advertisement ##"## at the head of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited##'##s announcement, and that the publication would not enter the matter editorially, either for the Broken Hill Proprietary Company </para>
                    <para class="block">Limited or the union. The publisher added that this is the normal and correct publishing practice, and concluded that any suggestion that the publication had taken sides in an industrial dispute is completely in error. </para>

                    <para>As promised, the matter was brought to the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs, who has now advised that, as previously stated in reply to other questions on the same subject, supplies of tobacco and cigarettes to Italian prisoners of war in Australia are issued on a maximum basis of 3 oz. a week, partly as a result of a reciprocal agreement between the Italian Government and various governments comprising the British Empire, and partly in accordance with the terms of the Hague Convention. Any attempt to reduce the scale of tobacco rations now applicable to prisoners of war in Australia would doubtless result in repercussions against Australian prisoners in enemy hands. The allowance of tobacco now drawn by disabled soldiers in Brisbane, namely, 2 oz. a week, is the maximum amount of privileged supplies approved for civilians in munitions and other war factories and for discharged Services personnel throughout Australia. Any increase in such privileged supplies would ultimately result in a reduction of the total  qantities  now available for ordinary civilian consumption, because of the fact that tobacco manufacturers##'## output is at present definitely limited by shortage of labour and other contributing factors in the larger factories at both Sydney and Melbourne. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>In November, 1942, action was taken to control the interstate transport of hay, straw and chaff, because of extensive cross-haulage resulting in unnecessary use of railway rolling-stock and engine power. Examination indicated that much of this traffic was of a speculative nature on the part of agents, and it was accordingly laid down that interstate transport would be subject to a permit under the National Security Regulations administered by  the Commonwealth Department of Transport. It was further shown that in many instances such movement was made against the interests of the State in which the consignment originated, as the produce was required within that State and this movement did not have the endorsement of the State agricultural authorities. Railway transport permits are issued in all cases, endorsed by the Commonwealth and State agricultural authorities, and, in the case of chaff required for fire-stricken areas in Victoria, every assistance has been given, and I know of no case in which transport has been refused for that purpose. I am advised that only recently my department authorized the transport of 500 tons of chaff from South Australia to Victorian drought-stricken areas, but the firm responsible for this request now advises that the chaff cannot be obtained owing to the dry conditions in South Australia, the shortage of manpower and inability to obtain the chaff at an acceptable price. Similar approval has been given in respect to chaff from New South ##"##Wales, and this traffic is actually moving. </para>

                    <para>As I informed the honorable member, the petrol stock position is not satisfactory and it is not possible to relax the restrictions now operating. However, supplies are made available under the ration scheme to enable essential users, including the manufacturers and producers of foodstuffs, to carry on their undertakings to the extent necessary in the national interest. Whilst the dangers associated with sea transport have decreased, the overall tanker and overseas petroleum supply position is not such as will enable any relaxation of existing restrictions on the use of petrol to be considered. The demand for petroleum products for operations not only in this theatre but also in other theatres of war is very heavy, and is increasing, so that the future supply position in respect of Australia may conceivably deteriorate, thus it is essential that we conserve our available stocks to the utmost. coal-mining Industry: Subsidies. </para>

                        <para>In endeavouring to obtain this information for the honorable member, I have come, to the conclusion that it is not possible to bring together into a single estimate the cost to the Commonwealth of assistance to other primary industries byway of subsidies and guarantees as such assistance covers a wide field of production and marketing andhas often assumed an indirect as well as direct nature. The Budget Papers indicate that from the 1st July, 1939, to the 30th June, 1943, a total of ##£##18,571,989 was expended as assistance for relief of primary producersand a further expenditure of ##£##13,636,025 was estimated for the current financial year making an estimated total of ##£##32,208,014 from the 1st July, 1939, to the 30th June, 1944. However, under special conditions arising out of the war, direct and indirect relief has been afforded primary industries by subsidies and guarantees which it is not possible to segregate from other expenditure by various Commonwealth departmeats and to this extent the above figures arc incomplete. </para>

                <para>Whilst the above payments have been made to the primary industries they include very large funds due to the Government##'##s policy of the stabilization of prices and are designed to obviate the passing on of high production costs to the public which would involve anincrease in the cost of living. This does not apply except to ##»## very minor degree to the coal industry. The figures quoted above in respect of the two industries are therefore not comparable. </para>
