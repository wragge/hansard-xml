                        <para>- I have learned recently that manyworkers in industry, some of them young single men, have volunteered for active service and have been accepted as A1 medically, but, because of the selfish attitude of their employers, have not been able to obtain the necessary release that would enable them to enlist. My inquiries satisfy me that these men are not so essential to industry as their employers contend that they are. On the other hand, some members of the forceswho have had active service extending over a period of three or four years cannot obtain their discharge from the Army, even though they may be B class or married men with domestic obligations. Will the Prime Minister have an independent survey made of the position, in order to ascertain whether or not it may be practicable to release from industry men who wish to join the fighting services, and thus enable them to replace others with long service who, because of their obligations, wish to return to civilian life? </para>

                            <para>- In the statement which I made to Parliament regarding the rebalancing of the Australian wet effort, I said that certain tasks had been given to the Defence Committee, the War Commitments Committee, and the Production Executive. The Cabinet, of course, has the final responsibility. The matters that are being considered include a revision of the list of protected industries. I shall endeavour to ascertain whether or not the examination should be extended so as to embrace a survey of the desirability or otherwise of associating, with the protection of an industry, a provision for selectivity in relation to thepersons who should be retained or released. </para>

                            <para>-I have expressed the opinion that I hold. I am unable, at the moment, to state exactly the amount which may be expended by the Government in the presentation of the matter to the people, but I should say that it will be less than £50,000. That does not include the cost of the "Yes-No" pamphlet for which the Constitution provides, or the cost of taking the referendum. I have inquired of the Minister for the Interior, and understand that generally the cost of an election is approximately £100,000. The cost of the "Yes-No" pamphlet will be approximately £25,000, and the cost of presenting the question to the people on behalf of this Parliament </para>

Either authority may appoint one scrutineer only at any one polling place or place of scrutiny. According to the official interpretation, the law would not permit of the Governor-General, or the Governor of a State, either by his own hand or through any person authorized by him, appointing two scrutineers, one representing the proponents and the other opponents, to act at any one polling place or place of scrutiny. The Government is of the view that the necessity for the appointment of scrutineers on behalf of the Commonwealth at the forthcoming referendum does not arise at the present time. </para>

If there were a department for the settling of returned soldiers on the land, I should expect that department to give the fullest information to all applicants for land. </para>

                <para>Since 1912, there has been an arrangement between the Governments of the Commonwealth and China, under which bona fide Chinese merchants could obtain facilities to enter Australia for the purpose of promoting trade between Australia and China, and those who came here have been permitted to remain so long as they maintained their status and carried on a reasonably substantial overseas trade. Such merchants have also been permitted to introduce their wives and minor children, as well as assistants whose entry was warranted by the extent of the business transacted. </para>
                <para>Chinese students from the age of ten years have been admitted to attend, not only universities, but also approved primary and secondary schools, and the general practice has been to allow them to continue their studies up to the age of 24 years, or in special cases even beyond that age if they have qualified for higher education. A similar arrangement has been in force since 1904 in respect of British Indians. </para>

                            <para>- The terms of reference of the inquiry contain six clauses. These concern primarily persons who were members of or were associated with the Australia First Movement in the early days of 1942, when the original internments were made. Therefore, I should say that, even on the strict wording, the terms of reference would cover matters such as the honorable gentleman has mentioned. The opening addresses at the inquiry suggest that it will be as broad and comprehensive as the honorable gentleman considers that it should be. In addition., however, the final clause gives to  His  Honour the power to investigate any matters which, in his opinion, should be investigated as being relevant to the scope of the inquiry. For both of those reasons, I consider that the objective of the honorable gentleman will be achieved under the terms of reference. The matter is one for  His  Honour to determine. </para>

                        <para>- I have not read the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Standard,</inline> which the honorable gentleman describes as an attack on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jackson,</inline> but I have heard echoes of an attack which the honorable gentleman himself has made. These caused me to become suspicious about the great solicitude that exists in certain quarters for people who evade their tax obligations to this country. Even though I have a tolerant mind, I have begun to wonder at the reason for this solicitude, because it would appear to be mostly on behalf of, not the people who are doing the hard work of this country, but those who are engaged in black marketing and other nefarious practices. As I said earlier this week, I offer no apology for any action that has been taken to compel tax evaders to meet their obligations. I do not propose to say anything to the Commissioner of Taxation about it, nor do I propose to interfere in any way. </para>

                        <para>- I gave to the Leader of the Opposition and to the Leader of the Australian Country party the text of a broadcast from Berlin at 9 a.m. this morning, Australian time, and monitored by the Department of Information. Hitler was speaking and he said that the attack was not made by the enemy, hut by a small clique of traitorous criminals. Hitler emphasized particularly that the Army was not implicated. He said that the  bomb  landed 2 metres from him, and one friend was killed. The monitors attached a note to their transcription to say that, in their view, Hitler's voice sounded weak and betrayed extreme excitement. That is all I know about the matter. </para>

                            <para>- Can the Minister for War Organization of Industry say whether it is a fact that the large rubber companies are most reluctant to provide the plant and machinery necessary to make use of the synthetic rubber brought to this country from the United States of America, because of their fear that such machinery might not have much value after the war? My information is that these companies are not co-operating as they should to make use of such synthetic material as could be manufactured here. Will the acting Minister for Supply and Shipping take the t  rubber  companies " by the ears " and, if necessary, compel them to make use of the -synthetic materials which can be obtained from the United States of America, in order to provide some measure of relief to farmers and others who are now unable to secure transport? </para>

In view of the extreme danger of floods in the Hunter River cutting off coal supplies in time of war, will this proposal be reconsidered? </para>

                            <para>- It is a fact. I have a copy of the listening-post report on the broadcasts from Japanese-controlled radio stations. On the 18th July the Batavia radio station, in a talk in English, discussed the expenditure of money by the Australian Government. It made u number of serious charges against the Government, and referred to the gross misuse by it of constitutional powers which the people had cheerfully granted. The announcer then used the following words - " Now the same government asks for additional powers. The answer must be an emphatic ' No '." Honorable gentlemen opposite are welcome to their new ally. </para>

The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> was himself responsible for a decision extending widely the scope of the censorship. The interim report of the Censorship Committee, which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> has adopted, will, I believe, put an end to any abuse of the system, and the decision of the Prime Minister is being given effect. I have no doubt that, as ancillary to that decision, the matter raised by the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> will be attended to. </para>

Is it the policy of his department, and of the Department of the Army - of which he must have some knowledge - that a man can be enlisted as sane, and discharged as insane, without the Government admitting or incurring responsibility, and that the Repatriation Commission can deny care, treatment, or pensions to a man whose enlistment papers necessarily show him sane and who is certified insane while in the Army? Does not the Minister consider that men who have lost their reason in various theatres of war are entitled to better treatment than is given to them? </para>

                            <para>- I have not seen the newspaper article to which the honorable gentleman refers, but I know that attempts are made from time to time to discredit the Repatriation Commission. That practice has been going on for some time; it commenced before I took over the control of the department. I say, definitely, that every care is taken of every serviceman who is in need of attention. Any ex-serviceman suffering from a war disability, or discharged as insane, is looked after by the department; no such person is denied treatment. I defy any person to show that the repatriation doctors are unsympathetic towards these men; I know them to be most sympathetic. The Repatriation Commission can hold up its head. As we hear a lot about preference to returned soldiers, I point out that every man in charge of repatriation matters is a returned soldier, and that every doctor and matron in every repatriation hospital has had war service. It is a dastardly thing for the honorable member for Wentworth to make such charges against a department which is doing such excellent work. </para>

                    <para>- Will the Government consider making available free of charge carefully prepared post cards to be used by the relatives of prisoners of war in the hands of the Japanese. Up to date the preparation of such cards has been left to the Red Cross Society, the Prisoners of War Relatives' Association, and other organizations and private persons. These organizations have designed and produced cards and envelopes for the purpose; but they do not conform to the requirements of the Japanese authorities, who demand that a space be left - generally on the left-hand side of the card or envelope - for re-addressing in Japanese characters all communications written in English. Moreover, the cards produced by these organizations are rather inadequate in size. </para>

                    <para>- I am glad to say that the matter to which the honorable gentleman has referred is already in hand. It is one of the matters to which I was not able to refer when I spoke earlier this week. The conditions under which prisoners in the hands of the Japanese live have been the subject of careful and prolonged examination. I do not know that we shall succeed in improving their conditions, but a concerted effort is being made to do so. The provision of suitable means of communication with them is one of the matters that have been given consideration. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of the falling off of supplies to some country meat works. That is due, in part, to operators visiting country districts, and buying stock on the hoof and transporting it to the metropolitan centres for slaughter. The honorable gentleman has approached me on this subject on a number of occasions, and I am in entire accord with his desire to increase the killings at country abattoirs, but the whole subject is most difficult. I shall again consult with the State authorities to see whether sufficient live-stock can be provided to enable country abattoirs to be kept going continuously. </para>

                        <para>- Since the Minister for the Army announced that a suit to the value of £6 10s. will be issued to every discharged serviceman the public has been under the impression that that represented a substantial increase of value on the £2 10s. suit previously made available to such men. It now appears, from a letter which the Prime Minister had sent to an ex-soldier from Goulburn, as reported in last week's press, that the increased value is only about £1, the explanation being that £2 10s. was the wholesale value of the suit previously given, whereas £6 10s. represents the retail value of the new suit. Can the Minister for the Army say what the position really is? </para>

                            <para>- In a statement that was published after the Cabinet came to a decision on this matter, it was pointed out that the suit to be given to a. discharged serviceman in the future would be the equivalent of a suit which he could buy from any retail store in Australia for £6 10s. It was also stated that until suits of the better quality were available, a voucher would be issued to a discharged serviceman which would enable him to purchase a suit to the value of £6 10s. in a retail store, and that, in addition, £1 would be allowed for a pair of boots, and £1 for a hat, making the total value of the outfit £8 10s. That statement was clear and definite, and left no room for misunderstanding. I understand that the manufacturers have delivered some suits of the new design to the army authorities, and they are available in 32 sizes, compared with eighteen sizes previously. I am assured that the new suit contains good cloth, and is in every respect equal to a suit which could be purchased in a retail store for £6 10s. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to ask the Minister for the Army a question regarding the position of a man formerly employed as a sergeant in the garrison artillery. With the approval of the Army authorities, he joined the Air Force and is now serving with air crew abroad.  His  mother has written to me saying that he is disturbed because he has received an instruction requiring him to apply for his discharge from the "Army.  His  appointment in the Air Force is for the duration only, and if he were discharged from the Permanent Military Forces he would lose his permanent occupation, together with superannuation rights, Asc. I ask the Minister to see that in this and similar cases no soldier so circumstanced shall be required to apply for his discharge from the Permanent Military Forces, when, the effect of such an application would be to prevent him from returning after the war to his former occupation. </para>

Permission has been given in some instances by the authorities for the building of houses, and they have been completed except for the roof, but no iron for roofing purposes can be obtained. In other cases, contractors will not begin building operations because there is no prospect of their obtaining roofing iron, and they want to know what the position is likely to be before they enter into contracts. </para>

                        <para>. -  I congratulate the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cur tin)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Curtin</inline> upon their safe return from abroad. I was most interested to hear from the Prime Minister his account of the important discussions in which he took part, and I was glad to hear his assurance that the ties of Empire were never stronger than they are now. Once more, we have had demonstrated the value of the Empire, whose efforts during the early stages of the war made possible the victory which is now in sight. When I was in England, I had an opportunity to witness at first hand the trials which the British people were enduring, and to note the courage with which they met them. My colleagues and 1 were impressed with the endurance of the people, and we left with the conviction firmly rooted in our minds that the Empire, headed by Great Britain, must at all costs be preserved as a guarantee of future liberty. We should never forget that, during the early part of this war, Britain faced the enemy alone. At one time, there was not more than a fortnight's supply of food in the country, and it was threatened at the same time from the air and from the sea. The submarine campaign was at its height, but the danger was eventually overcome. At this very time, too, 'other countries in all parts of the world, including our own, were screaming to Britain for help. I do not know whether we realize the value of the effort which Britain made in the Middle East, or the importance of success in that campaign. Had the Germans got through to Irak and Iran, joined with the Japanese, and perhaps thrust north through Russia, nothing would have been left for Australia, and eventually the United States of America, perhaps, but to go down before the enemy. But for the efforts which Britain made then, the Allies would never have been in a position to win the war. I am glad that Australia was represented by the Australian Imperial Force in those vital battles in the Middle East. While I was in Great Britain, I was left in no doubt of the gratitude of the people to Australia and the other Dominions. </para>

                    <para>After the war, there will be many problems to solve, and Britain will have its full share of them. Britain, unlike ourselves, will have to rebuild its cities, and will also have to re-establish its finances. Before the war, Britain was a creditor nation, but it was compelled to dispose of its overseas assets in order to finance its war effort. Moreover, during the course of the war, such countries as Canada and India had become important, manufacturing centres. Therefore, Great Britain will be confronted with serious difficulties after the war, having regard particularly to the fact that its trade credits are depleted, whilst the Unitell States of America has now emerged as the leading ship-building country.If the anxious  times ahead of the Mother Country, all members of the British Commonwealth of Nations should display great generosity in their future demands upon the United Kingdom, particularly when such demands involve monetary benefit to themselves. Canada has set us an admirable example in this respect. During the war it has developed its industries to a remarkable degree. It has been able to obtain sufficient man-power for its agricultural and secondary industries: and so great has been its production thai it has been able to wipe out its debt to Great Britain since the outbreak of war. In addition, it has made a gift to the Mother Country of foodstuffs and war material to the value of £800,000,000, and these goods have been shipped in vessels constructed in Canada itself. Canada made that grant as a gesture of goodwill, realizing the grave economic difficulties confronting Great Britain, and the great sacrifices made by its people. Australia and the other dominions should try to emulate  the  spirit thus displayed by Canada towards the Mother Country. Only in that way can be ensured the preservation of the Empire to which we are proud to belong. I again express my pleasure at the sentiments towards the Old Country which were voiced by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> in moving the Address-in-Reply Whilst Australia itself has contributed not a little to the war effort of the Allied Nations, we must realize that, in the not far distant future, Great Britain will be obliged to call upon us for further assistance. All of ais applaud the help given to the Allied cause by the United States of America. We must never forget, however, that the United States of America was enabled to render that help largely because of the orders placed by Great Britain for war material long before the United States of America entered the conflict on the side of the Allies, and before we heard anything at all about lend-lease. Up to that stage, the value of British expenditure and orders placed in the United States of  America amounted to approximately £1,000.000,000. The United States of America was thus enabled to strike so effectively when it entered the war. I remind honorable members oppo- site that these great achievements were accomplished under a system of private enterprise. I emphasize that point, because Government supporters seem to believe that the war provides an opportunity to wipe out private enterprise  in favour of government control in industry. When they remember the splendid record of the United States of America in providing the bulk of the requirements of the United Nations, let them also bear in mind that private enterprise was largely responsible for that success. Today unemployment is unknown in the United States of America. When I visited that country as a member of the Australian parliamentary delegation, I asked the general manager of one of the shipbuilding yards controlled by the great Kaiser organization what was going to happen to their employees after the war, and was informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kaiser</inline> had plans in hand for works which would provide employment for many more employees than were now engaged by that organization. I was told that he has prepared plans for the production of a car which will sell at from £80 to £100, and also a small aeroplane. I was also informed that the Kaiser organization employs a staff of scientists who are concentrating on the expansion of the work of the organization after the war. The lowest paid employee in the organization, an outside sweeper, receives £2 10s. a day. The Allied Nations owe it to themselves to do all they can to rehabilitate the countries devastated by war. With this end in view conferences of economists have been held at Bretton Woods, and plans now in hand provide for the creation of a fund for this purpose amounting to from £2,500,000,000 to £3,000,000,000. By such planning, the United Nations will avoid the chaos which otherwise will inevitably follow the war. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> who was recently described by the press as the Minister for the suppression of Information, endeavoured to frighten the people by painting a picture of a depression far more severe than the last which he said would occur in this country should the Government's referendum proposals be not agreed to. By indulging in such propaganda, the Minister does not do justice to himself or to his party. The last depression occurred when <inline font-style="italic">i\</inline> Labour government was in office in this Parliament. It would be as illogical to say that, because of that fact, the Labour Government was responsible for the depression, as it would be to say that this Government could prevent a depression in this country should conditions throughout the world which existed during the .last depression be repeated after this conflict. We must remember that the last depression was world-wide. To-day, however, the United Nations are prepared to pool their resources in order to prevent another world-wide depression; and we can best help to prevent another depression from occurring in this country by playing our part in the plans now being devised with that end in view by the United Nations. </para>
                    <para>Many factors operate to retard the development of Australia. Unlike Canada, we have not wiped out our national debt by production. Unfortunately, grave blunders have been made on our food front, resulting in severe handicaps being placed upon our primary producers. Owing to the shortage of man-power, many farms ha.ve gone out of production. Many old settlers, because of their patriotism, have done their best to carry on in the absence of sons and daughters who have joined the fighting services. However, the 'task has proved to be too much for many . of these people. Some of them have endeavoured to sell out, but have been prevented from doing so. Surely, in such circumstances, it would be wiser to allow these old people to make way for younger settlers. Our production of foodstuffs has fallen also because of the difficulty being experienced by primary producers in obtaining new machinery and spare parts for old machines. On one farm, to which I accompanied the members of the British and Canadian delegations, which recently visited this country, the farmer had been obliged to purchase a new junior rotary harvester at a cost of £182 because he had been unable to obtain spare parts for his old machine at a cost of £5. One can readily imagine the loss of production resulting under such conditions. The members of the British delegation expressed astonishment that this farmer was unable to obtain the spare parts he required. They pointed out that in Great </para>
                    <para class="block">Britain a primary producer,, who required spare parts for an old machine, had only to communicate with his business house which immediately made the parts if they did not have them on hand. The British Government's primary consideration was to keep machines running. Blacksmith shops which are absolutely essential to the maintenance of primary production arc being forced, by lack of labour, either to curtail their services or to close down. In my own electorate there is a smithy which will close within two or three weeks unless I am successful in obtaining the release from the Army of the son of the smith, whose arm is crippled; the son, a skilled blacksmith, ];as been a batman in the Army for two or three years. Almost any one can be a batman, but there are few blacksmiths. If this smithy is . dismantled, as is threatened, the producers of butter, maize and other essential commodities in the district will not be able to keep their horses shod and will be seriously hampered in their efforts to assist this country's battle on the food front. Food production is also seriously impaired by two factors operating to the detriment of garages in rural districts. Those garages have not sufficient labour to keep essential farming vehicles and plant in running order, and many of them suffer a second disadvantage in that their quotas of oxywelding gas are too low or, in many instances, almost non-existent. It is strange that many old-established firms are on very low quotas, whereas some newly established ones are on high quotas. 1 support what was said by the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Williams)</inline> about the excessive use of motor vehicles by the Army while the farming community cannot get tyres and is provided with insufficient petrol. Many Army vehicles ought to be stripped of their tyres to enable primary producers to put them to much better use than would appear to be the case with the Army. Primary producers are forced to allow their motor vehicles to remain idle because they have no tyres and are trying to take their produce to the railway on vehicles drawn by horses, for which they cannot even now get shoes that will fit. Even if that be impracticable, it seems that no reason exists why the farmers should be deprived et' lyres. For one thing, stores are bulging w.ib. huge stocks of tyres. Moreover, the tyres on tens of thousands of idle vehicles which were commandeered by the Army when invasion threatened could be distributed to the farmers. Another illustration of the almost countless difficulties under which primary producers are labouring is contained in the following letter which I received yesterday from the secretary of the South Burnett District of the Queensland Dairymen's Organization, an association which spreads over all the dairying districts of Queensland : - 1 have very definite evidence that mainten ance of primary production in this district is being menaced by the inability of farmers to maintain supplies of trace chains essential for all cultivation work by horse-drawn implements; in fact they cannot even obtain "split links " to join together the chains which break because of ordinary wear. I can assure you that this i9 a very real difficulty, and my organization would appreciate the making of strong representations by you to the proper authorities. </para>
                    <para class="block">I have made representations to the Minister. Trace chains are as essential to horsedrawn vehicles as are engines to motor vehicles. Fishing boats and nets are rotting while their former owners are making fruitless efforts to obtain their release from the Army, where they are doing nothing of value, so that they may return to their former occupation in order to aid in the production of a commodity which, if provided in sufficient quantities, will not only increase the range of food available to the Australian population, but also, by reducing the local demand, will enable the despatch of increased quantities of meat to Great Britain. Fish is a food, the growing of which costs nothing. The only requirements are men, boats and nets. The boats and nets are available - indeed they are rotting through neglect - but the men are not. I commend to the attention of the Ministry the suggestion that the food situation would be materially aided if fishermen doing little or nothing in the Army were allowed to return to their avocation. </para>

                    <para class="block">Those advertisements, inserted by the Commonwealth Food Control, appeared early this year. Later, the Army had to counteract their effect. Later still, those whose applications for release had been rejected were told to apply again. I made unavailing efforts to discover from the Army whether that advice came from it. Last week, we had an official statement that the whole matter of man-power is to be reviewed. This week, I directed the following question to the Minister for the Army: - </para>

                        <para>In view of the recent further announcements that more liberal assistance is to be extended to the dairying industry by releases from the Army, can the Minister for the Army say if, to make this possible, the Government is moderating existing sets of directions which to-day render impossible such releases and necessary assistance? </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The Minister was good enough to tell me that the matter was under review. We must  be  told whether the categories of men whose release was forbidden earlier are to be altered. It is of no use to say that 50,000 men will be released, thereby raising the hopes of the farmers, without action also being taken to make their release possible. It is necessary not only to say that the prohibition orders are being altered,  but  also to alter them. Needless anxiety and suffering have been caused to primary producers, particularly dairymen, by the vexatious announcements made from time to time that men will he released, when men are not released. I do not mind spending time over and over again on behalf of the farmers, but I do resent the loss of time caused to those whose applications for the release of their sons or other relatives to help them to carry on are either interminably delayed or refused. I know of many primary producers at the end of their resources of health whose applications for release of labour to assist in their efforts to produce essential foods have been turned down, notwithstanding that those applications have been supported by medical certificates, often in respect of not only the husband, but also the wife. No one can say that it is just that they should he deprived of the labour necessary for them to carry on merely because their sons happen to be what the Army describes as " specialists." Many of those specialists are motor drivers and mechanics whose retention was necessary when invasion threatened, but is not necessary now (because thu Army has trained thousands of them. All these matters require full investigation. A specialist in his own trade would be of greater value in carrying on that trade than as a batman in the Army. The Government should not be influenced by the fear that a return of men from unessential occupations in the Army to essential occupations in civil life would rouse further criticism by enemies like McCormick who run certain newspapers in the United States of America. Such men as McCormick have been enemies of the British Empire for twenty yearsThey have fed on German funds expended by Germany in an endeavour to keep the United States of America and Great Britain apart. "Why worry about what McCormick says when we know that the great majority of people in the United  States  of America are influenced not  by  what he thinks or says, but by what their renowned President, who stands with us and the rest of the freedom-loving world, says and does? </para>

The Prime Minister has been under an exceptional strain for several years. When the Labour Government took office this country was in dire peril. It is true that we had begun to mobilize our man-power and resources, but that effort was accelerated under his powerful direction. He has done a magnificent job. </para>

                    <para>Consequently, I was surprised to hear some honorable members opposite speak of his mission as if he had been on a pleasant holiday or picnic. The majority of honorable members realize the dangers that were associated with his mission. 1 have said on many occasions that if the Prime Minister went abroad to negotiate on behalf of Australia he would be a credit to himself and to the Commonwealth. I have learned on good authority that he created an impression more lasting and more favorable than had any previous representative of Australia. When he was given the Freedom of the City of London he delivered an address which created a profound impression throughout Great Britain and Allied countries - an address which will live long in the  annals  of history. Unfortunately, some honorable members who have spoken in this debate have not given to the Prime Minister credit for what he has done on behalf of Australia. They criticized his speech on the ground that it was confined to generalities. What else could they expect? We did not expect the Prime Minister to tell us details of the secret conversations which he had with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> and the Prime Ministers of other dominions. If the right honorable gentleman had done so he would have betrayed the Allied Nations, because he would have conveyed to the enemy information which they desire. I am satisfied that while John Curtin is leading Australia we need not fear the future. </para>
                    <para>Some honorable members complained that the Government had not revealed its plans for the post-war development of Australia. Personally, I am satisfied that the Government is planning wisely for the future. Of course, the moneyed interests in Australia are anxious that our slogan shall be " Business as usual ", because they are concerned only with filling their own pockets. Perhaps the greatest problem awaiting solution is that of monetary policy. I sought election to the House of Representatives because I wanted to support the Labour Government and the policy of the Australian Labour party, which is the only worthwhile policy for Australia. I am confident that the Government will do its job satisfactorily in the interests of the whole of the people. </para>
                    <para>Some honorable members criticized the action of the Government in holding a referendum at this juncture. The Labour party made it perfectly plain on the hustings that if it were returned to office one of its first acts would be to submit to Parliament a bill for the alteration of the Constitution. The Government has honoured that promise. I, for one, would have been disappointed if it had not done so. I am confident that when the referendum is held on the 19th August,  the  people, by an overwhelming majority, will grant to the Commonwealth the proposed additional powers. </para>

I do not believe for a moment that the right honorable gentleman would let Australia down. Obviously, the report of his mission, which he delivered to the House last Monday, is inconclusive in many ways. I realize that he was not able to convey to the House decisions on all matters that were discussed, but I propose to mention two notable omissions from his speech affecting rural Australia. Although the primary producing industries are the foundation of Australia's economic set-up, the right honorable gentleman omitted to refer to our future markets and to make a definite statement about manpower. I was interested in a. reply which the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> made to a question relating to the dairying industry. He attributed the record low production to drought conditions. That statement was not correct. The Minister included Queensland in his remarks, but that State has enjoyed the best dairying year since 1917. Prom August until the end of February, it had rain and heat, just when they were required. Admittedly, conditions were inclined to be dry towards the fall of the season, but that would not have had such a serious effect on production if man-power had been available to the industry. The Minister for Agriculture in Queensland, where a Labour Government is in office, complained very vigorously a. few days ago about the shortage of man-power in the industry, and gave the following information about the releases of army personnel : - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="179331194407212_14_0.jpg" />

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williams</inline>
                        also pointed out that although fewer releases had been recommended for the dairying industry in Queensland than in any other State, the population engaged in dairy production in Queensland exceeded that in any other State, and also that of all States, Queensland's percentage of volunteers from the rural districts for the armed forces was greatest. That, perhaps, explains why so few releases have been granted in Queensland. There is no better soldier than, the country volunteer. Men who have enlisted from rural communities have proved their worth over and over again on the field of battle. Because they are volunteers, naturally most of them are in operational units, and of course, the Army authorities are reluctant to release them. I think that explains in a few words why the dairying industry in Queensland is at such a low ebb. No less than 100 farms have gone out of milk production in one district alone, whereas one man released from the Army to work on each of those places would have enabled them to continue. I cannot see any immediate solution of this serious problem, because even if man-power were made available now, it would be impossible to get those farms back into production immediately, as dairy stock has been either sold or mated with beef cattle sires.
                    </para>
                    <para>The production of butter in Australia has reached a record low level. Whilst E agree with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully),</inline> that to some considerable degree that has been caused by the drought conditions in the southern States, there is no doubt that lack of man-power has been an important factor. The production of butter and cheese must be increased. I commend the Government's decision to give to the dairying industry first priority for Army releases, but I am afraid that if those releases are to continue on their present basis, the benefit to the dairying industry will not be very great. Of the 20,000 soldiers already released, only approximately 4,000 have gone into that very essential industry. The trouble seems to be that the recommendations of local committees composed of practicalmen who know just what labour is required on the various properties in their district, are ignored or overridden by meddlesome intervening bodies which give contrary advice to the man-power authorities. The result is that men whose services are not really essential are released, whereas others who could be of some real assistance are retained in the Army. Had the 20,000 men already released been selected carefully and distributed in the proper manner, food production would be in a much better position to-day. </para>
                    <para>I shall deal now with the serious threat to the wool industry created by the increasing competition of imported synthetic fibres. There is a question on the notice paper regarding this matter, and I trust that it will elicit some fuller information. However, the Government should make a full statement on this all important matter. The value to Australia of the wool industry under the Empire wool purchase scheme is estimated at £338,000,000 or approximately £70,000,000 a year ; but what will be the effect upon this industry of the increasing importation of synthetic fibres ? I remind honorable members of an exhibit recently shown in the King's Hall of this building. The exhibit included a chart which showed that whereas sales of clothing made from wool were more or less stable, sales of clothing manufactured from imported synthetic materials were soaring, and that, in the past twelve months, sales of garments made from synthetic clothes exceeded sales of woollen goods. A second chart showed that whereas the price of woollen clothing was more or less stable - that is to be expected because the selling price of wool under the imperial wool purchase scheme is constant - the selling price of clothing made from synthetic fibres had decreased considerably. So much so, in fact, that if the public were to purchase solely on the basis of price, the imported synthetic article would be selected every time, despite its inferior quality. I should like to know why the Government is subsidizing the importation of synthetic clothes at rates of from 2s. 5d. to 2s. ll£d. a square yard? Surely the Government must realize that the expansion of trade in artificial fabrics will have a detrimental effect upon our greatest industry. A deterioration in the position of the wool industry would effect not only wool-growers themselves, but also all other employees engaged in the industry, including drovers and shearers. Why pay manufacturers a subsidy on the production of artificial fibre while we are storing up large quantities of wool from which articles of a far better quality could be made? I am seeking an answer to that question, and at the same time protesting at the continuation of this policy which is so detrimental, not only to the wool industry itself, but also to our whole economic set-up. </para>
                    <para>I was informed by a man-power official in Brisbane that first priority in manpower releases for rural work was held by the dairying industry, second priority by the cattle industry, and third priority, by vegetable growing. I asked him what place the pastoral industry held, and he said that that industry was not in the picture at all. That, exactly, is the position - the pastoral industry is not in the picture either for Army releases or for prisoner of war labour. It has been denied prisoner of war control centres. Apart from some temporary releases for drought-stricken areas, this industry has not received any assistance, regardless apparently of how desperate the need for labour may be. A person running a pastoral property may become ill and unfit for work, but consideration will not be given to the release of Army personnel to take over his duties. Is this treatment to continue? I am offering this criticism in the hope that the Government will remedy this position. </para>

                            <para>-  Hundreds of releases have been made in respect of pastoral properties throughout Australia. Technically, cattle-raising is a pastoral pursuit. It may be that the formula for releases in Queensland is somewhat different from that applied to the other States, but I know that even in Queensland releases have been made for the wool industry, although possibly not so freely as one would have liked. </para>

                            <para>- Man-power authorities in Brisbane informed me that the sheep pastoral industry was not in the picture at all for Army releases. Apparently that is the policy of the department. I trust that in the review of Australia's man-power allocation - I regret that the Government has not given honorable members an opportunity to discuss the matter more fully - the factors which I have mentioned will be taken into consideration, and that servicemen available for release will be more carefully allocated to essential industries. My complaint is that, in the past, released service personnel have not been distributed according to the recommendations of practical men. </para>

                    <para>I have already received a protest from the Gayndah butter factory against any move to re-introduce daylight saving, because of its adverse effect in rural dis tricts. Ordinarily, the farming community works from daylight to dark. That is especially true under war-time conditions, but with daylight saving, these people have to rise before daylight and start their work by lamplight. The difficulty has been aggravated by tb&lt;refusal of the Queensland State Government to alter the commencing time of schools. Women, who have to assist in the dairy-yards, are obliged to get their children out of bed at an hour earlier than is good for their health and away to school. I know that this protest is justified, because I am familiar with the conditions under which these people work. It is because another section of the community is not doing its job that the farming people have to suffer in this way. Again I urge that in the interests of country people, daylight, saving should not be re-introduced. </para>
                    <para>I appreciate the opportunity I have had to make these remarks. Whatever I have said has been actuated by a desire to improve the position. I hope that when the House next meets, we shall haw a statement of policy in relation to the two important matters, the omission of which from the Prime Minister's speech I have criticized, and that we shall have an opportunity to discuss them. </para>

                        am not alone involved. I would have allowed the remark to pass, but for the fact that there might be an implication against the Prime Minister of Great Britain and the Prime Ministers of the other Dominions. We had consultations in order that we might inform the mind of each other  in  regard to our respective points of view. We considered that we were interpreting the views of the countries which we represented, rather than  out  personal views, so that, in the f  formulation  of policy, each government would be better equipped to act in concert with the other Dominions and, in particular, with the United Kingdom.
                    </para>
                    <para>There are three observations which I should like to make. The first is, that a world organization will be an invaluable contribution to the removal of the causes which lead to war. The next is, that the British Commonwealth must present towards that world organization the spectacle of a unified entity in matters of the highest import. That does not mean that we have to integrate our governments, nor does it mean that we have to present the spectacle of an absolute Empire bloc against the rest of the world. The Dominions, rather than the Motherland, have the largest interest in authoritative declarations whereby the British Prime Minister may speak for the Empire n? a whole. </para>
                    <para>Time and time again, it has been pointed out that this country has so mall a population that we have to take steps to increase it rapidly. I am quite in favour of the steps to that end that are being taken. But it would be false optimism to consider that there is likely to be a rapid increase. The shipping to bring people here, and the places whence they are to come, are considerations which have to bc taken into account. The problem of our security would not be fundamentally changed by an increase of population from 7,000,000 to 10,000,000, or even 12,000,000, in a reasonably short space of time; we should still rest on the postulate that without friends, allies and associates, we could be attacked by a superior force, and, perhaps, overrun. Therefore, whilst a world organization can do a great deal to remove the causes which lead to war, we have had the experience that nations have gone to war without what those governed by goodwill and reasonable intelligence would regard as adequate justification; that is to say, the causes which lead to war were not present. When the known causes which led to war have been removed, it can be said that a contribution has been made to the peace of the world; but that in itself would not constitute a guarantee of peace. Therefore, a concert of nations of like minds must be maintained. In that connexion, the observations of the Leader of the Opposition were most pertinent. The very case that he put - that is to say, the indispensability, in any conception of world organization, of a real membership with entire goodwill, not a mere formal membership of certain great powers - appears to me to be beyond argument. We generally address our minds to that problem in these days by saying that the sort of association which war has evoked must be maintained in the period after the war. But we would, I consider, humbug ourselves if  Ave  did not realize that the problem is one which requires careful management. All the time, it needs the most sober statement, and most certainly makes it necessary that the smaller parts of the British Commonwealth, however much they can offer their own views, must offer them with discretion and in the light of such other discussions as are proceeding. There is nothing easier than for a Prime Minister to make a speech on foreign affairs which is bound to cause difficulty and misapprehension somewhere. Therefore, when heads of governments discuss the problem of the concert of nations, they cannot always put forward with emphasis the particular views of their own countries, not because those views may not be justified, but because the bald statement of them in another part of the world, speaking a different language and probably facing different problems, may be entirely misunderstood. Therefore, our view has to be developed. We would first impart it to the British Commonwealth, the members of which would impart it to their ambassadors, and these would endeavour to develop a friendly acceptability of this view. We cannot by a crude and blatant declaration solve the problem of getting other countries to understand our point of view. All of these considerations properly impose a certain degree of restraint upon the heads of governments. </para>
                    <para class="block">A similar difficulty has no doubt been experienced by my predecessors. I make no apology for my inability to be as candid in public places in regard to certain problems of government, as one can be about certain other problems of government. I shall do my best to promote the splendid suggestion of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> in regard to the youth of Europe. They, at least, are guiltless of any contribution to the frightful catattrophe of world war. Animated by the impulse of humanity as well as by knowledge of the value which that impulse will be to ourselves, we can promote as far as possible the plan which the honorable gentleman has suggested. That is true also of the orphan children of the United Kingdom, except that our impulse is stronger in respect of them. Recently, a realization of their tribulations has been borne in on us even more poignantly than it was formerly. If one could add to the admiration which lovers of freedom everywhere in the world have for the people of Britain, it would appear that now is the appropriate time, in what looks like the stage leading to the successful termination of the struggle, when they are being called upon to bear an especially heavy punishment. For that, we feel regret, and extend our sympathy ; but our sympathy must be practical. That is why, in my statement, I indicated the nature of what will be a very great burden upon the people of Australia in the years to come. In addition to resolving our own problems, we have to share in resolving the problems of the world. We have accepted the obligation of making a very substantial contribution to the relief and rehabilitation of the countries that have suffered. </para>
                    <para>I do not wish to say more, other than that I believe that, however disappointed some honorable members may be with what I have said, the country as a whole has benefited by the debate which the House has just concluded. </para>

                        <para>- I shall gladly do what I can to give effect to the suggestion of the right honorable gentleman. Our own plans for post-war reconstruction, which aim at full employment, with rising standards, are well advanced. I am quite sure that a consolidated and an up-to-date statement of policy would be useful to honorable members. I trust that I shall be able shortly to lay before this Parliament a document broadly comparable in scope with the British White Paper. </para>
