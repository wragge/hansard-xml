                        <para>. - On Friday last, the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) asked rae a question concerning certain remarks made by the Minister for Transport and External Territories (Mr. Ward) on Thursday night. I now inform the House that I have discussed the matter with that Minister, from whom I have received the following letter, dated the 15th February, 1944 :-r </para>

                    <para>My dear Prime Minister: </para>
                    <para>Following on our conversation of this morning, I am surprised, and regret, that any one has misconstrued the meaning intended to be conveyed by me, but as such has happened I can assure you that it was not my intention to reflect adversely in any way whatever upon the Governments either of Great Britain or any other Allied country. </para>
                    <para>So far from wishing to reflect on the United Kingdom and our other Allies in this war, 1 have only the warmest admiration for the tremendous sacrifices being made by these peoples and the heroism of their fighting services in the common struggle to defeat the Axis powers. </para>
                    <para>Yours sincerely, (Signed) B. J.  Ward </para>
                    <para>I regard that letter as having removed any grounds there might have been for any assumption that the Minister for Transport and External Territories either reflected or intended to reflect upon the Government of either Great Britain or any other Allied country. </para>

              <para>We are at war, and there is urgent business to be done. The usual practice, when a motion of the nature of that of which the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) has given notice is placed on the businesspalmer, is for the Prime Minister to take a certain course, but I am quite ready, if the right honorable gentleman is agreeable, to take a different course, and to suspend the Standing Orders, or so much of them as would prevent the House from dealing with the motion forthwith.

                            the matter that I desire to raise concerns the censorship. I ask the Prime Minister whether or not, as the result of a censorship instruction, no portion of the speech which the Minister for Transport and External Territories made in this House last week has been permitted to be transmitted abroad. If the answer be in the affirmative, then I ask the right honorable gentleman whether or not he will give an explanation of the imposition of censorship upon a speech by one of his Ministers?

The industry that is threatened in Victoria is a vital one which would certainly have been the target for enemy attack had the course of the war in the Pacific not changed; yet this industry, upon which so many other industries in the State depend for power, was  left without adequate fire protection. Perhaps the Minister will take advantage of this motion for the adjournment of the House to tell honorable members why it is that, although it was the duty of his department to see that such an industry was properly safeguarded, no precautions were taken. </para>

                <para>Perhaps honorable members are not aware that many vital industries in Victoria are at the moment paralysed, and it is difficult to say just how far the damage will extend. Perhaps the Prime Minister could devote some time, which would otherwise have been devoted to the business of the House, to making a statement, either in the House or outside, upon what emergency action the Government proposes to take to ensure that Victorian industries shall be set going again. It is a piece of bitter irony that on this day he should give notice of another motion dealing with the control nf the coal industry. </para>

                        <para>- It was suggested last week that the name should be altered from coal-miners to code-miners because the industry has become completely entangled in codes of one kind or another. As I said, it is a piece of bitter irony that, at the very time of this disastrous outbreak of fire in Victoria which threatens the supply of coal and power in that State, all the southern coal mines in New South Wales should be idle because of a dispute which this Government apparently can do nothing to settle. A few days ago, the Prime Minister told the House quite frankly that the measure of the country##'##s war effort during the next few months, and perhaps the whole of this year would be the quantity of coal which could be produced. Then he waved his arms, and said that he wished some one could tell him how to get more coal. As a matter of fact, we do not need to tell him, because he told the House on the 14th October, when he outlined a carefully prepared policy for coal conservation and increased production. He told us of the measures which the Government proposed to enforce, and we were so im pressed by, them that, in spite of our concern over the dangerously low level of coal stocks, and over the fact .that industry would necessarily be interfered with owing to the shortage of coal, we raised no objection to his proposals. In fact, we approved of them.  His  policy seemed to be eminently satisfactory and sound. Here are some of the features of the Prime Minister##'##s scheme: He proposed to bring into the industry 600 exminers; he proposed to weed out the undesirable element from among the miners by an examination of their attendance records; he was going to mechanize many of the mines. Because of the critical position that has developed in Victoria, because responsible men in charge of industry and in control of public utilities in New South Wales have declared that stocks are dangerously low, and because war production is being hampered, we are entitled to expect from the Prime Minister something more than a gesture of helplessness. If that is the best he can do it is time this country had another government. </para>

                <para>It is significant that the Government has had to admit that production has seriously declined during the last twelve months, although during this period the Government has had a full measure of electoral support. It could not complain that its parliamentary position weakened its capacity to deal with the problem, yet during this very period production, instead of increasing, has declined. In spite of all the concessions that have been made to the miners, in spite of the tribunals that have been set up to deal with their claims and disputes, production has declined. </para>
                <para>The people of Victoria are vitally concerned in this matter. They have discovered almost overnight in what measure the successful conduct of commercial operations in that State defends upon the production of coal either m Victoria or elsewhere. I remind the Government that the coal is here to be won, and we have the men here to do the job. Does the Prime Minister propose to allow this condition of anarchy to continue, or is he going to give those States which are so drastically affected by the present coal shortage some idea of what emergency action he proposes to take? </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to add something to what has been said by the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt).</inline> Since the House is to adjourn, and as it is not proposed to proceed with the important business of which the Prime Minister has spoken, I suggest that he might, in the interval between the adjournment of the House and the resumption of the debate tomorrow, look into that code which says that men who cause strikes in coal mines may be called up for military service or for work with the Allied Works Council. I ask the Prime Minister whether any one has yet been called up under that provision? I do not think that any one has. These miners, who can earn from ##£##7 to ##£##15 a week - with a minimum amount of labour a man can earn ##£##7 a week in the coal mines - might well be called up, and men who have served for three or four years in the Army might be released to take- their places. The present position is acute. Munitions f actories have closed down, and others will close shortly. It is high time that action was taken along the lines which I suggest. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to identify myself with some of the remarks made by the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt).</inline> The coalmining industry is in a position of absolute chaos and anarchy, and something should be done about it immediately. It might be as well to state the facts concerning the dispute on the southern coalfields of New South Wales, the facts which precipitated this extraordinary strike. The trouble at Coalcliff seems to have developed out of a feud between the  president  of the miners##'## federation and the owner of one of the mines, the men concerned being <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Louden</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vickery.</inline> For the last fifteen years, what is known as the three-lift system has been in operation in the south coast mines. It is efficient and has proved to be iri every way satisfactory. The scraper loader has modernized the three-lift system, and it is because it is desired to introduce a two-lift system - incidentally, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis</inline> has agreed to it - that this strike has occurred. The pillar workings at Coalcliff are the deepest in New South Wales, with from 1,500 to 1,600 feet of cover. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Honorable members will understand that the health of the miners and the safety of the mines are the responsibility of the Government of New South Wales. It has been found that the safest way of working the pillars is by means of the scraper loader. Between 40,000 and 50,000 tons was taken out by the scraper loader without the slightest accident over a period of three years. Then, on representations being made by the miners, who thought that their jobs were endangered, the Minister for Mines, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baddeley,</inline> had the act amended in order to- compel the removal of the scraper loaders. I remind honorable members that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baddeley</inline> represents Cessnock and is, therefore, dependent upon the miners for his seat in the State Parliament. The miners continued working the three-lift system with picks, and it was found that the time factor in taking pillars was the main factor to be considered. The quicker the pillar was taken out, the more coal was saved. The miners know that they cannot control the roof with two men on the pillars and yet they object to a threeman lift. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Louden</inline> approached the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt).</inline> The Attorney-General will correct me if I am wrong, but my information is that he gave specific instructions to the  chairman  of the Central Coal Authority to stop it. </para>

                        <para>- He can make his own statement. Possibly we shall be able to prove that what I say has taken place. The short facts are that the manager, who knows that it is totally unsafe to work two men on the pillar, ha3 ##'##been ##'##forced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis</inline> to adopt that particular system. It is necessary for the House to understand the true position about this particular hold-up and that the country should know the general conditions which obtain in the coal-mining industry. I have a question to ask the Prime Minister and I think that he should answer it, because, if the answer is in the affirmative, it is time that action was taken by the country to see that this humbug about the winning of coal was done away with and the facts were brought to light. I ask the Prime Minister whether he proposes to appoint the Commonwealth Coal Commissioner as the supreme authority in the coal-mining industry and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> C. Willis is to he his industrial officer? Will the right honorable gentleman inform the House whether the Government or any member of the Government has issued or proposes to issue instructions to the . Coal Commissioner that he must: (1) refrain from allowing the employment of free labour in the mines; (2) if the miners threaten a general stoppage at any time, give way to their demands ? I charged <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis</inline> last week with being completely biased. I declare now that he has taken instructions from Commonwealth Ministers in regard to the coal-mining industry. </para>

                        <para>- I am going to reply. We are debating a motion for the adjournment of the House. It was moved by me because I believe that, when the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> moves a censure upon the Government, that matter must be decided before the Government can confidently continue public administration. That is the invariable practice of all parliaments and has been the practice of this Parliament. 1 did endeavour to find a way in which the notice of motion could be debated with a minimum of delay in the conduct of public business, but the right honorable gentleman, no doubt for reasons that he thinks proper, and which are not for me to question, desires that the matter shall be dealt with to-morrow. Therefore, unless I was prepared to do what I would never do, namely, treat the views of the Leader of the Opposition with disrespect, I had only this choice - either to continue the public administration and the business of this House as though the motion were not seriously intended and could have no possible effect, assumptions which I am not prepared to make, or move the adjournment of the House. Honor aWe gentlemen sitting behind the right honorable gentleman desire to treat his motion with far less respect than I have treated it. They have treated it as though it were an intrusion into matters which they deem more urgent or more vital. That is their business. But I have a duty to the authority of Parliament. I endeavour to respect it. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition, next to myself, has not only a duty to Parliament, but also rights in Parliament, which even the head of the Government cannot claim. Therefore, out of respect for him, but more so out of respect for this great institution of Parliament, I have invited the House to adjourn. </para>

The basis of paymentis as follows: - Summer time-table, ##£##15,000-130 voyages equal to ##£##115 7s. 8d. per voyage; winter time-table, ##£##15,000 - 96 voyages equal to ##£##156 5s. per voyage.

The exigencies of war have tosome extent interfered with transport generally and citizens generally are  put  to inconvenience and in many cases extra expense in necessary travelling  from  place to place. To grant a subsidy to Australian National Airways to enable citizens to travel by air to and from Tasmania at steamer rates would invite similar applications from many directions in the other States and would create a precedent which the Government could not resist in considering those applications. In the circumstances it is regretted that a subsidy cannot be granted in this case. </para>

                            <para>The restrictions on the sale of cream, icecream and processed milk and the rationing of butter, were introduced as a means of partly bridging the large gap as between  total  essential demands and prospective production. No restriction has been placed on  farm  butter production, other than the condition imposed by the Rationing Commission to prevent a large potential black market. There is nothing to prevent a registered dairy-farmer from ceasing to manufacture his own butter and forwarding the cream to a butter factory - in fact this is a course that should be encouraged. </para>
