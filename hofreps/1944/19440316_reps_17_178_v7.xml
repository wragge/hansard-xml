Should an honorable member desire to challenge their accuracy, I suggest that he should mention the matter to me so that I may consult with the  Clerk  and the Assistant  Clerk,  both of whom keep records. If, as I anticipate might be the case, p. ruling given by a  Chairman  of Committees were involved, that gentleman also might bo consulted. The question is not one of order. A substantive motion, of which notice had been given, would be necessary if the matter were to be dealt with otherwise. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; that is the best safeguard. If a mistake had been made, it might be adjusted after a proper inquiry. On the other hand, the submission of a motion might have very far-reaching consequences, one of which might be that whilst an honorable member might have a perfectly legitimate complaint he might be over-borne by a majority of the House. I warn honorable members that the establishment of the precedent of moving for the alteration of records which are kept by  disinterested officers of the House might be dangerous, in that, at some time or other, a majority of the House might find it convenient to have a record erased. </para>

                            <para>- I have already indicated that this is not a question of order. I have allowed the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> to state his case in his own way. I point out to him that he is not assisted by the standing order which he has cited. There is nothing in the Standing Orders which would prevent the House from proceeding with business between the naming of an honorable member and the subsequent submission of a motion for his suspension. The honorable member seeks some assistance from his submission that during this interval no business should be transacted. That is not borne out by the standing order. It is clearly stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> shall forthwith put the question, upon the motion being made. There can be no debate after the motion is made, but business can be transacted before the making of the motion. As I promised the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> I undertake to consult with all the authorities on the matter - with the  Clerk  and with the  Clerk </para>

                            <para>- I desire to speak to a point of order arising out of your explanation. It would appear from your interpretation of the Standing Orders that an interval could elapse between the naming of a member and the taking of subsequent action, and that during this interval the business of the committee could proceed. If that be so, then no restriction could be placed upon the named member participating in the business of the committee, and this, I submit, would be a negation of the intention of Standing Order 56, which is disciplinary in Character. </para>

                            <para>- I am convinced that my ruling is sound. The honorable member was named, and left the chamber. He might have gone outside the precincts of the House. He might even have got into a fast motor car and gone elsewhere. Is it contended that the entire business of the committee should be suspended until he could be captured and brought back to the build.ing ? Obviously, the standing order was drafted so as to permit business to be continued after its interruption by an incident such as I have described. </para>

                            <para>- Matters relating to the provision of cool storage space have been attended to by my assistant, the honorable member for Ballarat (Mr. Pollard). He has a record of all space available and has discussed the provision of cool-storage space with the apple-growers of Victoria. We are doing all we can to meet the requirements of growers. If there is any vacant space, the Apple and Pear Board will make it available to Victorian growers, because the board is just as anxious to serve the interests of the Victorian growers as is the honorable member himself. </para>

I want to make it clear that I have not at any time suggested that the Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> or any other Minister desired to hide anything or to suppress the facts. There has been dereliction of duty on the part of some one associated with the Department of War Organization of In dustry. For three months I have been trying to have this matter thoroughly sifted. By letter and personal interview, I have placed before the Minister for War Organization of Industry facts which have been brought to my notice by my constituents. As far back as the 14th December last I sent to the Minister a copy of a letter setting out the facts sent to me by a body in my electorate in regard to a number of buildings already constructed in the Bankstown district by a man named Fitzpatrick. Since then, I have sent the Minister further letters and seen him personally.  His  answer has always been that he is having the matter investigated and is awaiting the report. In view of the delay and the lack of action, I now consider it to be my duty to seize the opportunity provided by the presence in the House of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and all the other Ministers to make the facts known to them as well as to all other honorable members. Apart from the fact that there has been a definite dereliction of duty on the part of some officer of the Department of War Organization of Industry, there has also been lack of collaboration between that department and the Attorney-General##'##s Department. I dealt with this matter on the motion for the adjournment of the House last week, and in his reply the Minister for War Organization of Industry said that certain aspects of the matter did not come under his jurisdiction. I then asked him whether he would confer with the Attorney-General on those aspects, and he said that he would. On Friday, I asked him whether he had conferred with the Attorney-General. I do not know whether he misunderstood m.y question, but I did not misunderstand his answer. Again, yesterday, I asked the Minister whether he had received the report of the investigation. He said that he had, hut that he had sent it to the Attorney-General. I inquired of the Attorney-General whether he had received the papers. He had not. Perhaps he will say now whether he has received them. A little while ago, we had a similar illustration of the lack of collaboration between the two departments, in the matter of a certain swimming pool. The Minister for War </para>

The case with which I am now dealing is similar, in that labour end materials have been used. Yesterday the Minister told me that he had received a report. His words were - </para>

                    <para class="block">Yet, two months ago, I was told by the officials of the Department of War Organization of Industry in Sydney that they regarded this as a flagrant breach of the National Security (Building Control) Regulations under four headings. What has happened in the meantime? The Minister now says that his advice is that the National- Security Regulations do not apply, and were not in operation when the buildings were in course of construction. I know that in local government circles, and in the Allied Works Council, influences are at work to prevent this matter from being brought to light. I quite believe that in the Bankstown Municipal Council obstructions would be raised to prevent a successful investigation of this matter, but there are other sources of information which could he drawn upon ,by the department##'##s investigators. </para>

He says now that apparently there is no breach of the regulations, whereas two months ago there was in the opinion of the Minister##'##s own officers a breach under four headings. There is the additional fact that if the Minister was relying on information from, the local government bodies, perhaps the officials were precluded from getting the full facts. But I made it clear that there was definite collusion with officials of the council in regard to the matter, and the departmental officials have not interviewed the people who supplied the information which T sent to the Minister. Everybody in Bankstown knows about this matter. </para>

                                <para>- I have already said. In the first place, I understand that this individual applied for permission to  make  additions, at a cost of ##£##100, to a galvanized iron structure to house motor lorries. The Bankstown Municipal Council gave permission, and I understand that similar permission was also given by the Department of War Organization of Industry. The Minister can check me in that regard. The galvanized iron structure has disappeared, and in the place of additions that were to cost ##£##100 a cottage and a large building have been  erected  The dimensions of the building are: 160 feet by 60 feet by 40 feet. It has 24 skylights,  fibrolite  walls, steel girders and expensive electric light fittings. The floor and a huge yard, involving many thousands of square feet, are of concrete. </para>

I ask honorable members to note the contrast between the inquiries promised by the Department of War Organization of Industry and the expeditious investigation by the Department of Labour and National Service. On the 9th March, I expressed to the Minister for Labour and National Service my disappointment with the slow progress of the inquiries, and he asked me to put my complaint in writing. I did so. He immediately communicated with the  Deputy  Director of Man Power in New South Wales <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bellemore)</inline> who received the letter on the 10th March. Within the next 24 hours <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bellemore</inline> submitted to the Minister a full report of the results of his inquiries. I ask honorable members to compare the information obtained by the Department of Labour and National Service in 24 hours with the inactivity of the Department of War Organization of Industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bellemore</inline> said - </para>

                        <para class="block">Honorable members can use their own judgment as to whether work of this nature, including a concrete yard and the transplanting of a residence, could have been undertaken in wet weather? The cottage in front of the building cost between ##£##400 and ##£##500, although the  cost  of the entire job was not to exceed ##£##100. The double garage has a tiled roof and texture bricks - materials required for vital defence works - and two steel shuttered doors; the cost must have been between ##£##200 and ##£##300. The amount originally allowed was ##£##27. The local government authority is involved in the construction of a concrete road past this residence. It was supposed to straighten out the road, but really runs at right angles to it. This is the only residence served by the new road. </para>

                                <para>- It is to the credit of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bellemore</inline> that he required only 24 hours in which to make inquiries and take action in this matter. I have asked the Attorney-General to intervene because materials urgently required for defence work have been used in the construction of this building. This, man had not obtained a priority for the erection of this structure. My information is that these materials were intended for vital defence work and were dumped on the Bankstown aerodrome. This man has carted materials for these defence works. Certain of those materials were put aside one afternoon and his lorry carted them away to the site of his garage. That is why the building resembles an aircraft hangar more than a garage. The steel girders and walls are cut to certain standards. Even a crane that was being utilized on this aerodrome was employed in the construction of the building. </para>

                                <para>- I do not desire to go into that aspect. I do not want to implicate any one else in the matter. All I know is that my information definitely implicates this individual, and residents of Bankstown and other places in my electorate are asking whether privileged people can ##"## get away with these things ##"## without being prosecuted. The people of Bankstown want the law to take its course in this matter. I have endeavoured to prevent the calling of a public meeting to discuss it, because I believe that it can be thoroughly sifted elsewhere. Now I have brought it to the attention of the House. The Attorney-General should make a full investigation of the circumstances. These materials were supplied from the Allied Works Council, and certain  officials  are very restive about the whole matter. An attempt has been made to bring influence to bear, and this vital evidence could be destroyed. Therefore prompt action is urgent. </para>

The honorable member for Reid has made the allegation that the Bankstown Municipal Council is involved in this business. I do not know whether there is any substance in that allegation or not. If the allegation is true, it follows that one channel through which information would reach me in regard to any infringement of the regulations would not be open. </para>

                        <para>Mr.DEDMAN - The honorable member brought the matter to my attention  on the 14th December and an investigation was instituted immediately. As I have said previously in the House, it is not always easy to obtain information concerning the infringement of building regulations. First, evidence has to be obtained that a particular building now in existence was not actually in existence when the permit was given. </para>

The point is that my departmental officers began their investigations at the end of December, just before the Christmas festive season. </para>

                                <para>- Probably not much was done until after the opening##'## of the new year. As I have said, we have not a large staff of inspectors. With the limited staff at our disposal we have been doing our best to obtain information as quickly as possible. During the last three weeks, the honorable member for Reid has asked me a series of questions. I have assured him that I was having a report made to me, and that I would expedite it as much as possible. I took steps to have the  deputy  director in Sydney informed that I desired to have it at the earliest possible date. Two days ago, (he honorable member for Reid again asked me whether or not the report was available. I replied that, so far as I understood the position, it would be in my hands on the following day. Last week, the honorable member asked me whether or not I would refer the matter to the Attorney-General. In a statement that, he made on a motion for the adjournment of the House, he raised a nember of questions which did not come within my jurisdiction. I am concerned only -with infringements of the building control regulations. The honorable member referred to the building of a road by the Bankstown Council. This matter has nothing whatever to do with either my department or any, other Commonwealth department. </para>

I received the report yesterday, and advised the honorable member to that effect.

                        <para>. - I do not know when the new heading first appeared. From the establishment of the Commonwealth, the practice was to supply a member with proofs of his own speech, and, so far as I know, no one else was supplied with a copy. If copies got into the hands of other persons, there was attached to them a red tab which stated plainly that they were unrevised, and were hot to .be quoted from. That was the practice until quite recently. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I say that it is the point. The form of the notice which appears on the ##"## flats ##"## is of no importance. We are concerned with the fact that unrevised, unedited copies of speeches are being circulated. I have not seen the notice now appearing on the ##"## flats ##"##, and I do not know what it contains, but the explanation I have given is quite a reasonable one. Naturally, the Principal Parliamentary Reporter has to take some responsibility for the form in which matter appears. He corrects obvious errors. He does not attempt to do more than correct such errors as arise in transcription, and so on. I can suggest nothing more than that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> should exercise your authority, and refuse to authorize the circulation of the ##"##flats##"## to more than a very limited number of persons. I heard you say that they were placed in the hands of heads of departments. Well, I do not think that they ought to be. </para>

                            <para>- Unless with his permission, it was never done. I have myself asked for ##"## pulls ##"## of speeches. I have asked for a ##"## pull ##"## of a Prime Minister##'##s speech when it dealt with a matter in which I was peculiarly interested or in respect of which I had to deliver an address in this House. I have asked in special circumstances the permission of the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General or individual ordinary members as the case may be, for that permission, and permission was usually granted. I am frankly disquieted to learn that a speech, with all its imperfections awaiting correction, has been made available to other members. </para>

My experience is that the <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> reporters,##'## being hampered by interruptions in the chamber and by the fact that they necessarily mishear or fail to hear some things that a member has said, being human, cannot do a job that is 100 per cent, accurate. In. those circumstances, it is disturbing to know that a speech which requires to be corrected, because it is not what the member has said, or in some cases intended to say. is handed to chosen leaders in this House as being in fact what he did say, when we all know from common experience that it is perhaps what he did not say. I should like to know when this practice originated. </para>

                        <para>.- I am amazed at this practice. I have been a member of this House for several years, and I know that what the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has said is perfectly true, and that before anybody could get a ##"## pull ##"## of a member##'##s speech he first had to get the consent of that member. I do not know when this new practice came into being, but I am certainly opposed to it. On one occasion I had an argument in this House with my own party, and a ##"## pull ##"## of my speech was used at the conference of the Australian Labour party, before I had even seen it myself. How that came about I do not know; but, when I complained that I had not given my consent to anybody but myself seeing it, I learned that it was actually purloined by some one. On other occasions, I have been asked to consent to my speeches being looked at. The position is that I mak; <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> speech to-day and I do not get a proof of it until late to-morrow afternoon, but the ##"## flats ##"## apparently are distributed first thing in the morning to the Ministers. </para>

                            <para>- One of mine was used at the Australian Labour party conference. The fact remains that they could be used. Like the honorable member for Batman, I desire to know when  this practice was introduced. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> made it clear that the innovation has not been made since he took office, because he was receiving the ##"## flats ##"## when he was Leader of the Opposition about three years ago. The House should be told who was responsible for the change. In my opinion we should immediately revert to the former practice under which no honorable member could see the ##"## pull ##"## of another honorable members speech unless he had first obtained the consent of the honorable gentleman who delivered the speech. </para>

                        <para>|o.##'##51##]##. - I have no feeling whatsoever about this matter. So far as I can recall, I was appointed Leader of the Opposition in 1935. Whether ##"##fiats##"## were available then, I cannot say; but they certainly became available to me because for some time, while I was Leader of the Opposition, I received ##"## flats ##"## each morning. I understood that ##"## flats ##"## were issued to Ministers and to the secretaries of departments. To that practice I raised no objection. I knew that they were confidential. I considered that whoever had been responsible for asking for the ##"## flats ##"## to be made available early to Ministers and departments did so only to expedite public business by enabling matters that honorable gentlemen had raised in the House to be promptly investigated by the departments. Otherwise, every Minister would need to have his private secretary in the House to take a note, independent of the <inline font-style="italic">Mansard</inline> report, of what honorable gentlemen say. If that course be insisted upon, we shall have to increase the accommodation of this building for the note-takers. If, on the other hand, the leader of a party or a Minister is not to be permitted to learn without delay what an honorable member has said except with his consent difficulties will arise. It is not always practicable to obtain that consent. If a speech is made on Friday, one cannot obtain the consent of the honorable member who delivered it until the following Tuesday or Wednesday. In any case, the member himself does not correct his proof for three or four days. I have had some experience in this Parliament. It is many years since I attempted to cor rect a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof of any speech that I made. I have found the reliability of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> beyond question. In fact, I believed that sometimes I did not speak so clearly as <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> recorded me as having spoken. </para>

If the House considers that the ##"##flats##"## should not be issued to Ministers and leaders of parties, it will have its way; but the consideration of many matters which honorable gentlemen themselves are eager to have dealt with promptly will Hp. delayed, because they can only be handled expeditiously if the ##"## flats ##"## are made available. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proofs and their distribution is not a new subject in this House even within my memory. Not long after I became a member of this chamber, some nine years ago. a fairly long debate occurred on the whole question of the availability of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proofs to Ministers, leaders of parties and private members. Having come straight from the Parliament of South Australia, I pointed out that the practice of the State House was to issue to every honorable member a copy of the whole of the proceedings of the previous day. If any corrections were made by speakers, other honorable members were able to compare them with the original <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>During the debate to which. I referred, allegations were made that certain vital words or passages had been excised from speeches made by honorable members in this chamber. Whilst I have one or two recollections of these incidents, I shall not deal with them now. I uphold the view of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> that if honorable members insist upon their speeches being word-perfect before they reach government departments the business of the country will be held up, because the departments will be prevented from giving proper consideration to the matters which honorable members themselves raise. </para>

                            <para>- That is the only point I desire to raise. I mentioned it years ago because I was accustomed to the practice in South Australia under which every honorable member received daily a copy of all the proceedings of the Parliament. There were 46 members of the House of Assembly, and each received a complete record of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on the following morning, to peruse if he felt so inclined. I do not advocate the adoption of that practice at the present time, when supplies of paper must be conserved and the cost of printing must be kept in mind. I seldom had occasion to refer to the whole of the debates, but if an honorable member sub-edited his speech, I could examine the correction by comparing the amended speech with the original <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record. Occasions may arise when there will be a little difference between what one says in the heat of the moment in answer to an interjection, and what he may record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as his more considered view of what he thought he ought to have said in answer to it. </para>

                            <para>- I direct attention, now, to certain trends in agriculture in this country, which will be forced upon our attention before very long, and certainly as soon as the war ends. It appears to nae that we can look forward to facing several most important problems in agriculture within measurable time of the conclusion of hostilities. This is true also of other agricultural countries, generally known as the new countries. I refer to New Zealand, South America, South Africa and, to a lesser degree, the North American continent. Some lessons were learnt by certain countries from their experiences in and after the last war. One of these very vitally affected the wheat industry of Australia. During that war certain countries, including France, Germany and Italy, were forced to expand their agricultural activities. The result was that the export market which they had previously provided for other wheat-growing countries was practically eliminated. The United Kingdom alone remained a considerable importer of wheat. The lessons of the last war have been repeated during this war. I believe that when the fog of war clears sufficiently we shall discover that certain vital alterations have occurred in the agricultural economy of Europe. This has been indicated in our experience with the United Kingdom, the one country in the European zone  with  which we have been able to maintain practically untrammelled intercourse. I believe that we shall find after the war that a greatly reduced quantity of foodstuffs will be imported by the United Kingdom because so much more is being produced there. In this regard I commend to the careful study of honorable members, especially those who represent agricultural districts, a small book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Britain Can Feed Herself,</inline> by Pollitt. If the contentions made in that publication prove to be true, Great Britain, in the future, will not import##'## two-thirds of its foodstuffs. This will mean that we shall be obliged to overhaul our agricultural industries. My view, which I submit for the careful consideration of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully),</inline> and other honorable members interested in agricultural industries, is that the situation in Great Britain after the war will vitally affect the future of agriculture in Australia. Our future will be affected also by the interpretation that may be given to the very important document known as the Atlantic Charter, which some honorable members seem to regard as a new Nicene creed. If that document is interpreted according to the meaning given to common English, we sha*ll witness, in the days following the war, a degree of free trade which has not been known in the lives of any of us, and it will make a strong impact upon our future agricultural policy. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>Another important factor will be the##"## ##"## wash-up ##"## in relation to lend-lease aid. Will Australia be a debtor or a creditor of the United States of America ? In either case, the situation will need careful thought. There can be no doubt that, as the result of the war, Great. Britain and other countries in Europe will have developed a far greater degree of self-sufficiency in agriculture than has been known hitherto. </para>
                    <para>The considerations that I have mentioned should be viewed in association with the ##"## tie-up ##"## of certain agricultural trends which are unmistakable in Australia. We have had evidence of them almost every day for nearly two and a half years, and they have created unprecedented conditions throughout the Commonwealth. During that period the most general call-up of men and women has occurred that this industry has ever known or is likely to know in our lifetime. This has had, and will still have, an important bearing upon the future of agriculture. Disturbances in the distribution of man-power become apparent very much more quickly in secondary industries than in primary industries. There are still some honorable members of this House who do not realize that, in the lust two or three years, the farms, dairies, stations, orchards and gardens of Australia have been kept in production very largely because of the activities of elderly people who had regarded their working life as almost finished. They have been aided in their work by juniors, too young for the call-up. </para>
                    <para>I raise these points not with any intention to criticize the Government unduly, but because I believe that they deserve serious and immediate consideration. Probably the members of the Government will submit statistics in rebuttal of some of my arguments, but every honorable member who is at all closely identified with life in our country districts will know that what I have said is true. We have witnessed the sale and  dispersal  of numerous dairy herds in the last year or two; the area put under fallow has been greatly reduced and fencing and maintenance of farms have not been maintained at anything like the required standard. All this has been due to the fact that the supply of man-power and materials has been inadequate. Of course, we all realize that man-power and materials are closely inter-related. Another stultifying factor in agriculture has been the reduced supply of artificial manures available to farmers. The combined results of all these handicaps may be staved off for##'##a time, but ultimately the situation will have to be faced and grappled with courageously. When manpower and materials are not available for use in secondary industries, those industries are quickly brought almost to a standstill. Primary industries are not affected so rapidly. Nevertheless, the lack of man-power and materials gradually assumes a snow-ball effect, and 1 am afraid that unless something is done promptly to meet the situation that is developing, disaster will overtake the food production programme of Australia, and the productive capacity of the various classes of land which we farm will be seriously reduced. </para>
                    <para>Perhaps the most serious problem is the lack of man-power. Most honorable gentlemen who were members of the last Parliament look upon me as one who was in favour of the greatest possible military participation by Australia in the conduct of the war </para>

I stand by what I say. If some honorable gentlemen opposite would adopt the same practice it would lead to an improvement in the political life of Australia. If honorable gentlemen opposite are as ignorant of the trends of agriculture as they appear to be of the trend in the relations of certain Allied countries and Russia, it is a poor outlook for the agricultural industries of Australia. </para>

                    <para>The distribution of man-power in Australia, as I have always said, should be such as will lead to our making the greatest possible contribution to the successful conduct of the war. Some people, including some members of this House, seem to think that advocates of conscription, of whom I have always been one, believe that conscription means; grabbing people by the scruff of the neck and putting them into a uniform. That is not conscription. The essence of conscription is that every person shall do the job that he is best able to doin war-time. This country is organized: on a basis of compromise. Unfortunately, that policy has dominated Australia throughout the war period. In my opinion, too many men have been called up from the agricultural industries and put into various services, and I do not confine that term to the three fighting services, of which the Navy is very small. </para>

                            <para>- In that connexion, I am totally opposed to the policy that is now being followed. I. have never believed in the voluntary system. It was the policy of the Australian Parliament at the outbreak of this war, and I was obliged to accept it, but latterly it has not been the policy. To-day, we have a system under which the Government retains and exercises the right to call up every man and woman in the community for whatever work it considers that they ought to do. I am satisfied from past observations that too many men arc in the different services, including the Allied Works Council and munitions establishments. An investigation by competent persons would easily prove that tens of thousands of the men who are attached to the Army, the ground staff of the Royal Australian Air Force, the Allied Works Council, and the Munitions Department, would be better employed if they were transferred to some other avocation. Among the avocations to which they might be* transferred, I should certainly give to agriculture the highest priority, as being the most important and the most deserving of having additional man-power allotted to it. </para>

                            <para>- There is no need for a referendum of the people to enable the Government to exercise such a power in time of war. During the 1914-18 conflict, there was no need for the present  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to have a referendum, on the question of conscription; all that he lacked was the courage to put it into force. He took the meek, mild, and middle course of appealing to the country to give to him the authority to do something which he already had the power to do. Conscription in time of war is the only possible policy, and the Government is not prevented by constitutional limitations from giving effect to it. There is no lion in the path, if the Government wishes to proceed along it. It can do that, and it is doing it every day of the week. Thousands of men in this country, with or without their consent, have been called up and have been allotted to the Allied Works Council; they have been ?ent to the Northern Territory, northwestern Australia, Cape York Peninsula, and even New Guinea. That is just as much an act of conscription as would be an instruction to men to dig potatoes, repair fences, or sink wells. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know anybody who would. I have been brought up on the gospel not of loafing, but of hard work. We hear too much in this country of the beautiful heaven in which we are to live after the war, with nobody working and everybody being well off. Viewing the agricultural position as I know it, I can say that when this war is over a very hard task will confront every agricultural industry, in the restoration of normal conditions in respect of repairs and facilities. That task will also confront the transport industries. Every one is aware of the deterioration of the railways system. There is only a limited volume of man-power and resources for employment in repair work. That will apply also in a certain degree to sea transport, and in very great degree to road transport. One of the things which I have noticed is the refusal of the Army Department to release certain vital tradesmen. A certain degree of success is being achieved, although I have not participated greatly in it, in securing the release of men from the Army for return to the land; but there seems to be reluctance by the man-power authorities to release men for saddlery establishments, blacksmith shops, and licensed road transport. If the agricultural industry is to function satisfactorily and successfully, repairs must  lie maintained, men must be employed in blacksmithing and saddlery establishments, and drivers who can take charge of road transport, as well as mechanics to keep road transport in repair, must lie made available. These things are essential. I have a strong feeling that the proper degree of attention is not being paid to them. I fully appreciate the difficulties with which the Government is confronted. With a huge majority - a very large tail on the dog - mid several big problems, it may not be having an altogether easy time. Nevertheless, I put it to Ministers that the agricultural position must be investigated. A long-range view must be taken of some of the problems that may be likely to arise, and a somewhat shortrange view of the problems with which we are immediately confronted. Repairs und maintenance of the equipment of the farmer and the capacity of the Australian transport system, are very important. If these are to be maintained, man-power and materials must be released. </para>

                        <para>. -  I do not know that I have any very great grievance in which to indulge myself for a little while, except that I am experiencing a certain amount of fatigue from the fluctuations between last night##'##s ideal jurisprudence and the occasional interspersion of jungle law, during which we witnessed some examples of misanthropy. I should not be riding my hobby-horse with characteristic enthusiasm, were it not for the fact that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> is, I believe, about to go abroad, and there are certain matters relevant to the future of Australia to which his attention might well be drawn so that he may give adequate consideration to them upon his return. Since I last spoke upon the population problem in this chamber, the British Government has taken advanced action in the form of the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the subject of population. I do not participate often in the debates which take place in this chamber; I leave it to experienced members to discuss in their own way the problems that affect the wider aspects of Australian life. I am interested in their contributions, but am not altogether sure as to how accurate their observations may be. Probably that applies also to my riding of my particular hobby-horse. But I have devoted a .considerable number of years to an investigation of the Australian _ population problem, and am perfectly convinced - and could advance an abundance of reasons to prove - that the Australian flag could be hauled down within 50 years. It is all very well to pave our cities with marble. The first requisite in all our schemes is to have an adequate population for the protection and development of our country. During the last few weeks, I have caused some investigations to be made by the appropriate authority, in order to ascertain what has been the actual position during the last few years in relation to our population drifts. Yesterday, I received a graph which I shall ask leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard;</inline> it clearly illustrates just what is happening to the Australian population problem. One side of it shows the variation of the death-rate. In 1S60, the death-rate was approximately 20 per 1,000, and by 1940 it had dropped to approximately 10 per 1,000, the decrease having been gradual. The top line on the graph shows the birth-rate during that period. In 1860, it was approximately 43 per 1,000, but in the last year before the war it had dropped to 17 per 1,000. A rapid downward tendency has been manifest, and if it be continued the death-rate will exceed the birth-rate before many years have elapsed. The problem is a tragic one, and should engage our serious attention. If my friends opposite are earnest  in their desire to expand and develop this country as our fathers wished it to be developed, we must first ensure a population that will be capable of developing and defending it. It is conceivable that within the next forty years we may have a population of about 9,000,000. I am speaking purely of the internal problem, because I see no reason why we should have an immigration policy; there are plenty of reasons why we should have immigrants, but there is no possibility of getting them. I am also actuated by a remark, made only last week by one who occupies a. very high place in. Australian public life, in which he appealed for a White Australia. I am in entire accord with the idea; but so as not to lose Australia, we may have to turn our attention to other matters. The Department of Health -only yesterday supplied to me very interesting figures which are indicative of population trends. Between 1881 and 1890 there were 43,483 persons who reached the age of 60 years, whilst between 1932 and 1934 the number was 69,950. From 1881 to 1890 the number that reached the age of 80 years was 10,438, whereas from 1932 to 1934 it was 22,223. We are maintaining our population purely at the expense of longevity. This graph clearly shows that if the birth-rate goes steeply down, if the deathrate is maintained, and if the longevity rate rises, eventually a very considerable proportion of our population will be in the old-age group. We have set out to build up an ideal social State. We are not the only people in the world whose aims are in that direction. If any one is prepared to inquire into what Great Britain is doing at the present time, he will find that whilst 40 years ago we probably led the world in our approach to social security, today we are lagging very considerably. I suggest, that while the Prime Minister is in Great Britain, he should inquire into what is being done in this direction. </para>

                    <para>The second report of the Director-General of Social Services contains figures at page 12 which show that in 1939, out of every 10,000 of the population, 128 were in receipt of invalid pensions; and I point out that, in order to get an invalid pension, a person mustobtain a doctor##'##s certificate showing that he is incapacitated. In 1940, the year after war was declared, the number of persons in receipt of invalid pensions suddenly dropped to 84 per 10,000. The following year it dropped to 83, then it returned to 84, and this year it is down to 80. What conclusion are we to draw from that? </para>

                            <para>- That is perfectly true. In order to show that the figure of 12S for the year in which war broke out was not abnormal, I mention that, in the previous year, the figure was 125, for the year before that 122, and for the year before that 119. Those figures showthat either the doctors##'## certificates were entirely wrong - and I have no desire to cast reflections on the members of my own profession - or that people notwithstanding their disabilities, are prepared to work in order to support themselves if suitable employment is offering. That is another matter to which we must##'## devote our attention after the war. I have discussed this problem of population with a great many people, and I have always been amazed to find that most, of them are firmly of the opinion that they know all about it. I have studied it from the biological, the economic, the social and even the spiritual side, and I do not know the cause of our declining birth-rate, nor its cure. Having regard to scientific achievements since the outbreak of the war, and their effect in annihilating distance, I do not believe that 7,000,000 people can hold Australia. It is our duty as persons concerned for the welfare of our country, to ascertain if possible the inherent reasons responsible for our unsatisfactory birth-rate. We would do well to follow the example of the Government of Great Britain, and appoint a royal commission to examine the problem and endeavour to find whether the cause is social, economic or genetic. Some say that the low birth-rate is due to the lack of social security, but I remind honorable members that the people with the highest measure of social security are the most infertile. I believe that the low birth-rate is due to a combination of factors. If Ave do not solve this problem we shall pay the penalty in the loss of our country. If <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Kinnear##'##s figures are correct, and it is true that in 1972 40 per cent, of the population will be in the old-age group, and 20 per cent, in the child group, then 1 am convinced that the remaining 40 per cent, will not bc- able to carry on the economic life of Australia, and provide for its development and defence. I say emphatically that it cannot be done. The lower animals are able to reproduce their kind in a few years. It does not take long to breed a herd or a flock, but the human being takes a couple of decades to grow to maturity. Already, the gravest damage has been done, and remedies, even if applied now, could not take effect for a considerable time. Statistics collected in Great Britain show that, since 1918, the number of persons in the old-age group has doubled ; the number over 45 has increased by 75 per cent.; whilst the number of children of school age is the same as in the nineties, when the population was only 23,000,000. It is of no use splitting hairs over problems assorted with democracy, fascism or totalitarianism if we allow the population simply to destroy itself. </para>

                    <para>The problem of population is not a new one in Australia, and I believe that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has even written a book on the subject. It takes a long time to get anything done here, and I need only cite our experience in regard to housing in support of that statement. In 1927, the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> was responsible for having passed by Parliament an act providing for the inauguration of a ##£##20,000,000 housing scheme. I am certain that if the Australian people were given an opportunity to express an opinion through a referendum, 99 per cent, of them would favour a national housing scheme; yet, although that act has been on the statute-book for seventeen years, not one house has been built as a result of it. If seventeen years is not sufficient time in which to make a start on something urgently demanded by the people, and for which there already exists legislative sanction, how long will it take us to awaken the people to the danger of their own self-destruction? </para>

                            <para>- Those figures are available, and that is an important factor affecting the birth-rate. It may be said, for general purposes, that the fertile life of the human female is the period between 18 years and 38 years. Our mothers married at 18, whereas the average age at which females marry to-day is about 28. Thus they have only ten fertile years of marriage, and they have already lost ten best years. However, the declining birth-rate is not due to any one thing. It is due to a multiplicity of factors, including urbanization, genetics, and biological, social and economic considerations. The tendency of men right throughout history has been to become urbanized, and, by achieving urbanization, automatically to exterminate themselves. How otherwise are we to explain the extinction of all the great nations of the past? In the beginning, nil peoples were rural dwellers. Later, they herded in cities, and the result was always the same. We call ourselves civilized people, but having regard to our mode of national life, it is a grave misuse of the word to apply it to ourselves. If a man falls sick he goes to a doctor, who tells him that if he takes plenty of fresh air, and perhaps goes away to the seaside, he will feel better. The patient pays the doctor liberally for telling him what he knew quite well before, but he probably takes the advice. However, our economic system demands that when the sun rises people shall go indoors, and remain there almost until the sun sets again. We do even worse than that. We say that the population must be increased, but we expect young married couples in their twenties to bring up children while the husband is on the basic wage; then, when the husband is 50 years old, and the children grown up, we pay him twice as much, on the ground that he is experienced. This is our economic system! This is the barbaric atmosphere in which we live ! We go about with our noses in the air, and we call ourselves civilized. </para>

                        <para>. - Yesterday, when I made some observations about a matter raised by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> rightly ruled me out of order, but the opportunity now presents itself to make those observations. The Government cannot allow the position to remain as it is. The charges that have been made by the honorable member against an unspecified person and unspecified departments are such that in other conditions a royal commission would have been set up before now. But, so far, no action has been taken by the Government, although three months have elapsed since the matter was first brought to the notice of##'## the Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> by the honorable member for Reid. We have been told that the matter is now in the hands of the Attorney-##'##General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> but this House should not be satisfied with that statement. In the interests of the country, it should require much more information as to what the Attorney-General proposes to do and. what will be the result of the inquiries into the matter. Honorable members representing Sydney electorates know that that city is seething with rumours which, if founded on fact, would appear to reflect grave discredit on the Government, and the charges that have been levelled by the honorable member are of such a character that the country will not rest satisfied until they have been thoroughly investigated. </para>

                            <para>- If the Minister for Transport had been present when the honorable  member for Reid made his charges, he would know. From time to time, we hear rumours of rackets associated with many war-time Commonwealth departments. I have many instances brought to my notice, but when I ask my informants to make sworn affidavits on which I can bring the matters to a head in this House, they decline, lest they should be victimized. For the prestige of Parliament, something must be done to pin down these rumours and to establish what foundation they have, if any. Certainly, the case brought forward by the honorable member for Reid must receive the closest attention. Apparently, a permit was issued for ##£##100 worth of work, but the honorable member displayed photographs proving conclusively that the buildings could not have been erected for less than ##£##3,000 or ##£##4,000, whilst the surroundings must have cost many thousands of pounds more. It is pertinent to ask whence came the labour and materials used to erect those buildings. The honorable member said that some of the materials closely resembled those used in the erection of the Bankstown aerodrome. I have heard rumours to that effect in Sydney, and I hope to be able next week to bring to the notice of the Government something more concrete which will cause the Government to do more than it apparently proposes to do in relation to the disclosures made by one of its supporters. We want to know, if the material is identical with that used in the construction of the Bankstown aerodrome, how it came to be used, because we all know that such material must be either purchased legitimately - and I do not believe that war materials have been offered for private purchase except on the issue of a permit - or acquired by some method that is not legitimate. Whence came the labour? Who authorized it to be made available? Were permits granted to employ men on the work? These are questions of more than passing interest. The charges of the honorable member would appear to give point to many of the rumours that one hears in Sydney, and it seems that at long last matters are coming to a head. Ministers and departments are involved. The Allied Works Council is involved. The Minister for Supply and Shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> and his department are involved. The Minister for War Organization of Industry and his department are involved. The member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales for the State electorate which embraces Bankstown was asked to do something in respect of sand leases on the St. George##'##s River. Because he failed to do so, he was disciplined. I do not propose to say what the discipline was. Therefore, the State Parliament is also involved. The Government must do something to establish the facts and not indulge in intimidation in order to sidetrack the matter. I say that because the Minister for War Organization of Industry, when the honorable member for Reid was making his charges this afternoon, attempted to intimidate him by describing him in most unparliamentary language, such as would not be permitted to be used on any theatrical stage in Sydney. It is astounding that such language can be used in this Parliament by a Minister in order to browbeat a Government supporter. That is the sort of intimidation which makes citizens afraid to make disclosures. I support the remarks of the  honorable member for Reid and demand  a  full inquiry into something of which  everybody  in the Bankstown district knows, but which is unknown, apparently, to the departmental officials who were sent to investigate it. </para>

                    <para>I am doubly interested in this matter, because of the disclosure by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> that only fifteen war service homes, thirteen for men returned from the last war, have been built during this war. The reason given for failure to build more is the lack of materials, but  it  would appear that that lack did not prevent the erection of the structure to which the honorable member for Reid referred. Whatever materials and labour are available ought to be diverted to the construction of homes for men discharged from the fighting forces. That aspect, of the matter gives added weight to the demand that, instead of trying to intimidate a member of his own party by using foul and abusive epithets that count as insults in any company, the Minister for War Organization of Industry should do everything possible to ensure full inquiry into the honorable member##'##s charges. I put it to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> that, if honorable members, in the discharge of their duties to their electors, are to be intimidated by Ministers, the general public must feci that their welfare is insecure. In these circumstances nothing less than the closest inquiry, by a royal commission if necessary, will suffice to meet the requirements of the people and, I suggest, every honorable member of this </para>

                        <para>.- I do not wish to add anything to what I said earlier in regard to the matter which the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> has just debated. I have said sufficient for one day on that matter. I hope that when honorable members rise to speak on ##"## Grievance Day##"## they do so to bring forward real grievances and that the Ministers concerned will pay heed to what is brought to their notice. I say that because, on last ##"## Grievance Day ##"##, I raised matters concerning the Department of the Army, but so far without result. I was. very interested to hear the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eraser),</inline> when delivering his maiden speech on the Constitution Alteration (Post-war Reconstruction) Bill  1944,  suggest the setting up of an auditor-general of civil rights. Whilst I agree that some independent authority like that should be set up, I think that it should be an authority subject to the will of Parliament. I still advocate, particularly in connexion with Army matters, a standing committee to deal with grievances referred to it, in order that full .justice may be done to the members of the fighting forces. Certain cases which have come to my notice show that is vitally necessary. When Parliament re-assembled in February, I directed the attention of the Minister for the Army to 70 B class men who had been sent from northern units to Sydney to bc discharged from the Army for the purpose of engaging in the production of food. Instead of being discharged in accordance with the recommendation of their officers, these men were sent to other parts of the country. Comparatively few of them were released. When I raised this matter in the House, the General Officer Commanding Lines of Communication, Sydney, admitted that for three weeks during last December, the policy of the Government to release B class men for the purpose of enabling th##'##.m to engage in the production of food had, been suspended. I asked the Minister to inform me whether that action was taken on the initiative of the Army or at the instigation of the Government. I have not received an answer. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Three weeks ago, I referred to the treatment of other B class men. In a  letter to me, a corporal pointed out that 200 B class men who were members of a northern unit, had applied for release, in accordance with the Government##'##s policy, for the purpose of entering rural industries. They complained that their applications were not being dealt with, and alleged that they wore not being forwarded to the proper authorities. Instead of being released, the men were given hard  navvying  work on the wharfs. When their health failed, they were court-mar ti ailed and fined. They were not allowed to appeal against the decision of the court. I asked the Minister to call for a report on the matter, but to date he has not replied to my representations. </para>
                    <para>I should like the Minister also to inform me who is the officer at Victoria Barracks. Sydney, responsible for dealing with applications for release from the Army. I am satisfied that these applications are not receiving the sympathetic consideration to which they are entitled. </para>

                    <para>Speaking upon the Government##'##s constitutional proposals last week, the honorable member for Eden-Monaro stressed the necessity for preserving civil rights. Two instances have come to my notice that add weight to the contentions of the honorable gentleman. Indeed, this matter should be investigated by a parliamentary committee. Edward William Keating, formerly of the Merchant Navy, was rejected on medical grounds when he attempted to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force. He is now a greengrocer in business at Dee Why, New South Wales. On the 26th February two military policemen accosted him and pulled him roughly from his cart. They forced him to enter a military wagon and demanded the production of his identity card. He explained that it was either at his home or at his place of business, and asked the provosts to drive him there. Passing the Dee Why Hotel on the way to Manly, Keating noticed a. civil police man, grabbed the steering wheel of the wagon and caused it to turn into the kerb. He called to the constable to identify him. When the policeman did so, the provosts released Keating without apology. </para>

            <para>Instead they are seen driving around the district with the fruiterer forcibly ensconced between them. Perhaps if the fruiterer had not had the luck and courage to see and attract the attention of a policeman, they might be driving about with him still. </para>

            <para>Driving a borrowed horse and cart, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keating</inline> had gone 100 yards along the road, and was turning off Pittwater-road into Harbord-road, when a military truck pulled up alongside. ##"## A big sergeant jumped out,##"## said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keating,</inline> ##"##and said, ##'##Where are you going?##'## ##"## I said,##'## What the-- has that got to do with you? ##'## </para>
            <para>Sergeant, a military policeman, ordered me off the cart. I refused to get off the cart. ##"## Driver of the. military truck got out, and the sergeant and the driver pulled me off the cart. ##"## One chap held me by the arm. I was not struggling. I was a bit flabbergasted. There were some cement burns on my arm. One ot the provosts asked what they were. I said they were old boil scars. Suggestion was that they were Army vaccination marks. They were three inches below where vaccination marks might be. ##"## I attempted to remonstrate with them. They said, the big sergeant and the smaller driver, that I was trying to stand-over them. ##"## They bundled me into their truck between them. They then asked for my identity card.

I said,  Drive me straight home and I##'##ll show you##"## my identity card.##'## ##"## They said ##'## Righto, we##'##ll drive you straight home.##'## ##"##They then drove towards my home, but when in front of it they refused to pull in. They inquired where my business was. I told them. They drove slowly past my business. I asked them not to make me so conspicuous, driving me past my business slowly in a provost truck. Sergeant said to the driver,  Drive just as you are instructed.##'## ##"## I asked the sergeant to come into my business with me so that he could meet my mother-in-law. He again refused. ##"##After the truck passed the shop, there was some discussion whether they should take me to Manly or to Narrabeen. They turned the truck and came back on the left-hand side of Pittwater-road, to Deewhy Hotel. I saw a policeman standing in front of the hotel. T called out to him.  ##"## Driver said, ##'## Keep quiet.##'## ##"## With that, I kicked up a row and struggled. I was hit a glancing blow on the head. But I wrenched at the wheel, and they had to pull the car into the kerb. I called out to the policeman. Sergeant also called out to the {policeman, who was some yards away. Policeman walked towards the car. ##"##Sergeant told me to keep quiet; it was his say, he said. ##"## I said to the policeman, ##'## Do you know me?##'## ##"##Sergeant said, ##'## Do you know this man ?

                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keating</inline>
                had been abusive when spoken to, and had not carried an identity card. Sergeant then said he would drive

                    <para>- I cannot see how the publication of the article would affect the security of the country. I understand that Army censorship was responsible for suppressing it, but, in my opinion, the publication of such articles would have a beneficial effect on public morale, because civilians would know that they could obtain protection by appealing to the press. </para>

The matter was brought to his notice by one of my constituents, perhaps because the honorable member was formerly Minister for the Army and is a member of the Advisory War Council. There is no tribunal to which members of the Australian Army may appeal if they believe that they have been wrongly convicted.

He went with a Field Ambulance Unit from New South Wales to Western Australia. ##"## I contracted a skin disease in June, 1942,##"## he Bays; ##"## and since then I have been in eleven different hospitals, under the care of nineteen different doctors, and seven specialists; five skin specialists and two psycho-analysts. I have had 22 different treatments, including dyes, pastes, creams, lotions, powders, pills, and six doses of X-ray therapy. I still have the disease. ##"## After I had gone through a number of these treatments, I was transferred to the Military Hospital at Perth. ##"## One day the talk in the mess in the Sergeants##'## Wing turned on self-inflicted wounds. One man said, jokingly, that he knew a way of making the leg swell by injecting petrol under a kneecap. I said, ##'## I##'##ll be here for the duration; I##'##ll rub it with a brick or a towel ##'## - meaning the skin disease on my thigh. These jokes were a commonplace of the mess for some days. ##"##Next thing I knew I was placed under open arrest and then tried by court-martial. T was charged with misconduct in that I delayed the cure of a disease by rubbing the affected area with a towel. There were six alternative charges, that I had made statements in the Sergeants##'## Mess. ##"## At my trial, I was not allowed to produce the evidence of my medical history in the. report or statements of the many doctors and specialists who had attended me. My unit doctor was the only doctor allowed to give evidence for me. ##"## One skin specialist gave evidence that my whole skin condition was self-produced. Though my unit doctor was familiar with my medical history, the court-martial preferred the evidence of the skin specialist. ##"## I had not been given time to prepare my case, and I had been granted only two sessions of five minutes with my defending counsel. ##"## 7th April of this year I was sentenced to be reverted to the ranks, and given six months##'## detention. I was stripped of my rank before 000 men, and sent to detention at Fremantle. ##"## At Fremantle I paraded sick to the doctor each day. He gave me aspirin until the eighteenth day, when he put some dye on my skin eruptions. Later I was moved to Kalgoorlie. </para>

                    <para>Of course, all my pay was forfeited from April 7th, when I was sentenced, until July 15th, when I was released on suspended sentence. Thereafter I was paid as a private instead of as a warrant officer; and I wasreduced to a drawing rate of ls. a day to make up the amount which Army had continued to pay my wife after I was sentenced. My wife also suffered from the reduced rate of pay, from W.0.1 to private##'##s pay. 1 understand that because of these deductions, I was still ##£##45 in debt in my Army - account on my discharge, so that I shall  receive only ##£##20, if that, from my deferred pay of about ##£##65. </para>

                    <para>With further reference to your representations of 10th December, 1943, on behalf of NX42262 M. J. Vowles,. 2/14th Lt.  Fd.  Amb. (private address 28 Frampton-street, Lidcombe) regarding his reduction in rank prior to discharge, and the amount of pay which he lost thereby, I desire to inform you that inquiries concerning this matter have now been completed. </para>
                    <para>Investigations show that  ex-Pte.  Vowles was, on 16th April, 1943, as the result of conviction by court-martial of a number of serious military offences, sentenced to be reduced to the ranks and to undergo detention for six  months </para>
                    <para>The sentence of detention was suspended as from loth July, 1943, and the soldier, having subsequently been medically boarded and found unfit for further service, was discharged on 9th November, 1943, medically unfit and granted fourteen days accrued leave with pay. It will be appreciated that the loss of pay of which the ex-soldier complains naturally followed upon his reduction in rank. </para>
                    <para>Having regard to the serious nature of the offence it is not considered that the sentence was excessive, and it is regretted that no further action can be taken in the matter. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the representations of the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> and the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> for an inquiry into the allegations of breaches of the building regulations by the man Fitzpatrick, at Bankstown. I realize that the honorable member for Reid will probably be dealt with rather severely for having had the temerity to bring this subject to the notice of the House, but now that it ha? been ventilated it should be referred to an appropriate body for complete investigation. The honorable member for Reid has referred to this subject four times in this chamber. He began his representations in a letter which he wrote to the Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> on the 14th December last. So far, he has had no reply to his requests. Photographs have been made available to-day which indicate that although farmers have not been able to obtain permits to replace broken-down milk bails and the like, this individual has obtained authority from the Bankstown Council to. build a garage 200 feet by 60 feet, 30 feet high, of steel girder construction. Without any doubt, the honorable gentleman has brought into question the administration of certain Commonwealth departments. I look at the subject chiefly from the point of view of the primary producers, and I ask why a structure of this description has been authorized in a suburban area simply to house a couple of motor lorries, whilst farmers, who are desperately in need of building materials for repairs on their properties, cannot obtain the necessary permits! The honorable member##'##s requests for an investigation have been side-tracked  on every occasion, and I should like to know the reason why. I do not suggest for a moment that the Minister for War Organization of Industry, or any other member of the Government, is involved in the charges that have been made; but the administration of certain government departments is definitely in question. The Government of New South Wales is also involved, because serious allegations on this subject have been made in the State Parliament. In the interests of government prestige and the honour of public administration generally, I urge the Prime Minister to order an immediate inquiry into the charges. </para>

                        <para>- The allegations to which I am referring have been made by an honorable gentleman on the Government side of the House and supported by the honorable member for Wentworth, on information from quite independent sources. When the honorable member for Wentworth referred to the subject yesterday, he was ruled out of order by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> who said that the occasion was not appropriate for the discussion of such a subject. If the Government is prepared to shelter itself behind the contention that there <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> no responsibility upon it because certain offences have not yet been proved, then the public will clamour for the appointment of a royal commission, or the provision of some other means which will enable the truth to be arrived at. If it be suspected that a proper examination is being prevented, the demand for the fullest publicity will be widespread.  I am not in a position to express any opinion on the facts of the case, and can be guided only by the statements that have been made in this Parliament, which is the proper place for the discussion of such matters. I have been impressed not only by the statements that have been made, but also by the knowledge that the people whom I represent are unable to obtain supplies of essential commodities, whereas those who do not need them so badly can obtain them in overwhelming proportion.

However, within the last year or so, representations have been made to me by sugar-growers, particularly on the Richmond River, and I believe that practical representations have been made to the Minister personally, for the right to expand the acreage which they have under cane. </para>

                    <para>.- A portion of the personnel of a certain division of the Australian Imperial Force, which considerations of security will not permit me to identify, but which has had considerable experience in the Middle East, including association with ii memorable siege, was granted 24 days##'## leave in Australia and, at its expiry, a further eighteen days. These men are now receiving registered letters, recalling them from leave and cancelling the balance of that which was granted to them. I have received a long telegram from an indignant parent. I know that the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coles),</inline> who has returned to Melbourne, also has received a telegram to the same effect. The sons of these people fought for a long period in the Middle East. The deeds of the members of this division, and of other Australian divisions which participated in operations in that theatre of war, redound to the credit of Australia to a greater degree than does anything else in this country, including its governments. These soldiers have seen little of their homeland, or of their homes. I ask the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> to give the definite assurance that they will be permitted to enjoy to the full the leave that was granted to them. Men who returned to Australia at a later date are being granted 48 days leave, and are not being recalled. Thus, these men have a substantial grievance, which justice demands shall be rectified. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I have discussed with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> the issue of the 1939-43 Sta&lt;r, and I know that they are taking the matter up with the Government of the United Kingdom. I raise it now merely because there are aspects of it which I want to have taken into consideration, in order that the case may be strengthened. Recently I asked a question, upon notice, with a view to dispelling doubts as to who were eligible for this decoration. I found that a member of the ground personnel of the Royal Australian Air Force who went to New Guinea was eligible for the 1939-43 Star, and that an administrative officer or a non-commissioned officer of the Royal Australian Air Force ground staff in the Middle East was eligible for the Africa Star, whereas personnel of the Royal Australian Air Force, including the whole of the ground personnel of some famous squadrons which had been abroad for over three years - one squadron flew to Russia and with others has suffered casualties - ##'##are not eligible for either decoration, although they are the first personnel who went abroad, having left Australia before Japan came into the war and troops were sent, to New Guinea. The anomaly is .an extraordinary one, and can have been caused only by an oversight. As the decorations have been granted in Britain, naturally they do not apply to service in the United Kingdom, because that is not regarded as overseas ##'## service there. But Britain is definitely ##"## overseas ##"## to dominion troops. Many Australians who have been wounded, killed or drowned have not been able to qualify for either of those decorations. I can cite a few instances. A ship on which there was ground staff was tor.pedoed in mid-winter in the Atlantic, and one of the few survivors was picked up from the sea 48 hours later. He does not possess the necessary qualifications to receive one of these decorations. Yet, an administrative officer in Cairo may qualify for the Africa Star and a member of the ground personnel or Army who has seen no action in New Guinea is able to qualify for the 1939-43 Star. Victims of torpedoings  who have had to spend from fourteen to eighteen days on the sea in open boats cannot qualify, yet members of the Mercantile Marine who have been to sea for only six months and have done one trip through  submarine-infested  waters do qualify. All of the men for whom I am speaking have  passed  through submarine-infested waters. Personnel of the Royal Australian Air Force in Britain have been killed by machine-gun ##'##fire, bombing, or cannon shell. The anomaly is so extraordinary that I am astonished that I have not received a much larger number of protests. When the position becomes more generally known, there will be an intense bombardment of the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford).</inline> The troops affected ##'##belong to that section of the Australian Imperial Force which was left in Britain when the Australian Imperial Force went to the Middle East, and approximately 2,000 members of ground crews of Australian squadrons of the Royal Australian Air Force in Britain. No. 10 Squadron - an Australian squadron - has served in Britain from the outbreak of the war. Crews which were sent to bring back Sunderland flying boats immediately entered into service in Britain, and have since flown millions of miles in that theatre. Some ground personnel of that squadron have made numerous flights. Within the last week, some of the Sunderlands  have been brought to Australia. The ground staffs of that squadron, as well as squadrons Nos. 455 and 456, which have Australian personnel, are not eligible for  these  decorations, or if the personnel of No. 10 squadron qualify and others do not, the anomaly becomes more extraordinary. As the Prime Minister is going abroad, I hope that he will get all the facts he can to strengthen his argument in support of the claim for decorations for these welldeserving men, who have no opportunity to speak for themselves. The decorations should have been given to all men who served overseas, as was the 1914-15 Star. Unless this matter is adjusted some men, whose military service has been comparatively trifling, will receive the decoration, while others, much more deserving, will be overlooked. I wish the Prime Minister success in the representations which I know he is making. </para>
                <para>I also wish to refer to a matter connected with the Volunteer Defence Corps. The members of this organization give their services voluntarily throughout the year, and undergo a great deal of training. At Christmas time they go in for six days and are paid, but the Easter camp this year is called for only five and a half days, and for this period, according to the regulations, they are not paid. All are old soldiers, who are relieving more active men for service in the firing line. This practice of calling them into camp for only five and a half days looks like a miserable evasion of payment to a handful of enthusiastic men. In an effort to save a few pence they are being denied justice and are being discouraged from undergoing training. This  is a bad policy, just as is the policy of refusing leave to men of the Australian Imperial Force after it has been promised to them. This refusal of leave is causing great indignation among soldiers - men who do not go on strike, and who obey orders at no matter what risk or inconvenience to themselves. The Minister for the Army should give an undertaking that the leave will be granted. </para>
                <para>Once more I call the attention of the Government to the inadequate prices offered to the owners of land resumed by the Government for Government purposes. I raised this matter some weeks ago, and the views I then put forward were supported by honorable members from both sides of the House, including the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> and the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard).</inline> The Prime Minister was so impressed with the case made out that he promised that an investigation would be made. The Government has acquired some 600- blocks of land for the extension of the runways at the Essendon Aerodrome. Land has also been acquired for Government purposes in other States. Under the Lands Acquisition Act, the Government is empowered to acquire any property, but it is expected to do a fair thing by the owners. I do not know any of the people whose land has been acquired, but I have received sheaves of letters from them protesting against the way in which they have been treated. Now, the Prime Minister, after having promised an investigation, says that he was not aware at the time he made the promise, of the system followed in arriving at valuations, and he now thinks that the system is satisfactory. I maintain that this is not the proper way to treat people who believe that they are suffering an injustice, and whose resources are limited. Some of them may have bought the land in the expectation that it would increase in value, but, in the main, they bought the blocks in order to build homes on them. One block holder, a returned soldier from this war, and a demobilized soldier from the last war, writes - </para>

The owners of the blocks were so indignant over the letters which they received from the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> saying that that was the price and they would have to take it or, at most, offering an increase of a pound or two, that they formed themselves into an association, and appointed a deputation to wait upon the Minister in Melbourne. Honorable members from both sides of the House were invited to attend, but the Minister for the Interior, in a most cavalier fashion, admitted only those of his own political persuasion. </para>

                    <para>When I made my original statement on this matter I was not fully aware of the detailed procedure followed. As was indicated by the Minister, the Department of the Interior does not determine the assessed value of properties without independent advice. The amount of compensation decided upon is based upon the valuations assessed by valuers of the Federal Taxation Department and by sworn valuers in private practice in the district where the property is situated. If there is any large discrepancy between the taxation valuation and that of the private valuer, arrangements are made for the two valuers to confer with a view to discussing their respective valuations and submitting a final valuation to the Department of the Interior. In many instances, additional valuations arc obtained from other qualified valuers. </para>

                <para class="block">Let us see how the system works in practice. Various offers are made for a block, sometimes as many as four, and a sort of bargaining goes on between the department and the owner. In some instances, the amount offered was not sufficient to meet the unpaid instalments on the land. In one instance, a woman received from the department an offer of ##£##55 for her two blocks, on which she still owes ##£##80. In another case, the purchase price of the block was ##£##100, and the owner was offered ##£##45, although he still owes ##£##45 15s., so that he may receive 5s., while the amount of ##£##55 already paid will be a complete loss. A later case, since the matter was first dismissed was that of a Miss Malone who paid ##£##150 for her block, plus ##£##30 for roadmaking, plus rates and taxes since 1928, and she was offered ##£##68. She was originally offered only ##£##54, but when she declined to accept that amount, the offer was raised to ##£##68. This is the sort of unfair letter that is sent to owners in such circumstances by the department - </para>

It makes an offer to some person who, it is thought, will  not make a fuss. If the person complains, the department raises the offer by a few pounds. It may even raise the offer two or three times. The act requires the Government to take cognizance of the prices at which land in the vicinity has recently been sold. The records show that this district is developing rapidly. The reports of the Railway Commissioners indicate that the number of passenger journeys from North Essendon station has increased each year since the land was subdivided in 1924. For the year ended June, 1924, the number was 42,146 as compared with 410,478 for the year ended June, 1943.

The doctor who attended her on that day has previously attended her in December for bronchitis and he said her heart was quite all right then and that it was a disgrace that she should have been forced to live in the place the magistrate ordered her to move into and that in his opinion it was the indirect cause of her death.

                <para class="block">So the letter goes on. That letter is indicative of many similar cases. In a matter touching the lives and happiness of people so intimately as this matter does, the Government ought to exercise very careful discrimination in permitting persons to occupy the places which they do. I mention that because there are to my knowledge in my electorate and, I believe, in the electorate of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> and other Sydney electorates, numbers of big homes with many bedrooms occupied by only one or two people. There are other cases of persons who live in large homes because they have large families, but nevertheless have country homes occupied by only a caretaker. I suggest to the Government that in considering this problem of housing and accommodation it should take all these factors into account and that a careful survey should be made. If that were done, I believe that it would be possible for the Government to take over a large number of homes which are not fully utilized, and that the people who have suffered the hardship of living in premises such as those described in that letter, would benefit to that extent. I have received another letter which, besides touching on the matter which I have mentioned, indicates that the action which has been taken by the Government to keep down rents for accommodation and flats has not been so effective as it might be, because extortionate rents are still being charged for poor accommodation.

An agreement made between the Governments of the Commonwealth, Queensland and New South Wales, which has been in force for about twenty years, provides that there shall be no diminution of the area put under cane in the Clarence, Richmond and. Tweed River districts of New South Wales. If there is extension, as there has been in recent years, of the total area in Australia for growing sugar cane, the sugar-cane farmers in those districts should be fully entitled to some share of the total increase. They most strongly resist any proposal that there should be any diminution of their acreage. </para>

                <para>There is no question as to the limited man-power we have in this country, and the problem we have to face is how to make it go round. It seems to me that first we must save man-power in the Army to the greatest possible degree and secondly make the maximum use of the equipment available to the people who are trying to produce the food which this country needs so much. Thirdly, we must make new equipment available to compensate for the shortage of labour. The key to the whole labour situation, I believe, lies in the manner in which the system of Army control is being conducted. Only by altering that on the lines I have previously indicated shall we secure the best use of man-power and supplies and release the greatest possible number of men for the production of essential civilian needs. </para>
                <para>The existence of the present form of control necessitates a double secretariat - one of 2,000 under the secretary of the Army Department, and one of about 1,000 under the Commander-in-Chief. In the handling of hundreds of thousands of men, their equipment, organization and supplies, bottle-necks are almost unavoidable.; but at least one of these two bottle-necks ought to be eliminated. The saving of man-power should begin at the front line which the flower of our young manhood holds. Every man there should be kept fully equipped, healthy and well-nourished. The lowering of the rate of front-line wastage assists in many ways: in fewer reinforcements being necessary, in fewer enlistments, and in the release of more men for the production of essentials. On the Army supply side, the present system involves great delays in requisitioning and securing material available, especially lend-lease. On the food supply side I have been informed that the American commissariat arrangements frequently permit of much more fresh vegetables and fresh food on the front line than apparently our men are getting in similar situations. The contrast between the preparation for recent attacks and the casualties suffered rather indicates that the present system reflect-; itself in the actual fighting supplies as well. A comparison between the landings at Cape Gloucester and Pin seh n fen supports this view. At Finschafen the casualties, killed and wounded, in the 9th Division were stated by the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> to be under 2,000. A war correspondent stated that the preliminary aerial bombardment before our landing was comparatively light, whereas at Cape Gloucester, even though there were fewer Japanese, 4,250 tons of bombs is said to have been dropped on to an area approximating that of Finschafen, and the American casualties were relatively much less. </para>
                <para>At Finschafen, where air support in strength came belatedly, our men suffered  heavily  on the terrible Ridge of  Satelberg.  from which they retreated again and again, until their equipment was brought up to its final standard. In the early days of the war, when the total amount of equipment available for all theatres of war was very small, deficiencies were unavoidable. To-day, when much more equipment is available in all theatres, its absence must be largely a question of the handling of transport and supplies. It is a long way to Tokyo, and we must do much fighting and make many landings before we got there. The most efficient way of handling these problems should be determined immediately and put into effect as soon as possible to ensure ample supplies for every, emergency in every engagement. :; </para>
                <para>That is what we can do on the ##'## manpower side. But we can help to ease the shortage of men by ensuring that equipment shall be- made##'## much more readily available than at present, to those who need it for the##'## production of food.

                <para>It is hoped that you will find this to be a matter to which you can lend your influential support, but in any case we are really seeking guidance upon how best to serve in the problems brought forward by you, and any work or responsibility which may be entrusted to us will be faithfully carried out. </para>
                <para class="block">I have received correspondence on this subject from all the principal industries in .the district. The Associated Country Sawmillers of New South Wales, which operates no fewer than 70 mills, handles 8,000,000 superficial feet of timber a month - nearly 100,000,000 superficial feet of timber a year, or one-third of the total quantity of hardwood produced in Australia. The City Garage (Grafton) Proprietary Limited services the trucks and tractors of these mills. As Grafton is situated 450 miles from Sydney, the importance to them of the appointment of an intermediate parts distributor in the Grafton district requires no emphasis. The two big butter factories at Grafton and Ulmarra support this application. They each have 700 suppliers, and nearly all the cream is carried to the factories by motor truck and motor lorry. They point out that the City Garage (Grafton) Proprietary Limited, as intermediate dealer or distributor, would be in a position to carry a comprehensive range of parts that would be of great advantage to the carriers. The garage operators in the Clarence River district, who maintain the motor transport qf this district, believe that the difficulty of obtaining replacement parts could be overcome by the registration of an intermediate distributor. The principal ##'##bus operators in the Clarence River district also support the application. They point out that the essential services which they operate, depend upon the maintenance of costly vehicles on the road and that, in turn, depends upon the availability of spare parts. As honorable members are aware only one railway line serves this area. Twenty-five ##'##buses are operated and are extensively used by persons who are unable to obtain tyres for their private motor vehicles. Finally, the Clarence River City Council has submitted to me important data in support of the application. The council, which conducts an electricity undertaking serving 10,000 customers, operates a fleet of 39 vehicles, consisting of 26 Fords, 10 Chevrolets, 1 Bedford, 1 Plymouth and 1 International. Apart from normal running repairs, the whole of the council##'##s fleet of vehicles is overhauled in the council##'##s garage in South Grafton. The necessity for maintaining these vehicles in good order requires ho emphasis. In the past the council carried a comprehensive range of spare parts, but since the introduction of parts control, has had considerable difficulty in purchasing replacement##'##s. It supports the application of the City Garage (Grafton) Proprietary Limited as an intermediate parts distributor. The Government should decentralize the existing reserves of equipment. Whether the spare parts be kept at Sydney, Newcastle or Grafton, they still form a reserve supply. The officer responsible for the control of road transport on the north coast has his office at Grafton. The establishment of a reserve pool in that centre would obviate the long delays that occur when essential services require spare parts. </para>
                <para>A few weeks ago, I emphasized the necessity for providing in country districts ample supplies of ammunition for the destruction of vermin. Primary producers experience great difficulty in keeping their fences in proper order because of the ravages of dingoes, rabbits and hares. Although primary producers are able to obtain permits to purchase ammunition, they are unable to secure supplies of cartridges. S. Hoffnung and Company Limited, merchants, of Sydney, advocate the decentralization of supplies. Reserves of ammunition sufficient for three or four months##'## requirements should be established in various parts of the State, and farmers should be permitted to purchase reasonable quantities. In that way, they would not be obliged to use petrol ##'##unnecessarily in . returning to the town at short intervals . to replenish their supplies. </para>
                <para>The -Government should seriously consider  the advisability of constructing without delay an electricity transmission line between Brisbane and Newcastle in order that existing generating stations may be linked up, the intervening country served, and the maximum use made of the power. This scheme would enable us to stave off the disaster -that will otherwise -occur because of the difficulty of obtaining new generating plant. Although some -of these mammoth machines have been ordered, four or five years will pass before they can be installed. In some instances, Great Britain and the United States of America have not been able to accept orders. If these various undertakings could be linked up, primary producers and the residents of small towns would be able to overcome difficulties arising from the shortage of man-power by utilizing the electrical power at their disposal. </para>

It is just as well to remind the people of Australia that they have a good deal for which to .thank this Government. Two years ago, it saved this country from invasion, and the people demonstrated their gratitude by returning the Labour party with an overwhelming majority.

                <para>This debate affords me an opportunity to direct attention to several -matters that should be rectified. In my electorate, as in other electorates in the metropolitan areas of Sydney and Melbourne, the housing shortage is acute. People who desire to erect homes discover that the Department .of War Organization of Industry is unable, because of the exigencies of war, to release the necessary materials. I am. hopeful that existing regulations will soon be relaxed, and that people who urgently require accommodation for themselves and their families will have an opportunity to build their own homes. Last week, a man employed in a munitions establishment was ordered by the court to vacate the premises that he was occupying. He has a wife, three daughters and two sons. As the result of the magistrate##'##s order, the father and the two sons have gone to Bondi, the mother and two of the daughters live in the city, and the third little girl is staying with friends. Those conditions cannot be permitted to continue indefinitely, because they will do a great national disservice. </para>
                <para>Many servicemen and their wives have been saving their money with the object of purchasing homes after the war. The wife of a soldier who i3 serving in New Guinea entered into a contract to buy a home, subject to the approval of the SubTreasury in Sydney. The departmental reply was that, unless she could##'## get vacant possession and contribute ##£##100 or ##£##200 to the war loan, the sale would not be permitted. These restrictions should not be placed upon purchases of this kind. They are not investments. I urge the Treasurer to give sympathetic consideration to these genuine applications. The persons concerned have no money to invest in the war loans, after they have paid a deposit upon the purchase of a house. Usually, they have to borrow to finance the transaction. The particular application to which I referred has been forwarded to the Treasurer for review, and I hope that he will give it favorable consideration. </para>
                <para>I trust that the War Service Homes Commission will lose no time in making preparations to resume the construction of homes on a big scale for servicemen who need them. There is no need to wait until men are discharged before putting such work in hand. I realize that the shortage of man-power and materials is a great difficulty, but it should be possible to do something effective in war service home construction even under present conditions. I hope that the Government will prescribe conditions of purchase that will make it practicable for men to complete the purchase of homes within a reasonable period. Recently we have been informed that some returned men who bought homes 25 years ago, after the end of the last war, owe more on them to-day  than they owed when they signed their contracts of purchase. This is due, of course, to the depression, but high interest rates have also been a contributing factor. The interest rates on the homes erected for returned soldiers after this war should be such as will merely recompense the Government for keeping the accounts. The provision of war service homes on this basis would be real repatriation work. </para>
                <para>I offer a protest against the call-up for Army service of men with five or six young children. Such men are still being called up, and it is a wrong policy. 3 know of one young man with four children, and expecting another, who was called up a few weeks ago, and recently we read reports in the press to the effect that one man with nine children and another with eleven had been charged with absence without leave. Such men should not be in the Army. If they volunteer for service they evade their proper responsibilities to their wives and families, and if they are called up compulsorily persons responsible for their call-up should be brought to book. Such men can do far better work out of the Army than they can do in it. </para>
                <para>I trust that the appropriate Ministers will give careful consideration to these matters over which I ##"##grieve##"##. </para>

                    <para>.- On several occasions recently I have raised in this House the subject of the release of Italian internees and their employment to the detriment of Australian nationals. I do so again without apology, because I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the attitude of the Government towards my representations. This subject lias caused intense feeling in Queensland, especially among the members of returned soldier organizations, and I direct attention to it again as a returned soldier member of this Parliament representing a Queensland constituency. When I spoke on the subject previously the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> was in the chamber. I informed him that feeling in Queensland was at, white heat because of the failure of the Government to take effective steps to deal with this situation, but. although the Attorney-General interjected while I was speaking, he failed to take an opportunity to address the House on the subject. I have since written to him about it, but his reply is quite unsatisfactory. The subject was discussed on the. 19th February at the conference of the Western District Branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen##'##s Imperial League of Australia and strong protests were voiced against the release of Italian internees. It was requested that they be placed under Army control and employed at Army rates of pay. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knight,</inline> representative of the Toowoomba sub-branch, declared that Italians, who had been interned when Italy entered the war, had since been released and employed to the detriment of Australian nationals. He described the whole procedure as the work of politicians looking for votes, and emphasized that those responsible for  the  release of the men were not fit to be politicians. He asserted also that union organizers were aware of what was being done. That conference represented  3,000  returned men and its request that such internees should bc released only under Army control and employed only at Army rates of pay should be granted. I  han  received letters from 27 sub-branches  of  returned soldier organizations in Queensland on this subject, and I propose  to  quote extracts from some of them.

                <para class="block">I think that on an important matter of that kind the Minister should have obtained a reply to my questions without delay. It is utterly wrong to employ Italian ex-internees at award rates of pay, with provision for extra pay for overtime, when our own soldiers receive only army pay for doing the same work. We should not give preference to Italian ex-internees over our own soldiers. When our men are released from the forces, this policy will increase the difficulty experienced in restoring them to civil employment. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy,</inline> of the Toowoomba branch of the league, suggests that all of those Italians who have been released from internment and have been returned to their ordinary civil employment should be placed under army control and granted army rates of pay. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> pointed out that this was not considered practicable. A terse observation of that kind is an insult to the members of our fighting forces, and I renew my appeal for proper treatment of Australian soldiers. Italian ex-internees must be employed, as far as possible, but they should not receive greater advantages than the members of the fighting forces. The resentment at the action of the Government has spread to North Queensland. It is not confined to the electorates represented by members of the Opposition. The latest issue of <inline font-style="italic">Smith##'##s Weekly</inline> contains an article headed : ##"## Preference for Italians ##"##. It states, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia -</inline> ##"## One has only to live in the North, in these semi-Italian communities, to realise the resentment .that is growing, particularly among those mothers whose sons are serving with the forces; and we feel that the present policy should be discontinued.##"## </para>

                <para>Attitude at Tully is wholly in keeping with the stand taken by the Leagues at Ayr and Toowoomba as reported in the March 4 issue of ##"## Smith##'##s.##"## </para>
                <para>View expressed by the Tully League in its protest is: - ##"## The unfairness of releasing these aliens and allowing them to be employed at award conditions and higher rates of pay - overtime, ##&amp;##c. - when thousands of Australian men called up under proclamation (practically conscripts) are being kept in the Army in employment  battalions, base jobs, ##&amp;##c, at Army rates of pay, with no award conditions, overtime, ##&amp;##c. ##"## This policy, we consider, amounts to preference to enemy aliens, who have nothing to lose and everything to gain - who, in short, are being granted preferential treatment at the expense of natural-born Australians.##"## </para>
                <para>Among the instances of preferential treatment cited by the League is that of an Italian, who had been living in the north for 30 years, and was one of the earliest batch from the district to be interned. ##"##This man,##"## it is stated, ##"##has two wellgrown sons, both of military age. ##"## They were granted exemption from military call-up, because of the father being interned, and it was thought necessary they should remain at home to work the two sugar farms owned by the father. Since the release of the father neither of the sons has been called up.  ##"## On the contrary, one is contemplating early marriage, and is endeavouring to buy a sugar farm in this area.##"## tu contrast with this and the consideration shown to other Italians, the League gives - among other instances - the case of the proprietress of a registered dairy, supplying 50 per cent, or more of the milk needs of Tully. ##"## Her husband,##"## it is explained, ##"## is a returned soldier from World War I., and is suffering from the effects of war service. ##"## The husband does most of the work on the dairy, assisted by members of the family not yet of military age. ##"## One son of military age has been called up mid has been serving for some time. ##"## Owing to the shortage of man-power and her inability to obtain assistance to carry on mi essential industry, the mother has, we understand, made application through the proper channels, for the release of the son from service to enable her to keep up Unnecessary milk supply to Tully. ##"##This application has been refused.##"## </para>
                <para>Tully League requests <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martens</inline> to bring  ##"## this very urgent question before the Houe*##'##,##'##1 and, if possible, the favour of a direct report by him as regards his presentation of the matter to his fellow parliamentarians. </para>
                <para class="block">That is a glaring instance of gross injustice to a woman and an old soldier husband who is trying to supply milk to the people of Tully.

The charge that the censorship has in any way censored any book of Cecil Browne, or anybody else, is entirely without foundation. A certain number of copies of this book by Cecil Browne was sent to Australia, and they were bought up. The demand for the book could not be satisfied, because no more copies of it could be obtained from overseas and no publisher in Australia would undertake to publish it, for reasons best known to themselves, but maybe relating to the shortage of paper and man-power. That position is not peculiar to Australia; it obtains in Canada also. By a strange coincidence I, yesterday, received a copy of the book from a friend of mine in Canada, who said that it was out of print there. He had promised fo secure a copy for me when he was in Australia, and he fulfilled his promise.

As a result of observations overseas, particularly in Britain, one is struck by the groat effort that is being made in connexion with the production of food. In Britain, there are millions in the Army, and there has been a tremendous development of factories for war purposes as well as for the provision of necessary civilian clothing. The production of food has been increased by 50 per cent., and to-day two-thirds of the food that is needed is provided by farms in the United Kingdom. This makes one wonder why there is difficulty in Australia in meeting the position in relation to requirements of food. The great leaders of the United Nations arc straining every nerve to secure an intensification of food production. Britain needs what Australia is able to provide, and is ready to supply all the transport required. We must realize that our position has been eased !##&gt;##y the great activity of Britain itself in the matter of food production. If this country does not bestir itself during the war, it will find that at the termination of the conflict other countries which have developed their production will stand in our way as suppliers of the world##'##s requirements. We should not only produce, but also call science to our aid in order to overcome these shortages, and, at the same time, afford manufacturers an opportunity to produce improved labour-saving machinery for usp on farms. Unfortunately, the production of farm machinery has practically ceased. To-day, farmers must wait for many weeks before they can obtain ploughs, milking machines, and engines for milking machines. In the drier areas, they cannot obtain windmills. I urge the Government to provide these articles as a first priority.. </para></talk.start><para>Owing to heavy military traffic, the roads in many districts in my electorate have been practically cut to pieces, but the local governing authorities cannot effect urgent repairs because their plant and machinery have been impressed, by the Allied Works Council. I have received a letter from the Maryborough District Local Authorities Association, which represents six local governing bodies, asking me to make representations on this matter. They point out that at least one grader should be made available immediately in order to enable them to effect very urgent repairs. I have already made that request to the Government, but I have not yet received a reply. The only council in the association with a decent machine is the Biggenden Shire Council. The Tiaro Shire Council has no machine in working order. The Woocoo Shire Council does not possess a machine at all, and the Burrum Shire Council has to make shift with a machine which is always breaking down. The Isis Shire Council has a machine which has to be very carefully looked after, and the Maryborough City Council has no machine at all. Those councils formerly employed nine, and sometimes ten, good machines continuously on road repair work. In the Maroochy district, local farmers have repaired roads with shovels in##'## order to make them passable. These councils contend that, as the roads have been cut up by heavy military traffic, the Government should provide them with financial assistance to enable them to effect repairs, and that the Allied Works Council should make road-making machinery and ex Civil Constructional Corps workers available to them temporarily. </para><para>In many districts, farms are still being worked by aged people and youngsters. Owing to the strain under which they have been working so long in the absence of their  able-bodied  men who are now in the armed forces, they now find that they can barely carry on. I have in my hand a newspaper advertising the sales of . five farms in the one locality. In many districts, dairy cattle are being butchered. In view of the necessity to increase production on the food front, I ask the Government .to review the categories of Army Service personnel from which discharges are not permitted. These categories are - </para><list type="loweralpha"><item label="(a)"><para>Personnel medically classified A in units serving outside the Australian mainland. </para><list type="decimal"><item label="(6)"><para>Personnel medically classified A .in reinforcement training units. </para></item></list></item><item label="(o)"><para>Reinforcements en route to operational units. </para></item><item label="(d)"><para>Certain classes of skilled tradesmen. </para></item><item label="("><para><inline font-style="italic">e</inline>) Personnel medically classified A attached temporarily as instructors to units on the mainland. </para></item></list><para>I suggest that the present prohibitions applied in respect of classes 6, <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> and e could be relaxed with a view to transferring more men to primary industry. In one district in my electorate an aged blacksmith was advised that his son would be released by the man-power authorities, but that advice was cancelled. I point out that blacksmiths perform an indispensable service to primary producers. </para><para>I again draw attention to the serious effect of the shortage of motor tyres on primary production, and appeal to the Government to make more tyres available to producers. I need only cite the case of a farmer who has been obliged to place his motor vehicle on blocks because he cannot obtain tyres, and has now to convey his cream to the rail siding by other means, leaving his home to catch a train at 4 o##'##clock each morning. </para><para>The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> was good enough to inform me that all labour required by the sugar industry in the Nambour district during the coming sugar season would be made available. However, growers doubt the earnestness of the Minister in making that promise, because last season the Nambour mill was unable to obtain anything like the permitted labour it required, and when an appeal for additional man-power was made to the Government 22 aborigines were sent to the mill from Broken Hill. Those aborigines proved to be useless, and their services had to be dispensed with within a fortnight. On their arrival at Nambour they were in need of clothing; and the management of the mill found it impossible to teach them the work which they were required to perform. In view of that experience I ask the Minister to give an assurance to the sugar-growers of Queensland that he will honour his promise to provide sufficient labour during the coming season. </para><para class="block">Last season thousands of tons of sugar w as lost, following a heavy frost, because sufficient man-power was not available for cutting. </para><para>Fishermen in my electorate are still asking for release from the Army so that their boats and fishing nets may be put into use. Since the introduction of meat rationing the demand for fish has increased considerably. I urge the Government to follow the example of Canada and Great Britain, and release fishermen from the forces, so that they may win food for the people. I also advise the Government, when putting its housing programme into effect, to extend its benefits to the primary producers, and not restrict them entirely to city dwellers. The primary producers, perhaps more man any other section of the community,  deserve  better living conditions. </para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley)</inline> adjourned. </para></speech>

                            <para>The office in Queen-street is that of the Victorian administration of the board, whilst that in Collins-street is the head office for all Australia.. From the point of view of administration it is necessary for the Victorian office to be kept separate from head office as is the case in the other States. Previously the head office and the Victorian office were in the same building, though on different floors, but when it was found necessary to move to new premises suitable accommodation to house both staffs was not available. In any case, if such accommodation could bc obtained there would be no saving in the actual space required. The necessity for a Victorian office can best be illustrated by indicating that 780.000 bushels of apples and ##]## wars were handled ##"##in##"## and ##"##out##"## by this office last year, of which 430,000 were marketed in Victoria. The balance of 350,000 bushels was forwarded for marketing in New  South  Wales and Queensland. On account of shipping facilities Victoria has become the focal point for supplies for New South Wales and Queensland, both of which States are largely dependent on the board for their requirements. Last year the Victorian office distributed nearly 280,000 cartons of apples to industrial workshops, canteens, ##&amp;##c. and followed this with approximately 200j000 packages of dried apples. The distribution of ease lots direct to consumers and also through stationmasters to country people is handled by the Victorian office. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member##'##s remarks were brought to the. notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs, who has advised that following instructions given by him, a special investigation squad was created to deal with the black marketing of liquor in Sydney. This action has met with a large degree of success and many successful prosecutions have been launched as a result of the squad##'##s activities. With regard to the honorable member##'##s specific reference to bottled beer, it is pointed out that there is no objection under the Control of Liquor Order to . the sale of bottled beer, and, with the exception pf price-fixing, the Commonwealth at present possesses no powers ofcontrol over its sale. The prohibition of the drinking of bottled beer in parks and other public places is a matter which comes within the province of the State authorities concerned. </para>

                        <para>I have looked into this matter and desire to inform the honorable member that a considerable proportion of doctors practising in the city of Sydney are specialists, fully occupied with hospital and consulting work and with the teaching of medical students. </para>
                        <para>Suburban doctors are overworked. This is well recognized by the State Medical Coordination Committee whose function, under National Security Regulations,is to watch the distribution of civilian practitioners and to ensure an equitable distribution of the available pool of medical men. With one-third of the youngest and most active, practitioners on service, civilians cannot expect the same ready availability of doctors aa in peace-time. </para>
                        <para>In Sydney, however, with reciprocal arrangements between doctors, the ambulance services, the suburban ring of hospitals, and the Hospital Admission Depot, it is not true that many people taken seriously ill at night are unable to obtain medical attention. </para>
                        <para>The situation remains under constant review by the State Medical Co-ordination Committee. </para>
