<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure today to speak to the Aboriginal Land (Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest) Bill 1987 and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Amendment Bill 1987. As is pointed out in the legislation, the Victorian Government-a Labor Government at that-has provided for the vesting and control of two parcels of land to two Aboriginal corporations. There has been a great deal of opposition to this move, as one would expect, because this is the start, I guess, of the Aboriginal land rights movement in Victoria. Unfortunately, as these things go on and on we are seeing that the taxpayers of this country have to pay out $1.3m compensation to the existing landholders to purchase the land. So it is not government-controlled leasehold land that is involved; it is land for which taxpayers have to pay compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BF4">Mr IAN CAMERON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Farrer says, we are spending billions of dollars on Aborigines these days, but we are getting absolutely nowhere by doing it and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Holding) knows it. The grants to the two Aboriginal corporations will mean that they will have full power of management over the land. I find it quite ridiculous that the communities that will control this land under the Victorian Crown Land (Reserves) Act have been exempted from paying land tax. It is high time that we started treating Aborigines as Australians and stopped treating them as being different. If the taxpayers of this country are to provide $1.3m to purchase the land, I cannot see why we have to continue to exempt these people from the payment of land taxes. That is a ridiculous situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation provides for the setting up of a committee of elders from both corporations to determine membership and matters of cultural and religious significance to the area. It provides for regulation of mining activities. Minerals remain vested in the State of Victoria. At least that is sensible. It seems that the Aborigines will not have a veto over the mining rights on this land. Across Australia we are seeing that Aboriginal people are treated differently and separately and that they have the power of veto over much of their land, particularly in the Northern Territory. I think that is an anachronism to the rest of Australia, and I am quite sure it is an anachronism to most of them because, having got the land, they find that they have to do something with it. Mining is one of the things that is available to them on some of the vast tracts of land that they have under their control. Many of the more sensible Aborigines find it practically impossible to get the right to allow companies to search for minerals and mine their land to give people jobs and something to do other than sit around doing nothing, which most people on the land reserves that we have set up for them in the last 20-odd years seem to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Some expenditure is necessary for the establishment of the two trusts. An allocation from consolidated revenue will be made for the payment of an amount equivalent to the mining royalties. Of course, the same sort of thing is done in the Northern Territory. Again, the taxpayer is paying, and it is high time that we stopped that. If these people are going to be responsible at all, they have to make some sort of earning from the land and pay some sort of taxes. They get every other right, as Australians, and they are entitled to all the social security payments that are available. I believe that they ought to be paying taxes and have some sort of responsibility to the system. That is basically the problem with our social benefits system today, in that in many cases people are not paying any taxes on the sums that they receive; they have absolutely no responsibility to the system. We are breeding a race of people who are totally dependent on the welfare system, and that is why slowly, but surely, we are going bankrupt under this Labor socialist Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Amendment Bill limits the operation of any Victorian law for the preservation and protection of Aboriginal culture and property. As I have said, for a long time I have taken an interest in Aboriginal affairs that have been brought before Parliament. I have been a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs since I first entered this place in 1980. I have only just come from a meeting of that Committee, where we are setting up some terms of reference in relation to some of the continuing problems of communities throughout Australia. I have always had a genuine interest in this problem. The coalition has previously outlined some good policies in this area. On this occasion I believe that our shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), has brought down a very good policy on Aboriginal affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would like to know. Again, I would hazard a guess that it is the Australian taxpayer, it is we taxpayers in this House who have paid for this bloke's trip to Libya to talk with Gaddafi. Unfortunately, the definition of an Aborigine is apparently someone who associates with that group, but, obviously, from looking at this character on television, he is about as far removed from being an Aborigine as I am.</PARA></TALK.START>

He went across to Libya to stir up trouble. The payments for fares that are provided by this country for such people to travel overseas ought to be stopped immediately. Many of us forecast that this is the sort of situation that would develop. We were not believed at the time, but we are giving Aborigines more and more autonomy and they are not being brought under the rein of existing laws of Australia. They are able to travel around the world, to get up on the world stage and damn their own country and damn its government-even the Labor Government. They are able to swear all sorts of oaths against the Government on the world stage, and they have got to the ridiculous stage of talking about arming themselves for some sort of revolution. To my way of thinking, this bloke is a traitor to this country. The Minister has left the chamber, but it is time that he came back in here so I could say a few things to him. I see that he is now returning, so I can tell him, at least, that I support his speaking out against this character. But I would term Mr Mansell's actions as traitorous to this country and I believe that he ought to be taken to task.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation is to do with Aborigines. This fellow Mansell is meant to be one. That is why I am talking about him. Getting back to the legislation: The land in Victoria has been set aside to give a couple of groups of Australians there some extra privileges. They are getting some land at the expense-$1.3m-of the taxpayers. They will be exempt from paying land tax on it, which is a ridiculous state of affairs. They will be able to mine it. The royalty payments will go direct to them, as usual. That happens across the rest of Australia. That money does not go into Consolidated Revenue to be shared amongst the rest of the taxpayers of this country; it is paid straight back to the Aborigines. Again they are treated separately and differently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am a landholder with oil exploration going on across my land. Compensation is paid but we have to allow those companies to come on to our land and mine. We have no recourse to the law to stop the miners if we wished to. But if one is an Aborigine one can get a veto and stop them. That is the difference and that is the thing that we object to-and most Aborigines object to it, too. It is an absurd situation that we have developed. I am opposed to it. I do not believe that we should be establishing a separate race of people in this country, and most Aborigines feel the same way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Speaker, you will be pleased to know that I will speak about the Aboriginal Land (Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest) Bill and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Amendment Bill. It is a very sad day when we come into this House and we see the Opposition opposing the granting of the first major land rights in Victoria. Honourable members opposite get up and say: `If the legislation were put in a different way we might support it'. But they do not support the general concept of land rights for Aborigines in Victoria. The shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), presented the most convoluted argument against the legislation that one could imagine. He tried to say that the Victorian Government had instructed the national Government to legislate. Why did the Victorian Government say to the national Government that it should legislate? It is because it was very clear that the Liberal and National parties in Victoria were going to knock this legislation out in the upper House. It became necessary, if this land were to be granted to the Aboriginal people, for that to be done through the powers of the Commonwealth. That is the truth of the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The attitude of the Opposition is not new. It is the kind of attitude against Aboriginal people which unfortunately was prevalent in the last 200 years. It was based and continues to be based-one has only to hear the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) to recognise that it continues to be based-on myths and misrepresentation of what Aboriginal culture is about and what the Aboriginal people are about. For example, one white spokesman made these comments about Aborigines in Victoria at the time land was taken from them:</PARA>
<PARA> The Aborigines of Australia had no property in the soil in the shape of improvements-the labour of their own hands. Priority of occupation gave them a right to the game on the land, but it conferred no right to hold the country against a civilised nation who could turn it to better account. </PARA>
<PARA>The spokesman also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Aboriginal had no clearly recognisable claim to a particular area of land; his more subtle relationship with his country ignored or not understood. He lacked the organisation which could have enabled effective warfare in defence of his interests . . . He had neither the obvious right to a certain area . . . nor the organisation to defend any part of his traditional hunting and gathering area. </PARA>
<PARA>If we analyse that argument we see that it says that, because the Western concept of fighting over land was non-existent amongst Aboriginals, therefore, it follows that they did not have the same attitude to the land that we have and had no rights to it. But this was an utter misrepresentation especially, I might say, in relation to the Aborigines of Victoria because Victoria was the most populated area, in terms of Aborigines, when the white man came to Australia. Indeed, the Aborigines there were not nomadic as they were in other parts of Australia and there were very significant numbers of them. They used the land very intensively and were agriculturally sophisticated. In fact, they were attached to specifically designated areas-something that was determined later after the white man had taken the land from them. Victoria was more densely populated than any other part of the continent and the people were more highly developed agriculturally and technologically than in other regions. They were certainly not nomadic. Let me quote from a book entitled The Australians. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the society, technology and economy of the well-peopled basalt plains . . . challenges the popular European image of nomadic hunter-gatherers, few in number, moving camp every few days and living largely from hand to mouth. The people of south-western Victoria and their neighbours were more numerous, more sedentary and far more ingenious than we ever imagined. </PARA>
<PARA>What happened to those people? How was their land taken from them? Let me quote from a book entitled Select Documents in Australian History. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Henty family occupied without authorisation land at Portland in November, 1834. Many others followed, similarly without authorisation. John Batman was one of them, and acting as a syndicate called the Port Phillip Association. He devised a contract with the Aborigines to `cede' 600,000 acres to him on 6 June, 1835. This was in exchange for sundry articles of hardware and merchandise. However, as the British Government had long since declared sovereignty over the whole of Australia, this `treaty' was null and void from the beginning . . . the land in Victoria was subsequently parcelled out by the government to so-called `selectors', who paid nominal sums for huge parcels of land, or given away as grants as reward for feats of exploration or public service. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus, the Aboriginal people of Victoria had their land taken from them. Indeed, as early as 1842 there was considerable conflict over the taking of land from Aborigines. The Portland Mercury reported:</PARA>
<PARA> The country might as well be in a state of civil war, as few but the boldest of the settlers will move from their home stations. </PARA>
<PARA>The resistance by the Aborigines to the spread of white settlement was described in 1842 to 1844 as `rising resistance'. We have subsequent documentation of what happened. Numerous massacres took place. For example, on 25 February 1842 at Mustons Creek in the Portland district the bodies of three Aboriginal women, one of whom had been pregnant, and a male Aboriginal child were found, dead from gunshot wounds. In the same year a considerable number of Aborigines had been poisoned at a station near Port Fairy after eating flour into which arsenic had been mixed. In 1846 it was reported:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a Government survey party nearly exterminated the Cape Otway tribe, in reprisal for the murder of a white man . . . it is said that men, women and children . . . were shot down indiscriminately, and few escaped. </PARA>
<PARA>The exact number of Aborigines killed by Europeans will, of course, never be known. However, the 1858 select committee of the Government of Victoria reported to the Government in England that of the original Aboriginal population of Victoria, estimated at several thousands:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there were not more than a few hundred remaining, and most of them being in a state of abject want. </PARA>
<PARA>This had occurred within 25 years of the first white arrivals in the southern part of the country in Victoria. The committee decided:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to allow this to continue would be to tolerate and perpetuate a great moral wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee nevertheless stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Victoria is now entirely occupied by a superior race, and there is scarcely a spot, excepting in the remote mountain ranges or dense scrubs, on which the Aboriginal can rest his weary feet. </PARA>
<PARA>This was 25 years after the white man's coming. In 1860 the Government set up a board to watch over the interests of the Aborigines. Victoria was the first of the Australian colonies to set aside reserves for the tribes remaining, and establish missions in order to protect, Christianise and educate them. It was out of this situation that the areas we are talking about, Framlingham and Lake Condah, came into being. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to protect the Aborigines, an application by the Church of England in Warrnambool for reserve land was considered by the Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines, and on 17 September 1861 3,500 acres were reserved beside the Hopkins River. The estimated number of Aboriginal people remaining in the area by then was little more than 50. In 1876 the board resolved that 73 Aborigines should be moved from Framlingham to Lake Condah where a new station was to be opened. Lake Condah and Framlingham Aboriginal communities retained close links since those days when the missions were established and quickly phased out. The Framlingham settlement was never in favour with the authorities, and the area was sought after by other residents in the area as they wished an agricultural experimental college to be established there. However, Framlingham Aborigines refused to go to Condah. Those who were taken to Condah quarrelled with the Aborigines there and returned home. In 1868 the Aborigines asked for the re-establishment of the station at Framlingham, which was agreed to. In the detailed history of the Framlingham Aborigines by Jan Critchett, entitled Our Land Till We Die, this was seen to be the result of a:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . long fight by both the Warrnambool residents initially and then by the Aboriginal community. The amount of activity by the . . . community on behalf of the Aborigines was exceptional. There is no record of another case where the establishment of a Victorian Aboriginal station was preceded by so much effort from the local community. The answer may lie in the fact that the Western District was more closely settled than any other part of the Port Phillip District and the Warrnambool areas was one of the last places . . . to be taken up. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the horrifying details of the slaughter of the Aborigines which can be found in other accounts of the settlement of the area, it was seen that those who pioneered the Warrnambool area did so without the need for violence and were faced by a large group of Aborigines, obviously dispossessed and living near enough to the main settlement for their plight to be obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> Framlingham was officially closed in 1889 and no further government support given to the residents, but Aboriginal occupation has continued unbroken to the present day. I mention this because Framlingham is probably unique in Victoria at least in that there is documented history of continuity of residents there which enhances, and indeed establishes beyond doubt, Aboriginal claims to that area. I also mention the matter in this context because I want to nail the argument which has been presented by the Opposition. First, anyone understanding the history that I have presented to this point, anyone with a moral conscience, surely will take the view that we should do something to restore the rights of those people. </PARA>

That means that it becomes possible that if something goes wrong in the organisation of that community at any given point in history, if its members are tricked by other white men, as the original inhabitants were tricked by John Batman and others, their land would be sold off and they would end up not having any Aboriginal land. The whole concept of Aboriginal land rights, the concept of the relation of the Aboriginals to the land, is inalienable. No individual Aborigine has the right to give away the land of his tribe. That is a central and fundamental concept which Opposition members fail to understand. We well understand what those members are up to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member says: `Rubbish'. He should read the propaganda and literature of the New Right on Aboriginal land rights. The New Right gives no recognition to the Aboriginal people. He should read its documents. The honourable member and other Opposition members applaud members of the New Right and what it is trying to do to Australia. I say this to everyone who is listening: If they read the documents of what the New Right is trying to do to this country, they would see that it is trying to take away all sense of social responsibility and all sense of moral concern for not only the Aboriginal people but also migrant communities and all groups in this community other than the very wealthy. For Mr Kennett and the other leaders of the conservative forces in Victoria to have given in to the extremists who have been trying to take away these rights from Aboriginal people is a disgrace. It is an even bigger disgrace that the honourable member for Bradfield, the shadow Minister, tried to rationalise and justify the absurd and outrageous behaviour of the Victorian conservative parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to honourable members opposite, especially those who have some moral concern: This legislation could have proceeded uncontested if we had had a bipartisan approach, if as a nation we had finally matured enough to be able to recognise what we have done to the Aboriginal people, to recognise the slaughters that have occurred, the way in which Aboriginals were killed by diseases, and the way in which they were treated when the white man first arrived here-like animals. We should recognise this history and say to ourselves: `We have a moral responsibility and we ought to be doing something about it'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) has made a significant and rational contribution to the debate, as he has on other occasions when Aboriginal affairs have been debated. His last comment was that he hoped that further examples would be brought forward by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Holding) whereby restitution would be made to the dispossessed Aboriginal people in Victoria. Later in my speech I will dwell on a possible further example of that taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This debate provides me with an opportunity to discuss the issue of Aboriginal land ownership, the specific examples of Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest, and to draw parallels with other properties in Victoria which exhibit a similar historical background. Aboriginal culture and way of life is, as we know, extremely old. It is 40,000 years, or more, older than any other culture or civilisation in history. More importantly, the culture is alive today, not only in the outback but on the fringes of our cities and in the very cities themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> A major part of Aboriginal culture is the Aborigines' relationship to the land. Aboriginal owners see themselves not as owners with speculative and trading rights but as custodians or trustees, responsible to current and future generations for holding and keeping their birthright intact. </PARA>
<PARA> Traditional owners talk not of rights to exploit the land, to make a fast buck, but of their duty to look after the land. Use of that land which is compatible with care of the land, use that does not offend their culture, use that does not despoil the spiritual side of the land, can be a use, therefore, that provides benefits to the general community-Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal.</PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal Land (Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest) Bill and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Amendment Bill relate to traditional Aboriginal land which, as the honourable member for Calwell observed, in the nineteenth century was reserved for Aboriginal mission stations. Today, descendants of the Aborigines who were held in these missions still live on the same land. To the examples of Framlingham Forest and Lake Condah can be added Coranderrk at Healesville in my electorate of Streeton. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1861 the Framlingham Forest formed part of an area of land temporarily reserved from sale and set aside for the use of Aborigines. Despite the wishes of the Aborigines and without regard to any form of recompense for the existing state of dispossession from traditional tribal lands, the land was gradually sold off or leased. The last excision was as recently as 1952. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, Lake Condah reserve originated as an Anglican mission station in 1869. This has been stated by other members in this debate. Just 17 years later a Victorian law required Aboriginal people of mixed race under 35 years of age to leave mission settlements, and the population naturally dwindled. Gradually the reserve area was revoked and officially closed in 1919, many of the people moving to Lake Tyers. The reserve was finally revoked and the area carved up for soldier settlement after World War II, but no Aboriginal returned soldier received land there. That fact should not go unnoticed. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, around 1861, the tribes living in the Upper Yarra and Healesville area-the Wurundjeri, the Bunurong, the Taurngong and possibly the Yorta Yorta-were moved to a reserve at Acheron, along with other Aborigines from all over Victoria. This land proved unsuitable, so the Watts river reserve was created at Healesville. The Aborigines walked from Acheron to the Watts River Reserve over the mountain range, which has become known as the Black Spur as a result of that march. However, like Framlingham, Coranderrk was also whittled away. In 1883 half the permanent reserve was taken back by the Victorian Government and in 1924 Coranderrk was closed when the resident Aborigines too were transferred to Lake Tyers in Gippsland. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1948 the Coranderrk Lands Bill was passed, which revoked permanent reservation of the land. The land was disposed of through the Soldier Settlement Commission. However, I understand that as with earlier leases and sites, Aborigines were not allowed to apply for the land which was once permanently reserved for them. Some 90 acres of the original reserve became Commonwealth property in early 1952 and on it was established the Army School of Health. After 34 years of active use, during which the Army School of Health became an important part of the Healesville community, the school was transferred to Portsea. The Government, in its 14 May 1985 statement, decided to dispose of the property. I will speak more on that matter later. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given this detail to illustrate the parallels between and the similarities of the dismemberment of Aboriginal reserves in Victoria. We can see that Victoria, like other States, had gradually dispossessed Aborigines of all their community owned land. However, in more recent times, the general community has questioned the wisdom and justice of that dispossession and demanded some restitution. </PARA>
<PARA> The original Victorian legislation-now in Commonwealth form in these Bills-provides for the return of the remainder of the Framlingham Forest to the traditional tribal owners the Kirrae Whurrong. Some 237 hectares had been vested in the Framlingham Aboriginal Trust by the Bolte Liberal Government in 1970 under the Aboriginal Land Act. That Act granted the land in what amounted to inalienable freehold title. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising the non-exploitative affinity between the land and Aboriginal people, the current Victorian Government acknowledged that the form of property title chosen by the Bolte Government was the most appropriate and best suited the particular nature of local Aboriginal community ownership. These Bills therefore, give the Aborigines inalienable title, as this satisfies their concern to prevent the land from ever being taken from them again or about being dispossessed of it by any one generation. This point was made most emphatically by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Calwell. The need for a non-commercial form of ownership was recognised by the Fraser Government in 1976 when the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Ian Viner, speaking to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The coalition Parties' policy on Aboriginal Affairs clearly acknowledges that affinity with the land is fundamental to Aborigines' sense of identity. </PARA>
<PARA>With such honourable and solid conservative political support behind the concept of inalien- able freehold title spanning some 120 years in Victoria, it is astounding that the State and Federal Liberal parties have opposed inalienable freehold title. They have forced this legislation out of Victoria and into the Federal sphere. They are not challenging the grants, or their size; nor do they challenge the traditional connections between the trust membership and the land. They merely challenge the nature of the title, and in doing so expose their inability to accept that there can be a non-commercial interest in property, that the objective of owning land need not necessarily be exploitative. Their only concept of ownership is personal property, rights over property held, and to deny rights or sell rights in return for payment. Because of this inability to comprehend or accept the cultural affinity between Aborigines and land, they completely fail to see the distinction between use of the land and ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> The response of the State Opposition, and here today the Federal Opposition, has been obstructionist and backward thinking. Their attempts to persuade members of the general public that Aborigines would be somehow disadvantaged if these Bills were passed are politically irresponsible and have no factual foundation. Today racial discrimination is being replaced by a growing concern and willingness in the wider community to find ways of bringing cultures together and to find ways of acknowledging common benefits. The Opposition however, is seeking to take society as a whole back to an unhappy era of prejudice. That is happening right now in my electorate concerning the Army School of Health property, which I mentioned earlier in this debate had been an Aboriginal reserve declared by the Victorian Government last century. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Hawke Government decided to dispose of the property I approached the Minister for Local Government and Administrative Services (Mr Uren) and argued successfully that there should be no disposal until the community advised the Government on the best future use of the property for Healesville and the wider community. I was appointed chairperson of a consultative committee which included, appointed and elected local representatives and representatives of local, State and Federal Government. After six months of exhaustive, open public meetings and after discussing 19 well prepared submissions received in response to public advertisements, the consultative committee recommended that the site be used for a post-secondary education centre and/or, as a secondary priority for low cost tourist accommodation. Some land in this former Aboriginal reserve was to be made available to the nearby sanctuary. If these options were unattainable, we recommended that the land be sold. While the consultative committee specifically rejected discussion on future ownership of the land as being outside its brief, it went without saying that the consultative committee's recommendations could be achieved only if the future ownership was compatible with the recommended future use. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said in this chamber today and last night about people meeting and not meeting with Aboriginal groups and others associated with the lands in question. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who is at the table, I believe, has an excellent record of communication with various representative groups of Aboriginal people. He is willing to travel around the country, inspect sites for himself and meet with those groups. The Minister, for instance, met with the consultative committee that I chaired and indicated to us:</PARA>
<PARA> The Army School of Health was formerly part of the old Coranderrk Reserve which makes it an area of great significance and importance to Aboriginal people, not merely locally but throughout Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister then indicated that he supported proposals which would return the land to the traditional Aboriginal owners and which at the same time met the needs of Aboriginal people and related to the broader needs of the local community of which they are essentially a part. The Minister argued that such proposals would be one of the most important and innovative developments for Aboriginal people not only in Victoria but within Australia. A post-secondary education centre could provide cultural and educational training for Aborigines, as well as providing important training and education facilities for the local non-Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister very recently advised the Shire of Healesville by letter of the Government's determined intention to transfer title of this Commonwealth owned portion of the former Coranderrk reserve to the Aboriginal Development Commission. Eventually, traditional Aboriginal owners will gain inalienable title to the land in the same way as the traditional owners of Framlingham and Lake Condah are regaining their land through the legislation that is now before the House. Equally importantly, the Minister indicated to the Shire of Healesville that title would not be transferred until proposals satisfactory to the Victorian and Federal governments were put in place, proposals which, among other things, would contain elements of cultural opportunities and vocational training for Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's decision, when it is completed, made final and flesh put on the bones of the consultative committee's proposals by consultants, will have bridged or helped to bridge the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal cultures through combining wide community use of the land with non-commercial ownership of that same land by the Aboriginal people. Given the good news for Healesville residents, I am very surprised that this month's council meeting, held a couple of days ago, the Shire President did not disclose the letter or the item in it that I have worked closely with the Minister to ensure that the consultative committee's proposals will be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision will bring great benefits to Healesville. It will bring education opportunities to Healesville students, who now have to travel long cross-country distances to post-secondary education centres. Victour expects big increases in tourists due to the potential of the property. School students will be able to stay there to enjoy the fauna, flora and Aboriginal treasures which abound at Healesville and in the upper Yarra Valley and ranges, in the very same way as tourists now use the Mount Buffalo Chalet and students enjoy the live-in facilities at Sovereign Hill in Ballarat. The Government's decision will complement the Healesville Sanctuary and the neighbouring Worowa Aboriginal College. The Government's decision will create employment opportunities and increase trade for business, which is already feeling the absence of the Army School. The consultative committee's proposals, when fully implemented, will indeed put Healesville on the map. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as the Opposition is unable to comprehend the non-commercial, non-exploitative affinity of Aborigines to the land and the need to grant inalienable freehold title to the Framlingham and Lake Condah reserves, so it totally fails to comprehend the fact that the traditional owners of Coranderrk will be able to regain the land, yet be more than happy that the total community of Healesville will be able to enjoy the benefits of that property. </PARA>
<PARA> But local Liberal opposition to the Government's intention is not based solely on ignorance. Attempts by members of the local Liberal machine to use the Healesville Council for their short term political ends are nothing short of deception towards the ratepayers. They talk of a sell-out of the consultative committee's proposals. At the same time, two members of the Liberal Party on that Council this week pushed through two motions. One motion called for the overthrow of the consultative committee's proposals in favour of another sell-out to an unknown private hotel developer, a proposal already rejected by the Committee. The other motion ordered the Shire Secretary not to meet with the group implementing the consultative committee's own proposals. The deceit is doubled when it is learnt that one of those Liberal councillors was a member of the consultative committee he now pretends to support. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberals' call for a public meeting over the Government's decision is nothing short of a put-up job. Any pretence that these actions by the Liberal Party are in the interests of the ratepayers is shot away when one realises that the call for a public meeting to discuss the Government's decision was published in a local paper before the Council met later in the day. Its concern for the public is questioned when we learn that a document about the Government's decision had two pages removed from it before being allegedly leaked to the media. The full document clearly indicated that the land would be returned to the Aborigines only after the consultative committee's proposals were implemented to the satisfaction of the Victorian and Federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The people have a right to ask what good can come out of a stacked meeting orchestrated by the Liberal Party from go to whoa and designed to divide a community along racist lines. It is unlikely that the Liberal councillors will tell the ratepayers that the land will become ratable and return the community thousands of dollars. It is unlikely that the Liberal councillors will tell the ratepayers that their proposal to purchase the property could well cost each man, woman and child in Healesville up to $200-an amount that must be added to their rates. In any case, decisions made at a single public meeting which were designed to frustrate decision making cannot be compared with the six-months long arduous and responsible task carried out by the consultative committee which, in a calm atmosphere, involving the public, made recommendations strongly backed by the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> Things have been going pretty badly lately for the Liberal Party. It has been forced to manufacture issues to mask its divisions and inadequacies. In Healesville, as at Framlingham and Lake Condah, although the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) did not put it this way, the Liberal Party is attempting to create a land rights controversy where none exists. It would be a tragic outcome for Healesville residents if the Liberals were successful and robbed the community of the educational, social and economic benefits flowing from the Government's proposals to develop the Army School of Health property, held in trust by the Aboriginal people. At the local level and in this Parliament, on matters involving former Aboriginal land reserves, the Opposition has shown itself to be completely out of touch with the people and the Aborigines. It knows only division and deception. I congratulate the Minister and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-As in most debates on Aboriginal affairs and when dealing with the rights of Aboriginal people, the contributions which have come from members of Her Majesty's Opposition are disappointing in terms of an evaluation of the issues, trite in the level of understanding and hypocritical in the way the argument is put. As we approach our bicentennial I would like to read an extract from a letter that appeared in the Standard on 1 January 1889. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been thinking that the Government ought to give us some land on these stations. They could give it to us this way, that we could never sell it to anyone, but it would be a home to us always . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Yours, et cetera, F. Clarke, F. Murray, H. Nelson, H. Albert, H. Saunders, half-castes. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps it is time to ponder in this House the agony, indeed the tragedy and extent of the deprivation involved. A group of half-castes almost 100 years ago made a plea to a dominant white society-a less caring and less compassionate society-in respect of the very areas of land we are now discussing. I again refer the House to the words they used. They asked for a piece of land. They said: `They could give it to us this way, that we could never sell it to anyone, but it would be a home to us always'. That is what this debate is about; that is what this legislation is about. The Aboriginal people of Framlingham and Lake Condah, almost 100 years later, after four years of negotiation with the State Government of Victoria, have made it perfectly clear that what they want in respect of these areas of land is exactly the same as they were asking for almost 100 years ago; that is, they want an area of land. The definition of that land is not a matter of argument. The identification of the Aboriginal groups who have lived there, died there and endured there is not a matter of argument. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the issue that brings this legislation before this Parliament? I remind the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), of his own policy statement. When releasing that policy statement he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Liberal and National Parties rejected proposals for National Land Rights, but support the provision of land to Aboriginal communities by State Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>He did not say by State parliaments, but by State governments. The State Government in Victoria has had four years of negotiation with the respective Aboriginal communities. No one from the Opposition side of the House says that Aboriginal people are asking for anything more or less than inalienable freehold title. That means very simply that they want the land in terms which, as a matter of philosophy and policy, were part of the policy of the Opposition when it was in government. The present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has voted for the concept of inalienable freehold title, as has the Leader of the National Party (Mr Sinclair). This was an inherent part of Opposition policy for years-to its credit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman says that it still is. If so, why does the Opposition not support this legislation? There is a difference between the attitude the Aboriginal people of Framlingham and Lake Condah have and that of the political colleagues of the honourable gentleman opposite in the Parliament of Victoria. The Aboriginal people said, as they have said for more than 100 years: `We do not want to own this land as some kind of commercial property. We do not want to own it so that we can sell it or dispose of it or divide it into suburban building blocks and become real estate developers'. They said, as they have been saying for 100 years, that they belong to that land and they want it in the terms of the letter which I read out to the House and which is almost 100 years old-so that they can never sell it and it can never be taken away. Is that unreasonable? Is it beyond the comprehension or compassion of the honourable gentlemen opposite?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Aboriginals want the land in terms such that none of them at any stage will have to face the responsibility of saying: `We think we will put a luxury tourist motel here. We can run a slide rule over the land and dispose of it to the first white fella who comes along and jingles a handful of dollars before us'. It is all right for the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) to blanch. Well he may, because what has occurred in the party of which he is a member is that the policy and philosophies of the New Right are becoming entrenched on the benches opposite. I will say this for the Leader of the Opposition: In the history of the Commonwealth he is a truly unique Leader of the Opposition; he has more talent on his back bench than on his front bench. In the course of that happening there have been movements away from attitudes which were prevalent among and were the policy of members of the Opposition less than five or six years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bolte Liberal Government in Victoria, when it gave title to Lake Tyers, virtually gave inalienable freehold title. What has been the cause of the change of mind whereby that action, taken almost 20 years ago, suddenly freaks out members of the Liberal Party and the National Party in Victoria? The pious arguments to which I listened in the Victorian Legislative Council are reflected and reproduced in this Parliament to the disgrace of this Parliament and the honourable members opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the issue? It is the old assertion of cultural arrogance. Opposition members are not saying that these Aborigines should not have the land; not at all. They are saying: `You can have this land but you must stop thinking like an Aborigine-if only you would think like we do, if only you would tell us that the land belongs to you and you want to flog it off, sell it or redevelop it because you want to think like white fellas.' Then they would have the moral approval of Mr Kennett and his bunch of political no-hopers who pass for politicians on the Opposition benches in the State of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well for the honourable member for Wannon to stand up and say `Oh! People should go to Lake Condah and see the achievements there. It is a matter of pride'. How did these achievements come about? It was through the support of the Victorian Government and the imagination and capacity of the Aboriginal people. Some of those people are here in this Parliament today and they will say to any member: `We do not want this land given to us so that we can treat it or dispose of it in the same way as white people. We belong to that land; our ancestors are buried there; we have lived on it, suffered on it, endured on it and we want to have it as an inalienable freehold title.' Shock, horror! What an awful concept!</PARA>
<PARA> If only the Aborigines would think like the Kennetts of this world and like honourable members opposite, if only black fellas would think like white fellas and take the same moral position in their attitudes to land, if only they would think like us, then they could have it. What a paltry, miserable and disgraceful attitude to have at this time as we approach our Bicentenary. That sort of attitude has coloured the history of those settlements at Lake Condah and Framlingham virtually since they were created as reserves. One only has to look at their history. Their history was one of telling Aboriginal people all the way through, a consistent policy of saying: `If you are a half-caste'-as defined by the rulers of the day-`we will move you off the land.' What was a half-caste? A full-blooded Aboriginal woman could be married to a white fellow yet she was a half-caste and she had to move on. </PARA>
<PARA> There were two views governing the thinking of those days. One was that Aboriginal people would die out and the second was that they would be assimilated. One of the great and historic achievements of Aboriginal people in my State is that they have survived. They have survived as Aboriginal Australians and they confidently assert both their culture and their tradition. They say: `We have not been assimilated and we will not go away. We want this Government, the State Government of Victoria, to recognise our perceptions as Aboriginal Australians and to make this land available to us.' That seems to me to be a fairly simple proposition. It was a proposition which the Victorian Government accepted yet the Liberal and National Parties in the upper House made it perfectly clear that they would not accept it. Not only would they not accept it, but they would also reject the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the honourable member want me to quote from the debate? I actually sat there in the Parliament. If the Liberal and National parties did not want to reject the legislation, why did they vote against the second reading? If one is supporting the basic concept of legislation one does not divide the House; one does not divide on the second reading motion and the honourable member knows that. Let us be perfectly candid: The problem that exists in the Opposition at the moment is their confusion and division on these sorts of issues. For Aboriginal people that is a tragedy because I agree that this matter should never have come to this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I was approached by the Victorian Attorney-General, he said that he could not get the legislation through the upper House but that his Government did not intend to retract from its commitments to Aboriginal people. He then asked the Commonwealth to take up the legislation and put it through Federal Parliament. I told him that I would only do that if I could not persuade the Victorian Leader of the Opposition to look at the matter again. I made no secret of that. I made it clear to the Press that I would contact Mr Kennett and urge him to reconsider his position because we were really talking about a question of time. I rang Jeff Kennett-I have known him since he first went into the Victorian Parliament-and I had a short, friendly conversation with him. He was gracious enough to tell me immediately that there was no way that the Opposition would reconsider its position. Indeed, before I rang him he held a Press conference at which he said there would be no change of attitude or position. </PARA>
<PARA> I actually went in and listened to the debates in the Victorian Parliament; it was the first time I had been there since I left that Parliament. I sat there and it was perfectly clear to me and to anyone who listened to that debate that there had been no consultation at all with the Aboriginal people whose lives would be affected by the legislation. Had there been any consultation, the Aboriginal people would have told members of the Parliament that they wanted the same sort of title as members of the Liberal and National Parties voted into the national lands rights legislation and the same sort of title as that given by the Bolte Government to the Aboriginal people at Lake Tyers. What is wrong with that? What is so horrific, so terrible about that?</PARA>
<PARA> We are told by honourable members opposite that they think they support land rights but one only has to look at the record. When this Government made the important and historic decision to give title to Uluru to the Aboriginal people, the reaction was shock and horror. The Opposition supported land rights but it did not think that the Government should do anything as dramatic or radical as that. So Opposition members voted against that decision. We were dealing with land that was the property of the Commonwealth. Oh yes, the Opposition has great compassion for Aborigines, but it never wants to give them a title. If one re-read those earlier debates one would think that by now Uluru should have disappeared. One would have thought that it would be moved. The fact is that that decision has been an historic success and everyone knows it. When, after 10 years of negotiation, we decided to give the Aboriginal people at Wreck Bay an inalienable freehold title, the Opposition said it supported those people. Yet it voted to a man against the handing over of that title as an inalienable freehold title. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, listen to that! The shadow Minister is not a bad fellow but his real problem is that the New Right has a grip on him and he does not have quite the same intestinal fortitude of Senator Peter Baume. He is not willing to stand up and have John Howard sack him. What he does is sit there mouthing platitudes of support for Aboriginal people, but time and time again when he has to put his hand up he votes against any concept of giving Aboriginal people a title in the terms that they ask. That is what this argument is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree that this legislation should never have come to this Parliament. It is not here because anyone is interested in grandstanding; it is here because we indicated that we would support State governments in the pursuit of the question of giving Aboriginal people a title to their land. The Liberal Party policy states that that Party supports State governments doing that. We have been asked by a State government to assist in this way to overcome a political obstruction. Honourable members opposite and I know that many of their State leaders-they are on record-do not and will never support land rights. Therefore, it will be necessary for the Commonwealth, in pursuit of its policies, to pursue that matter vigorously through this Parliament, and that is what we will do. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the legislation to the House, just as I condemn again the disappointing, mealy-mouthed approach of the Opposition which will go on mouthing platitudes about how it wants to help Aboriginal people but when it comes to the crunch it never has the capacity, the willingness or, more importantly, the compassion to see that they receive land on their terms. It wants them to live and think like the Jeff Kennetts of the world. Most of them have too much integrity and too much honour to do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his closing remarks on this Bill, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Holding) attempted, rather unsuccessfully, to draw a distinction between the Federal policy of the Liberal Party, the official Opposition in this Parliament, and the Liberal Party in Victoria. In so doing, however, the Minister deliberately omitted some very important factors. For example, he drew attention to the fact that the Bolte Government had given what he described as a similar title to the Lake Tyers community. The question of similarity, of course, may be subject to legal interpretation. However, there is one fundamental difference between the title offered then and the title that has been offered now, and this relates to the whole question of land rights apropos mining on Aboriginal land. The Bolte legislation did not refer to such provisions as contained in this Bill. In Victoria, there is quite justifiable concern that if legislation which contains elements of the question of mining on Aboriginal lands is implemented, the same principle can be applied to other legislation in Victoria. This issue has been brought to our attention; it is a matter which was discussed in the Victorian Parliament. I merely raise it to emphasise yet again the inaccuracies of the Minister in trying to draw the type of distinction which he has. It is a dangerous precedent as far as many people in Victoria are concerned. The legitimate interests of the people of Victoria, as expressed in the Parliament of Victoria, were completely correct at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I again refer to the other point that the Minister had tended to ignore. The Minister claims that he agrees with what I have said on behalf of the Opposition-that this legislation should never had been introduced into this Parliament in the first place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not waste my time or that of the House responding to such a ludicrous proposition. I said, and I repeat: If the Victorian Government was serious about granting title, it did not have to do it through legislation, firstly, and, secondly, if it had the problems, as claimed in the Upper House, it could just as easily have reached the same conclusion by executive means. The Minister is well aware that, under Victorian law, Crown land can be transferred. A specific Act of Parliament does not have to be involved every time someone wants to give a playing field to a local council. The truth of the matter is that the Cain Government has a record of gross negligence in this area since its election. Year after year it has seen other States, both National Party and Labor Party States, going forward and giving land rights to Aboriginal communities. The State of Victoria has the worst record of all. At the eleventh hour, after four, five and in some cases, according to Mr Clark, eight years of negotiation, it has finally decided to make a virtue out of necessity and pass legislation through Parliament. When members of the Victorian Government found that the legislation could not be passed, instead of being men of honour and people of integrity, referred to so often by the Minister and his cohorts on the other side, they did not even bother to take the issue through the upper House. They did not bother to debate seriously the amendments put forward by the Opposition. They dropped their bags and baggage and ran off to Mother Holding for support. I said that last night, and I repeat it for the record: Had they been serious about this matter they could have solved their problems domestically, but they refused to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy Speaker, had you been here last night for my speech on the second reading, you would have noted that I referred specifically to the fact that we are not questioning the authority of the Federal Parliament to legislate concurrently with the States in relation to Aboriginal matters. That is a constitutional requirement placed on us by the referendum of 1967, and I have said nothing this morning which disputes that. All I have said-and I will repeat it as it happens to be a strongly held view of the Opposition parties-is that this particular set of problems, involving some 12 square kilometres of land, could have been solved in Victoria, through the normal procedures of the Victorian Parliament, without the Federal Parliament having to spend time on the matter. It is not a question of jurisdiction, as we have that jurisdiction. It is a question of judgment, a question of principle, as to who should do what.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has made a major issue of the question of freehold title in perpetuity. The question which people ask, and which the Minister did not attempt to answer in his response to the second reading debate, is whether or not the present generation has the right to tie up the opportunities for change which will affect future generations. The question of law is what we are trying to determine. We are talking about laws which are to be applied to Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals alike across Australia. We in the Opposition stand on the belief that the form of title should be arrived at by the State governments in consultation with Aboriginal communities. If they wish to take it to the Parliament they have to argue their case in the normal way. One can only conclude that they could not get it through the Victorian Parliament because they failed to argue their case satisfactorily and because they simply did not have the support of the House-a House elected by the people of Victoria.

The facts of the matter are that the Victorian Parliament considered this legislation and the Victorian lower House passed the proposals. The shadow Minister knows that the bunyips in the Opposition in the Victoria upper House got together and voted against the legislation at its second reading stage and threatened to knock it over if it went to the final stage in that place. That is why the legislation is before us; that is why amendments have been moved; and that is why we are having this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition parties, which are now saying that this legislation is the property of the Victorian Parliament, know full well that their colleagues in the Victorian Parliament would not allow the legislation to proceed. We have the spectacle of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), and the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria, roaming the countryside, particularly the western parts of Victoria, where the Bills--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy Speaker, I will hold a copy of the amendments, and I will refer to them as I make my remarks. The point that I am trying to make in response to the shadow Minister is that in all his discussions in the Committee stage he did not put up one argument as to why the amendments should not be proceeded with, other than to state that this legislation ought not to be dealt with in this Parliament. Madam Deputy Speaker, you have dealt with the right of this Parliament to deal with this question; so we have clarified that objection. I make the point again that, in terms of the substance of the amendments and the legislation, the Opposition has not presented one argument as to why the people of Lake Condah and Framlingham ought not to get this land. That is the real question. We have not heard one argument in the third reading debate relating to the matters that were discussed in the Committee stage. The Leader of the Opposition in Victoria, the shadow Minister in this Parliament and the honourable member for Wannon tried to stir the people of western Victoria into a frenzy over the sorts of things covered by these amendments. They failed miserably. They could not get people to attend meetings or to discuss the matter because the people to whom the shadow Minister referred support what the Government is on about and, quite frankly, they are disgusted with the shallowness of the arguments of the three people I have referred to. These amendments enhance the legislation and I have no difficulty in supporting them. In conclusion, I take this opportunity to say that the Opposition has been shown up for what it really is. It talks and talks about the rights of Aboriginals, it talks about how it is not opposed to them, but every time legislation comes forward the Opposition opposes it.</PARA></TALK.START>

He told me that in the presence of members of the land councils of the Northern Territory, following the course of events that occurred in the Victorian Parliament. That was then his position. To the best of my knowledge, and on the basis of information I have received from the Victorian Attorney-General, this legislation has the support of the Framlingham community. If any members of the House are in any doubt about the support of members of the Lake Condah community I point out that they are present in the Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be mercifully brief on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Amendment Bill. I wish to emphasise, for the benefit of the House, that we believe this legislation is no more relevant to this issue than was the legislation we have already debated. When the legislation in its initial form, that is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage (Interim Protection) Amendment Bill, was originally introduced we were assured by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Holding) and by the Government at the time that it would overcome any problems which may be created in relation to the overlap between Federal and State jurisdictions in relation to the protection of sacred sites and so forth. There is still a considerable degree of argument, as I understand it, in the Victorian Aboriginal community as to what extent these proposals adequately cover that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Among the various points Mr Clark raises in the letter which I tabled earlier-and I assure the House that these issues have been brought to my attention by other Aborigines in Victoria-he is concerned about the fact that the legislation requires the compiling of a register of sites in the Framlingham Forest. The Minister would say, as he has said on previous occasions-he made this point in his rather testy address this morning-that we tend to make judgments relating to legal matters which may be appropriate to white Australians but which tend to ignore the realities and traditional interests of Aboriginal Australians. In many respects this is a classic example of that. In terms of white law it is obvious and logical to say that one should always have lists, registers and clearly identified public knowledge of as many things as possible, but in Aboriginal law that is a contradiction, as the Minister is well aware. The very act of having a sacred site does not imply that everybody should know about it. This creates both social and economic problems. For argument's sake, a mining company in the wider context of land rights can rightly say `How are we to determine where to put our access roads if there is not a document, a register, which states explicitly what we should avoid?' But the very fact of an Aboriginal community putting sacred sites on a register open to the gaze of people who are not qualified, in terms of the Aboriginal law of that community, to have access to those sites, or even knowledge of them, creates a fundamental conflict, as I am sure the Minister would accept. It is one of the difficulties in trying to relate Aboriginal customary law to European or British legal systems and concepts. This point has been rightly made by Mr Clark in the letter I tabled earlier. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is also an additional point the Community is unable to accept. We are in total disagreement of both Federal . . . and State . . . Heritage Legislation. To declare a site is to endanger it. Freedom of choice should be respected. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, to avoid embarrassment and long turgid delays in this matter let me say that I have said all I want to say about Mr Clark's views on this subject. I simply point out what I said in my speech on the second reading of the earlier legislation. Whilst the Government may claim that it has gone ahead with an administrative package, which has the endorsement in all respects of the relevant Aboriginal community leaders, I simply say that there is considerable doubt in my mind, on the basis of the information I have, that that is the true story. The amendments in the context of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Amendment Bill are related principally to trying to overcome inconsistencies which may appear between Federal legislation and State legislation. Unfortunately, the same problems are being created on this issue as those which were raised in the second reading debate on the Aboriginal Land (Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest) Bill, and we assert that this legislation could have been more appropriately handled at State government level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other issue to which I should also refer in relation to this second piece of legislation is the rights which people will have to protect their interests in Aboriginal sacred relics. Because of the effluxion of time and the historical realities of which we are well aware, in parts of Victoria keeping places have now been established in which artefacts of Aboriginal communities that may no longer even exist are being protected. No doubt the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has visited some of these places, as have I. I must say that I am quite impressed with the dedication of the people who are looking after those keeping places and with the manner in which the whole objective of giving the wider Australian community access to, and a greater knowledge of, traditional Aboriginal culture is being preserved. A substantial educative role can be played and it must be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the problem in the context of these amendments is to what extent Aboriginal communities-no one disputes that they are Aboriginal-in different parts of Victoria should have the right of access to relics kept in keeping places and with which they have no direct social association. I make the point-the Minister is well aware of it-that traditional Aboriginal society in Victoria, as is the case in every other part of Australia, was made up of many variations of different tribes, different languages, and with subtle differences in its style of managing its affairs and so forth. Probably it is no more adequate if one relates the matter to a European environment to say that a German tribe should have access to the sacred sites or sacred relics of a French tribe or Flemish tribe in the context of western Europe. For all intents and purposes, they are different peoples. The one thing they have in common is that they have been classified by white anthropologists as being Aboriginal. </PARA>
<PARA> The important point I am making is this: Those communities which are protecting relics today, usually because no antecedents or communities are left which have a direct link with them, surely have the right to continue to protect them because there is a geographical and historical association with that local environment where those sacred objects or community works may have originated. For example, the Loddon Valley had a community and it has a very good keeping place, and it has been suggested that its artefacts should be moved to Bendigo or Melbourne. People in that community quite justifiably ask: `Why? We are protecting these artefacts. This is part of our history'. It is part of not only the local Aboriginal history-and the community may not even exist now-but also the contiguous history of that environment, society or group. They have been told that they have no right to those artefacts and that they should be transferred. Such problems have created considerable concern in parts of Victoria and I simply draw these matters to the attention of the Minister as being examples of where he may try to overcome a set of problems but often by getting Federal jurisdiction involved with State jurisdiction all one ultimately does is create a whole host of new problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I will finalise my remarks by simply saying that the Opposition will be voting against this legislation. I do not wish to delay the House any further on this matter. The Opposition will not divide the House, but as was the case with the earlier legislation, the Opposition strongly objects to the legislation on the grounds that it ought not to have been introduced into this Parliament, nor should the issues raised have been handled the way they have been. I reiterate for the benefit of all honourable members that the Opposition has no objection whatsoever to the transfer of title to the Framlingham or Lake Condah communities. It is simply saying that the jurisdiction of that transfer properly lies with the Victorian Government and the Victorian Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA> The reason the Government is putting this legislation through this Parliament is that it was opposed in the Victorian Parliament by political colleagues of the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly).

That is the reality. I have been assured by the Attorney-General of Victoria and its Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that this legislation has the support of the Victorian Aboriginal people and I have no reason to doubt that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As everyone knows, the coalition has ended, but because the Ships (Capital Grants) Bill 1987 was considered by the last joint shadow Ministry meeting, I have been asked to lead the debate on it, and I am happy to do so. I am confident that after the next election I will be leading with legislation on the other side on behalf of a coalition government. The Ships (Capital Grants) Bill provides for a taxable grant of 7 per cent to any ship- owner who upgrades his fleet with new or modern secondhand ships. It is certainly an encouragement for Australian shipowners to improve their fleets with more modern, more fuel efficient and more crew efficient ships. The approval depends on an agreed reduction in manning levels to a maximum of 21 for bulk carriers, container ships and tankers engaged in international trade, and 23 for tankers engaged in domestic trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation follows an agreement between the Government, the shipowners and the seafaring unions. It includes the requirement to introduce multi-skilled ratings on Australia ships-that is, those who can work in, say, an engine room as well as on the deck; to establish and conduct training and retraining programs to provide this necessary greater range of skills that will be necessary; and, overall, to encourage a greater emphasis on teamwork and break down some of the old demarcations and barriers. It also allows for further crew reductions below the maximum specified as at present. I believe that those further crew reductions will be necessary because without them Australian ships will continue to fall behind those of comparable Western nations. But the important point is that multi-skilling and changes to arrangements for crew amenities and so forth will be possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxable grant of 7 per cent will be paid after 1 July until 30 June 1992 for new ships, and until 30 June 1990 for secondhand ships. It will also be available for significant modifications to existing ships. Although I failed to establish the cut-off date for the modifications, I presume it will be 30 June 1990, the same date as for secondhand ships. By `significant' I understand the modifications must be quite significant. Obviously, changes to crew quarters and other changes must be made to make the new, reduced manning arrangements possible, and also to allow the re-engining of ships so that they can gain some of the dramatic improvements in fuel efficiency which have occurred in shipping over the last few years. I have been told that if one looks at gains in fuel efficiency in, say aviation, automotive vehicles and shipping the greatest gains have been made in shipping. </PARA>
<PARA> For a ship to be eligible it must be owned and registered in Australia. It must be crewed by Australian residents at the appropriate level and it must be engaged in the carriage of the correct category of cargo. The Minister for Transport (Mr Peter Morris) in his second reading speech estimated that, after tax, the cost will be $18m to $20m or before tax, it will be about double that amount. That will be provided by an appropriation from Consolidated Revenue. Generally, I wish to commend the Minister for his initiative, along with that of the industry, not only in establishing this new incentive but also, initially, in maintaining and developing the Crawford initiative that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) and the previous coalition Government initiated. </PARA>
<PARA> If one refers to the report of the earlier review of Australian shipping in 1982-which became known as the Crawford report after Sir John Crawford-entitled the `Revitalisation of Australian Shipping', one will see that the point was made very clear then, as it is now, that capital cost is the most significant and single most important item in relation to running costs of ships in Australia. The items, broken down are: Capital costs, 47 per cent; fuel, 19 per cent; manning, 14 per cent; and other costs, 20 per cent. I am told that port charges are the most significant of those other costs, about 8 per cent. Crawford recommended that to upgrade Australian shipping we must, first and foremost, provide the incentive, and also allow the capital cost to be written off over the life of the ship. In the Crawford days, unless one replaced a ship, it was very difficult to alter the manning structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Crawford recommended replacement of the then inequitable depreciation rate for ships of only 6.25 per cent per annum and extension of the investment allowance, which at that time was restricted to Australian ships engaged in the coastal trade. He recommended that the 20 per cent investment allowance be made available to all Australian owned and crewed ships, that the 20 per cent depreciation rate replace the 6.25 per cent rate and that the first year of the depreciation be the pre-commissioning year. That is a very important concession or initiative because of the costs that are incurred ahead of the actual delivery of a new ship. </PARA>
<PARA> To the credit of the present Government and the Minister, in 1984 this Government introduced the enabling legislation for the Crawford recommendations to be put in place. However, it is not to the credit of this Government that it terminated the investment allowance only a few months later, on 30 June 1985. For any Australian shipowner to take advantage of the Crawford recommendations, the ship had to be ordered before 30 June 1985 and delivered prior to 1 July 1987 when the general investment allowance terminated. Only a very short period of about 14 months was available to Australian shipowners to take advantage of what is a complicated procedure of purchasing a new ship. I think it is to the credit of the Australian shipowners that in that short period 12 ships were ordered, and I am told that only one is still to be delivered. Presumably, that will happen prior to 1 July. That new tonnage equalled 10 per cent of the total Australian fleet, including 25 per cent of the tanker fleet. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the termination of the effectiveness of the Crawford recommendations by the ending of the investment allowance only three ships have been ordered. They are basically ships of a special nature, such as gas carriers, but they come under the new manning arrangements, that is, the Crawford manning arrangements. Meanwhile, other Western nations with standards of living similar to those in Australia have manning rates or crewing levels which are much lower than Australia's were prior to Crawford-levels in the mid-twenties compared with our mid to high thirties in pre-Crawford times. Their improvements inefficiency have continued since the Crawford period. It is now common for countries that have comparable standards of living and comparable attitudes as to what are reasonable requirements for crew members to have crewing rates of 16 to 18. Some of them are now even allowing non-residents to be crew on their flag vessels. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of this the Minister established the Maritime Industry Development Committee comprising representatives of the Department, shipowners and unions. It studied the manning levels of the other Western nations in 1985 and reported in 1986 in the document entitled `Moving Ahead'. This report made certain recommendations to the Minister. That is the basis on which we now have this legislation, with only one significant exception, as I see it. It recommended a depreciation rate of 33 1/3 per cent per year for three years, including the first year ahead of commission. In its place, the Minister is legislating for a taxable grant, together with retaining the 20 per cent depreciation on new ships only in the pre-commissioning year. I acknowledge the point that for secondhand ships that is not a great problem because money is not outlaid as an advance payment ahead of the ship being available. </PARA>
<PARA> Ship owners have said that what the Government is providing is not as generous as what `Moving Ahead' or the MIDC report recommended and that, in turn, even those recommendations are not as generous as those of Crawford, initiated by the previous coalition Government and instituted by the present Government. However, the industry strongly supports the legislation. I acknowledge its strong support for the legislation and can understand that support. The industry is particularly supportive of the inclusion of secondhand ships and the provision for extensive modifications. That is very important. There is a surplus of up to date secondhand shipping around the world. Obviously, there is a saving both in capital outlay and time if someone purchases a replacement ship. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the shipping that will be purchased as a result of this legislation will be secondhand rather than new shipping. I would like to quote from a letter I have just received from Dennis Woods, who is Manager, Government Relations of Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd. He sent to me, as I presume he did to many other members of parliament, a brochure on Australia Star-the new Caltex Oil tanker. I wrote back to him with a variety of questions concerning the applicability of Crawford and this legislation and general movements in crewing efficiency. He has given me his approval to quote from the letter which puts into perspective the application of the various incentives to a particular ship over the last few years. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The overriding motivation in acquiring a new generation crude oil carrier, was for Caltex to become more cost competitive in an industry which has clearly demonstrated over the years intense, and at time fierce competition, a benefit which all consumers of petroleum products have enjoyed. </PARA>
<PARA> A substantial reduction in manning levels, together with other operational efficiencies characteristic to the `Australia Star' will enable Caltex to reduce its marine operating costs. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the taxation incentives available under the Crawford package also provided considerable incentive to commission the `Australia Star'. </PARA>
<PARA>In respect of specific questions I raised, he said the following:</PARA>
<PARA> The difference between crewing levels of 29 for coastal voyages and 27 for overseas is the provision of one extra mate and one extra SUA. </PARA>
<PARA>We should remember that we have the continuing provision with this legislation of allowing for two extra crew when a tanker is operating domestically rather than internationally. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The logic is that cargo duties are more intensive due to the close proximity of ports. Extended stands on cargo watch, followed by departure duties, then a normal sea watch cycle, can lead to delays if additional people are not available. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to be noted that the previous generation of Australia crude vessels-</PARA>
<PARA>that was, pre-Crawford-</PARA>
<PARA>had manning levels of 34 overseas and 37 on the coast whereas the new MIDC proposition is for 21 overseas and 23 on the coast. </PARA>
<PARA> Caltex received Crawford benefits for the `Australia Star' after extensive consultations between the Department of Transport and the unions involved. The level of 25 referred to relates to a desired manning level for dry cargo vessels-</PARA>
<PARA>that was Crawford's idea-</PARA>
<PARA>whereas for liquid cargoes (crude carriers) an extra crew is an acceptable addition for safety (hazardous cargo) and operational reasons . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been acknowledged by all parties to the manning committee that a training of skills factor be recognised in the crew levels of these new generation vessels. </PARA>
<PARA> In the next generation of ships, it is likely that Officers/crew will share common mess and recreation facilities, eliminating current duplication. A manning level in the vicinity of 21/23 is ultimately expected. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is reflected in the legislation. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Major changes will occur in SUA ranks where the introduction of a new integrated rating position will reduce manning. No change is expected in Officer ranks (with the possible exception of Radio Officer or Electrician). </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond this-</PARA>
<PARA>and that is beyond the immediate introduction of the MIDC manning levels as proposed in this legislation-</PARA>
<PARA>we would expect to achieve levels of 18 with elimination of the Radio Officer and Electrician and merging of catering staff into a single category. </PARA>
<PARA> All this cannot be done at once as hand in hand with these efforts must go changes to Union structures, including the amalgamation of existing unions into only two (one for all Officers and one for all the crew and catering staff). </PARA>
<PARA>That was the end of the letter. It made the point very well about progress pre-Crawford, through Crawford, to this legislation and, what is equally important, beyond this legislation. Obviously, the 21-23 figure cannot be final because other Western nations already have lower levels. Caltex acknowledges that it is possible to get the number down to 18, within the context of ships that are ordered or commissioned under these new procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> There are still many other problems associated with Australian shipping in its drive, which I support, to be internationally cost competitive. I have made the point already that we still are behind other countries in the numbers of people required on our ships. If this new incentive enables a further 25 per cent, and I hope it will be a higher percentage, of Australian ships to be replaced, by 1992 we could still have 25 per cent of our coastal shipping-if one considers what has happened with Crawford's ideas and these measures-with crew numbers still in their middle and high 30s, as well as crew numbers in the mid-20s and low 20s. Meanwhile, most of our competitors already have most, or a good percentage, of their crews in the low 20s or below 20. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a further problem in relation to manning levels for Australian ships; that is, the excessive leave entitlement for Australian crews compared with those in other Western nations. I am not interested in comparisons with Third World countries because that is not relevant. The Minister was quite right in selecting comparable countries which a group of people went overseas to look at. In looking at comparable countries, I refer to the point made in `Moving Ahead' that every Australian ship requires 2.25 crews. Therefore, if a ship has a crew of 21 and that number is multiplied by 2.25 we come up with a total requirement of 46 crew members per ship. Let us consider a west European ship. The ratio is 1.5 : 1 per ship. If the crew number is 18 and we multiply 18 by 1.5, we come up with a figure of 27. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. With that sort of authority I can now say confidently that we still have a great disparity; that is, 46 crew for an Australian ship and 27 for a west European ship which has the more common manning ratio. So there will still be a dramatic disparity in ship manning levels between Australia and our major competitors when this legislation is implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On-board maintenance is also a problem. I believe, from my discussions with Australian ship owners, that progress is being made in coming to more sensible arrangements so that on-board maintenance, which can sensibly be done during the voyage or at other times available to the crew, is being done more now than it has been in the past, but it still remains a problem. Of course, there are problems not only on ships, but in relation to shipping generally. There are many problems on our waterfront which need to be solved to allow our shipping to be internationally competitive. One of the unfortunate burdens that Australian shipping has to carry in its comparisons of coastal shipping and international shipping is that everything that is carried on the coast has to go through our waterfront twice. That adds immeasurably to the final cost of goods and gives rise to some of the comparisons which are made from time to time-and they are correct-of the cost of transferring goods around the Australian coast and the cost of transporting them from Australia to Japan or anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> There are problems relating to the efficiency of coastal shipping but there is also the problem of goods going through the Australian waterfront twice. It seems to me that better progress is being made with the maritime unions and management than with the waterfront unions and management. I include both groups in our problems on the waterfront. The Minister has a series of committees working on aspects of the waterfront, but at this stage there has not been the progress which has been made-which I acknowledge and which is included in this legislation-with the maritime unions. Unless there is considerable improvement in the waterfront situation as a result of the consensus approach of those committees, by the time there is a change of government the next coalition government will have to use public exposure far more than this Government is using it. I believe that this Government is holding the public exposure threat in reserve at present in relation to the work and management practices which presently inhibit the management of the waterfront generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem of the waterfront is reliability. We need industrial relations legislation to address that problem more specifically. That will be a necessity for the next coalition government. For its own benefit as a trading nation and to provide employment opportunities for maritime people, Australia should have internationally competitive shipping. However, it must be genuinely competitive and operate at the same level of efficiency whether it be in domestic or international trade. Since the Crawford recommendations were implemented by the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd with its bulk carriers, in those ships at least Australia has had almost genuinely competitive international capacity. The particular contractual arrangements have been a help in that case, yet we must still acknowledge that that is a good example of a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also realise that competitiveness is not static, it is dynamic. We may talk today about progress being made by certain legislation, but we cannot say that that must be the end of it. The momentum must be maintained and, unless it is, not only will we keep tailing the field in the measurement of efficiency compared with other Western nations, but we will also fall further behind. That competitiveness must be achieved by a genuine efficiency and not by flag reservation. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that cabotage, or flag reservation, is a vexed issue for the coastal trade. I believe that a coalition government would look at the progress of improvement in efficiency in our coastal trade and I personally would support an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry into the best way to improve our coastal shipping efficiency from that point. I believe that that would be a positive move. There can be no justification for flag reservation for Australia's international shipping. That applies particularly to the trans-Tasman situation where there is an unjustified extension of Australian cabotage which turns the Tasman into a very expensive Australian and New Zealand lake. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the closer economic relations review a study of trans-Tasman shipping is at present underway. In my discussions with the Labor Government in New Zealand before Christmas I gained the impression that if that review recommended the removal, either in whole or part, of the present restrictions on the Tasman, it would support the lifting of those restrictions. I know that there are various options around including allowing the cross traders to make more efficient use of container space between Australia and New Zealand on their way to some third port. I must say that a coalition government would support the lifting of the present unjustified restrictions on the Tasman to just Australian and New Zealand shipping. </PARA>
<PARA> The phosphate rock carriage to Australia has been another scandalous situation. It costs up to $15 a tonne more to ship rock from Christmas Island to Australia than from Florida to Australia. There has been criticism of the Australian National Line but I do not support that criticism because ANL took over a contract which locked it into a high price situation. I understand that the Government has arranged a far more efficient and competitive new contract and if the Minister likes to comment on that I will be pleased to hear what he has to say. I understand that the new arrangements, which have just come into place, are far better from an internationally competitive point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is concerned by this type of legislation. It is not unique, as there are industry-specific plans supported by legislation and by government incentives in the automotive manufacturing, heavy engineering, steel and textile industries. I believe that the shipping industry is probably the most specifically productivity linked. In other words, one can see a far more direct relationship between an expenditure of taxpayers' money and improvements in efficiency. However, in general-though I am not referring in particular to this legislation at this stage-the Opposition is concerned that industry is not taking the lead in making the adjustments that it should be making in a commercially competitive environment. It waits for, or goes to government expecting, what I call a bribe. What it should be doing naturally itself is becoming a case of plan after plan after plan. There is this belief that industry should go to the Government and work out a deal. I believe that it would be a very bad precedent for industry in this country to accept generally or have an expectation that, when it should be adjusting naturally to make Australia more internationally competitive, it can go to government and ask what sort of deal can be worked out. </PARA>
<PARA> By 1992 when this plan sensibly expires-and I believe it is a good feature to have a sunset clause in the Bill-enough of the Australian fleet will have been converted to more efficient crewing and other arrangements with the ability to continue that efficiency to put the pressure naturally on the rest of the Australian fleet to do what should be done without any need for any more special industry plans. In other words, the time must come when the Government says `Enough is enough; you have a good percentage of the fleet replaced so that the position is better for your own survival. If you did not or could not take advantage of the special deal, do not wait for another one. You should get on with it and do it yourself to stay in business'. In general terms that is the reaction to the legislation. The Opposition will not oppose it. </PARA>

I end my question by saying to the Minister and to the Government that matters relating to Libyan activity and any associated matters are of joint concern to both sides of this House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the statement of the Leader of the Opposition that there is bipartisan support for concern on this matter. I would have expected it, but the confirmation is reassuring. It is true that the visit to New Zealand was an unadvertised one.

<PARA> There was considerably less in the visit than apparently was suggested by some of the more agitated minds that were commentating on it this morning in media outlets-at least according to the reports that I have received. The visit was arranged several days ago. It followed extensive consideration by a Cabinet committee on regional matters and, most particularly, intrusion from outside influences into regional affairs. It was recognised that these would be matters in relation to which New Zealand would have common concerns and, indeed, a considerable fund of information. The New Zealanders have had a much more extensive and much longer experience in the South Pacific than we have had. Accordingly, the opportunity was taken by me to go to New Zealand this morning. The 3 a.m. departure was not one of delightful choice, but it seemed to be necessary if I was to get there, complete talks and get back here for Question Time. I miss Question Time sometimes. When I am in the country I prefer to be here when Question Time is on.</PARA>

<PARA> Other matters, of course, were discussed in New Zealand-in particular, the upcoming South Pacific Forum conference. It was necessary for ministerial discussion to take place because the conference is being held a couple of months earlier than normal and a great deal of work has to be compressed decisively into a very short period. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development conference, too, came up. Essentially we discussed concerns about developments in the South Pacific, arising from outside intrusions-most notably those of Libya. The New Zealanders and the Australian representatives led by me had an extensive exchange on these matters. Our presentation followed very much the presentation which I provided last night for the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Menzies as the spokesman on foreign affairs for the Opposition. As both would recognise, a great deal of material there is highly classified and at this point it would not be appropriate for me to say any more than that. I assure honourable members that the Government is keenly alert on this matter and is maintaining a constant overview of it. I also assure honourable members that the Prime Minister is maintaining a particularly vigilant attitude on this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the very wide consultations on the development of a national agenda for women there is, without any question, overwhelming evidence that Australian women want to dismantle the barriers to their opportunities for equal participation in all forms of economic and community activity in this country, especially in employment, education and recreation. So the fundamental principle underlying the Government's policy of equal opportunity for women is for all Australian women to have a fair go, a say and a choice. That, simply put, is our principle. We have stuck to it and we have legislated for it. Having made quite clear to the House what is the principle of the Government in this matter, I suggest that it is rewarding that we look at the question of principle as far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned. I preface my remarks in that regard by reminding the honourable member and indeed the whole of the House of what the Leader of the Opposition had to say on the question of principle and integrity of the Liberal Party on 19 February this year. Speaking on the Schildberger program the Leader of the Opposition had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask the Minister: In view of the severely depressed state of the sugar cane industry, shown by the continuing slump in grower returns and the recent closure of the Goondi Mill near Innisfail, does the Federal Government accept that such an arrangement is totally justified in order to maximise the number of jobs available to harvesting and general farm workers?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of the latter part of the question, I have no objection at all to putting in place a committee on business regulation. That is a matter for the House to determine, and I am sure that my distinguished colleague would know that that can be the subject of a resolution here at the appropriate time-which I do not have the carriage of. In respect of the national companies and securities scheme, I indicate that it has always been the policy of my Party to have such a national scheme. Of course, this has to be looked at in the light of what one might call the political developments that have ensued for a period of time. For example, in our previous Government of 1972-75, the Australian Labor Party attempted to introduce such a scheme, but it was rejected. I well remember being in opposition during the period following the 1975 election, and attempting to introduce, as shadow Attorney-General, a national scheme by means of private legislation. That Bill was rejected by the Senate on the first occasion and on the second occasion Parliament did not even bother to debate the matter. But at least some progress has been made since then. I am now a member of the Ministerial Council, which was created from what is called the national scheme that was developed in co-operation with the States and which was the subject of legislation in 1978. That scheme provides for all the States to be parties to it and, where there is a Ministerial Council, to decide what sort of legislation should be introduced into Parliament. When such legislation is introduced and passed by Parliament, it becomes the law applying to all the States and the Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is some artificiality about that, and in debates in Parliament objection has been made to the fact that, once the Ministerial Council has agreed, we in Parliament cannot alter the legislation. The argument is that it makes this Parliament a neuter somewhat, because for the first time legislation introduced here could not be altered or amended, as that would be contrary to the legislation introduced in 1978. I have always taken the view that it would be appropriate for the business communities to suddenly realise at last that the national scheme is in their best interests. The scheme relates to one market, one economy. Members would be aware that in recent weeks legislation has been passed to allow for the creation of the Australian Stock Exchanges. The various stock exchanges have agreed themselves that it is important that they get together as an Australian enterprise to deal with the Australian share market. It is an important market. It would have much more credibility and receive much more support from the public if the public realised that there was at least a national support for it. The difficulty that I face from time to time concerns what would be the attitude of other parties in the Parliament. I think I am judging the situation well now in thinking that everyone would agree that there ought to be a national scheme. I must say, though, that when I go to the Ministerial Councils and suggest that there ought to be a national scheme I am usually outvoted, on the basis that they feel that the State instrumentalities are the best way to manage the scheme.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I said the Ministerial Council. The creation of interest was encouraged at the time when the Leader of the Opposition was taking some interest in the matter. The State instrumentalities want to retain their respective responsibilities and to also retain the income that they get from the registration filing fees. At present there is a profit in it for the States of about $70m. However, it is only the Australian Parliament that is out of pocket, as the scheme was reasonably devised on the basis that we would always pay half the cost-but we get nothing like half the income. So, whilst we are putting up with half the cost, the States are getting the benefit. I know that this will not help my credibility with my State colleagues on the basis that I feel that they are looking at the matter more from the point of view of their State Treasuries than the national need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to pay a tribute to the Senate, which established a committee and which recently produced a report. That report is of interest. Evidence was given to the Senate Committee that there is increasing support for the suggestion that the Commonwealth Government should assume complete responsibility. I would be happy to do it. In fact, I am going to the Ministerial Council in May to suggest that I do it. I will ask for its support. I will be very surprised if I get it. However, the issue would be: What does the business community feel ought to be the situation? It appears very clear that the Business Council of Australia, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Australian Merchant Bankers Association and, certainly, the New South Wales Attorney-General, a colleague of mine, support a national scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member has asked a very important and valid question. He has always taken an interest in these matters; it is a very important interest. We are trying to indicate to the Australian people that we can have effective legislation on a national basis. There is no need for the plurality of some seven or eight different instrumentalities trying to deal with the same matter. I think that we would do it more effectively and efficiently than is the case at present. Some 1,400 employees work in the State corporate affairs offices. They have over 300 investigators, and there is the problem of the National Companies and Securities Commission saying that it desperately needs more resources. I will accept that; but the resources are already there, although probably not effectively utilised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The very essence of what the Government has done in the past in respect of expenditure restraint, or restraint in public outlays, tax expenditures or tax policy, has been equity and fairness. Whether we are speaking about tax cuts, tax concessions, wages policy or social security policy, they are all, in their essence, equitable and fair. That is how it will continue to be while ever this Government is in office. But I might say that that is not the position with the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We now see being unveiled in this country by the real leader of the National Party, the Queensland Premier, a 25 per cent flat tax proposal which would cost the revenue $4.8 billion and give a massive tax cut to the wealthy which the Queensland Premier says would be funded by an $8 billion cut in outlays-which, of course, would inevitably hurt the poor. The interesting thing is that the Queensland Premier said on the radio program AM the morning before last, when asked about his position or his involvement in politics or in any possible government: `It is all about getting the right policies'. When a question was put to him about his being Prime Minister, he said: `Don't worry about the PM part; it is all about getting the right policies'. In other words, if forced, he would forsake being Prime Minister-if he had the opportunity-to get his way on policy. Everyone thought: `Well, he will never get his way on policy while John Howard is the Leader of the Liberal Party. John Howard would not deal on policy with anybody he called a wrecker and a thug. He would not allow the National Party to run his policy'. But what do we find today? On the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald we find the headline `Howard: I'd work with Joh'. In other words: `I will do a deal with the devil. All I care about'-that is, the honourable member for Bennelong-`is being Prime Minister'. So the man who gambled on Sinclair and on maintaining the coalition and lost now says to his Party: `I tried to keep the coalition together; I tried to break Joh and keep him from power and I failed. But keep me in the leadership. And just by the way, Joh is basically not a wrecker or a thug. We would negotiate with him if we had the raw numbers on the conservative side of the House of Representatives to put a government together'.</PARA>
<PARA> If that were to happen we would find that Australian public policy would be run by the lowest common denominator in Australian politics-the Queensland National Party and the Queensland Premier. We would find that, in every fight John Howard had with the Queensland Premier, he would lose-like he lost every fight with Malcolm Fraser. One could sum up, certainly in election terms, the news of this week in the phrase `A vote for John Howard is a vote for Joh', because Joh would be sitting in running the policy of a conservative government if honourable members opposite had the numbers to form a coalition government-if that were ever to come to pass in this country. That is what it is about. Joh has said: `I will break the coalition. I will run the policy. I will smash Sinclair'. He has done all those things. Howard said he would bail him up. He was banking on a coalition. He put his career on the coalition; he lost; but he is still saying: `Oh, no, I've got the credentials'. Then he surrounded himself with his own supporters on the front bench. Any talent has been banished to the back bench and we find--</PARA>

It is back in the gutter in the filth where it belongs. Is it any wonder that members of the Opposition are treated like toadies by business? Members of the Opposition not only have no policies, no principles in policy and no principles in their relationships with one another or between the respective parties but also they are totally disinterested in the major issues facing the nation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that the United States has offered to the Soviet Union four million tonnes of subsidised wheat under the export enhancement program and that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has apparently assured the United States that it will purchase the full amount of the offer in the period up to 30 September this year. The House will recall that an earlier offer was made by the United States which was constrained by a fixed subsidy of $13 a tonne, later lifted to $15 a tonne. The present offer is not constrained by any limitation on the subsidy that would apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to say something about this matter which we view with some concern. The major reason we are concerned about it is that this sale has been made in the context of a long term agreement with the Soviet Union. Whilst the apparent justification for these subsidy programs is to allow the United States to meet the market, the reality is that, for very minimal extra sales by the United States, the effect of its subsidy programs has been to halve the price of wheat. So it has sold very little additional wheat, but the effect of its policies in halving the world price has had an extraordinary impact on wheat producers around the world, and particularly in Australia. If we aggregate the total effect of the United States farm program on Australian farmers we see that, in the last year, farmers in Australia have lost $1.3 billion as a result of these programs being conducted by the United States. I think the important point is that we have to maintain our efforts to ensure that some kind of sanity is reintroduced into world agricultural markets. Hence we are not only sending a group from this Parliament to Washington but also, later this month, I will be there and I will raise this matter, amongst others, with the Cairns group meeting which will now take place in Ottawa.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me make a final observation about this point. As a result of this subsidy from the United States to the Soviet Union, which is worth some $120m, households in the Soviet Union will pay less for their bread and wheat products than households in the United States will pay for their bread and wheat products. As this subsidy of $120m represents about a quarter of the value of the total consignment, perhaps it would be appropriate for 25 per cent of this four million tonnes to be shipped to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in United States aid bags marked: `This is a gift of the United States Government and its people to the people of the Soviet Union'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the Government is co-operating with the States and the Territories to achieve uniformity and cost effectiveness in building regulations through the Australian Uniform Building Regulations Co-ordinating Council. I understand that both the Government and the Opposition support the work of this Council. It was established through formal inter-government agreement to achieve simplified cost-effective and uniform building regulations. I have identified building regulations as a priority area for business regulation review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Council has developed a new building code of Australia which will provide a uniform and simplified code to be called up in full by State legislation. It will be more cost-effective and performance-orientated and based on current research. It will remove regulations which are not justified on health and safety grounds. The new building code of Australia has been released for public review now and is being further developed in consultation with the States, local government and the housing and construction industry. Seminars are being arranged by the States and Territories in all major centres to introduce the draft code to industry and to local government. I expect that the code will be available in final form by January next year for adoption by all States and the two Territories. I urge them to adopt the proposed uniform building code of Australia. It is a very important initiative and should lead to significant cost reductions and a more efficient building industry.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that he will be able to understand this one. I am not sure what documents the journalist concerned has seen or believes she has seen. I believe her to be a truthful journalist so when she says that she has seen them, I suspect that she has. I do not think that she would persist in misrepresentation on that basis. Documents circulate in the Department of Defence by the bushel, and it has been my experience as a Minister that quite a few of them shake out from time to time and turn up in ways that on occasions I would rather they did not. The simple fact is that whatever document it was does not reflect the position and I shall go through the matter in detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The figures I gave yesterday hold for the whole project; they are apples with apples. They are the same figures that went into underpinning the estimates on the $2.6 billion. They include all those items that were mentioned, including the berthing facilities, support, spares and all the rest of it which the article suggests must have been excluded from my figures. There is one small discrepancy in that area and that is that there is a higher inclusion in these figures than to the $2.6 billion for Royal Australian Navy costs. In other words, we are in one small area including a larger number of figures than were included in the $2.6 billion. So, far from excluding, we are in fact including a greater number of elements in the total project.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not, as the article suggests, a matter of my figures being at odds with the Department's. The figures are determined by two processes. One is by departmental committees which review all elements of the submarine project. In this case they are augmented departmental committees so that there is an opportunity for representatives of other departments to review the same figures. The figures that will be presented to the Cabinet, the parameters of which I mentioned in the House yesterday, are a result of that process. It is not a process involving my sitting down and trying to work out the costs of a submarine. Quite clearly I am not capable or competent to do so, nor is any other member of this House. That is the first point I make about those figures.</PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that the figures are based on a tender on which the four tender parties are willing to sign fixed price contracts variable only by the normal price movements in generalised labour costs and by the normal requirements of extreme force majeure, like a decision by the Government to cancel the project half way through and start it up again five years later or something like that. The figures are not just based on departmental estimates. They are figures on what four tenderers are prepared to build the submarine for. They are prepared to sign their names on the dotted line on the bottom of those figures. In addition, the figures that will be presented to Cabinet are based on June 1986 prices. In doing so, I shall be presenting myself to Cabinet at a slight disadvantage because the dollar is now about 2c, 3c or 4c ahead of where it was in June 1986. But there has to be some cut-off point of time for the purpose of negotiations when one is establishing the base line around which one will permit price movement in the future. We have chosen June 1986 figures in the contract.</PARA>
<PARA> So whatever figures may have been circulating at any point of time or somebody's idea at some point of time, those are the figures that have come through from the various committees in the Department. They are the figures to which they are prepared to sign on the dotted line. They are all-inclusive of every single category of element that was included in the $2.6 billion, with the addition I mentioned. Not only are they all-inclusive; they also relate to six submarines. It was also suggested in the article that one other way I could get down the figures was to bid for fewer than six submarines. It will be open to Cabinet to determine what number of submarines the country has. I am not pre-empting the Cabinet decision in that regard, but the figures that will be presented to it will be for six submarines. So in every single detail the article is incorrect on the basis of those figures. I thank the honourable gentleman most sincerely for asking me this question on the subject.</PARA>

Public hearings and public meetings were held in many country centres in Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania as well as Darwin, Perth and Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report forms the second phase of the work of the Committee on Telecom's zonal and charging policies. The Committee's earlier report, `Ringing in the Changes' which dealt with metropolitan and near metropolitan areas, was tabled in the Parliament on 4 October 1984. I tabled the Government's response to that report on 15 November 1985 and, in doing so, pointed out that the new zoning arrangements proposed to be introduced by Telecom would require up to two year's preparatory work. Telecom has now advised me that planning has been substantially completed and the preparatory work is well advanced. Details of the changes and implementation will be announced later this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is in the process of finalisation of its consideration of the latest report and I expect that the Australian Telecommunications Commission will come to a final view in May 1987.

In particular we resent the long-term effect of the discounting. The pension loss is compounded throughout the life of a pensioner and surviving dependants-into the 21st century for many.

<PARA> That, as a consequence of the Hawke Government's decision to introduce a two dollar coin in 1988,</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas the introduction of a one dollar coin was only a twofold increase in the maximum value of coinage, the elimination of the two dollar note represents a fivefold increase before a note can be used.</PARA>

<TITLE>Tertiary Education Administration Charge</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned, wish to register our opposition to the recent introduction of the administrative charge for higher education students because:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. the annual administration charge will inevitably restrict access to higher education for a range of disadvantaged groups, particularly women, rural dwellers and some low income earners.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. students will be deterred from study because of the probable escalation in the charge in future Budgets, prohibiting students ability to plan the long term costs of their education.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. the charge is ill-conceived and unfairly penalises part-time students, age pensioners and Austudy/Abstudy beneficiaries-who, in many cases, have to wait for months for reimbursement of the charge-amongst others.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. the imposition of the charge is contrary to the education provisions of the ALP/ACTU Accord and ALP policy which states that the party ``will maintain the provision of free tertiary education''.</PARA>

<PARA> Mr Porter-Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I understand it is the convention of the House that it not proceed if a Government Minister is not in the chamber. I draw your attention to that matter and wonder whether you would consider the point of order.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Leo McLeay)-I am not aware of any specific provision that a member of the executive Government has to be at the table.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Porter-Mr Deputy Speaker, perhaps I could assist you--</PARA>
<PARA> Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! If the honourable member will hear me, I will hear him. It is probably not as pertinent that a member of the executive Government be in the chamber when the House is dealing with petitions, which are matters between private members and the Parliament. I take the general view that we might dispose of petitions, and then see where we go.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Porter-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would like to draw your attention to certain conventions and certain precedents of which I am aware. For example, one of my predecessors from the electorate of Barker, Archie Cameron, was the Speaker. I know that on one occasion when there was no Government Minister in the House he considered it was inappropriate for the House to continue to sit.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-I have no doubt-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Tim Fischer-Leave the chair.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-The honourable member for Farrer does not need to provide any assistance unless he at least stands in his place. If he wants to interject, he might do so from his place. I think if one wants to make points of order and interject, one might at least do so properly. While there has been that convention, I think we can deal with the matter. A Minister is now present, and we can proceed.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Carlton-Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. The House deserves a ruling on the matter even though the Government has come to its own defence.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-I do not believe that any ruling from the Chair is necessary. A convention was brought to my attention by the honourable member for Barker. I said my understanding was that that convention was generally so, but I also pointed out to the House that we were dealing with petitions, which were matters between ordinary members and the Parliament. I do not intend to make any ruling on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Cadman-On the same matter, Mr Deputy Speaker: There are matters that cannot be dealt with unless they are moved by a Minister. I do not think the Chair is in a position to know when those matters may arise. I wonder whether you might further investigate this and perhaps report back to the House.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-I would not think it was in order for a Minister to interrupt the Clerk to move a motion while the Clerk was reading petitions unless the Minister wished to move a motion to print a petition. Even the honourable member for Mitchell would realise that, if it were necessary for a Minister to move a motion, he would be in the House to do so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major points of Labor's tax reform will be . . . increases in the spouse rebate and sole parent rebate, resulting in additional tax cuts of $2 a week to families. </PARA>
<PARA>Have a guess who said that! Of course it was the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in 1983. It is yet another broken election promise. Not only has the Prime Minister failed to deliver the promised tax cuts to families, but the real value of the spouse rebate has been cut in real terms by 25 per cent. In addition to reducing the value of tax relief previously provided to families, especially to families with young children, the Government's taxation and welfare policies have discriminated against families because they have totally failed to acknowledge the fact that families with young children have significant additional costs to carry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, has acknowledged that, as a result of Labor's policies, `Young Families are worse off under Labor'. That is a headline in the Canberra Times. The Government, instead of taking action to remedy the devastating impact that its policies have had on the family, is now looking to further increase the tax slug on families, especially families with young children, by reducing the spouse rebate and the family allowance. The Prime Minister has lost touch with middle Australia. He no longer has the interest of middle and low income Australians at heart. He is much more interested in strutting the international stage. Middle and low income earners see the Prime Minister as a man committed to promoting big government, keeping the big unions happy and trying to get on side with big business. Labor no longer represents middle Australia. It no longer represents the Australian family. It has lost touch with reality. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government has been in power for four years. As a result of its policies there are 55,000 more families with incomes under the poverty line. Interestingly enough, in a damning indictment of the Government's policies, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Blanchard), a member of the Government, yesterday proposed a motion calling on the Government to `pursue anti-poverty measures as a major priority of government programs'. His speech was a very clear and frank admission that the Government's policies have had a disastrous impact on Australian families and that its policies have failed to address the issue of poverty. The Prime Minister says that it is all the fault of international markets, but we know that the real cause is the Government's domestic economic policy. The Hawke Labor Government has massively increased the level of government spending, there has been a massive increase in taxes and charges, and there has been a massive increase in the deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to just one area which indicates the sorts of increases in Commonwealth government expenditure that this Government has undertaken-the area of health. In 1982-83 total Commonwealth expenditure was just over $4,400m. Expenditure this year will be just under $10,000m, an increases of nearly 225 per cent. The result of this extravagant spending spree was obvious and predictable. Australia has been hit by increased inflation, increased interest rates, higher unemployment and a dramatic slowdown in economic growth. The inflationary impact of Labor's wasteful and extravagant spending has been borne by Australian families. The cost of food has gone up by 28 per cent; transport by 30 per cent; recreation and education costs by 25 per cent. Heaven forbid if the family car packs up because if a person has to buy a new family car the cost has gone up by at least 50 per cent. The cost of a Ford Laser-hardly an extravagant purchase as far as cars go-has increased under Labor from $8,000 to $12,000. The Government's high interest rate policy has resulted in the average monthly repayment increasing by $152 a month, that is, from $508 to $660 a month. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policy on tax, both direct and indirect, has had a devastating impact on the family. The Government's income tax policy has meant that a single income family on average weekly earnings in March 1983 was paying $65 a week in pay as you earn income tax. That family is now paying $102 a week and will still pay $102 a week after the so-called tax cuts on 1 July. The capital gains tax and the removal of negative gearing have forced up rents for families. Of course, the families most affected are the ones who are unable to pay the high mortgage interest rates resulting from this Government's economic policies. Of course, tens of thousands of Australian families are unable to afford this higher cost of rental accommodation. They have been forced on to public housing waiting lists. Sixty thousand more Australian families are on public waiting lists than there were when the Hawke Government came to office. These increasing costs, taxes and charges have undermined family living standards. Families are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet. How often do we hear wage earners saying: `I am being paid fortnightly but I am having more and more trouble making my fortnightly wage stretch for two weeks'? Single income PAYE families are finding it especially difficult to make ends meet. They are finding it impossible to save. It is damned hard for them to ensure that they can afford to buy the essentials, let alone the luxuries. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NI4">Mr PORTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are indeed, as the honourable member says. The squeeze which this Government is applying to the family budget is not only having an economic impact on the family; it is tearing at the fabric of our society. Too many of our families with young children are faced with the economic consequences of being unable to maintain their standard of living on a single income. More and more mothers bringing up young children are being forced to return to the work force. Such a decision is no longer a matter of choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Parents are having to face unparalleled financial stress, worry and uncertainty. Too often children are suffering because of the increased tension at home and because too often mum is forced to return to the work force when she or her spouse would have preferred to remain at home caring for the children. Family life is the very backbone of our Australian community but it is quite clear that under this Government families do not receive the special assistance they deserve. They have not been treated with fairness and equity by this Government. Living standards of Australian families are declining under this Government, day by day. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government argues that the burden of the fall in living standards must be shared-but it is not. The heaviest burden is being carried by those least able to afford it; that is, families, especially families with young children. The Government's consideration of further reductions in the dependent spouse rebate and family allowances graphically illustrates the extent to which the Prime Minister and his Government have lost touch with the real needs of Australian families. The deep concerns being expressed by the Opposition about the impact on the family of government policies are widely held in the community. For example, the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association has issued a pamphlet entitled `SDA Fights for the Family'. This union clearly is concerned about the impact of government policies on the family. For example, in a section headed `Family Incomes Under Pressure' the SDA union says:</PARA>
<PARA> Single income families with dependent children are under financial pressure today as never before. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading `The Spouse Rebate' it says:</PARA>
<PARA> In his election speech in 1983, Bob Hawke promised a substantial increase in the spouse rebate. This promise has never been fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA>These comments on a Labor government are made by a union. Under `Family Allowances' the SDA says, after setting out a table of the impact of the Government's policy and inflation on family allowances:</PARA>
<PARA> The figures show that the larger the family, the greater has been its financial loss. </PARA>
<PARA> Low income families have suffered the most from the decline in the value of family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA>The pamphlet has a section headed `The Cost of Raising Children'. The SDA union says:</PARA>
<PARA> In Australia today, a large number of families with dependent children are living in or near poverty. </PARA>
<PARA>How right it is. Since this Government came to office, 55,000 more Australian families' incomes have dropped under the poverty line. Most interestingly, a section headed `The Plight of the Single Income Family' endorses everything the Opposition has been saying about single income families. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> This pressure-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the pressure on single income families-</PARA>
<PARA>has become so severe that many people have been forced into the work force as second income earners out of sheer economic necessity to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA> This places pressure on family relationships and has affected the ability of parents to raise their children in the way they prefer. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the union shares the Opposition's concern about the impact of Labor's policies on the family, especially on single income families with young children. Those people who are in a position to see the devastating impact of Labor's policies on the family are those who deal day to day with children-the teachers. They have also expressed deep concern about the future of the family. The Australian High School Principals Association, representing government high schools in Australia, has adopted a motion in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> That in view of the widespread and serious effects of family breakdown observable in schools and the community generally, the AHSPA urge the Commonwealth Government to develop and implement, as a matter of urgency, an effective policy in support of the family unit. </PARA>
<PARA>We strongly support the Australian High School Principals Association resolution. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NI4">Mr PORTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do, and we support the Association resolution. The creation of the family and community services portfolio by this Opposition highlights our commitment to the implementation of policies to encourage and support the family and promote its role in the continuing development of the Australian nation. The high school principals indicate that they believe the family is very worthy of institutional defence and support because of three major attributes. These are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1. Voluntary assumptions of obligations</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The motivation provided by natural affection through kinship</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The division of labour with regard to weaker members. </PARA>
<PARA>That is consistent with our own views. The Government not only is failing to address these economic issues but it is also guilty of attacking basic family values. Only last night in this House the Government introduced legislation to enable the Department of Social Security to pay married rate welfare benefits to under age de factos living in an illegal relationship. The payment of such a benefit not only is in conflict with State criminal laws, but also is in direct conflict with the age limits established by this Commonwealth Government under the Marriage Act. We brought that matter forward. We proposed an amendment to ensure that that not be allowed to come to pass. But this Government refused to accept that amendment. When we went to a division on the amendment the Government voted against us. It voted to maintain that part of the legislation; that is, it voted to maintain its ability to pay benefits to under age de factos. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only because of the heat of public pressure and public opinion that was put upon this Government that this afternoon at Question Time the Prime Minister announced that the Government would back down and accept our amendment. Why did the Government not accept the amendment last night? The Opposition will not stand by and allow this attack on family values and living standards of families to continue. Our policies will positively discriminate in favour of families. Tax and welfare policies will involve a co-ordinated approach to addressing the needs of the family and overcoming the burdens which this Government has placed on them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see that the honourable member for Mayo is now leaving the chamber. No doubt he was concerned that he was not referred to as part of the squattocracy, so he sought to interject. It is worth recording that for Hansard. However, this feigned concern will not go over with the ordinary Australian people. There is no doubt that the people of this country, when faced with difficulties and adversities, have always stuck with the Australian Labor Party and Labor governments during the various periods of our history have always acted in the best interests of the ordinary people. A Labor government is doing so at this stage in the nation's development and will continue to do so. There is no doubt that over the past four years the Labor Government has protected the standards of living of pensioners and defended the standards of living of ordinary Australians. Faced with considerable national adversity, the Government is to be commended and congratulated, not disparaged by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the reasons for the Opposition's raising this matter. One can have little doubt that the Liberal Party of Australia has been doing a bit of polling out there in the suburbs. It has found that when it asks questions such as: `Are you in favour of freedom, motherhood, democracy and the family?', it gets a big yes response. So what have we had this week? On three occasions when introducing matters of public importance the Opposition has moved motions about living standards and families. When I looked through Hansard today I noted this continuing theme and I was not at all surprised to hear the honourable member for Barker rendering the same speech again today as has been done on two other occasions this week. Those people who listen to the broadcasts of this Parliament will have picked that up and will not be at all surprised by my criticism that the honourable member's concern was completely feigned. The same series of statistics and essentially the same speech have been given in this House on three occasions this week. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting that the honourable member should mention the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association, a large union covering shop assistants and teachers. While the SDA has expressed some concern about ensuring that the living standards of its members are protected and, in the case of high school principals, that education continues to receive a fair proportion of the national cake, let me tell the honourable member this: When it comes to the next election he should make no mistake about the way in which shop assistants and teachers will vote. They will not vote for the party that is planning cuts of $14,000m in Federal Government spending, no sir. They will not vote for the Liberal Party. Neither will they vote for the National Party of Australia and the crazy policies that it proposes to implement under the pervasive influence of Bjelke-Petersen. No sir, those people will vote for the Australian Labor Party because they know that in this difficult period the ALP is the party that has introduced and followed through policies which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has described from time to time as showing restraint with equity. This is the party which, throughout history, has been called upon by the Australian people in times of national difficulty. Just as it is steering the nation through this difficult period at present in a competent and effective fashion, it will continue to do so and the Australian people will call on us to form the next government to continue that process. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note the way the nation is progressing at the moment and the statistics that have come to light in the past few days. One can see how the Government's policies are working and how we will get through this difficult period. One can see how we will be able to steer the nation to a period of continuing prosperity. As long as this Party maintains its position on the treasury bench, the Australian people need have no fear. The welfare of ordinary Australians will be the prime concern of the Government because that is the driving principle of the Labor Party and it always has been. We will not be in the position of honourable members opposite who must take account of the interests of their wealthy friends. No sir, that will not be the situation. Ordinary wage and salary earners, pensioners and the like can be assured that this Government will continue to look after them. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to look at a few of the things that this Government has done recently to ensure that we have restraint with equity, that we look after the ordinary people of this nation. I mentioned pensioners a moment ago. One only has to look at the fact that the age and other pensions are now at historically high levels-proportionately they are at 24.2 per cent of average weekly earnings. We are well on the way to achieving the Government's undertaking that pensions would increase to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. When I have moved around the electorate I have found that pensioners appreciate this. They realise that although the Government has had to deal with a difficult climate, it has protected the standards of living of pensioners. We introduced the indexation of pensions on a six-month basis and although there was a delay in the payment of that last year nothing has been lost in the longer term and pensioner's incomes have continued to increase to the point where they are at the historically high level of 24.2 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> In the near future wage earners in this country will be substantially better off as a result of the tax cuts which are being introduced. These will average $10 per wage earner and will be of considerable benefit to ordinary families. In addition, there is no greater step that a government can take to assist families than to provide jobs. This Government's record in that regard is second to none. This Government's record is in complete contrast to that of our predecessors, the Fraser-Howard regime. We have provided 750,000 jobs in the four years that we have occupied the treasury bench-an incredible record-and this contrasts quite extraordinarily with the 185,000 jobs that were lost in the last year that the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) occupied the office of Treasurer of this nation. A total of 185,000 jobs were lost in one year under the Fraser-Howard regime; under this Government 750,000 new jobs have been created in our four years in office. We have turned the whole situation around. We have led the nation from a period of steep decline to a period of modest growth which has ensured that as young people become eligible to enter the work force they have a reasonable chance of obtaining a job. We have reduced the amount of long term unemployment and certainly the amount of unemployment generally. As I have said, the Government's record in this area is second to none. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast again to the Opposition's attitude to wages, there has been some modest wage restraint under this Government. There has been a 6 per cent decrease in real terms recently. I contrast that with the Opposition's policy in this area which is quite extraordinary. In 18 of the last 20 national wage cases the Opposition has urged a wage freeze. It has wanted no increase at all. The result of that would have been that on average Australian wage earners would have been $106 worse off had the Liberal and National Party policies been adopted by the national wage case Bench. The ordinary Australian worker must be thankful that the Opposition's policies have not been implemented over the past four years. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want to talk about Australian families we need to define what we are talking about. Everybody is in favour of the family, but it does not simply mean the average family of a husband, wife and two children of some age or other. It can mean elderly married couples; it can mean young married couples; it can mean single parent families; it can mean those people described as double income, no children families which are known, I understand, as DINKs. It can include the extended family; it can include de facto families. A great range of people is covered by the word `family'. I suppose the best thing one can say about `family' is that it is best defined, like beauty, as being in the eye of the beholder. When we are talking about family I suspect that most people relate that term to their own families. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a very good record in providing benefits to families. I mention, for example, the first home owners scheme which has set up 230,000 households in the past four years. It has created 106,000 child care places throughout the nation since it came to government. That is a pretty incredible record and it is one of which the Government can be very proud. In relation to the aged at home-this is very interesting and it might interest many people listening to this broadcast-the Opposition has clearly indicated that it does not like the home and community care program which, I might remind the House, is designed to ensure in particular, amongst other things, that elderly people can continue to live in their homes until it is no longer possible for them to do so. It provides support and assistance so that they can stay in the family home as long as possible. We have provided $132m for these types of programs and this support in 1986-87. What has the Opposition done? What has the Opposition proposed? It is very interesting. It has clearly indicated by stating the $14 billion in expenditure cuts it would make if the disaster ever occurred that it got on to the treasury bench that this program would be for the chop. It would wipe out this program. Elderly people who at the moment are able to have home visits from nurses and various other specialists would no longer be able to receive subsidies for those types of benefits. That would be a disaster for those people. The Opposition should not be given the opportunity to endeavour to put those dreadful and dastardly polices into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by saying something about the matter on which the honourable member for Barker concluded his comments, and that is the treatment of under-aged de facto spouses. If ever I have seen a beat-up this has to be it. This issue, so-called, in my State of South Australia involves seven beneficiaries. Seven people are benefiting at the moment under arrangements by which they can obtain pensions or the unemployment benefit because they are under-age de facto spouses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since I have been representing the electorate of Grey in this House I doubt whether I have spoken in a debate on an issue which is of such fundamental importance for this country, or which typifies so many of our attitudes towards our country, our industries and Australia's position in the world, as the Ships (Capital Grants) Bill 1987. I also doubt whether an issue on the Government's agenda more graphically illustrates this Government's commitment to Labor principles for the development of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill represents the culmination of many years' work on the part of the parliamentary Labor Party, commencing in those seven years of opposition, when the present Minister for Transport (Mr Peter Morris) began drawing his blueprint for transport policy. This Bill represents a watershed for the Australian shipping industry. Never before has there been such an opportunity for a domestic industry, operated by Australians, employing Australians, for the benefit of Australians to grow and play the role to which it is entitled but which it has so far been denied. </PARA>
<PARA> As an Australian nothing aggravates me more than to see and hear within our society the expressed attitude that we Australians are not capable of looking after ourselves. We suffer a cultural cringe. We suffer a colonial cringe. We have an almighty inferiority complex. Almost daily within the Press we see expressions of opinion from foreigners and their local toadies on what we should and should not do. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the ironies are amazing. They apply equally to our shipping industry as to any other industry. We are told by the rich man's club, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on the European Economic Community how to manage our economy. The gnomes of Zurich pontificate about our economic health as they plan their next speculative raid on our dollar. Spokesmen from the most protected economies of the world tell us of the virtues of free trade and of the `science' of market forces and we believe them. So used have we become to this patronising drivel that we seem almost incapable of thinking for ourselves. With this Bill, though the rot has stopped-in part any way. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the makings of a strong shipping industry in this country. It is not very big but it is reasonably healthy and, by world standards, it is becoming healthier. It is, however, an indictment on all of us that our shipping industry should be as small as it is. Let us look, for example, at our coal trades. We are the largest exporting coal nation but, of the 90 million tonnes we exported in 1985-86, Australian flagships carried only an abysmal 1.2 per cent. How pathetic!</PARA>
<PARA> We Australians are almost totally dependent on overseas owned or controlled shipping. In 1985-86 Australian flagships carried in total less than 4 per cent of our trade. In freight revenue terms in 1984-85 Australian operators earned less than $900m of the total $6,700m generated by the shipment of Australia's imports and exports. </PARA>
<PARA> How has this come about? Why can we not carry more Australian trade in Australian ships? The history book tells us many of the answers. The genesis of our Australian merchant navy began in 1914, when 26 enemy vessels in our near Australian waters were seized and put into service for national purposes. To these were added 15 cargo ships bought by Prime Minister Billy Hughes in 1916-with much public outcry. The great irony of course is that it was Hughes, the greatest sycophant of all time, who committed us to fight the English battles under English command yet struck a mighty blow for Australia in building a fleet which could survive the greedy hand of the British shipping combines who had, since the days of the First Fleet, grown very fat on the proceeds of their monopoly of Australian trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefits to the Australian economy were immense. The line made a healthy profit and substantially undercut the conferences to the advantage particularly of Australian farmers. So the Commonwealth line prospered and added to its fleet in 1919 five passenger lines which plied the English trade and eventually gave great service in World War II. </PARA>
<PARA> The line continued to be profitable; it continued to provide freight savings to Australian producers and, accordingly, made a massive contribution to the balance of trade on invisibles. In 1929, though, after 6 1/2 years of Country Party dominated conservative government, effectively the Commonwealth line had been dismantled. It had been killed off by the combined assault of British ship owners, working with the full support of Australian political saboteurs on the conservative side. We had surrendered. From that day we have never regained our position. Our own Australian National Line is but a shadow of its predecessor, and although it might wish to do so, it cannot challenge the strength of foreign ship owner cartels. It can survive only by being part of them and, although it might attempt to keep them honest, it is too small to carry much weight in the general line of trade. </PARA>
<PARA> That was our legacy on coming to government in 1983. We found that ANL was virtually bankrupt. The history of conservative government and management shows us why that was so. Those attitudes are still there. While it is pleasing to note the grudging support for the Bill given by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), behind him we know that there is a whole band of dries and saboteurs who would allow our shipping industry, now being reborn, to be sold off to the advantage of foreigners. His colleague Senator Hamer, for example, still has on the Notice Paper a private member's Bill to abolish the exclusive right of Australian ships to trade the Australian coast. What is left of that industry, anyway? One might ask where such a policy stops. No doubt the senator and his supporters would be equally happy for every other Australian industry to be opened up to foreign labour. Why is the shipping industry any different? The answer is obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hamer and his supporters are not alone, of course. All foreign operators and owners are watching, no doubt very closely. The bureaucracy in Canberra, too, would have a warm inner glow. I suspect, though, that their record will never be revealed. However, we do know that the ivory tower theorists, breathing the rarefied air of Canberra, are none too keen on the Australian shipping industry. As with all government business enterprises, they persist in running them down, in depriving them of capital and milking their profits. So, too, will they try to run down our shipping industry. No doubt honourable members opposite will recall from their own experience in government the difficulties that they had in managing public business enterprises. The honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee), for example, mentioned the other night on `Carwash' his own experience with the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. As the saying goes, governments may come and go but the bureaucracy goes on forever. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all this, we have stood by our policy. We want to see more Australian cargo carried on Australian ships. We believe that Australian flag shipping can compete internationally and can be reliable, despite the difficult market situation that it faces globally. We want to see stronger support for our shipping industry by Australian exporters. For too long Australian shipping has been used as a scapegoat for shortcomings in our trade and marketing arrangements. After we have mined, grown or manufactured our exports, we have found it too easy to leave others to manage, and profit from, our export shipping. We have turned our backs on an enormous deficit in trade and services. Why cannot Australian shipping be treated as an export commodity itself? When shipping and related costs are such a large component of export costs, why should we not try ourselves to do something about it?</PARA>
<PARA> Again citing coal, I remind the House that in 1985-86 Australian ships carried a miserable 1.2 per cent of our total coal exports. Foreigners carried the rest. Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd has shown, though, that with modern tonnage and the benefits available from our revitalised shipping policies, we can do it. This year, with the three new BHP vessels-the Iron Kembla, the Iron Newcastle and the Iron Pacific-the figure of 1.2 per cent will double. We all know about our foreign debt, we all know that the imbalance is not just in trade and goods. The debt that we are incurring on shipping costs continues to increase. In 1985-86 it had reached $2,400m. Every dollar of this debt that we can save is worth while. These gains can be made, and that is why we must grasp the golden opportunity presented by this Bill. It has been a long time since we have had a chance to mend our ways. The industry, the unions and the Government have developed a package which is an absolute breakthrough. To all those who sling mud at the workers in Australia, let me say that I take off my hat to the seagoing unions. They have bitten the bullet; they know that to survive our ships have to be efficient. They know that modern technology means fewer jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated in the Minister's second reading speech, the Maritime Industry Development Committee has played a leading and crucial role in developing the framework for revitalising the Australian merchant fleet. Leaders of the five seagoing unions-the Seamens Union of Australia, the Merchant Service Guild of Australia, the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers, the Professional Radio and Electronics Institute of Australasia and the Federated Marine Stewards and Pantrymens Association of Australasia-have taken a constructive, responsible and realistic attitude during MIDC discussions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week I visited two primary schools in my electorate and saw two particularly effective and fine activities. At Flynn Primary School I was introduced to the reading recovery program, which is a new program begun in Australian Capital Territory schools last year. The aim of the program is to help children who are having difficulty with the early stages of learning to read, and to sort out those difficulties so that they quickly begin to cope with reading before it has become an intellectual or psychological problem for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the majority of children, a good classroom program is adequate to get them started in reading and writing. However, children differ widely and in any school system, regardless of the teaching methods used, a small proportion of children do not make satisfactory progress. The reading recovery program aims to enable these children to catch up with their age mates, so that they are able to cope well in the classroom. Children receive daily individual teaching in addition to their classroom instruction. They have a wide range of problems with learning, so especially trained teachers select from a range of techniques ones that are suitable for a particular child. Most children make rapid progress with this daily support and are able to reach the average reading skill of their age within three to five months. </PARA>
<PARA> At Flynn Primary it was a delight to see the individual care of the teacher and the response of children to this individual attention and encouragement. I was impressed to see the attentiveness of the teacher to every aspect of the skill of reading and the care with which the children were encouraged to address each difficulty as it occurred. For many children this program will be sufficient to ensure that they are able to progress to thoroughly competent reading and writing skills for the rest of their lives. Such a program is invaluable. It is a preventive program. A long delay in achieving success with reading carries high risks of emotional and intellectual underdevelopment. A child who gets further and further out of step with the class in which he or she is a member, loses his or her opportunity to learn effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The reading recovery program was developed in New Zealand by Professor Marie Clay, and research carried out there supports the claim that children who have participated in this early individualised program are still maintaining their progress four years later. Two Australian Capital Territory teachers, Margaret Clough and Margaret Olding, studied with Professor Clay at Auckland University during 1985 and are currently providing on the job training for the second intake of reading recovery teachers in the Australian Capital Territory. I would like to congratulate them and all the other teachers participating in this program for the imagination and effectiveness of reading recovery. The program is obviously expensive because a one-to-one teacher-pupil activity, even though it is only for half an hour at a time, is a high investment of teacher time. But it is clearly cost effective if the great majority of those students who go through the program are from then on able to improve their reading skills at the same rate as their peers. Competence in reading is one of the most central skills with which students must leave school, yet a proportion of students, sometimes estimated to be as high as 10 per cent, never completely master reading and writing. If this reading recovery program substantially reduces that proportion to one or 2 per cent, it will clearly be particularly cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA> The other primary school I visited last week was at Cook, where a peace park was being opened on the day before Anzac Day. The impressive aspects of this opening were that the park had been thought of by the students themselves; much of the money to pay for the preparation of the park had been raised by them, supported by a $400 International Year of Peace grant; and the quality of the opening itself. During the opening, probably a dozen Year 6 students participated, and showed that they had reflected carefully on the nature of peace. They clearly recognised that peace was more than the absence of war and that it involved personal peace, peace within the family and peace within our own community. </PARA>
<PARA> There was reflection on both the courage of the people who had defended Australia in the First and Second World Wars and, as well, a strong emphasis on the contribution which everyone can make to reducing conflict in the future. The Principal, Jan Laut, and the teacher responsible, Connie Owen, and all the children who were involved are to be warmly congratulated on this fine celebration. </PARA>
<PARA> These are just two striking examples of the high quality, creativity and intelligent compassion being demonstrated in the education provided through the Australian Capital Territory school system. I would like to put on record my whole-hearted congratulations of not only the teachers involved in these two programs but also all the others who are providing such a fine service to the children of Canberra. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today is 1 May, or May Day. May Day as we know it today has its origins in the industrial cities of nineteenth century America. In 1884 a conference of United States and Canadian trade unions set 1 May 1886 as the day on which to commence strike action in pursuit of their goal for an eight-hour working day. At that time many workers were working as much as 15 or 18 hours a day-from sunrise to sunset.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia, by comparison, we already had the eight-hour working day. This right had been won as early as 1855 by the Operative Stonemasons Society in Sydney, and soon afterwards by similar building trades unions in Melbourne and Sydney. The right was not easily won. It came as a result of strike action and processions, followed by negotiation. Indeed, I might add that, in the entire history of industrial relations, only very rarely have important rights been won by workers through negotiation where that negotiation was not first preceded by some demonstration of worker strength and unity of purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members might be interested in the words of the slogan used by the stonemasons in their struggle for the eight-hour day. It was:</PARA>
<PARA> Eight hours to work, eight hours to play, eight hours to sleep, and eight bob a day. </PARA>
<PARA>This slogan became the basis of the American trade unions' call for a just working day when they took up the fight towards the end of the nineteenth century. The main centre of the North American struggle was the industrial city of Chicago. Here too the struggle was not easily won. On that first industrial workers' May Day in 1886, 25,000 workers took to the streets in that city. Employers and government were alarmed and called out the police. On 3 May the police attacked a meeting of striking workers outside the McCormick reaper works. Six workers were killed and many wounded. The following day another four workers and seven policemen were killed in Chicago's Haymarket Square. Eventually four labour leaders were arrested, tried and hanged. They became the unions' martyred dead and symbols of the struggle. </PARA>
<PARA> The custom of holding workers' demonstrations and celebrations on May Day quickly spread from America to Europe and Australia. May Day was first celebrated by Australian workers at Barcaldine in Queensland in 1891. The early 1890s were years of struggle between unions, who were determined to hang on to their hard won rights, and many employers who spoke openly of their determination to crush the unions, or else replace them with tame ones. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1891 the focus of this conflict shifted to Queensland. Is it not fascinating how history has a habit of repeating itself? In Queensland, the squatters were preparing to break the Shearers Union by bringing in non-union labour from the south. The Queensland Government sent out police and armed troops. The shearers were arrested and gaoled. In Brisbane at that same time, mindful that shearers were marching in the face of the troopers' guns, Henry Lawson was writing `Freedom On the Wallaby', with its famous lines:</PARA>
<PARA> So we must fly a rebel flag</PARA>
<PARA> As others did before us, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Sadly, the shearers' struggle was lost on that occasion and their leaders were gaoled. But the struggle for unionism and better working conditions has continued. Today Australian workers face many of the same problems as those faced by the shearers of nineteenth century Queensland. There are many persons, employers and organisations-not the least being the Premier of Queensland and his Government-who would seek to cripple the union movement and to replace unionists with scab labour. This is not the way ahead. This is a recipe for industrial disaster. There is another way to go, and I can say with some pride that there are workers and trade unionists in the Wollongong and Illawarra area who are showing the way. This way is based on greater worker and union participation in industry. Industrial relations today must be viewed within the context of today's world. The ways of the New Right and the Premier of Queensland are the ways of last century. It is time they were forsaken forever. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude on a note of warning to those antiquarians who refuse to move out of the nineteenth century and learn their lessons from history. What the workers of the world are celebrating today, and on each and every May Day, is their strength, their unity of purpose and their firm resolve to struggle in the face of persecution and adversity. Time and again they have proved that they can be pushed just so far, and no further. They are marching today to celebrate just this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have expressed my concern on a number of occasions in this House about the political problems created by the nuclear industry, in particular the problem of radioactive waste management. In the second edition of the radioactive waste and nuclear accidents report, produced in my office in January of this year by Chas Collinson and myself, it is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> ALP policy must recognise that storage of all categories of nuclear waste will be a continuing problem for all future life forms on earth. It must be recognised that there is currently no operational solution as to how to ultimately and safely dispose of high level waste. It must also be recognised that Australia cannot absolve itself from the high level waste problem merely because we do not have our nuclear power plants. </PARA>
<PARA>In this respect a report contained in the February-April 1987 edition of the Institute of Trading Standards publication is most disturbing. A Mitsubishi chemical factory known as the Asian Rare Earth factory in Bukit Merah, Malaysia, has been dumping radioactive waste in many public places in the Bukit Merah area. Not only was the thoria waste dumped in places such as adjacent to public footpaths, but a truck driver was told to dump the wastes in any place he could find. There is also the far worse charge that the waste was sold to farmers to use as fertilisers for food crops. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Dr Sadao Ichikawa, a Japanese expert in genetics, radiation and agriculture, measured the wastes and found that dangerously high levels of radiation existed in a number of the dump sites, including abandoned dump trucks and the temporary storage site at the ARE factory. At one point outside the factory wall he detected a radiation level 150 to 160 times higher than the average natural background level and almost three times above the safe standard for workers set by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Professor Ichikawa pointed out that thoron gas as produced at the ARE factory is unlike any other radioactive gases as it is heavy and it stays at ground level. It will cause lung and skin cancers, leukaemia, birth defects and other ailments. Even more serious is that Mitsubishi Chemicals attempted to influence Professor Ichikawa not to release the results of his radiation measurements. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> He claimed that two Mitsubishi officials met him and the Dean of his factory at Saitama University, Japan, following his return from Bukit Merah in December 1984 to ask him about the readings he took. </PARA>
<PARA> When Professor Ichikawa told the officials that the readings were high, he was requested not to publish them. </PARA>
<PARA>It is reported that Professor Ichikawa said: `But I refused'. The report went on, quoting the professor:</PARA>
<PARA> `They went on to suggest that if I could co-operate with Mitsubishi, then Mitsubishi would provide an extra 10 million yen as grant for the on-going research that the faculty and Mitsubishi was jointly undertaking.'</PARA>
<PARA> However, Professor Ichikawa declined the offer. </PARA>
<PARA>`Mitsubishi should not pollute Bukit Merah with thoria wastes from ARE. Instead, it should send the waste back and store them at its old mines in Japan,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>In the same issue of the Institute of Trading Standards publication there is a Malaysian report about the warnings from a nuclear scientist in relation to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster who is familiar with the testing of food contaminated with radioactivity. I quote the professor again:</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, milk and agricultural products in European countries are bound to be contaminated . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Even if the radioactivity is low and thus the products enter Malaysia, I don't think they are safe because radioactivity accumulates in the body. </PARA>
<PARA> If we continue taking contaminated products, then after some years the adverse health effects may show up. </PARA>
<PARA>Taiwan, Singapore and the Philippines have contamination due to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in canned milk products from Europe because of the high radioactivity. In this respect I wish to mention a particularly relevant comment in the radioactive waste report issued by my office. It states;</PARA>
<PARA> The February 1986 edition of the magazine Soviet Life quoted the Ukranian Minister of Power as saying that the safety precautions at Soviet Nuclear Power Plants were so strict that `the odds of a meltdown are one in 10,000 years'. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact of the matter is that we can no longer trust the scientists and politicians to tell us that it is safe. The Chernobyl disaster highlights and confirms some of the important points that anti-nuclear activists have argued over the years. This disaster dispels the myth that nuclear power stations are safe. Accidents, whether they be caused by operator, designer fault, or the nuclear process itself, will happen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also remind honourable members of the disaster which occurred at Chernobyl a year ago. In fact, on 1 May, a year ago today, I spoke in the House about the disaster of which we had just had the earliest reports. At that stage it was very hard to tell how bad the disaster was. I certainly said that it probably had the dimensions of the disaster forecast for the last 20 years. A year later we can assess some of the dimensions of that disaster. I also said a year ago that whatever details we had and no matter how sketchy those details were, what was certain was that the scope and consequences of this accident would become clearer only as the weeks, the months and the years went by.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us go back to what happened only the day after I made that statement. By 2 May the radioactive cloud spreading across Europe from Chernobyl had reached Britain 3,200 kilometres away. By 6 May Moscow said that the reactor was almost resealed, only to warn two days later that the resealed reactor was overheating and threatening a core meltdown. It was not until 15 May that Mikhail Gorbachev broke his silence finally and said: `The worst is behind us'. But what was still to come? A year later, we have an opportunity to assess some of the damage. My colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton) has talked about radioactivity in products throughout Europe, particularly in milk. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give some other facts that we know about Chernobyl. Chernobyl emitted more long term radiation into the air, water and soil than has been produced by the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan and all the atmospheric nuclear tests conducted since then. It caused the deaths of 31 people, exposed many others to serious doses of radiation, forced the evacuation of 135,000 people and left a 30-kilometre wide dead zone around the site. It cost the Soviet Union-and this is only so far-billions of roubles, and led to a notional 2,000 extra deaths from cancer in the next generation-1,000 of them in the 12 countries of the European Community with West Germany, Italy and Greece the worse affected. Three times as many people will contract non-fatal cancers. </PARA>
<PARA> What of other projections? An American surgeon, Dr Robert Gale, who went to Chernobyl in the wake of the disaster, had warned of a cancer death toll of 75,000 in the years to come. The Russians themselves now talk optimistically-I stress the word `optimistically'-of between 200 to 600 people who are expected to die from excessive radiation doses in the next 40 years. Quite apart from the horrendous effect of this disaster on human health, we have to consider some of the implications for the industry itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The No. 4 reactor at Chernobyl now lies encased in 400,000 tonnes of concrete and 7,000 tonnes of steel reinforcement. That is the sort of condition that will have to apply to every nuclear reactor, whether or not there has been an accident, because they all have to be decommissioned. The Chernobyl tomb, which is 6 storeys high and designed to prevent the leak of any further radiation, could yet prove the prototype of similar tombs for other reactors, including Britain's Magnox power stations due to reach the end of their planned life in the 1990s. This sort of precaution will have to be taken until the world ends because we now have nuclear power. </PARA>
<PARA> What are some of the Russian scientists saying? For Vladimir Gurbaryev, the science editor of Pravda, Chernobyl was a case of real life horror overtaking and overwhelming scientific complacency. He has referred to the accident at Chernobyl as one which scientists had said for years could not happen. Another Soviet expert, the renowned physicist Yevgeny Velikhov, who flew to the area the day after the explosion, and who is widely credited with having brought order to the chaos that surrounded the scene, is probably one of his country's most influential scientists and is now one of the group of Soviets profoundly alarmed by the implications of the Chernobyl explosion. The world is alarmed at the implications of that explosion. As I said a year ago today in this House, it is time that everyone involved in the nuclear power industry-and that includes us-must question the involvement in that industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to Fraser. The composition of the Ministry could very well have come from the nineteenth century; yet we are only a decade and a quarter away from the twenty-first century. Being non-partisan on this issue let me, in fairness, refer to the previous Liberal-National Party Government. In its ministries the overwhelming numbers were held by two groups-farmers and lawyers. An unkind person might observe that a government of farmers and lawyers might better belong to the eighteenth century, but I would not, of course, lend my support to that observation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I believe that this briefest look at the composition of both ministries in terms of occupational and professional background is a cause of some concern for the future of this country. There is obviously something wrong with the preselection machinery in both parties, and there is obviously something just as seriously wrong with the attitude of many of our occupational groups and professions in their members' failure to pursue parliamentary careers. Parliament has been dominated for many years by trade union and party officials, teachers, farmers and lawyers-so much so that when this Government created a ministry of science it had to appoint to that portfolio a man who was formerly a teacher and a lawyer. The Minister in charge of technology is a former solicitor, the Minister for Health (Dr Blewett) is a former teacher of politics, and so the list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot govern properly because we do not have the people; the pool of talent. We are desperate for exports to improve our balance of trade, but where are the exporters in the Parliament or in the Ministry? Where are the biological scientists, the electronics engineers, the tourist entrepreneurs, the urban planners, the nursing sisters, the transport industry executives and, indeed, the fashion industry designers? Of course lawyers, farmers, union officials and teachers have their place in this Parliament. Some of our finest parliamentarians at present are from those professions and they have made a significant contribution to the progress of our country. However, to confront and conquer our present and future problems, whether they be economic, industrial, cultural, or in defence and foreign policies, we must attract a wider expertise and a greater pool of talent into our Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very good. What I will do on this occasion is identify some of the very special friends of the Queensland Premier, some of the knights of the realm, the pillars of society on whom the Premier has endowed this title. The first one is Sir Roderick Proctor, who was knighted in 1978 for `distinguished and dedicated service to the business community and to the people of Queensland', a very familiar citation. In 1982 his company won the contract for the Gold Coast Jupiter Casino. The next is Sir Leslie Thiess, who is the head of Drayton Investments Pty Ltd which won the contract for the Townsville Casino. He upset Proctor when it was discovered that the tax on his casino would be 10 per cent of revenue, only half of that being paid by Jupiter. Sir Wallace Rae, former Country Party Minister and Agent-General for Queensland in London until 1985, was a director of Jojoba Management Ltd, which went into liquidation owing 3,000 investors up to $10m. Sir Justin Hickey, a staunch supporter of the National Party, admitted in 1982 that he was knighted after he had donated $100,000 towards a nursing home in Sir Joh's electorate of Barambah. Sir Edward Lyons, a very good friend of the Premier, was forced to resign as chairman of the Totalisator Administration Board in 1985, following allegations of betting irregularities. It was also claimed that when Sir Edward was chairman of the TAB it invested $6.5m in Rothwells Ltd, a company chaired by Sir Edward. Sir Edward was the driving force behind the establishment of the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation in 1979 to raise $2.5m for the National Party. In his letter to businessmen seeking donations he wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Your contribution should be viewed . . . as a sound and very essential investment in the protection of your commercial future. </PARA>
<PARA>Needless to say, in the face of such an admonition, the money rolled in. Sir Terence Lewis became the first Australian policeman still in service to be knighted. An earlier effort by the Government to have him knighted was knocked back by Buckingham Palace. Sir Joh also ensured that Lewis was promoted to Commissioner over the heads of 16 officers of higher rank. Sir Frank Moore-I do not know whether he is related to our John-Sir Joh's `tremendous friend', is the Chairman of the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation. The Corporation awarded a $130m tourist project to Pioneer River Developments with which Sir Frank was associated. Sir James Foots, former chief of Mount Isa Mines, is a director of National Free Enterprises which gave $300,000 to the National Party for the 1984 Federal election. In 1984 he was the controversial appointment as Chancellor of the University of Queensland. Sir Thomas Covacevich was one of three commissioners appointed in 1985 to redraw Queensland's electoral boundaries. They cut Aboriginal communities out of marginal National Party electorates near Cairns and placed them in safe Labor seats. He refused to comment on a claim made in the Queensland Parliament that he was another fund raiser for the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation. Sir Harold Behan is the father of Michael, the National Party's northern organiser, who received the $145,000 loan forced through by the Queensland Government but opposed by the State Agricultural Bank. To top them all, Graham McCawley rescued Joh's son John in 1985 when he was lost and injured after falling off his motor bike during mustering. In 1986, the following year, Graham McCawley was knighted and became Sir Graham. </PARA>

Madam Speaker, could you please tell me and everybody else in this chamber how a member can, in all good conscience, stand in this place, just list names, link them to the Premier of Queensland and by that linkage alone conclude there is an act of impropriety or that they are unworthy of the Queen's award? It is sickening to my stomach to hear that sort of allegation made. If the honourable member for Charlton has serious allegations to make against anybody whom the law cannot take remedy against, it is his duty to bring it before this place; but he has not done that, he has simply listed names with gay abandon. I, for one, believe that the most important principle of this place has been breached; that is, one does not needlessly, without just and proper cause, bring somebody's name into this place, the very action of which is a slur on his character, a slur that he has almost no remedy against.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where are the alleged charges of improper or wrong conduct? The Police Commissioner was one name the honourable member for Charlton mentioned. Sir Terence Lewis has a distinguished record as a Police Commissioner. In my work on the National Crime Authority I know for a fact that he is highly regarded amongst the police forces of this country. I would like to know where are the allegations against him? There were too many names for me to have copied down. He mentioned Sir Roderick Proctor, Sir Leslie Thiess, Sir Wallace Rae and Sir Edward Lyons. What acts of impropriety are being alleged other than that they know and support the Premier of Queensland? All those men have distinguished records in their respective fields; all of them have made a contribution to the community. In many ways, if the honourable member for Charlton does not know of them, he certainly would not have the honesty to acknowledge them. Does any member on this side criticise the annual Queen's Birthday awards, major trade union officials or card carrying members of the Labor when they are made by the Australian Labor Party Government? Of course not. The mere fact that somebody supports the government of the day does not disqualify him from proper recognition of his community, industrial or trade union contributions made over so long. I, more than anybody else, am disappointed in the honourable member for Charlton. Credibility in this place matters. The honourable member for Charlton has always held the respect of most members on this side of the House because he is recognised as having credibility. He has shot that to pieces, irrecoverably in my judgment, if in no one else's, forever today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have detailed them. The honourable member asks me what they are. The honourable member should read the Hansard. I will now proceed with item 26, so he should listen and contain himself. He may be interested in what I have to say. I want to draw attention to some of the more spectacular environmental issues in which Sir Joh Bjelke- Petersen has been involved. Firstly, he supported sandmining in the Cooloola dunes north of Noosa. He lost this argument in the 1970s and almost lost the leadership of the Government because of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Cooloola beaches issue was followed by Joh's plan to allow the mining of Fraser Island. The Fraser Government-a conservative coalition government-thwarted his plan by refusing to grant export licences for the sand-mining minerals. Fraser Island is recognised as unique. This was another major environmental issue of the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Joh's support in 1986 for the revocation of the national park's reservation on Lindeman Island was neutralised when the developer-East-West Airlines Ltd-withdrew its application in the face of public opposition. His support for mining exploration in the Great Barrier Reef was defeated by public pressure which saw the Federal Government assume control of the reef waters for the marine park. Unfortunately, the Queensland Government was able to retain control of the reef islands. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government forced a road through the Daintree forest in far north Queensland. It supported and funded the local Douglas Shire Council to bulldoze the road and rejected efforts by the Hawke Government to provide alternatives. The road is largely impassable and is now eroding into the waters of the barrier reef islands. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Joh also allowed the heavy logging of the Mount Windsor plateau rainforest near Cairns and the Downey Creek rainforest near Innisfail. In early 1987 the Queensland Government demanded that a Japanese company be allowed to mine the Shelburne Bay sand-hills near the tip of Cape York Peninsula for silica. The dunes are one of the natural wonders of Australia. It is estimated that only 13 jobs would be provided and that the mining would earn only $50,000 a year in royalties for the Queensland Government. In early 1987 the Queensland Government proposed to sell some of the barrier reef resort islands to private developers. The Hawke Government declared that it would do all in its powers to protect the islands and the reef. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the outburst of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), it is fortunate that we have, at the Commonwealth level at present the Hawke Government, which is prepared to stand up when it is necessary and to prevent the destruction of some of these great and magnificent beaches, parts of Australia's natural scenery and environment. If the honourable member for Gippsland wants to defend the abuses and misuses of power which have taken place in Queensland, let him now repeat what he said and again place it on the record. I was very interested to hear what he had to say. He is one of the new and younger members of the National Party of Australia for whom we held out much hope. His outburst today, his pouring of vitriol on me, occurred when I was simply detailing substantiated and well documented events of the Queensland political scene at present and it reflects very little credit on him. We are disappointed in him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter the closing stages of this debate on a Friday afternoon to make some comments in relation to the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) in particular and the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). It has been quite obvious from Press coverage over the last few weeks that the honourable member for Gippsland has found himself in an invidious position with the National Party of Australia. He has gone out on a limb and supported the present temporary Leader of the National Party, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). It is quite obvious that the honourable member has received a few phone calls from his area in Gippsland and that he is now trying desperately, in the late hours of the adjournment debate on a Friday, to put in a few words on behalf of Sir Joh Bjelke-Peterson in order to try to get back on side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will just give the House and the public some idea of how far the honourable member is prepared to go in order to do this. Last night he appeared on local television-Channel 8 in Gippsland. He stood in all his splendour being interviewed by the local interviewer and he declared that he will vote against his own Party to block the legislation on the aggregation of television that is before the Parliament. He will vote against his own Party. He knows that on Channel 8 in Traralgon, back in his own little area, he has told the world that he will vote against his own party on this legislation, knowing full well that the dogs are barking in the National Party of Australia, that the new leader that he is not supporting is pulling the strings from Queensland and has said that the legislation will go through. So the mighty honourable member for Gippsland can bravely go on television back in my part of the world, in his own electorate, stand up before the people of his electorate and say: `I will vote against this legislation'. But, then again, he will be resting his case on the fact that when it gets to the Senate the new leader, who is speaking for the National Party of Australia from outside, and the group of faceless men of the white shoe brigade have made their decision in relation to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> So the honourable member for Gippsland has got himself into a very nasty corner. He backed the wrong horse, and that horse ran right off the rails. We have had the invidious position in this House for the past two days of having an official Opposition which has not even had an official spokesperson on primary industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has been announced this afternoon. It has taken the Opposition a long time to decide who is representing it on primary industry. There was a question that had to be asked in this Parliament today-a question of crucial importance to the wheat industry, to primary industry in Australia. It was a question about four million tonnes of wheat being sold to Russia by the United States of America. We sat here and thought that we would give the Opposition an opportunity. We are still waiting to see which members of the Opposition will go on the delegation to the United States. They are squabbling over that as well, but I am sure that they will eventually straighten out who is going to go. We thought that there may have been a question, but then we realised that we have had two days without an Opposition spokesperson on primary industry. The Opposition is so divided and in such a mess that an issue as crucial as this did not even rate a mention in the thinking of members opposite. In Question Time today they were asking about some poor unfortunate lady who has been fined by the Commissioner of Taxation, and trying to raise issues concerning the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Important issues have been ignored. The Opposition was not even in control to the point where it had a spokesperson on primary industry. How are the honourable member for Gippsland, the right honourable member for New England and members of the Liberal Party going to go out into their constituencies and say that they think that primary industry is important, when for the past two days the Opposition parties have not been able to raise a spokesperson between them? Now where are we? I am told that the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) is now the Opposition spokesperson on primary industry. Strangely, it looks like the right honourable member for New England may yet have to sit on the seat.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is good to see the Opposition Whip over there. I point out that the National Party of Australia is still running the Opposition, even though the National Party is a minority party and it is not supposed to be any part of Her Majesty's Opposition any more. We have only to look at the vote taken in the Senate on the regional television legislation, the Broadcasting Amendment Bill, where they did not support the people they purport to represent. So the National Party is still running the show in the Senate. Also they did not call for a division on the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Bill, as was the case here.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr Peter Morris</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) Data supplied by international airlines to the Department of Aviation, and data collected by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs from information provided on incoming and outgoing passenger cards and compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics; (b) The ABS; (c) The Department of Aviation and the ABS.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Department of Aviation has no involvement in the collection and collation of statistics compiled by the ABS.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Both.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Data supplied by the ABS include point of origin of air passenger journeys; data are also compiled from uplifts (and discharges) supplied by the airlines, consistent with the Department's other scheduled passenger collections, detailing, by direction, the initial point of uplift (and final destination) of the revenue traffic by flight number.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Figures used by my Department do indicate end to end traffic.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Proposals for both scheduled and charter international passenger and freight services are continually being received and evaluated by the Department of Aviation.</PARA>
<PARA> Applications for charter flights generally are processed quickly and there are never large numbers of outstanding requests at any one time. Proposals for additional scheduled services by overseas airlines which already fly to Australia come before the Government from time to time and are negotiated with the authorities of the countries concerned in accordance with our bilateral air service arrangements. Such proposals for increases in scheduled capacity, and requests for the introduction of new scheduled services, are examined on the basis of end-to-end traffic.</PARA>
<PARA> Charter applications are considered on their individual merits. Inbound tourism to Australia is of special interest and tourist charters which are compatible with the Government's objective of promoting the development and maintenance of scheduled services can expect favourable consideration. Sympathetic consideration may also be given to programs of charters designed to test and develop routes on which end-to-end traffic levels are not sufficient to support scheduled services. Proposed flights may not be of a nature and of such regularity as to assume the characteristics of scheduled services.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Since April 1986 requests have been received from a number of Governments for the introduction of direct scheduled services. Requests from Poland, the Republic of Korea, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and the Seychelles for direct air services have been declined on the grounds that there is insufficient end-to-end traffic travelling between the countries concerned and Australia to support commercially viable scheduled services. Conclusions were based on ABS statistics. The Governments of Sri Lanka, Mauritius and the Seychelles were advised that programs of charters would be approved in the interests of developing traffic levels. The Seychelles have taken up this offer and are operating charter flights. Air Mauritius also operated a number of charter flights over the Christmas/New Year period.</PARA>
<PARA> Since April 1986, of the 55 applications for various types of charters, including programs, that have been received, only one has been refused. An application to operate a series of charters between the USA and Australia was not agreed on the grounds that the proposal entailed de facto scheduled services. Rejection was not based on traffic flow figures.</PARA>
<PARA> Two other charter applications during this period were approved for carriage of passengers but not cargo, since cargo space was available on the scheduled carriers at that time. One of these charters was by MAS from Adelaide to Penang in August 1986 and the other was a Singapore Airlines inclusive tour charter program in January/February 1987 between Darwin and Singapore.</PARA>

In 1986 the Council received a special allocation of $210,000 from the Department of Foreign Affairs for grants for arts activities to mark the International Year of Peace. This was a one-off program of assistance and funding for the sculpture by the Visual Arts Board did not invalidate the group's eligibility for seeking additional funds from this source.</PARA>
<PARA> When the Australia Council assessed the group's application under the International Year of Peace program it sought the advice of the Visual Arts Board. The Council was therefore aware of the initial grant provided by the Visual Arts Board. On the basis of a favourable recommendation the Council decided on 12 March 1986, to provide a further grant of $14,000 under the International Year of Peace grants category.</PARA>
<PARA> Both the Visual Arts Board and the Council were advised of the significance of the project by letters of support from local organisations. The Doncaster and Templestowe Council contributed an estimated $10,000 in kind including the site for the sculpture, installation and unveiling costs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr Dawkins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Latest advice from institutions indicates that 388,352 students will be required to pay the charge. An estimated 110,300 students in receipt of an allowance under AUSTUDY, Postgraduate Awards and Abstudy schemes will receive a supplementary payment of $250 to cover the cost of the charge. A further estimated 13,600 overseas students will have had their Overseas Student Charge reduced by $250 on account of the administration charge.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Exemptions are now estimated by institutions at 15,268 comprising 7798 pensioner/beneficiaries; 3151 scholarship students; 2690 students attending other institutions; 1629 full fee-paying overseas students.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The estimated average cost per equivalent full-time student for higher education is $9,500 per annum; this figure includes a component for the investment in buildings and equipment at universities and CAEs.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. The charge is an administrative one and is not related to the costs of teaching a particular course. Every student enrolment whether full-time, part-time or external generates administrative costs and it is therefore considered appropriate that a single level of administration charge be imposed for all enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) and (6) The Government recognises the important role of external studies in providing opportunities for many students who would not otherwise be able to participate in higher education. A monitoring committee has been established to oversight the impact of the charge on the various categories of students. The committee is expected to report shortly.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr Dawkins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In the period 1977-83 the number of higher education places in Queensland increased by 5,795 places. For the period 1983-86 the increase was 6,201 places to 43,111.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Since coming to office, the Hawke Government has taken steps to increase access to and participation in higher education in all States, but particularly in those States such as Queensland where participation rates have been relatively low for some time. For example, the number of Queensland higher education places is expected to grow by around 22% between 1983 and 1987, compared with the average national growth of 14%.</PARA>
<PARA> Amongst the measures taken were those which allowed additional places in engineering and science courses to be provided at Queensland Institute of Technology, Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education, Queensland Agricultural College and Capricornia Institute of Advanced Education. Other measures allowed for increased opportunities to be made available in business and computing courses at these Colleges and at Brisbane College of Advanced Education. Additionally, provision was made for the University of Queensland to increase its intake into engineering and for a significantly increased intake into a range of courses offered by Griffith University. Funds were also provided to assist in planning a new tertiary institution on the Gold Coast.</PARA>
<PARA> In October 1986 Senator Ryan and the Queensland Minister for Education, Mr Lin Powell, announced that a joint Commonwealth/State working party had recommended that university or advanced education courses be made available in TAFE colleges in regional centres in Queensland where no other tertiary institutions exist.</PARA>
<PARA> The working party gave highest priority to the areas of Cairns and Mackay, but anticipated that in future years higher education programs might also be made available through TAFE Colleges in places such as Bundaberg, Gympie, Maryborough, Mount Isa, Ipswich and the Sunshine Coast.</PARA>
<PARA> TAFE colleges in Cairns and Mackay are taking higher education students from either James Cook University or Capricornia Institute of Advanced Education for the first time this year. These students will then transfer to the main campus of the relevant higher education institution to complete the second and subsequent years of their awards.</PARA>
<PARA> The initiatives recommended by the working party, and indeed all the measures outlined above, are consistent with or indicative of the Commonwealth Government's policy of seeking to broaden access to tertiary education while at the same time making the most efficient use of available resources and facilities.</PARA>
