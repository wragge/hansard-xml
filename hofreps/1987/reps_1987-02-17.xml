<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Prime Minister to Australia's near double digit inflation rate and to our huge current account deficit, highlighted by the worst January figure on record. Does the Prime Minister still hold to the view that the strategy of the last Budget has laid the ground for a substantial fall in interest rates this financial year? If so, when will that substantial fall begin to occur?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Speaker, I understand the concern of the Opposition. The point I am making is that we inherited an inflation rate of 11 1/2 per cent and by the end of 1985 we had more than halved that rate. Even with the imposition upon this country of the enormous, adverse effects of the massive decline in terms of trade, and with the associated depreciation of the Australian dollar, the inflation rate in this country has not returned to that inflation rate which the Leader of the Opposition handed on to this country. It is still significantly below that inflation rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I go to that part of the question of the Leader of the Opposition which deals with interest rates. It is the fact that high interest rates are an inevitable feature of adjustment to Australia's current account difficulties. As much as this Government obviously would welcome lower interest rates, it is quite clear that we are responsible economic managers who, unlike the Opposition, eschew politically expedient quick fixes. We have reduced the burden on monetary policy by pursuing appropriately restrained fiscal and wages policies. It is all very well for the Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members opposite now to preach the virtues of low Budget deficits and of balanced Budgets. They were the people who bequeathed to this country a prospective deficit of 5 per cent of gross domestic product. Under the responsible economic management of this country-particularly under the management of the economy exercised by my colleague, the Treasurer-that inherited 5 per cent of GDP has been successively reduced to about 1 1/2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> We look to 1987 with a cautious optimism about the economy including a fall in interest rates in 1987, though, as I have said on many occasions-and I repeat on this occasion-the timing of such a fall will be affected by external factors, including what happens to world commodity prices and what happens to international financial conditions and sentiment. It will also depend on the pace at which the current account deficit declines. The country is presented with a responsible, cohesive mix of economic policies which will produce those results, as against the pie in the sky nonsense which day after day is coming from the Opposition. Until the Leader of the Opposition was last night and this morning scuttled by his coalition partner, what we were looking at was an $8 billion deficit credibility gap of the Leader of the Opposition. Now that $8 billion credibility gap has been thrown up to $11 billion because the Leader of the Opposition has received his marching instructions from the Premier of Queensland, who is about to replace him. What was an $8 billion credibility gap of the Leader of the Opposition is now $11 billion. And this man has the hide to talk about inflation and interest rates! If those policies of the Leader of the Opposition were ever given an opportunity to be effected, the deficit would blow out and interest rates would go through the roof. He has no confidence and no credibility.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interjections from members of the Opposition during the Prime Minister's answer to the previous question indicate yet again their absolute intellectual incapacity to cope with the fact that we have a massive balance of payments problem due fundamentally to the corruption of agricultural markets and also-</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members-Ha, ha!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition members laugh. The problem is due fundamentally to the corruption of agricultural markets and also declining markets for mineral exports. That is the principal economic problem this country has today. The reason we are in this situation is basically the policies of the present Opposition over 30 years. They have left us in a situation in which we cannot capitalise on the fast growing areas of international trade. So we are expecting two sectors which have declining terms of trade-they have had that for a long time-to carry the whole external account. That is the problem we have. All the Opposition offers, if it offers anything, are a few quick-fix populist solutions. It has no real solutions. The Deputy Leader of the National Party wants to send a delegation to Washington with a begging bowl, and that is about the Opposition's policy on trade. All the Liberal Party Opposition-we will not call it a coalition any more-wants to do is to slap down wages by up to 60 per cent, and it believes that in that way we can become more competitive. It agrees with the New Right. It wants an average wage of $173. It says it agrees with everything that Joh says, but it really does not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Prime Minister put forward at Davos was a practical, politically feasible, range of options and proposals that could have some effect in dealing with the terrible problem we face with the corruption of world agricultural commodity trade. The seven proposals involve a commitment to hold the subsidy escalation and to freeze and progressively to reduce the gap between administered internal prices and international market prices for farm products. There are elements of freeze in the European Economic Community today, such as the Commission's proposals on farm prices. There are also elements of freeze in the commitments made by Japan and the United States. Those elements are there due to the work being done by Ministers in this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the Prime Minister's proposals was an early reduction in internal administered producer prices. We believe that we need to get action and we believe that the seven economic summit countries should provide the leadership. I say that without the efforts of the Australian Government President Reagan's proposal on agricultural policy, which is now on the floor of the Congress, would not have taken the form it did, because it proposed a 10 per cent cut in target prices over the next three years, and that will reduce the price adjustment gap that the Prime Minister has focused on with his proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> The third element of the proposal refers to stocks. If we can get commitment and political action we can do something about responsible stock management and remove these great stock overhangs for the market. The fourth part of the Prime Minister's proposals refers to decoupling, so that policies which are attacking the problems of European agriculture, such as rural amenity, the environment, social distress and regional problems, are decoupled from farm policies themselves that centre on production units. The fifth point refers to principles for agricultural policy. We believe that the work that is being done by officials in the Australian Government, as well as by Ministers in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, will provide the basis for setting forth those principles. That will take place in May of this year at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ministerial meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> If we work hard and get those things together we will get an accord regarding international agricultural reform at the economic summit in Venice, and that will prepare the way for the negotiations in the Uruguay round under the Multilateral Trade Negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> I can say to this House that the Prime Minister's proposals were welcomed, that the analysis was agreed to, and that they have had a major impact on opinion leaders in the Western World. In my journey to Europe, where I spoke with people such as Sir Geoffrey Howe, Prime Minister Martens of Belgium, the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand and the Prime Minister of Malaysia, I found there is very broad agreement for this Australian initiative-the Prime Minister's seven proposals. I believe that elements of those seven proposals will take place. Unlike the Opposition, we are focusing on Australia's main economic problems. We are taking initiatives. We are due to get agriculture put on the agenda at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade meeting for the first time, and that will be dealt with in the Uruguay round. With this proposal we are capitalising on opportunity, to take steps in the six months leading up to the Venice summit. We will be unrelenting in our efforts. Unlike the Opposition, we are working hard on Australia's real problems, not putting forward quick-fix populist solutions and not failing to cope with the fact that we have this problem.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is it a fact that, comparing the number of bankruptcies in the first half of the 1986-87 financial year with the year before, there has been an increase of over 35 per cent? Is the half-year bankruptcy result not only the highest ever recorded in Australia but also the highest ever in those States with Labor governments? Are we looking at the prospect of Australia's largest ever number of bankruptcies-an horrific number of 8,000 businesses going broke this year due to the Government's policies? Do these half-year figures follow last year's record breaking result of 6,408 bankruptcies, which was also the highest number ever recorded?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Surely the implication of the question is not that the Australian economy has not undergone a period of growth from 1983-84 through to the present. Even in this financial year, when we heard howls from the Opposition at Budget time about how we would be in deep recession and how unemployment would rise, the Opposition again has been proven to be wrong. Unemployment has stabilised; the growth has slowed. We are not in negative growth; we are still running at around the Budget forecast, after three years of very strong economic growth. Has it entered the minds of Opposition members why the Australian stock exchanges are about to move into their fifth year of growth, breaking their records for the fifty-second time last year, through 1986? Has it ever entered their minds why the profit performance of Australian business has been the way it has been? It is because of the restraint of the work force and the policies of the Government over the last four years. Has it entered their minds that the whole process of adjustment to the terms of trade, and the fact that the Government has kept Australia on its feet by adjusting the economy of this country without moving into the kind of recession that the Opposition urges upon us, has been anything other than simply good for Australian business?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tax on unincorporated enterprises in the first three years of this Government rose by 50 per cent, or $8.3 billion, to almost $25 billion. What do Opposition members think is the explanation for this massive lift in profitability through these years, and for the buoyancy of Australian business? It is because of the policies of this Government and the product of restraint in the accord. That is in marked contrast to what we had in 1982-83 when the economy was in collapse, and major companies were going backwards and, for the first time in their corporate history, were posting losses. There were not just bankruptcies. The honourable member for Mitchell makes no point about bankruptcies of small businesses. They occur all the time. Many people move in and out of small businesses. What one must look at is the buoyancy of the Australian economy, and the buoyancy of business in particular. That is what this Government has delivered to businesses, which is in contrast to what the previous Government gave them in 1982-83, when the terms of trade were massively more advantageous than those we have now. The previous Government, or in fact the present Leader of the Opposition, managed to give us the first domestic negative growth for 30 years. That was all his own work-not the work of international commodity markets, but all his own work. Opposition members should go out and ask people in business what they think of the policies of this Government compared with those of the Opposition, and they will get the answer. If Opposition members had been around over Christmas, as we were, they would know what the answer is: It is a big thumbs-down to the politics and the economics on their side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude the point: Australia is adjusting to the worst terms of trade since the Great Depression. It has done so, producing growth. It has done so, lifting the profitability of Australian enterprise. Even the inflation rate, to which the Leader of the Opposition referred recently in a question, is the product of that very process of adjustment, of lifting the profitability of the traded goods sector of the Australian economy so that it can draw the investment and produce the kind of current account outcome that we want. I reject any implication whatsoever in the question that the profitability of Australian business is other than what it has been on the record, in the taxation statistics over the last three years, and I reject any implication that the health of the Australian economy is not vastly improved by the policies of the Government and the policies of the accord.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security and concerns the recent initiatives by the Government in presenting new directions for family assistance through the work of the social security review.

Could the Minister explain to this House how the Government's tax reform and income support provisions have affected the living standards of Australian families?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. She referred to the social security review. The response to the early papers, and particularly to the first issues paper, on the social security review has been very pleasing. There have been more than 100 submissions from a very wide and representative range of groups, indicating a great deal of interest in the substance of the review, the very substantial issues raised by it and the various suggestions made with respect to policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The paper contrasts with the kind of blancmange which was put forward in the name of family policy when the Leader of the Opposition issued his statement in December. Reading the Opposition's statement, I find it very difficult to find one concrete sentence which goes beyond talk of love, togetherness and emotional values. There is not one concrete sentence in relation to policy or which is not something which has not already been taken up by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> I was encouraged by one aspect of the statement in that the Government's proposals with respect to child support were not ruled out by the Opposition. I would not suggest that there, or anywhere else in the statement, it is clear exactly what the Opposition's policy is, but at least the proposals that we made-which have received very widespread public discussion-were not ruled out. The interest in this issue is very pleasing. A very large number of submissions have been received in relation to the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> If we want to talk about the difference between the Government and the Opposition in relation to questions of family policy and income transfers, we can simply consider where the priorities of the Government have been with respect to improvements in family income. In times of severe economic restraint those priorities necessarily have been with the lowest income families. I believe that our record in this area is very proud indeed.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the legacy of the Fraser- Howard Government. It is all very well for people to talk about four years ago. But what was the legacy? It was an increase in the number of children in pensioner and beneficiary families from around 8 per cent to 20 per cent-one in every five children was in a pensioner or beneficiary family. That is where the measures this Government has taken, within very tight Budgets, have been directed. In contrast to a 30 per cent real decrease in support for very low income families under the Fraser-Howard Government, in our time in office there has been a 30 per cent real increase in assistance to very low income families. We introduced the family income supplement, for which the Opposition can claim some credit, and increased it very substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a great deal of talk about the family. I do not think anyone is going to be impressed by blancmange. People are going to look for substance and priorities. As the Treasurer has said, our priorities have been growth, employment and the provision of a number of improvements in the social wage which have added to people's real incomes. Where are the Opposition's priorities? Its priorities are to protect the tax cheats and the business lunches, to knock off the fringe benefits tax and to keep paying pensions to millionaires. That is the difference. The issue is all about fairness and equity.</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members can run around the country as much as they like displaying emotion, but people are going to look for the bottom line. The bottom line is that, with all the difficulties and constraints, this Government has delivered a range of measures which have improved the standard of living of the average Australian family and which have shown particular concern and compassion for families dependent on social security.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer and it concerns the bottom line of welfare to Australian families. I refer the Treasurer to the fact that when Labor was elected in March 1983 a family on average weekly earnings was paying 17 1/2c in every dollar in tax and that even after the proposed second round of tax cuts in July this year that same family will be paying 20 1/2c in every dollar in tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In mentioning 1983 is the honourable member referring to the 500,000 families the honourable member for Bennelong banished to the employment scrapheap? Are they the families the honourable member is talking about-families that did not have jobs to pay any income tax on? Are they the families he is speaking about? Are the 700,000 people who were banished to unemployment in the Fraser years and the 500,000 who were banished to unemployment in the former Treasurer's last 18 months the people he is referring to or does he think they are martians? Does he think that the people his Government banished to the unemployment queues were part of Australian families or not? Fancy honourable members opposite talking about families. The Opposition had nothing but contempt for Australian households all the years it was in government. It beat them to death and never at any stage did it give them tax indexation. It took the $3 billion of new cheap lazy oil money out of Bass Strait and spent it on the Burdekin Dam and everything else it could get its hands on when it could have relieved the taxpayers and families of this country. It never cared less.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1983 the Opposition has opposed every wage increase in contemplation. It has supported a wage freeze on every occasion since 1983 and did so well before that. But honourable members opposite get up here and bleat about the disposable incomes of families via the tax system-that is their point-and say that there should not be any wage increases; that we can have inflation from the Howard years of 11 per cent, but families should be given nothing. When this Government said `Let us put a decent policy together which has restraint and which tracks Australian inflation down', the Opposition said that there should be no wage increases. That is what the Opposition said.</PARA>
<PARA> Now the honourable member is asking me a question about taxation. We know where he stands on taxation. He stands with the politics of greed. That is where he stands on taxation. He stands to hand tax cuts to the rich at the expense of the poor and the working class. That is where he stands. He now stands to sabotage the whole climate of restraint that this Government has created through its wages and budgetary policies. The principal saboteur, the man with the fistful of cheap dollars, is the honour- able member for Bennelong. He is the man who says `Give the rich-the white-shoe millionaires who have spent years paying less than their fair share of tax-a 40 per cent tax rate', but have we heard in the proposals of the Leader of the Opposition of any tax changes for the people who earn under $20,000? Have we heard of any tax changes for the people who earn under $30,000? No way. If a person earns above $35,000, that person is entitled to a 40 per cent tax rate, and it is paid for by the rest of us. That is what the Opposition is into. The whole fabric of restraint which the Government has built up-getting the work force and the Australian Council of Trade Unions to accept income restraint for four years, cutting transfer payments and basically controlling and reducing the Commonwealth Budget deficit-the Opposition would put at risk basically to go back to another fistful of dollars. It would blow the Budget deficits apart and even the foundation stone on which that handful of greed sat, the consumption tax, we now find today has gone up in thin air because it has been vetoed by the National Party of Australia and by Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen.</PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition stands now without any fiscal policy, with $7.8 billion of tax and outlays promises and without any wages policy-and he is asking about the disposable income of Australian families. This Government is the only government that has given families substantial tax cuts which are paid for by making the urgers pay their way with the abolition of the fringe benefits and negative gearing and the substantiation of entertainment allowances and capital gains. The tax cuts are paid for by those things, yet the Opposition says `Let's give them back the free lunches. Let's give them back their free Mercedes and their negative gearing on their properties. Let's give them back all the profits in the stock exchanges by wiping out the capital gains tax, but let's have some crocodile tears for the low income earners.' The Opposition pushed the low income earners on to the unemployment scrapheap; it ran them into the ground with its high tax policies by letting the tax cheats off for seven years. We brought them to book and we have given Australia the fairest tax system it has ever had in the history of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to credibility with Australian families, as my colleague the Minister for Social Security said, honourable members should look at the record of this Government, at the Opposition's record and rhetoric, its constant complaints about wage increases, its advocacy of a wage freeze and the fact that it never gave any tax relief in all the years it was in government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is well known that since coming to office the Government has taken every opportunity available to it to raise its concerns about the plight of the Soviet Jewry both in bilateral discussions and in appropriate international forums such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Mr Hayden, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, raised the matter directly with the Soviet authorities in Moscow in 1984. I think it is well known that I have raised it on occasions with the Soviet Ambassador. Madam Speaker, as you will clearly recall, the parliamentary delegation to the Soviet Union which you led last year again raised the question with high level authorities. You made a new appeal for the release of Jewish activists still imprisoned in the Soviet Union. Especially, you mentioned, Madam Speaker, the case of Dr Joseph Begun in detention for having taught Hebrew in the Soviet Union. I am very pleased to say that last month in Israel I had the opportunity to reaffirm-in meetings with Prime Minister Shamir and also in a very touching meeting with a group of refusenik representatives, who between them represented some 200 mothers separated from their children and grandchildren-that I would raise at every appropriate opportunity, the issue of the Soviet treatment of Jews.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very pleased to say that there has been a development from that. In that meeting with the representatives of the refuseniks I was most particularly moved by the case of Sophia Landver, a woman whom I would judge to be about 40 years of age, who wished to enter the Soviet Union to visit her terminally ill mother. As a result of that meeting in Jerusalem I immediately had representations made here in Canberra and in the Soviet Union. On her behalf last Wednesday here in Canberra I raised the matter directly with the Ambassador of the Soviet Union. I am delighted to be able to report that permission for Mrs Landver to visit her mother was granted last Thursday. I have thanked the Ambassador for this. We have also been heartened to learn that Dr Begun is among a group of refuseniks released from detention in the last few days. I think it is fair to say-and I guess no one has been more consistent in criticisms on this matter than me-that there are some encouraging signs in Soviet policy on human rights, but very much remains to be done before the situation can be considered acceptable. This Government will continue to make representations to the Soviet Government to this end in the knowledge that our efforts and those of other democracies can produce some positive results.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Prime Minister. I draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the recent decision of Justice Pincus of the Federal Court of Australia in the matter of Western Television Ltd v. Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in which Justice Pincus made it clear that the failure by a company director to lodge income tax returns is sufficient reason for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to refuse a television licence to that company. I also refer the Prime Minister to the recent decision of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to make the renewal of the licence of the highly rated and regarded Perth radio station 96FM subject to the resignation of the chairman of the board, who has been convicted of failing to lodge tax returns, which the Tribunal said was a `neglect of one of the basic obligations of a citizen'. In the light of this opinion of a learned judge and a government tribunal that failure to lodge tax returns, irrespective of subsequent remedial action, must require the resignation of a company director from the administration of a mere government licensee, how does the Prime Minister now justify his statement of 28 November 1986 that the Treasurer's non-lodgment of tax returns `is not one of immense consequence'? When will the Prime Minister lift his principles to those of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and require the resignation of his Treasurer, the late lodger?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been proposals around in the media which have emanated, amongst other places, from the Opposition that we ought to have a 40 per cent top marginal rate of tax paid for by a consumption tax of approximately 7 1/2 per cent and by other cuts in outlays. The first thing I would like to say about that is this: At a time when the national income is going down-because of cuts in primary industry commodity prices for cereal, metals, coal, oil and many other commodities-the Opposition is running around saying: `We will give people tax cuts and lift their incomes. We will lift the incomes of high income earners when Australia's national income is going down. We expect all those other people in the work force to have wage restraint-we expect their incomes to fall-but we wish to give our supporters, the people at the top end, a higher standard of living by reducing their top marginal rate, not to the 49 per cent which this Government has done and paid for, but down to 40 per cent. On top of that, we will abolish capital gains taxes, fringe benefits taxes, negative gearing, the wine tax and tax deductibility for entertainment and we will introduce income splitting, et cetera'. All of those things would total $7.8 billion. Those are not the outlays promised by the Leader of the Opposition, which he jumped in his Budget reply; those are the standing commitments of the Opposition, which account for $7.8 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sitting under that proposal was a consumption tax which was supposed to yield $3.5 billion, but we have seen today that the National Party of Australia dumped the Leader of the Opposition in any proposal for a consumption tax. The Deputy Leader of the National Party, Mr Hunt, said at lunchtime: `Our Party room is very much opposed to a consumption tax because we feel that a consumption tax introduced at this time could have a serious effect on people out there in those regional areas, where they are in dire difficulties with their incomes. At the present time it would add to their cost of living and impose a tax upon them they could not afford to pay'. That is the position. In other words, the other half of the coalition says `no' to one of the principal tax planks of the Leader of the Opposition. One of the foundation stones of the tax planks, the $3 1/2 billion of income-to pay for the $7 1/2 billion, leaving a further $4 billion to be met by some unspecified outlay changes-has gone. All the computer models of the honourable member for Mackellar and the doodlings of Senator Messner in putting the final touches to his tax package are finito; they are gone; they are off the board. Sinkers struck them down on the front steps. Basically, they have gone because the voice form the north has said they must go. The great leader of the conservative forces, the honourable member for Bennelong-the saviour of the wealthy-has had his policies cut down by Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Yesterday, the honourable member for Bennelong said: `I am backing Sinkers'. Sinkers is where other sinkers are. They are with their mates on the bottom of the harbour. Members of the Opposition are not too cheery today. Just look at them over there.</PARA>
<PARA> The former Leader of the Liberal dries, Mr John Hyde, who was the first person in the Liberal Party in the post-war years to start talking economic rationality to them, had this to say today:</PARA>
<PARA> What we don't want is cheap populism. Promising easy solutions is no answer. It's not courageous to say you are going to cut taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is blowing the whistle on the cheap politics of the Liberal Party, and those of the Leader of the Opposition, who, knowing that Australia's national income is declining, runs around out there with a fistful of dollars a la 1977 and a la 1982, basically offering people tax cuts that he knows the nation not only cannot afford but also can never pay for. It is worth recalling that in response to the 1984 Budget Mr Howard said at the National Press Club:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't think there is any doubt from an economic point of view that greater priority should be given to reducing the Budget deficit. I think if the Government is faced with a choice between giving a tax cut of, say, $1 billion and having a deficit that is a billion lower than it might otherwise be, I think it ought to choose the latter; that is, go for the lower Budget deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Government wishes, on top of that, to give taxation cuts, then it should cut further its own expenditures to find the room.</PARA>
<PARA>That came from Mr Howard when he was worried about the fabric of the Australian economy and when he knew that fiscal policy played an integral and important role in any process of economic adjustment, especially in these times when the terms of trade have fallen disastrously, in the most disastrous fall since the Great Depression. What are we getting now? We are getting this attempt to sabotage the whole climate of restraint. For four years, the unions have copped wage restraint, seeing some decent policies in the tax system, and seeing cuts in outlays. The Opposition says that we should rip up all that restraint. It says: `Do not give the notion that there is restraint; dance to the tune of incentivation'-some madcap theme thought up by the greedy who want to rip off the top end of the tax system at the expense of the needy and the poor. Incentivation is now running the Liberal Party-not economic rationality, and not the Hyde view that tax cuts are cheap and lack all courage. Basically, what we have seen is just the old Liberal Party tune of greed. We are back out there with greed.</PARA>
<PARA> Even on that greedy platform, we find that the Leader of the Opposition says now that a consumption tax, providing $3.5 billion, with all its attendant problems for inflation, is just an option. It has now diminished to an option because he knows that he cannot deliver his half of politics in that respect. He stands here today, two years into this Parliament and one year into his leadership, with no wages policy, no fiscal policy and no tax policy. He stands bereft of policy in a nation with a current account problem much of which was induced by his own policies and which has been dealt a very solid blow by the rest of the world. Yet we are all about to say: `Look, 49c is enough'. As Treasurer, he let the 60 per cent rate sit there for five years. He had the new oil revenue, the $3 billion from Bass Strait, to cut the 60 per cent rate with. He left it and it came to this Government to cut the rate to 49 per cent, to provide relief from the double taxation of dividends and to cut other rates by introducing the fringe benefits tax, by making people pay their way. We have introduced the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax and negative gearing provisions but, no, the Opposition wants to wipe all the decency out, wipe the fairness out, wipe the equity out and just provide a fistful of money to people who have not made enough-as if the millionaires and the people investing on the stock exchange had not made enough in the last four years. The Opposition says: `Give them a tax cut that we know the country cannot afford. Let us not say how we will pay for it or, if we do, let us talk about a consumption tax that we can never deliver'.</PARA>
<PARA> That is the position on marginal tax rate changes in this country. The only tax change is this Government's massive $4.5 billion tax reduction now under way, paid for by making the tax system broader and fairer and by making sensible cuts in public outlays. That will be the only reform in taxation that this country will see, and if the people want to fall for the policies of greed being propounded by the Queensland Premier, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party of Australia they will have a very clear choice at the next election.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Speaker, I know that you would regard a question on housing as being broad enough to enable me to make a comment on bankruptcies, which I will do very quickly. I was interested in the question addressed to my colleague the Treasurer earlier about what had happened to bankruptcies in this country. It is relevant to note just what happened to the bankruptcy rate in the years 1983-84 to 1985-86. I ask honourable members to note this in light of the now well-known remarks of the incoming Leader of the National Party in this place, the Premier of Queensland. He said on a national program the other day that he wants to do for Australia what he has done for Queensland. I see the smiles on the faces of my Liberal friends the honourable member for Ryan and the honourable member for O'Connor. They agree with me because in the last two years the increase in bankruptcies in Queensland has been 43 per cent; the increase for the rest of Australia has been 6 per cent. So that is what the incoming Leader of the National Party wants to do. Is this what the honourable member for Maranoa wants his friend to do for the rest of Australia-give them a 43 per cent increase in bankruptcies? What he will do is sink not just the honourable member for Maranoa but the whole lot of his colleagues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, I know that the question was about housing. In the difficult economic circumstances that confronted the economy in general and the housing industry in particular, this Government brought in a housing package last year and it has been a significant success. Let me very briefly give the figures. The housing finance figures show that savings bank lending is up markedly since the package was introduced, and is now running at an annual rate of above $7 billion compared with the pre-package level of less than $4 billion. In December private housing approvals were at their highest level since February of 1986. The outlook for starts in 1986-87 and for employment in the housing industry is much brighter than before the package was brought in. Therefore, we are satisfied that the steps that we took last year to meet the problems of the housing industry in those difficult economic circumstances have been successful.</PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, you will be aware, as will all honourable members, of the other actions which the Government has taken to demonstrate its commitment to support the housing industry. We introduced the widely acclaimed first home owners scheme which has put more than 200,000 Australians, particularly young Australians, into homes. The circumstances were such that before the introduction of that scheme they could not possibly have contemplated the ownership of their own home. In terms of funds for public housing, under this Government there has been a 42 per cent real increase in the funds made available by government for public housing. When we came to office we took steps to lift the housing industry from the doldrums into which the incompetence of the Opposition had plunged it. We are confident, in the difficult economic circumstances, that the package that was brought in by the Minister for Housing and Construction on behalf of this Government will be appropriate to lift the level of activity, as it has in the period since it was introduced.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A report that appeared in the Armidale Express newspaper on 24 November 1986, and which subsequently appeared in some other newspapers, carried a story about the Minister for Transport, the Hon. Peter Morris. It stated, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A proposal by the National Party Member for Cowper, Mr Garry Nehl, to transfer Federal funds from the New England Highway to the Pacific Highway would severely disadvantage the New England region, according to the Federal Transport Minister, Mr Peter Morris. </PARA>
<PARA>No such proposal was ever made by me. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Morris said that a document prepared by Mr Nehl gives first priority to substituting the Pacific Highway for the New England Highway in the National Highway system. </PARA>
<PARA>The document I put out, entitled `The Pacific Highway-Towards 2001', does not allocate any such priority. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Morris said that this means the New England Highway would lose its National Highway classification and revert to being a State road if Mr Nehl's argument is to be heeded. </PARA>
<PARA>No such argument was made. The Minister has certainly misrepresented me. I would like to read out two paragraphs from the document entitled `The Pacific Highway-Towards 2001', of which every honourable member has received a copy. It presents a detailed argument for upgrading the Pacific Highway, but at no time and in no place does it indicate what the Minister says it indicates. I have always respected his veracity until now, and I am rather disappointed. I said that there were four options:</PARA>
<PARA> First, the Pacific Highway could be removed from the Rural Arterial Road category and made a National highway (not a likely possibility); secondly, the Federal Minister for Transport could use his powers to declare it a Development Road; thirdly, the Minister could channel additional funding by declaring it a Tourism Road; or, fourthly, it can remain in its present classification but with additional funding from both Federal and State governments. </PARA>
<PARA>The one relevant recommendation in this document reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The NSW and Federal governments should make an irrevocable decision in principle that the Pacific Highway should be upgraded to a four lane, dual carriageway, divided road. </PARA>
<PARA>At no time did I make the claims that the Minister for Transport said I made. </PARA>

<TITLE>Closure of Post Office Agencies</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we strenuously object to the proposal that many post office agencies are to be closed. They provide a network of offices with postal and agency services to residential areas and small communities.</PARA>
<PARA> They serve a community need and we would be seriously inconvenienced if forced to travel further to purchase postal items or collect parcels. It would be an unnecessary expense particularly for pensioners without their own transport. We maintain that the purposes of post offices should be to serve the public for the variety of services they offer. They are a community centre particularly in country areas and if necessary they should be subsidised to retain them.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House should take all possible steps to prevent the closure of post office agencies and that the network should be extended, with the agency services they offer expanded.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>National Flag</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that whereas:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of three Christian Crosses, represents the Nation's historical origin and the source of its language and law;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location on this planet Earth;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. They know the Flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time when we had the benefit of the advice of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on a whole range of subjects he said that during the parliamentary recess he had been around talking to the business community. I can believe that, because he certainly was not anywhere to be seen around Bankstown during the recess. In fact, his electorate did not see hide nor hair of him during a very important by-election. I can also believe that the Treasurer had been around the business community during the recess because I do not think he has been around middle Australia, and I do not think he has been in any of the marginal electorates that will determine the fate of his Government at the next election. If he had been around those marginal electorates he would have gathered a very clear idea of one fundamental fact-that the Australian Labor Party is utterly on the nose in middle Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nobody represents that rejection of the Labor Government better than the present honourable member for Blaxland, the Treasurer of this country, because his policies, his Prime Minister and his Government have been seen to let down Australian families, Australian individuals, Australian farmers and Australian small businesses. It is a tired government. It has lost direction. It has lost touch with ordinary people, and middle Australia is hurting a great deal under this Government. Interest rates have gone up, inflation has gone up, taxes have gone up, debt has gone up, and the dollar has gone down. All of this is the legacy of the man who could not even fulfil what a Federal Court of Australia judge described as a fundamental obligation of an ordinary citizen. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) may want to think that chapter is closed, but I can assure him on behalf of the constituents of middle Australia that that chapter is far from closed. </PARA>
<PARA> There was one thing that the Treasurer said during Question Time with which I agreed. He said that this country faces a parlous balance of payments situation. He was absolutely right. He hit the nail right on the head when he said that this country faces a parlous balance of payments situation. It is not a time for anybody to advance irresponsible economic alternatives or instant fix economic propositions; it is a time when the Australian public are looking for a credible, responsible alternative to the present Government. That credible, responsible alternative has to be built around a credible, responsible, believable economic package. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of things constitute a believable economic package. The first thing we have to do is to have a mini-Budget in May and do something about expenditure. People talk a lot about cutting tax. I will say again to the House that we cannot cut tax in this country unless we are prepared to take the knife to government spending. People who pretend otherwise are misleading themselves and the Australian public. We say again to the Treasurer: `You bring in a mini-Budget in May and if you are prepared to cut the Commonwealth's outlays to the tune of 3 or 4 per cent in real terms you will get support from the Opposition, you will not get condemnation. If you want to do something to ease interest rates and to put a floor under the dollar at the same time you will adopt a responsible fiscal policy, because up to date you certainly have not done it'. That is the first thing that has to be done to redress what is happening to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing we have to have is a fundamentally reformed Australian taxation system. I do not yield from anything I have said in the past about what should underlie the reform of the Australian taxation system. We need a simpler taxation system, one that is based upon expenditure reductions, with a more intelligent mix between direct and indirect taxes. We need to get rid of the incentive deadening effects of the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax and the lump sum tax on superannuation. The Treasurer begs the Opposition not to be populist, but he is a craven populist when he accuses every one of his opponents on the taxation front of being a friend of the taxation cheats. He knows as well as everybody in this House that I did more to smash the tax avoidance industry than any Treasurer since Federation. I do not apologise for having done that because I am not prepared to stand by and see ordinary people carry a tax burden that has been shifted upon them by the misdeeds of the greedy and those people who would despoil the reputation of capitalism. We need a reformed taxation system; a taxation system based upon putting greater incentive; one that walks away from the existing progressive taxation system; one that is far flatter in terms of personal rate scales; and one that has a more intelligent mix between direct and indirect taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> We need also urgently to lift totally all of the existing restrictions on foreign investment, except in one or two extremely sensitive areas such as media ownership. If we were to do that we would bring about a recycling and replacement of debt and investment to the benefit of our long term balance of payments situation. It is absolutely essential for the Government to go much further than it has in the area of freeing up foreign investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth thing we have to do is to be willing to free up Australia's overregulated and excessively controlled labour markets. I remember a year ago when my colleagues and I were talking about freeing up the labour market and talking about reform. What did the Government, newspapers, commentators and trade unions say? They said that we could not do it, that we would not even get a policy through our joint party room. They said that blood would flow out under the door as we debated the policy. They said that it would divide the Liberal Party down the middle and that it would divide the Liberal Party from the National Party. We produced the policy and it has drawn overwhelming support from the Australian business community. It has been endorsed by the Confederation of Australian Industry, farmers, small business, the Business Council of Australia and by those who want a new deal in industrial relations. Even more significantly, major industrial figures in the labour movement, such as Charlie Fitzgibbon, have talked about the very things that underpin our policy. If ever there was an example of what was seen as radical at the beginning of last year becoming the conventional mainstream of a political debate, it is what the Liberal and National parties propose in the area of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Absolutely fundamental to that policy is one very important principle; that is, that the trade unions of this country must be brought within the reach of the ordinary laws of this country. One of the greatest legislative achievements of the Fraser Government was the introduction of section 45D of the Trade Practices Act. I remember it well because I was the Minister responsible, if honourable members will forgive me for saying so. Without that section it would never have been possible for Jay Pendarvis to have had his triumph at Mudginberri, because that was the legislative backing for Pendarvis's triumph. That triumph has been rightly hailed as a new dawn in industrial relations. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was opposed by the present Prime Minister and, I regret to say, many sections of the business community. It was opposed by the then leader of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the present Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis). Not only did section 45D play a very important part in the Mudginberri dispute; it also played a very important part in the historic victory of the Queensland Government over power workers in that State, which is the other significant milestone along the hard march towards a far better industrial relations system in this country. That piece of legislation has played a very important role. That is the fourth thing that we need if we are to improve this country's economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fifth thing that we need-I think that there may be some measure of bipartisanship on this-is a significant boost to the migrant intake of this country. We should not be ashamed to say it. We know in our hearts that it is the right thing to do. We know that migration to this country has enormously boosted our economic growth. We know that without further migration we will not realise the growing economy and provide a greater level of demand for the goods produced by our manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> The final thing that we need in order to start turning around the Australian economy, and which constitutes an element of our policy, is to make a massive assault on the lather and the layers of regulations that constrict and constrain the business community and many aspects of the Australian commercial sector. That assault must not be restricted only to the Federal Government; it also needs to reach into the activities of State and local government. My experience in politics is that State and local governments are the greatest regulators of all. Regulation at a State and local government level needs to be significantly attacked and assaulted. Not only do we need to attack that regulation; we also need to go much further in freeing up areas such as transport and communications. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's media proposals have a number of basic flaws. One is that they maintain the ridiculous barriers that exist on entry. If people are really worried about concentration of media ownership, they should be prepared to free up the barriers to entry. They should allow more players on to the field and not allow the existing players to wax fatter. If the Government is serious about freeing up the system, and if it wants a diversity, that is what it should be prepared to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been a miserable economic failure. Over the Christmas recess, it found the false dawn that it promised us. The Government said that the trade account would turn around. It said that things were getting better. All of that was exploded by what happened over the past two months. This Treasurer has presided over an inflation rate which in relative terms is the worst that this country has had since the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was formed. The trade figure released yesterday is the worst January trade figure that this country has ever had. One may well ask when on earth his fabled J-curve is going to arrive. How much longer must the Australian community wait for the Treasurer's J-curve? How much longer can the Australian community put up with month after month of promises that it will get better next month? We were told in December that the dawn had arrived. We were told that everything was starting to turn around, but what have we found over the Christmas recess? We have found that we have double digit inflation which is not twice that of our trading partners, not three times that of our trading partners but four to five times that of our trading partners. We have also found that we are back on the rack of $1 billion to $1.5 billion current account deficits every month. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the legacy of the man who the Prime Minister certifies to us today is going to remain Treasurer until the next election. All I can say is pity help Australia. It might boost the electoral prospects of the Opposition for him to remain Treasurer until the next election, but pity help Australia. This is the man who was too ashamed to go into his own electorate during a by-election. They kept him on holidays until the Sunday after the by-election. They trotted him out the day after. They kept him well and truly under wraps in his own electorate. They were not even prepared to send him into his own electorate in that special car he has, with the darkened glass. It is no wonder they kept him under wraps, because I can tell this Parliament and the people of Australia that this Treasurer has failed. He is seen as a wrecker and a destroyer of the living standards of average Australians; he is seen as a man who has abandoned the very battlers that he craves acceptance as a representative of; and he is seen as a man who has wreaked havoc upon and pillaged the Australian economy. He and his Prime Minister will be thrown out at the first available opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, whatever the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) may think of me, I will be around long enough to see him rolled in the political dustbin. The speech we just heard had a melancholy quality to it. It sounded like a political valedictory, a recital of objectives once sought by a more ambitious politician who is now seeing those objectives leave him and become unattainable, a recital of objectives without means, impractical views clothed with emotional rhetoric. Why is all this recital of the things that the Leader of the Opposition once stood for relevant today? The answer is that he has lost the political supremacy of the conservative forces in this country. It has been taken away from him. The only reason why Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen is running wild, pushing his conservative philosophy and his opportunist views, is that Howard is no good. He is not up to the job of leading the coalition parties. That is why. Joh has smelt the weakness and filled the void, and he has pressured a weak Leader of the National Party into denouncing an even weaker Leader of the Liberal Party and all he stands for in terms of his tax policies and his economic program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Like a dentist going over someone else's bad work, I have gone over the Leader of the Opposition's bad work. He knows I know about the fabric of the Australian economy. I know where the tears and the stitches are because I have had my hands on it for four years. It really makes me sick to read a matter of public importance such as this. The Leader of the Opposition refers to the disastrous impact on families, farmers and small businesses. He then refers to high taxes, high interest rates, inflation and all the rest. Let us recite the facts. In years of massively advantageous terms of trade compared with now, when oil prices were up, when coal prices were up and when iron ore prices were up-when all of our great commodity prices were up-and when we had all of the new revenue from Bass Strait, when this man had an opportunity to remodel Australia, get if off the back of international debt and rebuild its secondary structure, he was quite happy to jump on the rhetoric of the resources boom, he was quite happy to see the secondary structure fall apart, he was quite happy to sit and watch the current account deficit slowly start to grow, he was quite happy not to tell Australians that they could not have a recurrent living standard built upon overseas savings, and he was quite happy that the current account deficit in 1981-82 was 6 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> He knew that any perceived improvement in 1982-83 and 1983-84 was simply because of his recession, because it cut imports and there was no attendant real improvement in the current account. He knew he had put us on the inexorable road to debt. He had no wages policy, so he overvalued the exchange rate. The farmers he talks about in this cheap matter of public importance were the people who were robbed of decent prices during the 1970s by an overvalued dollar. He knows that. He knows at the same time that his failure to control wages and hence inflation and interest rates robbed Australians of their living standards over the years and pushed three-quarters of a million of them into the poverty of unemployment. That is his record. If this were any other parliament in the world, or, if we operated under almost any other political system, he would not have the hide to show his face and talk about economic policy and no party with any respect would elect him as its leader. But the Opposition has and the fact that it did now matters for naught because he stands bereft of any political authority. That is the truth. Australia is in a period of almost unparalleled problems in terms of its trade accounts. It is in a period when tomfoolery with fiscal policy will not be tolerated on the financial market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The thing that the Liberal Party has never reckoned upon is that this Government and this Government alone is the first to live with the discipline of a floating exchange rate, to wear the daily assessment of the international markets. That is something those opposite never lived with. They always cheated on the exchange rate by overvaluing it. They cheated on fiscal policy and they cheated on monetary policy. They would never put interest rates at their proper levels so they could sell the required number of bonds to soak up liquidity. Their monetary policy always ran way over target as they financed one property boom or inflationary surge after another. They always cheated. They went for protection when they should not have. They, as a coalition, always cheated on the fabric of the Australian economy. This Government came along and said: `Right, if we are going to do anything with this country we need to expose it to the fresh breezes of international competition. We will wear the discipline, wear the burden, of a floating exchange rate; we will open it up to the criticisms of fiscal policy, wages policy and monetary policy, and we will silence those criticisms by making the appropriate policy changes'. That is what this Government is doing. But the Opposition parties thought that because they always had the people out there running business, who were once the old Establishment and who all carried Liberal Party tickets in their pockets, they were immune to economic forces. Let me say this to them: Much of what they say now is based on those views, but the people on the Reuters screens in Melbourne or Sydney, or Tokyo or New York, would not care whether people hold tickets in the Gordon branch of the Liberal Party, whether they are born to rule or whether they are just remnants of Australia's failed upper class. They could not care less and they will strike members of the Opposition down in two seconds if they follow a stupid, crazy fiscal policy. The Leader of the Opposition now stands with a $7.8 billion set of tax promises.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A $7.8 billion addition to the Budget deficit would send the financial markets into a frenzy. They would squash this country with interest rates the likes of which we have never seen. They would damn us to a recession the likes of which would only be a repeat of the Great Depression, with an interest rate structure which would be punishing. People will not tolerate the kind of fiscal stupidity which is part and parcel of the Opposition's stated policy, and while those opposite may think there is some cheap support for their chopping the top end tax rate, basically the hard assessors, the international assessors, would give them the thumbs down in 24 hours if ever they thought their policies could become reality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today we saw one of the principal revenue planks of the Opposition-the consumption tax proposal-torn from under the Leader of the Opposition. Notice that today he has already changed the language. Ever adaptable, the India rubber man, he has turned around and he is now talking about a more intelligent balance between direct and indirect tax. There is no more talk about a consumption tax or a retail turnover tax because Sinkers has sunk it, on the word of Joh. The Leader of the Opposition stands there now with basically no fiscal policy. On top of that, he says that what we need is some tax decency. But, in a contradiction in terms, he says: `We will repeal the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax, the disallowance of the tax deductibility for entertainment expenses and negative gearing-the lot'. In other words, in gestures of indecency he would wipe out the equitable tax reforms of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> He talked about the need to flatten the tax system-in other words, to give the people on high incomes an increase in their living standards when the nation's national income is going down. That is all it is. If one is talking about a flatter tax system one is talking about lower rates of tax for high income earners, who have already got a tax cut from this Government, when the nation's income is coming down. One is talking about tax cuts and higher living standards when one knows one could never pay for them. </PARA>

We have the British craft union structure; we do not have industry unions. If one goes, all go. The Leader of the Opposition has not faced that fact. He is still going on with this nonsense as if something different would happen. We would quickly have a situation similar to that in 1981 all over again. The climate of restraint would be gone. When members of the Liberal Party stand up and say that they want to give the rich a tax cut when the country is going through a period of economic problem, when people in the wage system have been making sacrifices for four years-five years if we count 1982-83-and when we are cutting outlays and programs, they try to tear the whole fabric of restraint away. They are sabotaging the whole climate of restraint. Do they not realise that? The more noble objective of trying to get the nation to live within its means is being put asunder by their quest for the response of greed. We have a group of millionaires putting their hands out. They have been paying less than their fair share of tax and through Joh and the Leader of the Opposition they are trying to shanghai the Federal Government into giving them tax cuts at the expense of the poor. That is what the Opposition is proposing. That is not tenable in this country in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition stands up and says that we need a better wage policy and a better tax policy. What does he mean by a better wages policy? Does he mean further wage cuts for those at the lower end while people at the top end, the high income professionals and the millionaires, get tax cuts when the value of their property, their stock on the stock market and the profits of their companies have risen inexorably. Is that what members of the Opposition really stand for?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition talks about a media policy. I remind the Opposition that it gave Frank Packer and the Melbourne Herald the two-station rule, pretending that two stations in Sydney and Brisbane are the same as two stations at Mount Isa and Broken Hill. They are not. That was a rort. This Government has changed the situation. It is decontrolling the media. No longer will the print barons control television. But the Opposition cannot even see any decency in that. The fact is that members of the Opposition are not-as the Leader of the Opposition said in his opening remarks-a credible, responsible alternative; they are incredible and irresponsible and they have no alternative. That is the fact of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition talked about my being a craven populist. If anyone wants to be a craven populist he should stay away from fringe benefits tax, abolition of tax deductibility of entertainment expenses, capital gains tax and the hard changes the Opposition never had the decency to introduce. He should stay away from the things that matter. The Leader of the Opposition tried to make cheap points about high inflation. The Leader of the Opposition must know, and I remind him, that the price of imports has risen by 50 per cent in the last two years because of the depreciation of the Australian dollar. That impacts on our consumer price index. It gives our traded goods sector the chance to lift its prices, therefore to draw investment to it, therefore to turn the current account around. It is a necessary part of the process of adjustment. The Leader of the Opposition knows that. He knows that the wage policies in place will pull the present inflation rate down rapidly. At the end of that process we will have a far more dynamic and competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Leader of the Opposition took cheap shots about inflation and high taxes. He sat back with a 60 per cent marginal tax rate and did nothing about it. Now the 49 per cent rate is not good enough for him! He says it has to go to 40 per cent. He did not change the 60 per cent rate. With all the new money out of Bass Strait, he did nothing about outlay changes and he did nothing about the double tax on dividends which had been in place since 1936. For all those years business asked: `Why should we be penalised because we are a company? Why do we have to pay tax twice? Why do you not relieve the double tax on dividends?'. Did the Leader of the Opposition do that? No, it did not happen until the Labor Government came along. It was the second government in the world to take such action. We said: `We will give you a total relief of tax for a corporate rate of 49 per cent'. West Germany is the only other country in the world with a full imputation, for a corporate rate of 56 per cent. But no, that is not good enough! The Leader of the Opposition does not believe in imputation. He did not take such action. He says that the 49 per cent, 40 per cent, 29 per cent, and 24 per cent rates are not good enough; we must grease the tracks for the millionaires whose net wealth has gone up enormously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is about fact. The honourable member had his chance. He was a Minister in the last coalition Government. John Howard was the Treasurer. He had the chance to do all this. He was not living through the kinds of fiscal disciplines this Government is living through. He never had to bring a deficit down from 5 per cent of gross domestic product to 1.4 per cent of GDP; we did. We have cut the tax rates, we have got rid of the double tax on dividends and we alone have removed the poverty traps for the poor in the bottom end of the social security system. Right across the spectrum-high taxes, high interest rates, high inflation and massive foreign debt-the previous Government did nothing about these problems. The fundamental problem of our lack of competitiveness springs from the Howard years. The growth of our debt started in that time and has increased inexorably since. We now see an Opposition without any thread of credibility, without any policy framework. I repeat, as I said at the beginning of my speech, that the speech of the Leader of the Opposition was melancholy. It sounded as though it was simply a recital of the things he once wanted and stood for and which he can see all slipping away. He is right. It is slipping away and he will slip away. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) will also slip away and if many honourable members opposite are not careful they will slip away with them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a bit disappointed; I thought Gerry Hand might have come in to see whether Gordon Scholes had moved aside. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) came into the House and talked about being a dentist. He talked about looking over somebody's old work. If I had that sort of a dentist looking over me in a patient's chair I would want a lock and key on my gold fillings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the last three years all we have seen has been a progressive decline. We all know that our country is now more than ever in need of economic direction. We are going flat out down a one way street the wrong way. We all know that the Treasurer's record, above all, bears little scrutiny. Indeed, people need to remember that it is now more than three years since the Labor Government came to office. The result is that Australia is now in a significantly worse economic position and so is each Australian. We all know that the Treasurer has been able to increase his public sector borrowings by $24,000m in his three Budgets. We know that his Government has lifted interest rates over those three years, over his three Budgets, from fifth to second in the items of expenditure. We know that because of his performance every statistic today sees Australia having lost that advantage which the wages pause, which the last coalition Government introduced, would have given us in overcoming our problems. We know that the benefit of the international revival which this Government enjoyed in 1983 was blown by the big spending, big taxing polices of the Hawke Labor Government. We know that since 1983 the situation for the mums and dads and the kids of Australia is worse than it ever had been. </PARA>
<PARA> If anyone is in doubt, I think it is worth remembering the fundamental problem that not one of those areas that the Treasurer was speaking about sees an ordinary Australian better off. Indeed the Treasurer, who has just spoken to us, has not even realised that a taxpayer on average weekly earnings who in 1983 was paying 17 1/2c in every dollar in tax will be paying 20.5c in every dollar in tax after the proposed second round of tax cuts in July. None of these people are the high fliers that the Treasurer is talking about. An Australian on average weekly earnings needs $15 a week more in tax cuts just to bring him back to where he was in 1983. So much for the much vaunted tax reform that the Treasurer has just been talking about. We probably need to remember that there is a lot more to it than that. I am interested in the childish behaviour of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It is about as irrational as that of a man who has the responsibility of the most senior political office in this country being cut off radio because he made a bit of a joke that everybody in the radio station was embarrassed to hear him make. Here he is, holding it up. It is great! That is the sort of childish behaviour we would expect from somebody on the back bench. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that while the Treasurer is trying to get his tax returns done and while the Prime Minister is playing around the golf course Australia is going to the poor house. We need to worry about the present massive loss of our economic lifeblood through the current account deficit. Yesterday's figures were the watershed for the Hawke Government-nearly $1,300m. There has been all this talk about the J-curve. We heard over the last two months about the current account deficit publication and how suddenly imports were down and exports were up and that all Australians could expect the picture to change. But what happened yesterday? The moment of truth arrived for the Prime Minister. Suddenly we saw the inability of the Prime Minister's Government to escape and not from the consequences of its chronic balance of payments problem caused by other countries. This is the man who pretends to be Prime Minister. Honourable members will remember the `yap, yap' of men of yesterday. I suggest to this man that if he is unable to assume properly the mantle of being Prime Minister, it is about time we had the election that he has been considering over the last few weeks. He will find defeat very ignominious. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the blowout in our domestic deficit and our Budget deficit, high interest rates, massive taxes, wages and on-costs that are way out of line with those around the world, an inflation rate four to five times higher than that of comparable countries, pricing us out of world markets, and, above all, the steady increase in already massive government spending are the real causes of the economic malaise in this country. The reality is not the overseas market that he complains about, but his high taxing, high spending, wage conciliatory approach has given to this country a heritage which, sadly, is leading many Australians backwards. If he thinks it is all a great farce, I invite him to come up to my electorate or to any of those farming electorates where the wheat growers, the rice growers, the dairymen and the sugar growers of Australia are finding it harder and harder to survive; where the small businessmen-big businessmen yesterday and small businessmen today-will be bankrupt tomorrow and why? It is because this Government is driving them into an impossible economic condition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister thought he was being very funny during Question Time. He talked about the rate of increase in Queensland. He failed to realise that the rate of increase to which he referred was a figure taken over three years. His achievement is a 35 per cent increase in bankruptcies over the same period last year. Over a 12-month period the Hawke Government has achieved a 35 per cent increase in bankruptcies over the preceding period. We know that, sadly, we are looking down the throat of a new record, of reaching 8,000 for the full year. We know that our current account deficit in 1986 was the worst for 35 years. In 1987 it is again expected to be the second largest, after the United States, for the whole of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Yet this man has the hide-he has left, and thank goodness for that-to go over to Switzerland and to lecture countries such as Japan and Germany and the countries of the European Community whose inflation rates and interest rates are so much lower than ours. It would be far better if this man stayed at home and learned a few basic sums. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic requirement of this country is that taxes must be reduced. We have a government whose revenues have increased by 61 per cent, from $44 billion in the last Fraser-Anthony Budget, introduced by my colleague the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), to $71 billion in the revenue receipts of the last Keating Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that this Government is host to the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Apart from all those other things, apart from its tax record, apart from its spending record, we now have, in mark III of an accord, which is better called the discord, a 14.4 per cent wage demand which is going to drive even more small businessmen and more farmers out of operation in any sort of a profitable way. </PARA>
<PARA> The real problem is that wherever we go in Australia average Australians are being affected by the creation of this Government. It is not the product of other countries, it is the product of the Hawke Government. The three Budgets of this Labor Government have completely blown the tremendous opportunity that it had when it came into office in 1983. Let me reiterate: The drought broke, the world economy improved and the Government had the enormous benefit of the 12-month wages pause, introduced by the previous coalition Government. Not only has all that gone but today ordinary Australians, on average weekly earnings, would need a $15 a week increased tax cut before they would be in the same position they were in only three years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, the problem is not only there. We know, from figures for the commencement of homes and from the car industry, that in the Inter- national Year of Shelter for the Homeless every one of the statistics is worse. The public housing waiting list stands at 160,000 today; 60 per cent higher than when Labor came into office. </PARA>
<PARA> But the sad part is not the effect on the pockets of the more affluent of our community, it is the effect on the pockets of ordinary Australians. Unless fundamentally different policies are adopted, Australia is going to go down the gurgle hole. What Australia needs now, more than ever, is direction. Mothers want security for their children. Prime Minister Hawke has given an economic speech. The Hawke-Keating combination is an unmitigated, unreliable, unnecessary and unacceptable disaster. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sad thing really is that we are seeing the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), going down without much of a fight. In all my time in the Parliament, I have found that whatever one has felt about him when he is under pressure he usually delivers. But what we have heard today is a speech in which there has been absolutely no content. That is the fundamental problem with the Opposition. It is quite unable to cope with the pressures of opposition. It is unable to do the kind of disciplined work which is needed to produce any sort of detailed alternative policy. The Leader of the National Party reflects that malaise; an inability to come to terms with the hard questions that this Government has had to face, and any government would have to face, when governing during periods of very difficult economic circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing to be said about our period in government is that we have seen improvement in employment and growth, and that is the fundamental thrust of what we are about. We have seen results in the aggregate figures between 1982-83 and 1985-86. Real gross domestic product grew by 14.1 per cent. That meant a real increase in the after tax incomes of households, which grew by 12.4 per cent over the same period. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the capacity within the Australian community to support family living standards, we need to look no further than at a recent survey by the Reserve Bank of Australia which showed a 51 per cent increase in corporate profits in Australia between 1983-84 and 1985-86. That occurred at the same time as a recognition by the trade union movement in this country, and I believe by most sections of the Australian community, that there needed to be a considerable degree of restraint. That restraint has been delivered in terms of wages-not so that those profits would be dissipated, but so that investment could continue to occur, to rebuild the Australian economy, and so that it would be possible to achieve some direction of expenditure in relation to the average living standards of Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> That theme of fairness, which we have seen throughout the life of this Government, is never reflected in the Opposition's policies. When Opposition members talk about incentive, they are talking about more incentive for people at the higher end of the spectrum who are already getting significant tax cuts. Opposition members do not talk about incentive for or assistance to people in the middle or low income groups. It would be extraordinary at this point in time if one were to advocate seriously policies to deliver the kinds of tax cuts that are being promised in the rhetoric of the Opposition's policy. Of course, all we have at present from the Opposition is ever more confusing rhetoric. We have failed to get from the Opposition at any point a real policy decision. We get words, and then the words are contradicted: Sometimes they are contradicted by the Liberal Party; sometimes by the wet side; sometimes by the dry side; sometimes by the National Party here, and sometimes by Joh in Queensland. There are always different voices, different messages and different themes; but it is all empty rhetoric. There is never anything of substance. Meanwhile, the think tanks are beavering away and producing ideas that are being knocked over in the Liberal Party room, in the National Party room, by Joh or by some combination of all three. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the Opposition's policies? What can we really expect from the Opposition? The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said today that the first thing on his agenda-what he is really about-is to achieve much greater cuts in expenditure than have been achieved by the present Government. He said that the deep knife has to go in. The shadow Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), suggested that there have to be program cuts-deep cuts into some of the major programs of government. It is difficult to understand, as we do not get any indications or statements from it, what the Opposition is about. But let us look at what the think tanks are coming up with. We know from a report in the Australian Financial Review this morning that the Centre of Policy Studies has been given $1m to help to develop policies for the Liberal Party of Australia. Spending cuts of the order of $5 billion are proposed to finance tax cuts for people on the very highest of incomes. What are the proposed cuts? The Centre talks about the reintroduction of substantial tertiary fees and an amount of $1 billion; a reduction in superannuation tax expenditure saving $1 billion in terms of retirement income; income testing of family allowances saving $500m; greater application of social insurance principles to unemployment and cuts in terms of unemployment benefits of half a billion dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively, we can look more towards another one of those think tanks, and no doubt a very influential one, given the influential role of John Hyde, which, in its publication entitled `Mandate to Govern: A handbook for the next Australian Government', made a number of other suggestions to the Opposition as to where it might achieve those deep program cuts. It suggested that we could end bulk billing and change the method of calculating Medicare rebates-in other words, to destroy Medicare; a 12.5 per cent cut in funding for universities and colleges, with the reintroduction of fees, and a new voucher system for secondary education; skipping one or more of the indexation adjustments of pensions and benefits; tapering family allowances; winding up the community employment program; terminating the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement; winding up the first home owners scheme; removing all interest rate controls; and abolishing the Department of Housing and Construction. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things about John Hyde is that there is a certain degree of honesty about him. We thought that was so about the Leader of the Opposition. It was thought that Honest John Howard was someone who would tell us where things were really at, where he was going and what he would do. But again today he called for deep cuts, significant cuts. The Liberal Party's ex-leader, its future leader, the honourable member for Kooyong, who left because he would not say what he was really about, also called for program cuts. But where do we get any concrete proposals? This morning the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) was involved in an interview with Julian Disney, the President of the Australian Council of Social Service Inc. The honourable member for Richmond was asked to state what the Opposition's policy is. But, of course, the honourable member for Richmond would not say what his policy is because he does not have a policy. He may have attitudes; he may have feelings; he may love the world. But he will not say one significant word about the Opposition's policy, except to make very clear and to defend the Opposition's very specific decision to repeal our taxes. The ACOSS news release states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the course of discussion with the Opposition we will continue to emphasise our total rejection of proposals to weaken or abolish the existing taxes on fringe benefits, capital gains and lump sum superannuation payments. These proposals would inevitably disadvantage hundreds of thousands of families with children, especially those on low and middle incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>It was very impressive to see Julian Disney, the President of ACOSS, look at both sides of the equation. Sure, he wants to see the Government do more in the area of expenditure on families. But he was prepared to look at the other side of the equation. He was prepared to come up with proposals which would contain some balance. We will never get that from the Opposition because it does not want such specific or concrete policies because, if its policies become specific or concrete, they become absurd. That is what the Premier of Queensland is; he is absurd. He has put up propositions which have no substance whatever. He runs around the country with his wild propositions and he is wreaking absolute havoc on the other side of the House. No one on the other side of the House, including the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Richmond and the honourable member for Kooyong, is prepared to come in and say anything specific or concrete about positive policies because the Opposition does not have such policies. That is not what Opposition members are working on. Opposition members are working on the numbers game. They are involved in constant battles to remove each other. It is as though there is some significant difference between the various factions of the Liberal Party, which have run absolutely riot in the Parliament. We have had members from the Opposition side come to tell members on this side of the House how the numbers are going and how soon they think there will be a change. But we know very well that it does not matter whether there is a change because there is no substance within the Opposition; it is empty. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House share a belief in the basic intelligence of the Australian people. The Australian people recognise what the problems are that we have had to deal with and which have been outlined by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). They recognise that it is a time in which we have to make some hard decisions and in which some people have to give up what they have for the sake of overall fairness. People do recognise that and they are prepared to make that sacrifice. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report I have just tabled is the second report from the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform appointed for this Parliament. The Committee, in March 1985, decided to review the operation of the 1983-84 amendments to the Electoral Act in the light of the experience of the 1984 general election. The report I have just tabled is the result of that inquiry. Honourable members will already have received a copy of the report, which was authorised for distribution by Madam Speaker during the summer adjournment pursuant to the resolution of the House on 27 November last. The inquiry found that the 1983 reforms had been effectively implemented and resulted in major improvements to the operation of the Commonwealth electoral system. Consequently, despite the fact that 156 recommendations are made in the report, it does not propose radical or dramatic changes. The recommendations relate to fine tuning rather than a general overhaul of the Electoral Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first recommendation proposes that future parliaments should appoint a joint standing committee to overview the electoral process and to monitor the work of the Australian Electoral Commission. As a statutory authority independent of direct control by the Government, the Australian Electoral Commission operates in a political vacuum. This inquiry has demonstrated that a forum in which the AEC can test party political and public opinion on proposals it has under consideration is a useful safety valve for the Commission. The Committee found that the 1984 redistribution of electoral divisions was undertaken and completed by the AEC in a most efficient and satisfactory fashion. It makes some recommendations in the report which relate almost entirely to improving the mechanics of the process of future redistributions. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the electoral rolls and their maintenance, the Committee is proposing that the information on the rolls should be more accessible. As well as the hard copy of the electoral rolls now available to the public for purchase, the AEC should be permitted to sell magnetic tapes and microfiche at commercial rates. The Committee is also proposing that, as well as the elector's name and address, the publicly available information on the roll should be extended to include the gender, occupation and date of birth of the elector. This would not involve electors providing any additional information to the Electoral Commission beyond the information now provided on the electoral claim card. Honourable members will recall that gender and occupation were printed on the rolls prior to 1983 and that their removal engendered some dissatisfaction which was reflected in the submissions received. The report emphasises the importance of the maintenance of the rolls for the integrity of the electoral process. To ensure that rolls are up to date, the Committee recommends that annual habitation reviews should be undertaken by the AEC. This would ensure that electors are enrolled correctly for their divisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee reviewed the position of prisoners and their entitlement to the franchise. Currently, prisoners under sentence for an offence punishable by sentence of imprisonment for five years or more are not entitled to the Commonwealth franchise. The report proposes that the franchise be extended to all prisoners except those convicted of treason. There is a dissenting recommendation on that point. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the registration of parties and candidates, the Committee has recommended the repeal of Part XII of the Electoral Act which requires the registration of political candidates. The inquiry found that this register served no useful purpose as it is essentially a duplication of the nomination for candidature process. These processes caused much extra work and expense for all concerned and no real benefit accrued from it. Part XI, registration of political parties, is not affected by this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered whether patients in hospitals and people in nursing homes should continue to have a postal vote where they have access to mobile polling. It concluded that they should retain this right. Mobile polling facilities should, however, be made comprehensive and provided at all hospitals and nursing homes. The Committee recommends that it be an offence under the Electoral Act for a person associated with the administration of a hospital or nursing home to influence a patient or inmate as to the candidate or candidates for whom that person would vote. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received evidence from the AEC and political parties on the question of the high informal vote for the House of Representatives in the 1984 general election. The Committee concluded that the rise in the informal vote does not justify changes to the formality requirements of the voting system. Reduction of the informal vote will best be achieved by an educative program at each election to ensure that electors understand the complexities and differences between the voting systems of the two Houses of Parliament and the requirement to be observed for recording a formal vote. Some technical changes to the Senate scrutiny procedures are recommended. </PARA>
<PARA> In chapter 8 of this report, the Committee considers the operation of the electoral funding and financial disclosure provisions of the Electoral Act. The Committee found that the system had operated effectively and recommendations made relate mainly to machinery aspects of the scheme. Problems had emerged in relation to the disclosure of gifts by third parties where these were channelled through intermediaries. The Committee concluded that these problems were amenable to solution through a process of negotiation. Should there be evidence of attempts to subvert the intention of the funding scheme by avoiding the clear intention of the scheme then the AEC should employ its investigative and coercive powers to the full to ensure that the scheme operates as intended. The Committee itself would respond to any evidence that the scheme was being undermined and, if necessary, invoke the investigative powers of the Parliament to expose attempts to undermine the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> A development of considerable importance for electoral law and practice generally was the dispute over the election for the Legislative Council Province of Nunawading at the 1985 State election in Victoria. In the last chapter of the report the Committee analyses in depth the decision of His Honour Mr Justice Starke in the Nunawading Court of Disputed Returns and the implications of His Honour's findings for the Commonwealth electoral system The report makes recommendations chiefly to ensure that ballots are not excluded from the scrutiny as a result of electoral officials' errors that led to the nullifying of the Nunawading election result. The report recommends that the Electoral Act be amended so that, in the event of a deadlocked election, the result no longer be determined by a Presiding Officer's casting vote. </PARA>
<PARA> In future cases of deadlock there should be an immediate recount of votes and, if the deadlock persists, the Presiding Officer should declare the election accordingly deadlocked. Upon receipt of this advice the AEC would take action to file a petition disputing the election. In these circumstances the Court of Disputed Returns would be required to determine the case within three months and either declare a winner or order the election be held again. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee wishes to acknowledge the assistance provided by all those who have made submissions to the inquiry. It particularly wishes to thank Dr Colin Hughes, the Australian Electoral Commissioner; Mr Andrejs Cirulis, the Deputy Electoral Commissioner; and the staff of the AEC. As well as providing, very promptly, submissions on all aspects of the operations of the Electoral Act, the Commissioner and his staff have made themselves available at short notice to give evidence or consult with the Committee or to provide additional written responses to requests by Committee members for supporting information and analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also wishes to praise the AEC for the high quality of its research and analysis which is a contribution of great assistance to all Australians concerned with ensuring a continuance of the tradition of equitable electoral practices for Commonwealth elections. The Secretary of the Committee was Mr Donald Nairn and the report was typed by Mrs Elizabeth Kemp. The Committee is very grateful for their assistance. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The second report by the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform is a very important report. I hope that honourable members get time to study its recommendations in detail. I say `in detail' because 156 recommendations have been brought down by the Committee. It will require intensive work by honourable members if they are to appreciate all the recommendations we are putting before the House. I would like to associate myself with remarks made by the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), praising Mr Nairn, the Secretary of the Joint Select Committee, his support staff and the many organisations and individuals who made submissions to the Committee during its hearings. I would like to pay tribute also to the Australian Electoral Commission for the high quality of its submissions and, in particular, of the evidence which was given to the Committee on many occasions by Dr Colin Hughes, the Australian Electoral Commissioner; and Mr Andrejs Cirulis, the Deputy Electoral Commissioner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to make a few brief comments about several of the Committee's more important recommendations. The first point I touch on is the Committee's recommendation that the Electoral Act be amended to allow all prisoners to cast a vote in future elections. The current Act disqualifies persons convicted of an offence which has a maximum penalty of five years or more. The Electoral Commission reported to the Committee that it has had major problems in identifying which prisoners should be permitted to vote and which prisoners should be disqualified. The reason is simple. The Act requires prisoners to be disqualified from voting if the maximum penalty for their offence is more than five years. It does not refer to the actual penalty but to the maximum penalty which could have been applied by a judge. The prison authorities around Australia have great difficulty in telling the Electoral Commission the maximum penalty which corresponds to the offence for which a particular prisoner was sentenced. The Committee concluded that prisoners, like all other citizens, should be forced to meet their civil and political obligations by being required to vote at all elections. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to note that one of the first comments yesterday by the new Special Minister of State, Senator Michael Tate, was his call for an increase in the level of enrolment from young Australians. One of the more innovative amendments to the Electoral Act in 1983 was the provision for provisional enrolment. I can see that that has the support of my colleague the honourable member for Cowan (Ms Jakobsen), who is nodding her head at the moment. The Parliament's decision to allow young Australians to obtain provisional enrolment when they turn 17 allowed almost 4,000 more young Australians to vote. The provision worked this way: People were able to enrol when they were 17-before they turned 18-but they were not allowed to cast a vote unless they turned 18 before the date of the election. Four thousand young Australians who were 17 at the close of the rolls-when they were no longer able to submit an electoral enrolment form-who filled out provisional enrolment forms and who turned 18 before the date of the election were able to cast a vote because we allowed provisional enrolment for 17-year-olds. That measure also has the endorsement of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also made several recommendations for voting in nursing homes. There was a lot of discussion within the Committee about what were the best procedures to be adopted for people in nursing homes. I am glad to say that, while there was a lot of debate in the Committee, the final recommendation had the support of all members of the Committee. That recommendation provided for mobile polling facilities to be provided wherever possible in all hospitals and nursing homes so that voting by residents of nursing homes, wherever possible, could be supervised by officials of the Electoral Commission, whose impartiality is beyond question. The Committee has also recommended that it be made an offence for a proprietor of a nursing home or a staff member of a nursing home to seek to influence a patient when that patient is seeking to cast a vote. That recommendation certainly has my endorsement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also recommended that the penalty for not voting be increased. While at the moment the Act provides for a maximum fine of $50 to be imposed by a court, through administrative measures the Electoral Commission can apply a maximum fine of only $4 to anyone who has failed to vote. In many cases that does not even cover the costs of inward and outward correspondence to those people who have neglected to cast a vote. The Electoral Commission submitted that this was ridiculously low. I agree with its analysis. The Committee, by a majority-I am sad to say that we did not have the support of the Liberal and National parties on this measure-recommended that that administrative penalty be increased to a maximum of $20. I think that is a reasonable fine which the Electoral Commission can apply through administrative measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the 1984 election, when there was a large increase in the level of informal voting for the House of Representatives, there was a lot of debate in Australia. In fact, the level of informal voting for the House of Representatives on average throughout Australia increased from 2.1 per cent to 6.4 per cent. That massive increase was very disturbing to many members of the Committee. The good news was that the level of informal voting for the Senate fell markedly because of the introduction of the list voting system. In fact, the level of informal voting for the Senate fell from 9.9 per cent in 1983 to only 4.3 per cent at the 1984 election. The Electoral Commission carried out an analysis of the informal votes for the lower House. Seventy-four per cent of the informal votes were due to people using ticks, crosses or defective numbering and in most cases they were informal because people placed only a number 1 next to their preferred candidate and forgot that for the House of Representatives one must extend a preference to all the other candidates. As the honourable member for Warringah has stated, the Committee has decided on balance not to recommend a change in the voting system but to recommend that the Electoral Commission improve its advertising prior to the next election and also seek to mail out to all electors detailed information on the voting procedures to ensure that wherever possible ordinary Australians will cast a formal vote. I commend the Committee's report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill 1986 and the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill 1986, which are being debated cognately, is to allow the Australian Industry Development Corporation to opt out of the requirements to have a government guarantee in relation to its fixed interest raisings and to impose a one half of one per cent fee on government instrumentalities that use a government guarantee. An allowance is to be made in relation to the Commonwealth Bank insofar as this fee will apply only to overseas loans and will be one quarter of one per cent. Special consideration is given to the bank because of the interrelated dealings in currencies as well as foreign debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is not opposing these Bills. However, it would like to raise just a few matters that come up as a consequence of these Bills. The Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill seeks to implement the proposal introduced in the Budget to allow the Commonwealth to charge a percentage, not to exceed half of one per cent, of the amount that is borrowed on or after 1 July 1986 by Commonwealth business enterprises-in other words, Qantas Airways Ltd, Australia Post, Telecom Australia and the like. However, special arrangements have been made in relation to Commonwealth financial institutions. In the case of the AIDC the charge is to be one half of one per cent. However, as I said previously, the Corporation will be exempt, as it will be at its discretion whether it applies for this guarantee or not. </PARA>
<PARA> It was always my understanding in the financial world that when Telecom came into the market it was a raising by a government instrumentality with a government guarantee, for which in those days there was presumably no charge, and special status was given to it. It was much easier for the stockbroker and the underwriter concerned to place Telecom in the market in earlier days. It is the responsibility of the underwriter not only to place the prime instrument but also to secure a secondary market in that particular stock. That is no small responsibility of an underwriter to a client-in this case Telecom because of its ongoing demand for money. Telecom is always in the market, it is a substantial borrower of funds throughout Australia. Its ability to raise money is related to the secondary market which must be created. It is in the creation of the secondary market that the use or non-use of the government guarantee is significant. As a government guarantee is applied to the current Telecom issue, or to any other government instrumentality, it is acceptable as a trustee security. That market is substantial and that type of security is used widely. If a government instrumentality opts not to use the government guarantee, quite clearly the market would have to take into account the desirability or the commercial degree of difference of a precise government guarantee and the implied government guarantee. Because Telecom is owned by the Government one must therefore assume that in the end, if it went bust, there would be a possibility of the government of the day being called upon to bail out that instrumentality. </PARA>
<PARA> Having drawn the distinction between the guarantee and the non-guarantee, and having pointed to the secondary market and the high probability that a difference would develop on that market, I bring the House back to the price that will be charged. One half of one per cent is, in commercial terms, a substantial amount to be charged for a 10-year bond. In fact, a seven-year bond is Telecom's most common instrument in relation to a government guarantee. Most of the underwriting fees for government securities are of the order of 2 per cent, depending on the market conditions at the time. An extra half of one per cent is a high price to pay. Because of that point, it seems to me that the Commonwealth Treasury has unduly given itself some extra kudos or dividend from its own instrumentalities. Those users of these instrumentalities are, of course, the people who pay for the increased government charge that flows from it. That is one of the principal items I see from the use of government securities in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of the Australian bond market is a significant factor in this. In the late 1950s the Treasury established the official market deal in Australia. It was hard to get takers in every State to join the capital market. I can well remember that in Queensland they virtually had to give a guarantee to a broker to join in a syndicate in the first official money market operations. The people who dealt in that were required to deal in government securities. They had to be government securities and there was no doubt about the guarantee. As time went by and as the markets developed we saw the additional players come into focus. I can recall that when the unofficial market got going and the commercial papers started to come into this the degree of measurement of risk came about for the first time, and that the spread of interest between the government guarantee, the semi-government guarantee-semi-government securities-and the commercial paper had a traditional spread of 3 per cent. This brought about enormous development in the capital markets of Australia and led to the involvement of merchant banks in this particular area and in some stockbroking areas. The reason they did it was that they funded in this area government paper, semi-government papers in terms of city councils, shire councils and more latterly bills of exchange written by clients and endorsed by banks or straight bank paper or merchant banking paper. This development has added enormously to the cash liquidity in the Australian economy. The flow from that has had a great bearing on money supply growth and on the use of these instruments in the whole of the monetary policy in Australia. The Bill before us which allows the Government to charge in this area up to half of one per cent for the use of the government guarantee is in my view an additional impost in an area which has functioned particularly well for 20-odd years. The cost imposed is a very high charge of a guarantee which the market determines, in assessing the risk and the classification of a security between a government, semi-government and the commercial sector, to be far less than that. I hope that those who will use it will look to it in relation to those judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Industries Development Corporation has been exempted from the compulsory use of the government guarantee. It is its option under this Bill to come to the Treasurer to seek his guarantee. I commend this move. There is no doubt that in the market-place the AIDC is known as a government merchant bank. It is substantially funded by the taxpayers of Australia. If I recall correctly, its paid up capital is some $87.5m. It has operated for a number of years and has established a wide clientele. In view of that particular enterprise it has carried out it is time that people saw the AIDC for what it is. When we take the last profit and loss account of the AIDC-and from memory I think it made something like $17m-and place that against the paid up capital, we see that it is doing not much better than the Commonwealth bond rate. I suggest that operating on the scale it does, with the borrowings it has in that account to fund, the charge of an extra half of one per cent is just another government impost on a particular instrumentality which it does not want and is not necessary in the main. It is a straight obligation to pay.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I will comment briefly on the operations of the AIDC. When it first got under way there was no doubt in the market-places of Australia that it was the last stop. When one could not sell securities anywhere else, one tried the AIDC. There is no doubt that in the first 10 years that its security bag was well laden with dead wood. It is certainly a credit--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr MOORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a funny way to look at it. I did not know that government ran an investment policy on the AIDC. It is a strange way to look at it. It is the responsibility of the executives of the AIDC to make the day to day decisions in relation to their investment program. It is its investment programs that have got that body into this peculiar position. It is to the credit of Mr Thomas, who has recently retired, that in looking at recent accounts most of the past debt appeared to have been washed out of the accounts and it is now in a much healthier position than it ever has been in its whole period of operation. I read a recent review of its activities. They are spread over a wide range of areas from Siddons Industries Ltd, Mildara Wines Ltd, a substantial role in the rationalisation of the white goods industry, right through to the Australian Biomedical Corporation Ltd-with which it is in partnership with Wormalds-to a commitment of $200m to Woodside Petroleum for a gas project which I guess weighs heavily in its balance sheet at the moment, and some substantial involvement in real estate development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those activities strikes me as a very wide-ranging commercial involvement, which raises again the question of what the Government is doing owning an institution such as this, when the functions it performs can most readily, and probably more wisely, be carried on by the private sector. What is the purpose of an $87.5m capital injection to run an institution such as this, which has nothing more than a commercial interest, rather than any particular government policy about its type of development? If that is the case, all we are doing is promoting a Government instrumentality to compete in the merchant banking sector; a sector which is vastly oversupplied. The Government is going along with an AIDC arrangement which fails to meet any policy objectives, as far as I can see, and when the AIDC is no more than a competitor in the area of merchant banks. That being the case, I can see a wonderful opportunity for the taxpayers to be lightened of that commitment and of the total funding operations of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to interest rates in Australia, because the Bills before the House undoubtedly will have some impact on interest rates. In the past few years the importance of merchant banks and the financial markets has been seen by the Government, particularly in relation to the freeing of the exchange rate. As the Government has freed the exchange rate it has depended more and more on the use of official money market dealers and the Reserve Bank of Australia to hold the currency at certain deemed levels. There seems to be a remarkably close relationship between the Australian dollar and the US dollars and a lesser propensity to support the trade weighted index in relation to currencies, but a great propensity to hold the Australian dollar against the United States dollar. In view of those things, the importance of interest rates and the structure which the Government is using through the money markets to hold the currency come into play. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth while looking at the movements in interests rates which have occurred in the past two years on official Treasury bonds. We can see a movement from 11.8 per cent in September 1984 to 14.3 per cent one year later and 15.15 per cent in 1986; a constant move upwards. This is where the Government has failed completely, because in the movement of its prime interest rate setting instrument, the 10-year Commonwealth bond, it has forced the commercial interest rates out of the reach of the average user. It is no wonder that business is struggling and is not investing in capital development. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I mentioned in a straight line the comparisons for September 1984, 1985 and 1986 in bonds, let us look at the comparisons for the prime rate for trading bank accounts for the same period. In 1984 it was 13.5 per cent; in 1985 it was 18.5 per cent; and in 1986 it was 19 per cent-a constant upward movement of the prime rate for three years running. Little wonder that people are complaining about the Government, the management of the economy and the general level of indifference of the Government. If one is paying a 19 per cent prime rate, God help the person who is looking for consumer credit and living on Bankcard and the like. It is no wonder that people are having difficulty in meeting their commitments and no wonder, that the circumstances in which the Government has allowed the official bond rate to be used to prop up the currency, that must inevitably flow down the road to prop up interest rates right across the board. I have pointed out the prime interest rate for the past three years 13.5, 18.5 and 19 per cent. It is an appalling record. No wonder that bankruptcies are high, housing repossessions are going up, housing is declining and capital reinvestment is nowhere near the level adequate for this nation now. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I welcome the Government's decisions in recent times to free up the capital markets to some degree-it was long overdue. That development has been most beneficial to the financial maturity of Australia and to the internationalisation of credit and money. Overseas interests in the Australian capital market have increased enormously in the past two years. Japanese purchases of Commonwealth securities and semi-government securities have been about $8 billion to $10 billion in the past 18 months. A substantial redemption of that will take place in March-April this year, which will have some impact on exchange rates, especially if the Japanese choose not to renew the deposits. As the Japanese are well in front, I would be surprised if they did not. That shows that we have been able to grapple with and handle the very complex areas, to match the overseas markets, provide the services and securities which enable this Government to fund its debts, and that Australian industries, in some cases through swaps of currencies and instruments, have been able to fund their business activities at a more reasonable level than the domestic rates, which has allowed Australian commercial enterprises to buy abroad, hedge currencies and protect their risks in a very changing and moving market place. The Opposition will not oppose the Bills. </PARA>

I understand the difficult position which he is in at present, what with all the problems in Queensland, the push from Sir Joh and all the simplistic solutions that are coming down, but one would have hoped that we might have had some indication of the Opposition's industry policy, of what it really thinks about the Australian Industry Development Corporation and about the role of such a body as the Corporation in government and in the Australian economy.

The honourable member for Ryan said something to the effect of, `Well, perhaps since this is a burden on the taxpayer we ought to consider ways of removing that burden'. He could not come out and say: `Look, it is still our policy to abolish the Australian Industry Development Corporation'. That is the policy of the New Right.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Hon. John Howard, the present Leader of the Opposition. That is what the Opposition's policies would bring into place. The honourable member for Ryan mentioned that for a long time the AIDC could not really get going. That occurred under the Opposition's policies. The Opposition shackled it. It would not let it expand and do what it wanted to do. It could not invest in new and exciting projects in manufacturing. Instead, it was forced to invest in projects which had no foundation. It was hobbled by the Opposition. Since the Hawke Labor Government came to power in 1983, it has brought in substantial changes and has injected capital into the Corporation. There has been a massive increase in its activity and profitability. For those honour- able members opposite who think that public investment and enterprise are always foolish, that they never achieve the development of industry, and that they are always unprofitable, the Australian Industry Development Corporation, under the Labor Government, stands as a monument which shows that those statements are lies. There is no question but that public enterprise, done properly, through bodies such as the AIDC, can not merely help to stimulate our industries in manufacturing but can also help to save the situation for us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us consider what is happening in Australia in private enterprise and manufacturing. Record profits are being made in many industries. Are those profits being reinvested in productive enterprises and in manufacturing? They are not being invested at the level which one would have hoped and required. Why is that the case? It is because many of our entrepreneurs prefer the quick buck rather than investment in production in their own country. They like to make huge profits, but they are not interested in setting up new enterprises and in developing those enterprises. The Government has put into place a large number of schemes to increase their profitability and profit shares. In return, do we get sensible investment? No; we get ideological objections. Instead of looking at the matter in strictly economic terms, they object to investment. They listen to the gibberish of the New Right and the extremists who have dominated conservative politics.

<PARA> The Corporation has a crucial role to play. It is playing that role. I have already mentioned that the Corporation has increased its profitability and its capital base. The Government is responsive to the desires of the Board of the AIDC. We should forget about the ideological objections of the New Right and honourable members opposite. Let us call for an even further investment program on the part of the AIDC. Let the public sector invest in productive, sensible and potentially profitable projects in our manufacturing industries. Let us reopen the factories that were closed during the period of the Fraser Government, modernise their equipment, and produce, because the circumstances are very good at present. The massive devaluation of the Australian dollar, which we have paid for through a series of painful adjustments, has made it profitable to invest in manufacturing. The circumstances are such that they warrant such investment. Unfortunately, because of ideological objections and the hoo-ha that has been developed by the New Right, we are not getting the level of investment in this country that we should be getting because of the objective circumstances, especially the devaluation. In those circumstances, the AIDC has a role to play. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the Corporation. I call for an even bigger role for the Corporation. Let it be expanded even further.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Corporation does not want to be privatised. That was an inane remark by the honourable member opposite. The Corporation wants to expand and it will be supported in that process by the Government. We support the expansion of the public sector in such matters. In view of the honourable member's interjections-he has only recently become a member of the House of Representatives and he has a lot to learn-let me say that the conservatives have done a good job in smearing the public sector of this country. They have attacked and smeared the public sector. They have reached the point where anything that is done by the public sector is seen to be nasty and awful. The record of bodies such as the Australian Industry Development Corporation shows that, if they are given the autonomy to make the investment decisions that they need to make, through a regulated process in the public sector, they can have both profitability and efficiency and they can continue with something that is owned by the people as a whole and is not merely in the hands of a few millionaires. Such bodies can take into account, as is the charter of the AIDC under the Labor Government, the national interest and, therefore, they can urge investment in certain risk areas in which some private capital is not prepared to invest, especially areas of high technology in which we need to invest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The people of Australia should recognise that the smearing job that has been done against the public sector is incorrect and that the Australian public sector is, and deserves to be, credited for the excellent role it has played in public investment in industry. I look forward to further expansion and development of that area. It is only through that process that we will achieve what is necessary; that is, a turnaround in our industrial development, especially the development of export oriented industries, as well as import replacement industries, so we can deal with a problem that was put on our shoulders by the conservatives for many years-the balance of payments and the extraordinary position which we got ourselves into because of neglect and mismanagement over many years by the conservatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Ryan tried to make certain points about interest rates and the investment program. There are answers to these problems but he has not put forward anything at all. I do not speak about him personally, as I like the honourable member; I speak about the Opposition. The Opposition has not put forward anything at all. Even Sir Joh does not have any idea how we are going to get an investment program going. Let me tell honourable members that a flat tax cannot solve every problem in the universe. In fact, it will not solve any problem in the universe. So let me say this: What we ought to be seriously considering is a program which offers special interest rates or soft loans of some kind. We ought to seriously consider such a program for investment in the productive sector, in manufacturing. This is a real concrete proposal that the Opposition and the Government ought to be thinking about. It is my view that if we consider these sorts of suggestions rather than the gibberish coming from the Opposition side of the House we can look at moving capital from the unproductive areas into the productive areas of manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let me say once again that the Australian Industry Development Corporation, and public sector instrumentalities generally, have a very big role to play in the sustenance of our industrial development, and if those in the New Right and the mad extremists of the National Party get their way and such bodies are abolished this country will be faced with a massive employment crisis and the gains that we have made in difficult circumstances will all be lost. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I always find speeches by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) rich in irony. Not only do I share his view of the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) but I can also reciprocate that view. The honourable member for Calwell is a nice man, he is a pleasant man, but the way he calls anybody who disagrees with him an extremist and an ideologue is extraordinary because if ever there was an extremist, if ever there was an ideologue in this House, it is without doubt the very pleasant honourable member for Calwell. He is a man of the Left whose views are ignored by much of his own Party and are certainly ignored by the broader Australian community. The view that he has been expressing today in effect is that the Australian Government should be nationalising the commanding heights of our industry. That is the view that was popular back in the nineteenth century on the left of politics; it seems to be a view which has been abandoned by most thinking people in the world but which is still adhered to by the Left of the Australian Labor Party. Certainly proposals for the nationalisation of industry do not make any sense in Australia today when we are desperate for investment from the private sector. We are desperate for investment to rebuild an economy which is stalled by high interest rates, which is stalled by record inflation rates and which is stalled by union power and the exercise of that power through restrictive practices. Governments must make substantial changes to domestic economic policy and to economic policy in general if our investment prospects are to pick up. We cannot go on with the sort of mind-set that the present Labor Government has against productivity, against profitability and against development-those things which in the past have been the hallmark of the building of a greater Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course the attitude of the Government towards the public sector, towards public corporations, will be an important part of the way our country's economy develops and its investment prospects grow. The Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill and the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill do not do much by any standards to promote the prospects for investment in Australia. What they do, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Ryan, is impose an 0.5 per cent charge for Commonwealth guarantees for borrowings by public enterprises. That 0.5 per cent charge is without doubt a very significant charge. As the honourable member for Ryan pointed out, it is a charge which would seem to be considerably more than a charge that the market itself would make for a similar kind of rolled gold guarantee. Those things being borne in mind, it would seem that this charge has two functions. One is the rather cynical function of raising more money for the Commonwealth's own Budget through the operation of public enterprises and through providing Commonwealth guarantees for those enterprises. In other words, it is just another way of raising taxes. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Ryan, as the honourable member for Kooyong says, was entirely right in putting that proposition. It is also true that the Government argues that by imposing this charge those public corporations will be put on a more competitive basis simply because the private sector cannot get such guarantees and as a result has to pay more for its borrowings. I do not think there is any doubt about at least the theory of that. In a sense, these public corporations are being made more competitive with the private sector. In reality, though, does that argument really make any sense? Does it make any sense to impose additional charges on public corporations so that somehow they are more competitive with the private sector because it makes their costs higher? It seems to me a rather curious form of logic, because if those public enterprises are genuinely competitive in the market-place, what is the Government doing owning them in the first place? If they are not competitive, the whole issue of their competitiveness with the private sector is clearly irrelevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So it does seem to me that there is a fundamental problem of logic in this whole exercise. This whole exercise draws attention to the fundamental problems of running public enterprises. If the Government is really serious about its objective of somehow putting public enterprises on a competitive basis with the private sector, perhaps it should sell off some of those public enterprises for which there is a market and which are simply involved in commercial activities-not, of course, public enterprises that provide a service that the private sector cannot provide. That is one way of going about it. I suppose the other thing that the Government could do-and it seems a rather impractical proposition-if it wants to put the public and private sectors on a competitive basis is sell Commonwealth guarantees to all borrowers at a charge of 0.5 per cent. Why not do that if the Government wants to make the public and private sectors somehow equal in the market-place? I suppose one could take that argument one step further and say that the Government would not give public enterprises any Commonwealth guarantee whatsoever. I do not think that is a particularly sensible option, particularly when we are talking about some public enterprises which are simply loss making operations because of the nature of the work they do. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am really saying is that if we are going to talk about making public enterprise competitive with the private sector and we are going to maintain public enterprise we will run into a whole lot of problems of logic which I hope I have been expounding fairly clearly. When we run into those problems of logic we are faced with one simple solution, and that is that where the public enterprise is simply a commercial operation, such as the AIDC, we are better off not abolishing it, as the honourable member for Calwell says, but handing the control of that enterprise over to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill is a particularly curious piece of legislation. It is the sort of legislation that has a bob each way, because it allows the AIDC not to use Commonwealth guarantees if it so wishes. That raises a very important question. What would happen, for example, if the AIDC entered into some investment and found itself in considerable financial difficulties? Would the Commonwealth then come forward to honour the obligations of the AIDC or would it say: `The AIDC did not get a Commonwealth guarantee so we will not honour those obligations.'? I think the answer would almost certainly be that at the end of the day the Government would honour the obligations of the AIDC. That leads one to the next question: What is the point of this legislation for the AIDC? One of the problems is that if the AIDC gets the Commonwealth guarantee it will increase the cost of its borrowings by 0.5 per cent. On the other hand, if it does not take the Commonwealth guarantee it will pay higher charges for its loans. It will end up paying higher interest rates because of the higher risk in there not being a guarantee. Again, that legislation strikes me as having a curious lack of logic. </PARA>
<PARA> I see that there is not a Minister in the chamber at the moment but I hope that the Minister who responds to the debate will explain the logic of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the honourable member for Calwell, I have some real concern about the role of the AIDC-the ever expanding role of what is in effect the Australian Government's merchant bank. That bank lends something like $2 billion a year and invests $91m in ordinary equity in companies. The range of investments shows that they are not just romantic investments in the manufacturing sector, as the honourable member for Calwell tried to make out; they are investments in an enormous range of different activities. There are investments in companies such as Australian Biomedical Corporation Ltd. The AIDC owns 50 per cent of that company which is involved in biomedical inventions. I suppose that is new technology. Twenty-eight per cent of the equity of Barbeques Galore Holdings Pty Ltd is held by the AIDC. That company, not surprisingly, makes barbeques. AIDC invests in a company that makes microwaves. Believe it or not, it even invests in shopping centres. There are plenty of people investing in shopping centres in this country, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) must surely know. We have surely seen the sign `Westfield' up hither and thither around Australia. It is clearly diversifying its investments fairly significantly now. There is not a shortage of people wanting to invest in shopping centres but we see the AIDC getting involved in that kind of investment because it sees it as being the best way of maximising its profitability. But of course that is a concession to the point that it is not providing a significant social service; it is operating as best its board thinks it can in a completely commercial competitive world. That again raises questions about whether the Corporation needs to be owned by the public sector. That is not to say that it should be abolished; it is simply to question whether it is the role of government to be directing investment into such areas which can be handled by the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that in recent years the AIDC has been successful commercially. It is also important to note that to some extent the AIDC has been hamstrung by the fact that it must at least enter into discussions with the government on what sort of policies it should pursue over the subsequent year. I understand that the informal agreement is that the AIDC and the government come to some kind of-let us use that long forgotten word-consensus about what the strategy should be. I am sure I am right in saying that the AIDC would much rather operate without any inhibitions whatsoever from the government, without any guidance on where investments should go. The people on the board of that Corporation, the people involved in that Corporation, are proud of its work-I think rightly so-and they want to see it develop as a truly strong Australian national merchant bank. Why should they not? That is why, as I understand it, the AIDC has formally sent a submission to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) suggesting that the Government consider selling off the AIDC to the private sector. I understand that this has happened relatively recently and so far the Minister has provided the AIDC with no reply to the suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA> That should not come as a surprise to anybody in this House. The AIDC is on a sure footing. It is operating fairly efficiently as a merchant bank. It has a very strong management team and a very strong board with years of experience in the private sector. There is no doubt that it can fulfil the dynamic role of a merchant bank, in particular in creating investment opportunities in our economy, simply by being privatised-if one wants to use that word-simply be being sold to the private sector. The Government could then put the taxpayers' receipts from that sale to a much more constructive use which bears some relationship to the very major economic problems that our country faces. I do not make these suggestions because I am an ideologue of any kind. I would not argue that all members of AIDC are ideologues, even though they are asking to be privatised, but there is some ideological opposition from the other side of the House to the private sector-to private sector investment, to private sector involvement in and control of the Australian economy. Otherwise, honourable members opposite would not speak with such ridicule about proposals to sell some public enterprises to the private sector. It is simply ideological opposition, and not practical, economically based opposition, that comes from the Labor Party to building a productive and constructive private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that the AIDC has apparently made this submission about its future. In conclusion, I say that I think the Government should take up that recommendation and ensure that the AIDC, like private merchant banks, plays a real and vital role in building a proper investment structure for our country. The Government, instead of concentrating on running public enterprises, might start to concentrate on bringing down interest rates, lowering the tax burden, reducing the enormous cost of government, getting rid of a great deal of the waste that is going on in government and ensuring that small business, primary producers and big businesses become profitable once more so that they can create jobs and create wealth, not just for the rich but for all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to support the Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill and the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill. Both of these Bills arise from a Budget proposal, outlined in Australia last year, to levy a charge in respect of any guarantee on borrowings or fund raisings by the Commonwealth's business organisations. The Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill does give effect to those Budget measures and in the case of the Australian Industry Development Corporation it provides that the levy, which is set at the rate of one half of one per cent, should apply only where the borrowings are actually guaranteed by the Commonwealth. This piece of legislation, in effect, gives discretion to the AIDC to decide whether it wishes to have Commonwealth guarantees placed on loan funds that it raises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is worth mentioning a few points in background about the Australian Industry Development Corporation. It is a statutory corporation, it is wholly owned by the Commonwealth of Australia. In other words, it is a statutory corporation which is owned by the people of Australia. Its objectives are, I think, very good. They are to promote and assist Australian industry and to assist in the Australian ownership of industry. The Corporation is a financial enterprise and it operates on commercial principles. It is engaged in the business of borrowing money. It makes loans and it makes equity investments. It also provides related financial advice and other services including lead management of syndicated project financing. The Corporation does consult with the Government from time to time on its general policy, but it should be emphasised that its decisions on particular transactions are totally independent of government direction, influence or review. In that regard, any transactions which the AIDC has with its clients in industry in Australia are conducted in a completely professional and, of course, confidential manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say also that the AIDC is taxed in Australia in exactly the same way as are public companies. In many ways its operation is no different from that of a public company. As I have said, it operates independently and professionally in the market and it operates confidentially with its clients. One half of its net profit after tax is paid back to the Commonwealth, in other words back to the people of Australia, as a dividend. In that regard it is worth noting that in the last financial year-I am talking about 1985-86-the AIDC made a profit of around $19m. Considering the economic circumstances of the time, that is a fairly good profit, and it is a profit which benefits the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Government came to power the AIDC has responded exceptionally well to government initiatives to support and foster industry in Australia. The total assets of the AIDC, as at 30 June 1986, amounted to more than $2 billion. That compares with about $770m just four years ago. So there has been a significant increase in assets held by the Corporation. I remember speaking in a debate in this House late in 1983, when this Government decided to inject additional capital into the AIDC and to allow it to gear up that capital and to borrow it at a higher rate. I think, from memory, we increased its gearing ratio to 15:1. Australians are now seeing the benefits of that increased capital with the further activities of the AIDC; with a large increase in the number of enterprises and firms assisted throughout Australia; and, as I have already said, with a return of profit in the form of dividends to the Commonwealth, in other words, to the people of Australia. I think the AIDC is doing a good job. As I have said, as a statutory corporation it operates effectively and independently from government and it has autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view the AIDC is very much a success story. It is typical of what this Government is achieving in the area of industry policy. We came to government at a time when secondary industry in Australia was probably in its most parlous state since before the Second World War. During 1982 close to a quarter of a million jobs were lost in secondary industry, and we had the task in front of us in 1983, as a newly-elected government, to try to restore competitiveness, profitability and job prospects in Australia's manufacturing industry. I think the record to date shows that we have done a fair job of meeting that task which we set ourselves. There has certainly been increased profitability and a return to manufacturing industry in Australia. Increased employment has certainly been generated throughout manufacturing industry in Australia. If we look at the statistics and at the anecdotal evidence, such as new applications for industrial land in cities such as Bendigo, Ballarat and the outer suburbs of Melbourne, there is a lot of evidence that industrial expansion is still occurring and that with the turnaround in the competitiveness of the Australian economy, in allowing the dollar to find its appropriate level, this Government has provided a real boost to secondary industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There is certainly anecdotal evidence in my electorate of the major turnaround that has occurred in manufacturing industry because of the policies of this Government. Just before Christmas I visited a clothing firm in my electorate which produces a name brand product which is produced identically in seven different locations around the world; in Hong Kong, Korea, Switzerland, America, the European Economic Community and so on. So this factory in Bendigo is one of seven which produces an identical garment to garments produced by other firms around the world. I was told that in United States dollar terms the Bendigo firm is now the most cost competitive of any of those seven firms located around the world. That truly does mean that at long last we have, in Australia, a structure and a government policy setting which has allowed firms to achieve real competitiveness. We have done that by letting the dollar find its right level, and also by producing a system of wage restraint in difficult economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> There is further evidence in my electorate of the strength of the economic recovery that is occurring in manufacturing industry. A firm in my electorate, Empire Rubber (Aust.) Pty Ltd, has increased its employment by about 150 people since March 1983. Bendigo Pottery (Epsom) Pty has increased its employment substantially. Nearly all the clothing and textile firms in my electorate have experienced considerable increases in employment. At the Bendigo Ordinance Factory there has been a significant increase in the exports that we are now winning overseas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interjection from my colleague from New South Wales asks what would happen to all of that progress if the Opposition were returned to government. I cannot answer that question because the Opposition has not announced any policy for manufacturing industry. I can say that if we look at its record prior to 1983 we could envisage a disaster of some considerable proportion for Australia's manufacturing industry. We could envisage an overvalued exchange rate. We could envisage a tax policy that would provide no assistance at all to secondary industry. We could envisage the dismantling of many of the excellent programs which are presently actively assisting industry in Australia. Let us not forget the shameful record of the Fraser Government in 1982, when a quarter of a million jobs were lost in manufacturing industry in one year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now mention some of the good things that we are doing for industry in Australia. We have developed a new steel plan. We have developed a new motor vehicle plan to restructure and assist that industry to promote exports. We have recently announced a heavy engineering plan, a sectoral plan, specifically targeted at that industry. Another plan that we do not read much about in the newspapers is the computer hardware and software industries plan, which is a real success story. Literally tens of thousands of new jobs have been generated in that industry because of the proposals put in place by the Hawke Labor Government. We have given assistance to shipbuilding to make it a more competitive industry. We have developed the growth strategy for the communications industry and we recently announced a new program for the textiles, clothing and footwear industry which will make that industry more competitive and more oriented. </PARA>
<PARA> In some areas of technology, which is crucial to Australian industry, we have developed a national industry extension plan. I know from experience in my area that that is going very well indeed. We have implemented the very important research and development measures-the 150 per cent tax deduction for approved research and development, and of course, we have reviewed the offsets policies which were in a shambles when we came to government. There are lots of other things I could talk about that we have done in industry policy, but I think the runs are on the board. I do not need to talk about them because our story in industry policy has been very much a success story. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that we would not quite know what to expect from the Opposition if unfortunately it were returned to government. We have no policies from the Opposition on tax. We have no policy for industry. We have no wages policy. In relation to tax we do not know whether we will get the Sinclair policy, the Howard policy, the Peacock policy, the Joh policy or whether we will get the policies of some of the conservative think tanks. There simply are not any Liberal policies around, so we cannot tell what would happen to secondary industry if a conservative government were re-elected in Australia. There is no industry policy; none at all. During January I read the Business Review Weekly, and I do know that there is considerable disquiet in the Liberal Party that much of the policies which have been generated in the industrial relations and industry areas are in fact being written by organisations outside the Liberal Party rather than by the elected members of the Liberal Party in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I want to say a few words about the relevance of this legislation and industry legislation for that State in the north of Australia, Queensland. In recent weeks we have seen a new political phenomenon arrive in Australia, bearing claims to a place in this House. That, of course, is the Premier of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. If we look at industry policy in Queensland-this legislation concerns industry policy-we see that no one could be proud to be the Premier of Queensland. I think most honourable members in this House would know, and the Australian people would know, that Queensland effectively has the highest rate of unemployment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> During January its unemployment rate soared to 10.3 per cent. That is possibly a model for Australia were Joh ever to be elected to any position of importance in this House. The average unemployment rate for Australia is about 8 per cent. I do not think anyone in Victoria, where the unemployment rate is 7 per cent, or in New South Wales, where the rate is 8 per cent, would really want to add another 2 or 3 per cent to their rates, as is occurring in Queensland. That is a marvellous example of what Joh might do for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The real point on which I want to concentrate is the Queensland economy's performance in the area of new investment, because that is what we are talking about in this debate. I have with me some statistics from the 1985-86 report of the Foreign Investment Review Board. Of course, at the moment foreign investment is pretty important to Australia because of our balance of payments problems. But what the 1985-86 annual report of the Foreign Investment Review Board shows is hardly good news for the people of Queensland or for the Queensland Premier, who appears to be an aspirant for this place. The report shows that the amount of new foreign investment proposals anticipated to occur between July 1985 and June 1986, around Australia was expected to be $3.049 billion. The annual report breaks that up on a State by State basis. It shows that New South Wales was expected to receive $1.368 billion of that total amount, which is about 45 per cent of the total new foreign investment planned for Australia. It shows that Victoria, under the very competent government there, the Cain Government, was expected to receive $1.1 billion, which is about 37 per cent of the new foreign investment planned for Australia. But it shows that poor old Queensland, with its National Party leadership of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen-who has always claimed that Queensland is such a wonderful State in which to invest and such an attractive place for foreigners to invest-could expect new investment of a paltry $148m, which is 4.9 per cent of the national total. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just repeat those figures, which compare New South Wales, with $1.37 billion, Victoria, with $1.12 billion, and Queensland, with a meagre $148m. Queensland has 16 per cent of the nation's labour force. We might have expected to to attract at least 16 per cent of new foreign investment in Australia. But, no, the best that Queensland could muster, with its National Party-led Government, was a paltry 4.9 per cent. What that shows is that foreign investors have snubbed Queensland. No one wants to invest in Queensland, because the Queensland economy is on the skids and because the Queensland Government is second rate. If ever there has been a clearer set of figures, I would like to see them. They simply show that foreign investors do not have the confidence to invest in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that this Government's record on industry policy is a very good one. We believe that industry policy is crucial to Australia's future at a time when the prices we are receiving for our traditional exports-our energy exports, our resources, our primary industry exports-are falling. We have had about $6 billion wiped off our terms of trade, and manufacturing industry is crucial to the long term living standards and economic health of all Australians. We are helping manufacturing industry. The number of new jobs in manufacturing industry is growing rapidly. There has been increased profitability. We think our record is a good one. The only blot on what is otherwise a very good copybook is the performance of the Queensland economy in terms of new investment. But perhaps in three or four years' time we will see a change of government there and at last some new investment going into that State. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill-and the cognate Bill, the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill, which is necessary only because of the change to this legislation-is another tax gathering measure. It happens to be the latest phenomenon. In his second reading speech, the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hurford) stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Similar loan guarantee charges have recently been announced by the New South Wales and South Australian Governments . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We also know that it is the case in Victoria. We have the phenomenon that government entities have to make a profit and have to meet the market. That sounds fine in rhetoric but it totally overlooks the fact that these particular institutions make that profit only when they put up their prices. Who pays those prices?</PARA>
<PARA> Today we heard our Treasurer (Mr Keating) crying crocodile tears about the fate of the less well off in our community. I am sure that we all concern ourselves with those people. It is a pity that the Treasurer did not get his tax return in a little earlier, to help with the efficiency of the Australian Taxation Office, if he is so concerned about these things. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that, according to the second reading speech, this Bill will take an extra $3.4m from the Australian people, because, quite obviously, the institutions involved, which are to be taxed in this fashion, will pass on the charges. They have no choice. It is an interesting line-up of institutions. Part A of the Schedule lists Aussat Pty Ltd, which offers the alternative form of communication for many people today. We should remember that every time we go into many places to buy things there are electronic funds point of sale systems, involving credit cards, which now use the communications system. Many of the larger chains will choose to use Aussat. The Australian Telecommunications Commission is also listed. As the pressure goes on those two organisations to raise money to cover the new data transfer processes that are necessary, a tax will now be put on them if they require the Treasurer to give them a government guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we already have plenty of taxes in that area. Already, the State governments tax the turnovers of their electricity authorities to the order of between 3 and 5 per cent. That is taxation by stealth-and this is taxation by stealth. It appears to be a relatively small amount of money. I guess some calculations have been made on it. The amount is 0.5 per cent. If the Australian Telecommunications Commission, Telecom Australia, is to be taxed at that rate on all its borrowings, the amount will have to be more than that. Maybe it will not seek a guarantee; maybe it will pay the higher interest rates that the market demands. But I see that in 1985-86 Telecom's new borrowings were $640m. Its total borrowings, which includes roll-over of old debt, were $934m. In 1986-87 the figures were approximately $640m and $1,033m in total borrowings. Neither the second reading speech nor the Bill is very specific about roll-over, but I gather that that is a borrowing and that as such it will be subject to this form of taxation. If the Government gets 0.5 per cent on $1,000m in one year, that represents a lot more than $3.4m. Maybe the Minister will enlighten us in that regard as to the extent to which Telecom seeks government guarantees for its borrowing program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority is also in the list. We presume that it will borrow to meet its commitments of expansion in this new and developing area, in this very speedily developing city. Is it not wonderful? I soon worked out the Canberra property market: One buys under a Liberal government and sells under a Labor government, because prices have risen at a huge rate under this Labor Government. That is one of the major points about this legislation and in the speeches we have heard from Government members on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> All of the institutions involved provide services to the community. They seem totally incapable of reducing their costs internally. When governments say to them `Make a profit', it is seldom done by efficiencies internally; it is done by putting up prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Postal Commission-Australia Post-is included on the list too. The Australian National Railways Commission, which is showing massive losses, is also included. How can it pay the charge from profits? Even the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission, which provides necessary drugs to Australians, is included, and will now be taxed. The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, which is obliged to raise money to cover itself from time to time in giving insurance to that very important person in the community, the home owner, is included. The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation is the body which allows young home owners to get a second mortgage. It will be hit by the tax. Qantas Airways Ltd, our international carrier, will have its competitive situation somewhat damaged by this arrangement. I could go on. There is a huge list. Some bodies are to be treated differently, namely, the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia, the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia and the Australian Industry Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me come back to the basic premises of this legislation: More taxation, more revenue. During Question Time today the Treasurer talked about the constraints which have been placed on the Government and the difficult times it has had. It entered office in one of the few periods of sustained economic growth throughout the world-growth which is now starting to stagger. It had the benefit of that period of growth. Yet how is that reflected in the Government's revenues? The only Budget inherited by this Government was the last Fraser Budget. This Government had three months of management of that Budget before it commenced its own Budget management in June 1983. It inherited only one Budget. </PARA>

The Hawke Government's revenue raising since the last Fraser Budget-in the last Fraser Budget we raised $44,000m-as suggested in the present Budget estimates for this year is $71,261m, representing an increase of 61 per cent. Honourable members opposite cannot say that that is evidence of the growth rate of Australia. The Government has increased its revenues by 61 per cent and has needed an additional $24,000m of borrowing to balance the books. It has pushed the cost of interest to the Commonwealth from $3,300m in its inherited Budget to $7,500m in this Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The massive effort of the Government to borrow money in the community is forcing Australian business to pay 18 per cent and 20 per cent for its money when comparable people in Japan are paying 5 per cent and in America about 8 per cent. Honourable members opposite may think things are getting tough for the small business sector and wonder about the figures that were mentioned today-8,000 bankruptcies have occurred in recent times. The honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has suddenly stopped making speeches about bankruptcy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No; I am telling honourable members what the finance company is charging him. A lot of the reason for it lies with this Government because of its borrowing program of $24,000m over four years which it has needed because it has lacked the courage either to cut expenditure or to increase taxation. The Government should not tell us about its economic concern and caution. It has borrowed $24,000m in four years. In old fashioned prices it would take the wheat farmers of Australia six years to produce that much revenue. The Government has had a debt-led recovery. It has also massively increased government revenues. Let me repeat it: Revenue has gone from $44,000m in the last Fraser Budget to $71,000m in this Budget-an increase of 61 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is just another revenue grab. It is being practised by State Labor governments in exactly the same way. Fancy this Government saying that it would create revenue by making these firms pay a dividend on capital outlay! The dividend is a direct tax against the community. We now see all those activities reflected in an inflation rate that is unheard of around the world today. I like to hear the history lessons of honourable members opposite about past governments. When we, as a government, had high interest rates they were common around the world. When we had high inflation rates they were common around the world. This time it is only we and the banana republics. It is only we and Mexico that owe the world $100,000m-up from $35,000m when the Fraser Government left office. These are the sorts of figures Australians have to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> I will tell honourable members what an Australian has just discovered. When Fraser left office one could buy a Holden Commodore for $10,500. I priced the same vehicle the other day. It now costs $16,500. And the Government wonders why the car industry has had the lowest level of sales since 1968. After four years, let the Government tell me how it can blame anyone else for that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a frivolous point of order. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Returning to this legislation, I have claimed again and again that it is a tax measure and that it will hurt small Australians in many areas. We have heard some amazing defences of government institutions this afternoon. One government institution mentioned in this legislation is the Commonwealth Development Bank. This Government made a big play amongst small business as to how, by expanding the role of this institution, it would help farmers and small business. I believed it at the time. I saw the bank in my electorate promote a new scheme to help farmers. It was going to buy up their hire purchase debts and put them on long term finance, which appeared to be an excellent proposition at the time, particularly as when it was able to make the offer interest rates were at 14.5 per cent and the Treasurer was predicting that they would go down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Huge numbers of farmers in my electorate, in great financial difficulty, went to the bank to apply for that money. The rejection rate was 90 per cent. The bank was not interested in those who were hard up. It was interested only in those who were not hard up. It was interested, as a competing organisation under government guarantee, in pinching the good customers the other financial institutions had at the time. So the poor were left where they were. The joke is that the poor have become the winners because, of course, the new deal was a flexible interest rate whereas the deal with the financial companies was fixed interest. The Treasurer's promise was not kept, interest rates have gone through the roof and some of those people who got what appeared to be an excellent proposition have suffered. They have suffered because of the Government's high interest rate policy, unique outside of the banana republics, which it created by excessive borrowing at the government level and which has put it on a merry-go-round it cannot get off. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me again remind honourable members of the damage that has done to people who made investments believing the Treasurer, believing that whether they received loans from the Commonwealth Development Bank, the Primary Industry Bank of Australia or the AIDC-which gets a mention here-their interest rates would not increase. That is the major problem in farming and small business today. People believed the Government and believed that they were in a safe interest rate environment. They borrowed money and that borrowing is contributing substantially to the thousands of bankruptcies that are occurring at the moment and the plight of the thousands of other people who are losing their businesses without getting to that particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA> These particular institutions do not deliver much in the way of help. They are government institutions competing with institutions of which, as has already been said, we have literally hundreds. We are not short of banks or merchant banks. We do not need those government institutions. In respect of these particular institutions, the Opposition's policy is not, as the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) said, to disband them or to put a torch to them. They will be disposed of and the arrangements they have, the loans they have made, will be transferred to people who will deal just as fairly and at the same prices. For a change we will not have a government trying to pick winners. </PARA>
<PARA> We listened to the honourable member for Calwell saying that it all has to be invested in the manufacturing sector. Not only is that picking winners but the honourable member for Calwell might also ask himself why the manufacturing sector is not attracting investment from the private sector today. I have talked to those investors and the answer is quite simple. Those investors will tell us why all the money is flooding into a share market where $1 chases another in an ever rising spiral, as it did before the Great Depression. Those investors will tell us why they are in there-because there are no hassles. They can run a very successful organisation with half a dozen dedicated people who are not subject to the control of the trade union bureaucracy. Those people ask why they should invest $50m, $100m or $500m in some new manufacturing process and have some shop steward tell them when they can open their doors. Honourable members opposite have forgotten that their masters are the members of the trade union bureaucracy-they should get this into their minds-and not trade unionists, who are generally very good people. Honourable members opposite talk about the white-shoe brigade. What about the white fingernail brigade? They are the people who run the trade unions today. When did Simon Crean ever get out there and do a day's work? When did most honourable members opposite, who call themselves representatives of the working people, who do not know, who do not understand and who are being dictated to by people who are not even democratically elected, do a day's work? They should get into their minds that it is the trade union bureaucracy, the white fingernail brigade, which is damaging our society. </PARA>
<PARA> I talked to Ralph Sarich not so long ago and he told me the reason he is not manufacturing his invention. We see all these programs on television on why all these inventions drift overseas. He went through it step by step and at every level he could make a viable operation until he got to the Australian waterfront. The unreliability of that sector destroyed the financial viability of giving jobs to Australians. For Sarich there was no problem. He sold licences, but he is deeply disappointed as he is a great Australian who wanted to manufacture those products in Australia. He got right through to that point but because of the cost of maintaining stocks in overseas countries and putting up with never knowing when things would get out of Australia-for that reason alone-he decided to sell licences. That is the only revenue that will come to our country. The investor gets his money; the worker does not. The Government is not fixing that up because it is dictated to by those people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contribution by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) was typical of the Opposition's general approach-that is, to fill our X amount of time with hot air and rhetoric when we are talking about one of the most significant issues confronting this country, industry development. It is worth reflecting that he did not at any point in his whole discourse put forward any firm proposals or ideas that go to the very fundamental issues before us. As I indicated, that is merely a mirror image of the Opposition's general approach. As is his wont, he also embraced a bit of personal insult on the way through. Let me place on record my view of the trade union leader to whom he referred, Mr Simon Crean. I believe that history will regard Crean, Kelty and a few of their colleagues in the trade union movement as very significant figures. As reported in today's Australian Financial Review, there has been a broad acknowledgment of not only the difficulties that Australia is facing but also the opportunities that are presented by the process of change. The honourable member for O'Connor talked about the white fingernail brigade. I think I have done a little bit more work over the years than my old mate Wilson Tuckey but I do not feel the need to get up here and insult those who may not have had backgrounds in physical labour. Once again, that is irrelevant to the issues before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is very important to put this legislation, as indeed it is important to put any debate in this House, into some overall perspective. We should have an objective in mind and not simply indulge in rhetoric. What is the objective? It is certainly not the objective embraced by the Opposition when it was in power; it is the objective of creating a strong internationally competitive manufacturing base in Australia. Previous speakers have adverted to the fact that under the former government there was something of a crisis because an overvalued Australia dollar led to a massive loss of jobs and opportunities in the manufacturing sector. By definition, the manufacturing sector was the sacrificial lamb of the Fraser-Howard Government's overvalued exchange rate policy. I think it is appropriate to draw the distinction that, to the contrary, this Government's approach has emphasised making Australia's manufacturing and service industries more internationally competitive, export oriented and innovative. I referred earlier to the article in the Australian Financial Review. I think that article ought to be compulsory reading. Of course, the changes in attitudes have come about in a two-year period, when the Australian Labor Party has had stewardship of government of this country. I think probably one of the most important outcomes of the industry policies and a whole range of other policies embraced by this Government is that people now have a realistic perspective of the art of the possible for Australia and I think people are prepared to pursue more vigorously the opportunities to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank my colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) for providing me with a glass of water. I am not sure whether he is implying that my voice does not sound too good, but I thank him anyway. The Labor Government's policies have, as an objective, sought to develop new industries with growth prospects and to establish industry sector plans in key industries. That has largely been completed in the steel, motor vehicle, clothing and footwear industries. They are all very key industries which have all benefited very much from the fundamental changes brought about by this Government. This Government has upgraded the technological and research and development capacities of industry in a whole range of areas to which I will refer a little bit further down the track. Unlike the honourable member for O'Connor who simply criticised, I think it is worth reflecting on the Government's record. Criticising may be the constitutional role of the Opposition; nevertheless, it is sensible every now and then to inject a little bit of policy into debate. What we have heard from the Opposition has been bereft of policy. It ought to have been compulsory for all Australians to have listened to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) today go through in some detail the Opposition's political and economic position with respect to taxation policy. The Opposition is very much like the emperor with no clothes. The basis of its financial and taxation policies is non-existent. It will go to the next election heaping cliche upon cliche, catch-phrase upon catch-phrase, but with very little by way of sensible alternative policies. I hope Australians focus very much on what the real alternatives are rather than simply on the rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> As opposed to rhetoric this Government has had a number of major achievements that it will seek to have acknowledged by the people at the next election. For example, it established the Australian Manufacturing Council. That has been a significant development. It was set up to work with the trade unions, the various governments of Australia and also the industries. The Government has also set up the Australian Industry and Technology Council and the Small Business Council. Earlier I referred to the steel plan, the motor vehicle plan and the heavy engineering package. One could go on with the various aspects that the Labor Government has been instrumental in bringing about, but I want to make one point which specifically relates to the Australian Industry Development Corporation. One of the very many initiatives of the AIDC has been to be involved in the financing of the Portland aluminium smelter project in Victoria, a project of very great significance to the economy of Victoria and, I acknowledge, a project that had its genesis in a government prior to the election of a Labor Government. There have been some difficulties with that project and they are widely known. Nevertheless, I believe that that project now offers the economy of Victoria a significant potential stimulus, particularly when the international recovery eventually comes about. The AIDC, through a 10 per cent interest in the joint venture, facilitated the involvement of the People's Republic of China. It was not that long ago that the mention of that particular country would have caused some people in this chamber to have apoplexy. Of course, people acknowledge that China is, certainly potentially, a major trading partner and has very significant economic potential for Australia. The AIDC in that particular project has sought to cement those long term relationships. That is just one of many examples of AIDC involvement in helping industry and long term planning in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a whole range of issues that one could address in making reference to the AIDC but I think it is worth going back to the comments I made at the outset-that the industry policy of this Government is seen and is acted upon not necessarily because of a desire to bring about change for change's sake but to acknowledge a fundamental and ongoing reality that without significant change this country's economic future will not be guaranteed. I referred to an article in today's Australian Financial Review. It is very important to acknowledge the widespread acceptance of the challenges that confront Australia. It is very much a function of the type of approach of this Government in terms of trying to encourage research and development, trying to move in all spheres for more innovative, technologically competitive industries, and so on. This Government has brought about that massive change and I believe that this country will be the beneficiaries of acknowledgments that people are now prepared to make. We hear about smashing unions and so on, but at the end of the day what will put this country firmly on the path to a prosperous future is a preparedness to take different approaches, not to believe that the world simply owes us a living, but to get out there and work a little harder. I believe that reality is acknowledged throughout the work force. I believe the old image of the ocker with the big beer belly and thongs is very much a false image of Australians. In my working lifetime I have worked in numerous industries at a professional level and as a worker. One of the things I learned over those many years is that that image of Australians as being a little lazy is really an unfortunate caricature. If one worked as I did as a scaffolder in the building industry one would know that there is no sloth in that industry because sloth brought about one hour's notice of the cessation of employment. It was a very physically demanding industry to work in. That was the case in many industries I experienced. This image is one that ought not continue. The average Australian worker has shown resourcefulness. If one travels around the world it is possible to draw comparisons with a whole range of other countries. I believe we stand up to analysis on any ground-contribution, intelligence, the infrastructure of this country. I believe the position we have in terms of the developing economies in the Asia-Pacific region are of themselves a significant, potential, comparative advantage that we enjoy, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my contribution by making one point and perhaps a plea. The point is that the challenges that are confronting Australia ought not only be seen as difficulties; they are very much opportunities. The AIDC is in my view one aspect, but an important aspect, of a changed attitude in Australia that is seeking to take advantage of the opportunities that are before us. The Government's record in industry development is second to none and stands in very stark contrast to the rather embarrassing record of the previous Government. If the Opposition wants to be taken seriously out there in the electorate rather than simply parrot the rather cliched, immature debate that we have experienced over the last few weeks, it is beholden on it to come before this House with constructive alternative policy proposals. We have a record upon which we are proud to stand and we have the policies for the future. When I hear the Opposition challenging those on their merits I will be a very happy member of this Parliament; so far in my four years it has yet to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing cognately with the Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill 1986 and the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill 1986. Principally they relate to Commonwealth borrowings and, in specific terms, the Australian Industry Development Corporation and its work. It should be remembered by the Parliament that this legislation came into effect in 1970. It was the McMahon Government which moved to establish the Australian Industry Development Corporation. I think it is fair to say that in the intervening 17 years the Corporation has done an outstanding job. It is chaired currently by a great Australian, Sir Gordon Jackson, and I have no doubt at all that many businesses, many operations in Australia today, are there because of the assistance provided and the support given. But I have to say that if ever a government has shown itself to be two-faced, hypocritical and dishonest in relation to industry policy it is the Hawke socialist Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give just a small example of the deception we see in this cognate debate. We can read through and through the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill 1986 and the second reading speech of the Minister for Science and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Mr Barry Jones) but we will not see the amount of levy or the charge-in fact, I brand it as a tax-set out at all. However, if we look at the Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill 1986 we will find that, after it deals with charges in respect of Commonwealth borrowings, semi-government borrowings and the like, on page 3 a direct reference is made to the 0.5 per cent per annum charge which can now be levied by the AIDC in cases where it determines-and I emphasise `it determines'-that borrowings or raisings of money made after 8 October 1986 are to be guaranteed by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again this two-faced, hypocritical Hawke socialist Government shows its double standards, because effectively under the legislation one has Hobson's choice. I know that my colleague, the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who is at the table, would quickly pick up the point; that if one gets a Commonwealth guarantee, one finds that that evil department, the Department of Finance, will get its little sticky fingers in the honey jar and will levy 0.5 per cent. If one does not get a Commonwealth guarantee, one will have to pay higher interest charges, so either way one is over a barrel. I could not let the opportunity pass, as a former Minister, to say that once again we see the sticky, tacky little fingers of the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary that this Parliament has been the subject of deception by the Hawke Socialist Government in relation to two consecutive measures which flowed from the 1986-87 Budget. The first was the absolute lie-which is what it is-that the $250 being ripped off the university and tertiary students of Australia is an administration charge. There is no question at all about it-it is a fee. But the Government came into this Parliament and deceived the House and the people by saying that this was an administration charge in relation to university students-totally fictitious, totally false, totally untrue--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And absolutely gutless. The Government said that it is a levy-it is not a levy. I join with the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in saying that it is a tax-no ifs, no buts. Who on earth will tell me that a flat, standard 0.5 per cent per annum charge bears any relation to the administrative work involved? In some cases the borrowings might be straightforward and simple-in some cases it might be a renewal or a rolling over of borrowings, which are processed almost automatically-but people will be slugged that 0.5 per cent. This Government seems to think that people on this side of the House do not understand the figures; that we cannot see through the fraud, cheating and robbery. That is exactly what it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the second reading speech of the Minister for Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, on which I base my case. The short point is that Australian industry should realise that whilst this Government on the one hand preaches support for it and preaches all good things to all good men at all good times, on the other hand it is robbing industry in this country. The figures are very significant. In the Minister's second reading speech he indicated, quite properly, that the AIDC had recently reported a record after tax net profit of $19.1m. Well done-good profit! Then a little further down we get an idea of the impact of this apparently small 0.5 per cent levy. The Minister talked about the assets of the AIDC amounting to $2,167.4m compared with $768.1m at 30 June 1982, which is an increase of 180 per cent. He congratulated the Corporation, then went on to say that the paid up capital stood at $100m. I am trying to pick up the figure in this rather extraordinary speech by the Minister where he indicated what the effect of the reduction will be. Of course-I am sorry, I am being tricked again, because it is not in that speech, it is in the other one. One has to read the two speeches to follow it. The figure is in the order of over $15m which will be saved-if I can use that expression-by the AIDC, but it will be paid by Australian industry. Frankly, it is a tax. Of that there is no question or shadow of a doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sick and tired of the hypocrisy of this Government claiming that it supports Australian manufacturing-it does not. This Government has betrayed the Australian manufacturing sector. If you do not believe me, Mr Deputy Speaker, look at the raw statistics. Last year imports increased by a massive 21 per cent. Twenty-one per cent in one year is an enormous figure. In June of last year the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) announced, as if it were of no importance at all, a 6 per cent increase in imports of textiles, clothing and footwear. Do you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that as I speak there are the ghosts of 350,000 Australians, who 10 years ago were working in Australian manufacturing, who are not working there today? Do you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when Australian manufacturing is under increasing pressure, when goods are being dumped in this country day in and day out, this wretched, disloyal and unpatriotic Government does nothing about it?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) went to Beijing last year. When he got to Manila he released information-he did not release it in Beijing-which he had conveyed to the People's Republic of China, with which I have no quarrel, that when the current textiles, clothing and footwear plan runs out it could expect a major increase in importation of clothing, textiles and footwear. Without wishing to shock the Parliament, I have to say that the day is fast approaching-it will probably come within a decade-when Australian kids will go to school wearing clothes and shoes that have not been made in this country and we will be hard pressed to buy shoes and clothes made in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The country is being flooded with imports by a government which says: `Be fair dinkum, support Australia'. We saw the Prime Minister pleading on television. He says `Be true blue' when his Government has permitted imports to increase by 21 per cent in one year. He cannot work out why the balance of payments figures have gone through the floor. One does not have to be Mandrake the magician to understand that if we permit massive increases in imports, when our exports have dropped, according to the January figures that have just come out, we will have the worst balance of payments figures on record. This Government says that it stands by the Australian worker, whereas in fact the Australian worker in the manufacturing sector is being betrayed day in day out by the people they thought were their friends and protectors. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said this before and I will say it again: Everything I wear is made in Australia. That is a standard rule. I will not strip, but I will run through it. I am wearing an Anthony Squires suit made in Australia; an Austico tie made in Australia; a Van Heusen shirt made in Australia; John Brown socks made in Australia; and Florsheim shoes made in Australia. I am sorry that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) is temporarily out of the chamber, because Mr Barry Counsel is the head of Flor- sheim Shoe Co. Pty Ltd and Julius Marlow Holdings Ltd. I am wearing Jockey underwear made in Australia in the colours true blue-Liberal true blue. I am not having a shot at anybody else who wears Gucci or anything like that, but I wear Australian. I drive an Australian car, I have an Australian family and I am proud of Australian products because I am one myself. I was constructed in Australia and delivered right on time on 16 November 1938, so I believe in things made in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I talk about a government which says `Be true blue, be fair dinkum', then lets imports come in at the cost of Australian jobs. Look at the gutlessness of this Government which is absolutely hypnotised by the economic purists, these geniuses who come to bring salvation to us. They are the ones who look at the report of the so-called Industries Assistance Commission on the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. The implementation of the recommendations of that report could put 60,000 Australians out of jobs. This is a government which talks about being interested in women in the work force and in our ethnic communities. This is the same government which, with a stroke of the pen to implement that IAC report, could put out of work 60,000 Australians, of whom 80 per cent are women and of that 80 per cent of women, 90 per cent are ethnic. When the new Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Young) goes running around the ethnic communities, I hope that a few of them will say: `What are you going to do about women in the work force-those in the textiles, clothing and footwear industry?' They are about to be sent to the gallows by the Hawke socialist Government, which says that it supports the workers, but of course it does not. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the latitude which has enabled me to address my remarks to the manufacturing sector. As you would be well aware, the AIDC has played a significant role in two sectors which were referred to by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), whose speech preceded mine. I compliment him on a very thoughtful speech. He pointed specifically to the passenger motor vehicle industry and to textiles, clothing and foot- wear. I want to talk now about the slaughter of the passenger motor vehicle industry by the Hawke socialist Government. My old friend the Minister for Local Government and Administrative Services (Mr Uren) is smiling. In his fairness, he will recall that when this Government introduced the steel industry plan I was but one of two members on this side of the House who stood in this Parliament and applauded it. The Government's steel industry plan is first rate. The runs are on the board. I believe that Australia's indigenous, Australian-owned steel industry will go from strength to strength. You may remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I was mildly embarrassed that night in the House because applause is not usually permitted. Even worse for me; when I sat down I was applauded by the Socialist Left in Moscow corner. They thought that it was a marvellous speech. I have been fair and have supported the Government when I have thought that a proposal was proper and fair. In the steel industry plan it was first rate. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government done to the passenger motor vehicle industry in this country? It has effectively cut the throat of the industry. Sales are down a massive 160,000 vehicles as a direct result of the Government's iniquitous and vicious fringe benefits tax, the compulsory keeping of log books and the other cutbacks that have occurred as a result of the Government's full scale assault on private enterprise. How embarrassing and degrading it is to say to a reputable businessman: `We want to know exactly how many kilometres you travelled, where you went and what your journey was for'. Such a person is expected to have a much better memory than the Treasurer (Mr Keating). The Treasurer is so forgetful he forgot to lodge his tax return. It is a damned good thing that he is not a woman and on the pill. He would finish up very pregnant. The plain fact of the matter is that the Government is demanding a higher standard from the Australian businessman than it is prepared to apply to itself. The Government is turning this place into a second rate Soviet Union. It is a case of `Write it all down; tickey tack it in the little book; keep the dossier'. It is only a matter of time before we will have to put meters on the end of beds. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that this country is going down the gurgler-down the road to a socialist republic. I am concerned that most people in Australia are just lying there, half asleep, not believing that that will ever happen. They think: `Mr Hawke looks so nice on television. We like the way he does his hair. He always turns up when Australia wins at sport. He is never there when we get done, but you know what it is like'. He is one of the best political operators that this country has ever seen. But the Government has killed the passenger motor vehicle industry. It is wiping out decent Australians who have earned a living in the retailing of new and second hand motor vehicles. The people in the street cannot afford to buy a new vehicle. It is almost as expensive as buying a Sherman tank. The right of an Australian to buy a vehicle today has been knocked sideways. I like the little signs I have seen on the back of cars which state: `I own this car, but I am paying for the petrol on hire purchase'. That is what the Government has done. Mr Keating, a modern day Ned Kelly, is robbing the motorists of Australia. One does not see too many of them going for a Sunday afternoon drive. They cannot afford to even switch on the engine, because every time they do so money goes into the Commonwealth Treasury coffers. </PARA>
<PARA> In the concluding moments available to me, I ask: What has the Government done to the workers? The ordinary Australian worker cannot now go into a pub and buy a beer and a packet of cigarettes. That is what the Government has done to the ordinary Australian worker. We in Tasmania have a standard eight ounce beer glass. The price of that glass of beer is now over $1. I know that the Minister for Local Government and Administrative Services does not smoke or drink, but if I bought drinks it would cost me $1 for my eight ounce beer and about $2.40 for a packet of cigarettes. What would I buy him-a square and a lemon? I would probably get hit 85c for that. The whole thing would be over in 10 minutes. The Prime Minister said that he was a man of the people, that he was for the people, and would be with the people. Today, the pubs of Australia are like mausoleums. One could fire a cannon through them at 8 o'clock at night and not hit a soul. The ordinary worker cannot afford to go into hotels. He cannot afford a beer or cigarettes. </PARA>
<PARA> So there we have it. The Government floats along on deception and deceit. It did not even insert `0.5 per cent per annum' in the second reading speech to the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill. I suppose it thought that the honourable member for Bradfield, the shadow Minister-he is at the table-and I might be a bit thick and we would not pick it up in the other Bill. It is not a levy; it is a tax. It is a tax on Australian industry which the Government says it supports. It is a tax on the development of Australian industry which the Government says it wants. Once again, it is an example of a government prepared to go the half truth in an attempt to get the legislation through the Parliament without much debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a tragedy that a government can resort to lies and deception, as it has in this case and as it did in the so-called administration charge for university and tertiary students. That was not an administration charge at all; it was a tertiary fee. I would like to know why it costs $250 to administer the studies of a student in Tasmania who is doing an extramural course from Monash University and has never put a foot on Monash University in his life. Where does the $250 administration fee come in for that?</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Government has become very careless with the truth. The tragedy is that, unfortunately, many Australians are blind to it because they find the smiling face, the charisma, the coiffured grey hair and the handsome, tanned face of the current incumbent of the Lodge. They are prepared to accept what he says. He is on his last stay in the Lodge. He will be thrown out neck and crop at the next election, and I, for one, look forward-if I can afford it-to celebrating on that night the total defeat and, indeed, the total destruction of the Hawke socialist Government. Come the day; it will not come quickly enough for me. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Speaker-(Quorum formed) It is very nice to have a large audience, but calling for a quorum is typical of the disruptive tactics of the Opposition when it has nothing useful to say. It is interfering with important parliamentary committees, not to mention the satisfactory eating of dinner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although we are discussing two Bills, I want to comment only on the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill. The AIDC is sometimes described as a merchant bank but it is more accurately called a development bank because it concentrates on longer term lending for the development of Australia. The AIDC has had a remarkable history. It shows the benefit which can be received by the whole Australian economy through effective public sector enterprise. I want to hear `Hear, hear' to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Government members-Hear, hear!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The AIDC is a statutory corporation wholly owned by the Commonwealth. Its objectives are to promote Australian industry or Australian ownership in industry. It is a financial enterprise, operating on commercial principles, and it is engaged in the business of borrowing money, making loans and making equity investments. It also provides related financial, advisory and other services including lead management of syndicated project financings. The AIDC consults with the Government from time to time on its general policy but its decisions on particular transactions are independent of government direction, influence or review. Under the protection of the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act the Corporation deals with its clients in a completely professional and confidential manner. The AIDC is taxed in Australia on the same basis as a public company, and we should not let the Opposition tell us otherwise. One half of its net profit after tax is paid to the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The AIDC has had a remarkably successful history. It was established over 15 years ago. In its earlier years there was some controversy about the value or appropriateness of active government involvement in development banking. This was linked with some decisions about overseas borrowings which caused foreign losses in some early years. However, that early phase was quickly over and in the last 10 years there has been a dramatic growth in the operations and profit of the Corporation. For example, during the last 10 years, between 1976-77 and 1985-86, new financing commitments and guarantees have grown from $27m to $1,6000m. Much of that growth has occurred in the last two or three years. Similarly, funds disbursed in development loans and investments have grown from $24m in 1976-77 to $574m in 1985-86. Net profit after tax-I hope that members of the Opposition are listening to this figure because they are so often critical of the net profit of government bodies-grew from $2.3m in 1976-77 to $19.1m in 1985-86, and that growth has been relatively steady. The directors in their most recent annual report write with pride that this growth in activity and profits was achieved by a staff of fewer than 200 people. Therefore, on average, each staff member brought in $8.2m of new business and produced after tax profits of nearly $100,000, which is quite remarkable. This is clear evidence of the high level of efficiency of a public enterprise and refutes yet again those extremists opposite who claim that public enterprises are inevitably inefficient. </PARA>
<PARA> In December 1983 the present Government extended the Corporation's role to include all Australian industries, including the service industries where most growth in future employment is likely to occur. The amended Act also puts new emphasis on promoting the creation of new industries and facilitating the restructuring of existing Australian industries to enable greater efficiency and competitiveness. Government therefore has given the Corporation an important part in its policies for the revitalisation of industry, and the AIDC's corporate objectives show that very clearly. Those objectives are very impressive, and they begin by expressing the aim of being Australia's best and most innovative development bank. They continue by expressing the aim to actively seek out opportunities to encourage and assist the establishment and growth of viable, internationally competitive Australian industries and to facilitate the restructuring of industries within Australia. It is hard to imagine more important objectives in the economic sphere of government. </PARA>
<PARA> The distribution of the Corporation's new commitments in 1985-86 clearly expresses those goals. A third of new commitments were to oil and gas production and distribution mainly through its involvement in the enormous North West Shelf project. Another 28 per cent of commitments were for other manufacturing industry, 22 per cent were for transport, distribution and service industries, nearly 12 per cent were for the other mining and mineral processing category, just over 3 per cent were for tourist facilities and accommodation and 1 1/2 per cent were for technology based industries. One would hope that that investment in technology based industries can be expanded in future years, though given the size of the Corporation's total financial activities-which I remind honourable members totalled $1,600m last year-it is never likely to predominate. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is clear from this year's annual report that some quite imaginative and innovative technological commitments have been made by the Corporation-for example, through its involvement in the Aussat satellite project; through helping to finance the commercial development of a continuously variable stroke automotive internal combustion engine; through fifty-fifty ownership of the Australian Biomedical Corporation through its wholly owned subsidiary, Interscan International Ltd which has received some very welcome publicity and which was established with government funds to develop a microwave landing system based on a principle developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and adopted internationally for the next generation of aircraft landing guidance systems; through its substantial investment in Nucleus Ltd, the holding company of Australia's premier high technology medical products and equipment manufacturing group with world-wide operations; and through support for innovative consumer products such as Gliderol garage roller doors, and solid fuel heaters. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1986 the Corporation, acting on behalf of the Australian Government, committed $9.2m for a 40 per cent joint venture interest in an anti-malaria research and development project being carried out by four of Australia's internationally famous medical research groups. The additional funds injected by the Corporation will accelerate the research and development program, which is becoming particularly urgent given the breakdown of other attempts to eliminate malaria. These are just a few important examples amongst many included in the Corporation's 1985-86 activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill is to amend the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act to provide for the Commonwealth guarantee of moneys payable by the AIDC to be optional, at the Corporation's discretion. The amendments come about from the Government's intention to levy a charge in respect of the guaranteeing of borrowings or raisings by the Commonwealth's business enterprises. This would have cost the Corporation an estimated $7m on its borrowings and raisings in 1986-87, so the Corporation expressed a wish that the Commonwealth guarantee be optional rather than automatic so that the Corporation could avoid these additional costly charges if it wished. The Corporation will be able to call on a Commonwealth guarantee in future if it wishes but that will be optional on the basis of the Corporation's preferences. It is important that this is understood to be a commercial preference by the Corporation and involves no reduction of support for the Corporation by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The practical value of the AIDC's work is evident from the examples that I have already given. There is also a profoundly important structural reason why the existence and work of the AIDC are essential and that is that within Australia there are few, if any, perfectly competitive markets. In fact, there is a high degree of market failure. The AIDC contributes to easing the danger of that situation by injecting additional competition and innovation into imperfect markets. In Australia, as everywhere else, market failure occurs for a number of reasons, of which five are centrally important: First, in Australia there are high degrees of monopoly and other market imperfections. When there are only one, two or a few firms in an industry and there are tariff or other barriers to trade, each firm has power to influence prices. Some firms in Australia are so dominant that there is little constraint from the market over their price setting, whilst many other firms have considerable freedom to control their own pricing. Second, many consequences of economic activity are not reflected in the price system; that is, there are external effects of externalities. Third, the actual price system reflects current scarcities and therefore cannot be an adequate guide to decisions affecting the future notes, such as those on investment. Fourth, risk and uncertainty always influence allocative decisions, tending to bias investment against risky activities. This is a particularly important reason why a public corporation with a longer term perspective on its activities can have a particularly valuable role. Fifth, perfectly competitive markets occur only when all buyers and sellers have complete information, which is a patently absurd assumption about any market in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of market failure of the five kinds I have described, it is commonly essential for governments to intervene in order to increase the efficiency with which markets operate. There are various ways in which governments can intervene, ranging from simply requests to private corporations to behave in particular ways, statutory regulations, and competitive involvement in an industry to complete public ownership. In many ways, the least intrusive of these alternatives is competitive public sector involvement because this puts no constraints on activities by private companies but does increase the competitive pressure on them to operate efficiently. Publicly owned competitors can reduce the danger of exploitation of market power without the establishment of a paralysing labyrinth of regulations. This approach has been used effectively in Australia in banking and insurance for a long time. Commonwealth and State banks and insurance companies are subject to pressure to maximise their efficiency, to minimise prices, to respond to consumer preferences and to be innovative, and they increase the stimulus for private competitors to do the same. This is a particularly appropriate policy in what economists call oligopolistic industries; that is, industries where there are two or just a few companies, for there a public competitor can shatter cozy implicit collusion. It is particularly important to emphasise both the theoretical value of the AIDC and its great success in practice because there has been some talk within the Opposition in the past-even during this debate-of privatising the AIDC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is extraordinary. The AIDC has ceased to be a matter of controversy. I am reluctant to raise this issue now, when the existence and role of the Corporation are completely accepted in Australia's financial markets. However, it is important to encourage people to look sceptically at the nostrums being spread by a few of the Opposition's more extremist and doctrinaire speakers. Privatising the AIDC would reduce the efficiency of the Australian economy. Privatisation involves the abandonment of public responsibility not only for equity and humanity in the community but also for efficiency. Although the Opposition leaders have been quiet for some time about the issue of privatisation-apart from on the AIDC in this debate-following the failure of the proposal to be an electoral success in South Australia, it apparently remains one of their key policies, so debate about privatisation is likely to be intense in the run-up to the next election. The privateers appear to believe that only the individuals involved in transactions have the right to be concerned about their nature or outcome. Privatisation involves rejecting the balance of community responsibility. It is a direct attempt to undermine the power of government to influence the economy on behalf of the community. Privatisation would lead to increased inefficiency, greater inequality in the distribution of income and wealth, greater conflict and less effectiveness in the delivery of services. In fact, it would lead to greater insecurity, less freedom and more injustice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sale of the AIDC would reduce the efficiency of Australian industry by reducing the extent of innovation and by removing one of the sources of competitive pressures on private industry. It would tend to increase the extent of overseas ownership of Australian industry because one can be sure that many of the shares in a privatised AIDC would be bought by overseas companies and individuals. One of the results of the sale of the AIDC would be loss of a useful lever in building up Australian ownership of our enterprises. Therefore, Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to be able to praise the Corporation and to support this Bill wholeheartedly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation comprises two Bills which are partly complementary. The first is the Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill and the second is the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill. The Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill imposes charges on government instrumentalities and the second relieves the AIDC from those levies or charges concerning government guarantees. Activities of the AIDC are well known to most Australians. It acts as a development bank. It makes a significant contribution by the sheer size of its activity in seeking to increase the contribution to national growth and development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seeks out industries which are, in particular, internationally competitive, businesses which will earn export income. This year AIDC has posted a record income and a record profit as have most banks in Australia. I have heard members of the Australian Labor Party complaining about the size of the profits of banks. In particular, the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr West) said that as banks are profitable they can afford lower interest rates. It is a fascinating factor in the Australian economy that at times of high interest rates banks make profits. We have exceptionally high interest rate charges in Australia today and therefore it is not at all surprising that an organisation favoured by the Government, such as the AIDC, is making profits, as are other financial institutions which lend funds in our society today. The interest charges that Australians are paying are at world record levels. I fear that some of the activities of the AIDC and the high interest that it is forced to charge will lead to the problems that are notable in the disclosure of bankruptcy figures and the failures of businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all right for banks and lending institutions to be profitable but it is very hard for them to get additional business when the charges for money are extremely high. I suggest that the new business AIDC is writing at this moment is not significant, because nobody will take a punt on whether they can make an investment succeed at the charges that are levied on people when they borrow funds today. One has only to look at some of the standard interest charges in our community. We see 90-day bank bills at 16.75 per cent, 10-year bonds at 13.88 per cent and Bankcard at 21 per cent. The lowest rate for home loans is 15.5 per cent but most Institutions commonly charge 17.5 per cent with second mortgages running at over 20 per cent. That is the market that the AIDC is operating in. Whether it be finance for second mortgages, on advance or for the longer term investment with large amounts of money that the AIDC favours the charges are great and the profits are small. It is an exceptionally entrepreneurial type of activity that will profit in a climate such as that. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders whether the small businesses, the farming organisations of Australia, can continue to survive in the current climate, because their overheads and interest charges are a significant part of their operating costs. One wonders whether they will continue to survive. One also wonders how our home buyers can go out on the market and afford to purchase a home. I know it is only an exceptional few within my electorate who can make those purchases. They are the sorts of people basically who pay cash for their homes. People who have to borrow or have some sort of a cocktail loan-part building society and part finance company funded-are making exceptional efforts to meet their repayments, and that also applies to the organisations funded by AIDC. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this legislation the AIDC will be relieved of levy charges, and that is probably appropriate because the Corporation does make payments of a normal commercial type. However, it has some favoured aspects to it because of its association with government. The basic fact is, however, that, as an organisation, it is facing the same difficulty as any other lender in today's market. It is making profits but it is not writing new business. </PARA>

The expectations of investors are not great and job opportunities are declining. That is what the Government has to face in its broad management of the economy. It is all right to take an example, such as the AIDC, and say that it has made a big profit, therefore, it is a good organisation. The Government has to look behind those profits to see whether they will continue and whether that organisation will fulfil its objectives, whether there will be propositions for it to invest in Australia, to create jobs and to roll over both the funds of Australian investors and the funds of its overseas borrowings, which are substantial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the indicative figures that have come through on the success of business are very strongly linked to the statistics on bankruptcy. We have seen a half year result on bankruptcies, which is a record high for Australia. The Inspector-General in Bankruptcy says that it is quite proper to extend a half year result to a full year result because the number of bankruptcies has remained consistent during record keeping. Over 8,000 bankruptcies in a year is a huge increase, from 6,408 during the previous year. How does the AIDC operate in a market like that, where not just small businesses but also large businesses are being squeezed tighter and tighter? I do not see how the AIDC can continue to be effective while the economy is running as it is, with high overheads and high interest charges. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the performance of the AIDC and what it is facing. I refer to the quarterly business survey produced by the National Australia Bank Ltd and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and to capital investment in Australia. The expectation for capital investment is not good. One has only to look at the graph of expenditure plans on page 5 of this quarterly publication to see that the crunch point for capital investment started in the June quarter of 1985. That is when the nose dive commenced. Capital investment really took a dive. It hit a bottom on current figures in September last year, and has eased up very slightly. But it is a mirror image of what occurred to capital investment in 1981 and 1982. There is a similar depth of concern for the lack of expenditure. If one looks at the facts that have been collected on investment intention, one also notes that the proportion of firms anticipating a decline in capital investment is at a peak. It has fluctuated slightly over the last 12 months, but the proportion of firms anticipating a decline in capital investment is very high. Therefore today we have Government members saying: `What a fine organisation this great development bank is, which lends hundreds of millions of dollars to investment prospects', but they are behind the times. They are not with the current economic situation in the market-place and the prospects for investors. There is no prospect for large investors in Australia at the costs that they have to carry. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic outlook for investment by the AIDC is best summarised by quotations from five top across-the-board Australian economists, one of whom the Government will not appreciate. The first one, John Stone, believes that the outlook for 1987--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not voting against it. If the honourable member wants to muddle along and have a difficult economy in 1987, he is at liberty to do so. The reckoning day will come, however. We will not oppose this legislation. The Government can go ahead and pass it. He thinks that is fine. Let him answer a few questions when he speaks. This Government is going to put a levy on these organisations. On which government organisations will it impose the levy to make them into more commercial type activities? It will put a charge on Aussat Pty Ltd. Will the price of overseas telephone calls rise? What will flow through to the consumer? In his second reading speech, the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hurford) did not mention changes to consumer charges as a result of this levy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What about the Australian National Airlines Commission? What about the Australian National Railways Commission or the Australian Postal Commission? Will postal charges go up as a result of this additional levy, or will this cost have to be absorbed in the way that Australian businesses have had to absorb the stupid costs and taxes of the current Government? The result will be more expensive government instrumentalities because the Government will charge those instrumentalities, more expensive operation of those instrumentalities as a result of those greater charges, and the prospect of an increase in the charges imposed by those organisations. The Australian Telecommunications Commission is also to be subject to this levy under Part A and Part D of the Schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> The total amount of tax being requested from those organisations is such that it will be written into the balance sheets of the corporations. Will charges rise? I would like the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism (Mr John Brown), who is at the table, to say whether charges will rise. In six months' time we will see an increase in charges from these organisations and they will say that wages, salaries and overheads have necessitated the increase. Part of the increase will be due to a Government imposed levy on a government business undertaking. Also included in the list is the Federal Airports Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The costs of operation of airports in Australia, particularly Sydney's Kingsford-Smith Airport, are part of the responsibility of the Federal Airports Corporation. Will landing charges, et cetera, go up at airports? The Government is to have a double whammy. It will hit Australian Airlines, Qantas Airways Ltd and other instrumentalities with the levy, as well as the Federal Airports Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> An interesting inclusion in the list is the Health Insurance Commission. The Government is to put a levy on the Health Insurance Commission. It is fascinating that it can put a charge on this organisation that will affect the payment of health costs of the people of Australia. The Government will do that because the Commission is supposed to be run as a business type organisation and this is a business type charge. What will happen to the cost of health insurance? Will there be any change in that? We know the figures in the Budget. The abysmally small amount that we pay by way of levy is just laughable. Will the Medicare levy rise with the levy going on to the Health Insurance Commission?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the shadow Minister for Health, the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) notes, if the Government follows its previous practice, the cost will not be absorbed into the levy deducted from every taxpayer; it will be buried in the Budget, as most of the costs of Medicare are. So, secretly, the cost of the Health Insurance Commission may rise, but it will be the taxpayer who pays for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This levy being imposed on government instrumentalities is a cost that will have to be paid somehow. It will be paid by the consumer. The thing that worries me is the Government's head in the clouds attitude to all of this. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) likes to sit back and wind up his antique clocks. He likes to give the flick pass to any suggestion that the massive and record number of bankruptcies being experienced in Australia has nothing to do with him. He likes to say: `Don't you worry about that. A 35 per cent increase in Australian bankruptcies is no concern of mine'. That is how remote the Treasurer is from these matters. But he needs to be aware that organisations such as the Australian Industry Development Corporation are dependent on economic health for them to be successful. I have to say that the Opposition does not see any real role for the AIDC but, while the Government holds to the principle that there needs to be an AIDC, the Government needs to examine the environment within which that Corporation operates. What I am saying about the Treasurer's and the Government's attitude to these affairs is best epitomised in the lead in to the feature article in the Melbourne Herald of 12 February, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Paul Keating has always been a man of contradictions. He's the working class boy from Bankstown, who now wears imported suits and collects antique clocks. He's the man who lives in Canberra and collects $17,000 a year-tax free-for living in Sydney. He's the Treasurer--</PARA>

<PARA> He's the Treasurer who prosecutes people who don't get their tax returns in on time, but doesn't get his returns in on time. Then there was the Fringe Benefits Tax, which was to be changed only over his dead body. Bob Hawke got to fiddling with the FBT, but there seems to have been a problem with the second half of Mr Keating's boast: he's still with us. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a pity because, if he were not still with us, maybe we would have as Treasurer somebody competent, who would understand the affairs of the AIDC and the impact of charges across a whole range of government businesses and corporations which must ultimately increase the price to the consumer, the Australian taxpayer. It is a double way of taxing people. It is the standard technique of the Labor Government of New South Wales; it puts up charges as a way to balance its books. The charges are increased and money is got out of people indirectly. The whole scene in Australia is one of more and more costs impacting on fewer and fewer productive people. The economic growth of Australia is abysmal. The Government ought to be ashamed of the way in which economic growth is going and the predictions for economic growth. We have massive foreign debt, to which the AIDC is in part contributing. We have a record inflation rate compared with our partners in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The cost of labour is high. The Government uses the term `unit cost of labour', which is a ridiculous term. Over the last few days we have seen the figures for our terms of trade. There are problems with the value of the Australian dollar and with the Government's general fiscal policies. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these matters impact on the taxpayer. They are attacks on the Australian worker, the average guy, with his family, who wants a job and an opportunity. That is all those people demand, and yet the Australian Government is turning its back on them. It is fooling around with the economy. The Treasurer is winding his clocks while the country burns. He is a latter-day Nero in the way in which he regards the Australian community, the Australian worker and the Australian economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in support of the Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill and the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill. It is significant that these Bills are being couched in general economic terms in that in a sense the Opposition is putting forward a series of propositions about the economy. Of course, we on this side of the House welcome that. When it comes to comparing performance, the Government has a lot to be proud of in terms of its performance vis-a-vis that of the Opposition. The unfortunate thing for the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who has just sat down, and his colleagues is that they are regarded as failures by the electorate. Obviously, they are also regarded as failures by the Premier of Queensland. But we will not rely upon his judgment; we are happy to rely upon the judgment of the Australian electorate, which judged the Opposition very seriously in 1983, and again in 1984, as having a record of failure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The disturbing thing is that, even though the Opposition has been given time in opposition to come up with some policies, it has not been able to do so. We on this side of the house have been waiting for quite some time for the Opposition to develop some policies. It is interesting, when we look at the structure of comments made by Opposition speakers in this debate, that all we have really had has been random sniping about economic performance; there has been no cohesive development of argument or policy from the Opposition. Of course, the Australian electorate is not surprised at that because it sees the Opposition in its current tattered state. We on this side are not really sure with whom we are dealing in the Opposition. We do not know which particular groups or which particular faction to deal with. If we want to find out what the Opposition thinks, we do not know whether we should be ringing up Brisbane to find out what the Premier of Queensland thinks and whether perhaps he speaks for the Opposition. </PARA>

Very clearly, the independent Liberal Party, the independent Opposition that we had in the times of Menzies and McEwen, has been somewhat lost. I hope that Opposition members take some notice of the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) who is someone of principle and integrity in matters economic. Unfortunately, the experience is that they do not tend to do that. What they tend to do, which is the case with people of dogmatism everywhere, is to shout and scream loudly enough to silence the voice of reason inside their own heads, let alone anyone else's head.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AG4">Mr RONALD EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your comments. The problem for the Opposition is that in a sense what we on the Government side are doing is holding up a mirror to the Opposition. Opposition members find that a very painful experience because what they see is that not only is the mirror somewhat cracked when they look at their own visages but they recognise that there are many pieces which they have to have on display. Nevertheless, the Australian electorate understands that as well because it is wise enough to make those judgments. I was talking about the relationship between economic policy, industry policy, trade policy and fiscal policy. Those are the areas which the Opposition has not addressed substantially. Nor has it addressed monetary policy. What we on this side are saying, I suppose, in terms of the Bills is that we recognise that there is an important relationship between the role of government and the role of the private sector. This Government has shown that very clearly. The AIDC also does so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me be specific in terms of the role of the AIDC. We on our side do not find it difficult to recognise that there are public sector institutions which perform an admirable role in delivering services to the community. Neither, might I add historically, did the Menzies Government find it awkward. The problem for the Opposition is that it is not really sure whether it is reflecting the past or whether it is being tugged some other way. But we on our side are very clear about it. We believe that if the public sector has a role in trying to provide opportunities for industry-that is, the role of the AIDC-we welcome it. It is interesting to observe, particularly with respect to the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism (Mr John Brown), that the role of the AIDC in providing support for tourism in this country has been quite substantial. I am advised that last year the AIDC provided some $30m for tourism. If we look back historically, tourism was an industry that was neglected by the Opposition. When the Opposition was in government it behaved as if tourism did not exist. Yet we have had no doubts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism was very clear when we came to office that he had a role to perform in terms of the tourist industry and we have seen the benefits of it. It is not by accident that one of the great growth industries in Australia is tourism. It also is not by accident that tourism is one of the great employers. It also is not by accident that we are acquiring a great deal of foreign exchange, particularly as a result of the success of tourism from the United States. One of the difficulties in bland statements of ideology, which the Opposition tends to make, is that they ignore the realities of business. By and large Australian business is very mature. Australian business in recent times has been more accustomed to dealing with a competitive environment and, as a consequence of having a government which has competent economic policy, it has been prepared to take risks and to invest. An interesting test of the confidence of Australian business is the current performance of the stock exchanges. The stock exchanges, in terms both of the individual equity holder and the major movers in the stock market, recognise that we as a government have been doing the right thing. That is one of the important criteria we ought to be looking at. We have seen substantial investment in tourism, and substantial performance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that the AIDC, viewed from the point of view of the Opposition, could have been disposed of. I know that the Opposition is having a great deal of difficulty with slogans. Privatisation was one slogan which it has buried. It now has a new slogan, which we will not add to in this House. The difficulty of the Opposition is: What does one do beyond slogans? What does one do in terms of the analysis and policy work, the hard work, required to bring about both a change in people's perceptions of voting and a change in economic performance? That is something the Opposition has not addressed yet. I put to the House and to the Australian community that it is something this Government has been addressing. </PARA>
<PARA> On the demand side we recognise that it is important to provide a growing economy. Within this context let us talk about the AIDC. The AIDC recognises that it is important, if there are industry ventures which require support, to be prepared to commit itself to them. Let me be quite specific in terms of the AIDC's charter. One of the things we did when we took office was to increase the AIDC's gearing ratio to 15 : 1. That is the value we on this side place on having an organisation such as the AIDC. As a government we are not prepared to spend time badmouthing our fellow Australians, which seems to be a characteristic of some honourable members opposite, and certainly is a characteristic of the spokesperson referred to by the honourable member for Mitchell, that is, John Stone, who seems to take particular delight in criticising and badmouthing fellow Australians. We do not get any pleasure from that at all because we recognise that we have a joint responsibility to make this economy work. </PARA>
<PARA> In no better area has that been tested than in the wages policy area. The Opposition has some difficulties with wages policy. It will take some time working them out because that policy is a reflection of its own internal difficulties. But, at the extreme, to be generous to the Opposition, what it has not been able to put in place is a recognition that, in terms of the supply side of business, it is important that business can predict some directions of wages policy. A characteristic since we have been in government has been that it is possible to see a direction for wages policy because an element of predictability has been put into the picture. The Opposition has to recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA> When I spend time talking with people in business it is very clear--(Quorum formed) I say to my colleagues who are here that one of the difficulties that the Opposition is facing not only today but also this year in terms of the electoral process is that its destructive tactics we are seeing displayed in this place merely reflect the problems it has within its own parties. The problem for the Australian electorate is: Which Opposition are we dealing with? Is it the Joh led people and all the white-shoe brigade, is it the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) and his people from Melbourne, is it the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the remnants of the discredited National Party, or is it the dries around the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)? Which group?

Only for the greedy does it have a tax policy. Has it got a wages policy? Only for Copeman and Robe River people to kick unions. It has not got a wages policy. Does it have a trade policy? You bet they do not. That is why we have had difficulties in terms of evolving a wages policy. Ever since 1971 when the National Party stood over poor Billy McMahon in that famous meeting in Martin Place and the then Government did not deal with the Australian dollar we have had trouble on the trade front. The Government would not face the tough questions and it was copping out. Little wonder the honourable members opposite can find $25m from the Gold Coast to prop them up. Goodness me, all the people over the years that they are beholden to! It is a terrible situation. We ought not to put up with this; my goodness me, no; definitely not.

Are we going to accept the witch doctory of the Premier of Queensland, the uncosted circumstances and all of these situations that have never been dealt with properly? These are things that really we ought to be dealing with. What we want to say as a Government is that we have some policies in place, our record is clear to the Australian people-and the Australian people recognise that-but I think the Opposition has a real problem to face. Who is going to be leading it next week or later this year? Who is it going to be beholden to? What kind of debt does it owe to people?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said to the honourable member for Berowra, no wonder he feels lonely. He has no mates over there any more who can talk economic sense. The Opposition has dredged up John Stone as an economic commentator. Goodness gracious me, what a terrible situation. The honourable member for Berowra can do better than that. He is a man who has a degree in economics. Why does he not tell the Opposition that there is a world of real economics other than witch doctory. It happens that the Australian Treasurer knows the real circumstances of this economy. It also happens that the Australian electorate understands those circumstances. The Australian electorate is not going to be fooled by the sort of nonsense that the Opposition parties as a tattered group are putting about. At least we on this side have a track record. However, with the Opposition's track record it is no wonder that it wants to run away from it. The problem is that the Opposition is saddled with a leader, the honourable member for Bennelong, who was rarely the architect of all the economic vandalism that went on. No wonder Joh says he is going to come down and save the Opposition. All I can say is that Joh and all the lot opposite do not have enough between them to worry this Government at all. We have a track record and we have policies, and the Australian community is saying to the Opposition: `When will you come up with your policies?'. Certainly we do not have to be beholden to the $25m brigade. We do not have to do that at all. We are accountable to the Australian community and our record is very clear. </PARA>

They certainly enjoy the view from this side and they are going to have this view for a long time to come, because they are led by a government which has policies in place and because they are facing a series of Opposition groups-not parties any more, but Opposition groups-that are led by a terrible collection of failed leaders with a record of failure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am ordinarily delighted to follow the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), who usually speaks in a calm and well reasoned way, albeit often in grievous error. I must say though that in the latter part of his speech one would think that he was speaking from a position of rock-like solidity and unity over there, although what we have just had, in terms of new ministerial appointments and changes in the other place, is the outcome of the protracted bargaining of the institutionalised factions on that side of the House. It reaches a peak of irony when he says: `We are willing over here to stand on our record; we have got our policies'. What record? I hope that the Australian people are listening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have in this country a situation of quite dire straits. We have a desperate situation, one of real peril where we have a balance of payments deficit at an all time high level. We have a relentless progress to an overseas debt of the order of $100 billion with all its implications. Who brought it about? It was $30 billion when the Hawke Government came to power and it is now on course for $100 billion, with all that implies for what it will impose on our children and future generations. Associated with it we have a falling dollar, inflation in the range of 10 to 12 per cent and interest rates-pick up any issue of the Economist-seven to 10 percentage points higher here than practically anywhere else. It might be salutary for people on that side to do a few calculations sometime as to what that incidence of seven to 10 percentage points means in terms of additional costs for every man, woman and child in Australia, particularly for the young people of Australia who when buying a house work most of the working week just to pay the interest on the house they are endeavouring to buy. That is the sort of situation we have. We have a high level of unemployment with 25 per cent of our young people not in jobs. As my colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) emphasised earlier, probably one-third of farmers, a particular area of small business, are about to go broke.

Whatever the Government might see as difficulties for this side, there is a determination to carry things through this year, to remove the Government from that side of the House and to restore the situation in Australia. I am not suggesting, incidentally, that there is any instant or overnight solution. It will be a long haul but we have to get the settings in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This debate is about the Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill and the consequential Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill. The Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill imposes a charge where any government guaranteed loan is involved and has a particular impact on the Australian Industry Development Corporation. That organisation is given the option of invoking a government guarantee. If it does so, a charge of 0.5 per cent will apply. If it does not choose to involve a government guarantee, the charge will not apply. The first thing to be said about this is that it is just another tax gathering exercise, another tax gathering initiative, and the ultimate effect will be to raise some prices somewhere for ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing to be said is that in terms of its impact on the AIDC, by and large the most likely effect of the legislation will be that the AIDC will pay marginally more for its borrowings either because of a higher risk rating without the guarantee, or by paying the charge. It could be said that if that happens the Corporation will be placed on a more equal footing with competitors, which the Opposition basically supports. But one is bound to say at the same time that it seems rather unlikely that the Government would not honour financial obligations of the AIDC if the AIDC did get into trouble; so the AIDC could substantially retain its advantage in a sort of de facto way. </PARA>
<PARA> To say that is to underline the question that has been raised in the context of this debate as to why the AIDC should continue to be a government owned financial institution-a development bank, or perhaps it is described more accurately as a merchant bank. In these days of widespread deregulation of financial systems throughout the world and the enormous variety of financial institutions that have developed since the AIDC was established in 1971, it is a good question why this Government ownership continues at all. </PARA>
<PARA> What I have just said about the development of financial institutions underlines the absurdity of the claim by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) earlier in this debate that the consequence of such a change, of the Government divesting itself of the AIDC, would be `a disaster', or `a massive increase in unemployment in manufacturing'. That is absolute rot. I have no doubt that the actual job that the AIDC is doing today could be and would be done, and more cheaply, if it were left to the private sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it would, as my colleague said. That is not just ideology; it is supported by the weight of evidence when we look at many such activities. The word `privatisation' has been thrown around, but we are not interested in that or like words; we are interested only in the most efficient way of getting certain activities done. I remark in passing that we would not be taking up the time of the Parliament now with a debate on this Bill if it were not in itself an example of the sort of complications we can face when we have, in effect, government enterprise doing a job which is properly the role of the private sector. We have to look at this aspect of the matter and the impact of the Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill on the AIDC and sort it out so that it can continue its role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The hour is late but I intend to go back a little into the history of the emergence of this institution. It was brought into being basically as one element in a policy of encouraging borrowing instead of relying too much on direct foreign investment. It was one element in a policy of promoting the assembling with a significant Australian initiative and participation, of funds to finance major development projects. It was almost superfluous even at the time it was introduced because the Australian Resources Development Bank in the private sector had been set up for that purpose. This was all in a context of widespread concern about the extent of overseas ownership and control of Australian industry and resources. With the less fluid and less developed financial system and the international financial system at that time, the AIDC achieved some success along with the private sector institution, the Australian Resources Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> In the position Australia is in today we have almost the opposite requirement. Loan borrowings with the associated fixed interest obligations have burgeoned-I was saying a moment ago just how they have burgeoned. What is now important is the encouragement of long term direct investment, including perhaps some recycling of existing debts as direct investment. The Government should do that. We will certainly do it on return to government, by the removal of all remaining foreign investment controls, except for certain limited and clearly defined strategically important areas. If we did have some sort of balance of payments problem coupled with a concern at the extent of overseas ownership and control in the economy in those days of the latter 1960s preceding the setting up of the AIDC in 1971, what a problem we have today! If we had a problem then, what sort of a problem do we have today after four years of the Hawke Labor Government? What we have had is a deficit in the balance of payments of $11 billion in 1984-85, $13.7 billion in 1985-86 and currently we are on course for at least the same order of deficit, about $14 billion for 1986-87. We heard the figure yesterday for the deficit in the balance of payments for January-that is, the excess of what we have to pay overseas as compared with what we earn overseas. What we have to pay overseas includes very substantial sums for interest on those borrowings. The figure for the month of January we heard yesterday was $1,290m-nearly $1.3 billion. So when I say we are on course for another $14 billion we only have to multiply that by 12 and we can see where the $14 billion is. There is in excess of the order of $1 billion a month on average. That is worth thinking about; that is about $40m a day which is the measure of the extent to which as a nation we are going into hock. It is $40m more today than it was yesterday. The relentless impact of this building up of the overseas debt, which is on course for $100m, which is Third World stuff, is to put an enormous first charge on export earnings and a great burden on future generations. This country is living very much beyond its means, like an individual with an income of $300 but spending $350 per week. He has to borrow and keep on borrowing. The currency eventually becomes suspect and is devalued. We have listened to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) talking as if the currency being devalued was a considered measure of economic policy. It was visited upon us by overseas countries because of the situation we got ourselves into. That is the truth of the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know about that. The Government floated it and immediately after there was a bit of a devaluation. Then it came back and stayed for quite a while at the level it was when it was floated. The Minister can form his own opinion from that. That is what has been visited upon us and if the situation continues a further devaluation will be visited upon us. That would then have its impact upon inflation. Inflation in the December quarter was 2.9 per cent, which can be annualised in the order of 10 to 12 per cent. In the United States of America the inflation rate is one per cent to 2 per cent and in Japan and Germany it is practically zero. Yet those are the countries against which we are supposed to do better in terms of costs and inflation, in order to work ourselves out of this situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is a desperate situation which the Australian economy finds itself in. There has been a bit of a false dawn, with some reasonably favourable figures in December, but do not let us lose sight of the real situation. So we spend our time debating this Bill to impose charges, to increase taxes, prices and the consumer price index a bit more! I admit that the amount is not massive. I will conclude by looking at the AIDC itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one looks at the range of the present activities of the AIDC, as distinct from those sorts of activities which I set out to put in a historical context, one sees that it is financing shopping centres as well as a lot of industry development in, thankfully, high technology ventures. But there is not very much of what it is doing which could be construed as arising from some sort of social purpose which a government-owned body must do. In point of fact, there is a strong case for disposing of the AIDC to the private sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. I was trying to say that the Opposition speakers say that they support these Bills, but everything they have said is in opposition to them. I came from a statutory authority, Telecom Australia, and I was involved in an area which was originally opened up to a limited degree of competition and now is opened up to full competition-I must say, by a Labor Government. The important point I want to make is one of the points the competitors used to make, which I thought was fairly valid. Statutory authorities have certain advantages over competing private enterprise organisations. I would have thought that the Opposition would have welcomed the Government imposing a small fee of 0.5 per cent on those loans that statutory corporations raise on the private market where they are guaranteed, but that has not been the argument. The argument has been that this is some sort of taxation revenue measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thought that the only Opposition speaker who came close to a decent point was the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), who talked about whether it was really worth the 0.5 per cent. If I understood his point correctly, it was that corporations such as the AIDC and Telecom, which have gone out into the private market, have developed their own market and by and large do not need government guarantees. Of course, it is one of the features of the Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill that organisations may apply to the Treasurer, where the Treasurer has a discretion, to opt out of it. The other Bill makes specific provision for the AIDC to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot has been said about the AIDC, but I want to say something about two things which the dedicated people who have been working for quite some time in this organisation must have been very disappointed to hear. Firstly, the Opposition want to privatise the AIDC. If one clear message comes from the Opposition, it is that it wants to privatise it. They said, in effect: `Gentlemen, your work is of no value. Indeed, it can be performed by any other merchant bank'. I disagree, and I hope that I can prove the contrary later in my contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I take up the remarks of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) who suggested that the Corporation had actually written to the Government seeking to be privatised. It is absolutely disgraceful for the honourable member for Mayo to advance that proposition. It may be the case, where statutory corporations are finding difficulty in raising capital, that they want to diversify their capital base away from the Government and attract some private funds, but I put it to honourable members that to suggest that this is some form of privatisation is, with great respect, a canard. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the AIDC? It was set up, I believe, in 1977, not by a Labor government. It is a statutory corporation which is wholly owned by the Commonwealth. Half of its profit, which I believe was some $19m last year, went back to the Australian people by way of dividend. The Corporation is a financial enterprise operating under commercial principles, which is another area where I feel that Opposition speakers have confused the issues. On the one hand, they point out that the Corporation operates under commercial principles. Yet, on the other, they feel that if it operates under commercial principles it should therefore, be privatised. The AIDC consults the Government from time to time on its general policy, but it makes its own decisions on transactions. The Corporation makes its own individual decisions, but generally it follows government policy line. This Government, in stark contrast to the Fraser Government, has quite a record on industry policy. The beefing up of AIDC is but one of the areas. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the summary of operations of the AIDC, one sees the dramatic change that has occurred under the Labor Government. For example, in 1981 the Corporation had about half a billion dollars worth of loans and investments. In 1982, the last year of the Fraser Government, it had $735m worth of loans and investments. What had happened by 1986? Was the figure $800m or $900m? No. Under the Labor Government, in 1983 the figure was $927m. In 1984 it was $1,145m and in 1985 it was $1,460m. This year the figure is $2.1 billion. What that means is that the Corporation is in the market-place-firstly, attracting funds and, secondly, putting them back into Australian industry. It has put the funds back into a variety of things. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation has been involved in technology and innovation, manufacturing, and export developments. For example, it has been involved in penetrating the United States of America and other markets with novel products. It has been involved in industry restructuring in the wine, whitegoods, iron foundry and pump industries. The Corporation has been involved in generating new ventures. It has looked at resources, at tourism and accommodation, and at Australianisation, commerce, underwriting of public shares, industry initiatives, and funding capital market activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo seemed to make light of the fact that the Corporation was involved in Barbeques Galore Holdings Pty Ltd. Let me set the record straight. Barbeques Galore is Australia's largest vertically integrated producer and distributor of gas barbecues and solid fuel heaters. The group has a joint venture retail and manufacturing operation in New Zealand and has three retail barbecue outlets in Los Angeles. The company has established a joint venture for retail distribution of its products in the United Kingdom, which will commence operations in 1987. It also aims to expand its activities in the United States market. The AIDC has taken a shareholding in Barbeques Galore to support the company's expansion plans, particularly in overseas markets. If the honourable member for Mayo finds some objection to that, so be it. I think that that is what our Australian Industry Development Corporation should be doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted a couple of things in the honourable member's contribution. He certainly did not mention the AIDC's involvement in Mildara Wines Ltd. On any occasion that wine has come up as an issue in this Parliament, the honourable member has been up on his feet. Does he not take exception to the AIDC's involvement in that, or is he keeping mute to be rather cute? He did not mention the rationalisation of the whitegoods industry. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be aware of the takeover and amalgamation of Simpson Holdings Ltd, a South Australian company, and Email Ltd. Why did not the honourable member speak up on that issue? It certainly affects his State. Would he privatise those industries? If so, would the private merchant banks be involved in Mildara Wines and the whitegoods industry?</PARA>
<PARA> I have already talked about the Opposition's position on this matter. I have not heard one Opposition speaker, even my esteemed colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards), point out the Fraser Government's record on industry policy or the Opposition's platform-whether the Opposition is the Joh party, the National Party, the wets or the dries. At least we are entitled to an exposition of which industry policy the Opposition would advance. The honourable member for Berowra says that we should not be proud of the record. The Hawke Government has a lot to be proud of in terms of industry policy. I would have thought that the honourable member for Berowra would have at least given credit to the Hawke Government for its involvement in industry policy. Can honourable members opposite name an industry plan that Mr Fraser introduced to put a bottom line under employment in a particular industry, or to provide a future of growth and jobs in a particular industry? I would like to rattle off a few of our plans. There is the steel plan--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Button plan is the Opposition's plan? Come on, Harry! We have a plan that is working, and we are exporting more. The problem with which the Opposition will not come to grips is that we are in a cyclical downturn in terms of our agricultural and mineral products. It has never occurred with such force. One hopes that in the years ahead those commodities will come up and that agricultural and mineral production will continue to play a significant part in Australia's exports; but we must broaden our base. If we just let the market-place sort it out, that will not happen. If a Liberal-National Party coalition gets into government, it will blast manufacturing out of the water.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We need corporations such as the Australian Industry Development Corporation to put packages together. For example, we have had the heavy industry manufacturing plan announced last year and implemented by this Government. Does the Opposition intend to say that that was its plan? It is not the Opposition's plan; it is Senator Button's plan. The AIDC is playing an important part in that plan. We are looking for something like $130m worth of investment in that industry. About $30m is going in concessional loan subsidies to get it back on its feet so it can be competitive, replace imports, and have an export orientation. That is terribly important. </PARA>
<PARA> Another plan that is costing the Government very little-perhaps it was Mr Fraser's plan; I will have to check-is the communications plan. No, it was not Mr Fraser's plan; it was this Government's plan. We have put some targets on it. We are looking for an increased performance, from about $200m to $600m by 1996. There has been a lot of criticism of the plan. The real criticism is that although we are doing better we can do much better. It has taken a Labor Party government to say, first, that manufacturing and services are very important; secondly, that we need to broaden our base in Australia; and, thirdly, that we need the involvement of government, business and unions in it. </PARA>
<PARA> One can expect the Labor side to support initiatives such as the steel plan. But the AIDC plays a very important role. The Opposition has tried to say that it is nothing other than just an ordinary, average private enterprise merchant bank. Well, it is not. It is an organisation which makes its own individual decisions but which consults with the Government to ensure that its policies, its areas of activity, dovetail into the initiatives the Government is taking.</PARA>

Why will honourable members opposite not acknowledge the tremendous impact that it is making in a wide variety of fields? Why do they want to kill it off when it is proving to be successful? I just do not understand it. If we have an organisation that is meeting all our criteria, they want to say to the employees: `You might have done a good job, but go away; we want to privatise you. Whether you keep your job or not does not matter to us and whether or not your customers have loans does not matter to us'. The Opposition does not like successful statutory organisations. If such an organisation were banking up losses, those opposite would say to us: `There you are; it is a fallacy of your philosophy; it is a fallacy of intervention. We told you you were wrong'. But if such a body is successful, the Opposition says we have to sell it off. The AIDC has been successful, and the Australian people can be assured of a couple of things: Firstly, the Government's commitment to the continued involvement and growth of the AIDC; and secondly, the Government's continued involvement and commitment to the services sector and to the manufacturing industry sector. We will not implement the policies that those opposite had when they were in government that blasted industry and services out of the water.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a strong supporter in previous years of the Australian Industry Development Corporation I want to have just a few words tonight about the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill, which of course is aimed at continuing the operation of this organisation. I have supported the AIDC in the past because the Australian financial system was reluctant at times, in years gone by, to fund those proposals which had any element of risk. I think it was well known through Australian business society that the Australian banking system bet only on certainties. In fact, there were no bets at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes; the Minister at the table is quite correct. One had to prove that one was so viable that everyone was rushing to lend money. On those occasions people who had the idea and little else had to go away and beg to others or accept the fact that they just could not get their proposal up in the world of commerce. I ran into such a situation while I was Premier of South Australia. The Director of Industrial Development came to me one day and said: `Look, this fellow who makes a certain commodity has been making it at home in a garage. He submitted this commodity in response to a tender called by a multinational in Australia for a product to perform a certain task, which may lead to sales of the product throughout Australia. Despite the submission of tenders by huge companies, this little operator was successful because of the quality of his product'. Of course he was presented with this enormous order. Every month he was due to deliver this huge quantity of material, and all he had was a garage. What he needed first was a mixer. Way back in 1969 it would have cost him $10,000-a small amount by today's devalued currency. There he was-he had success staring him in the face, a contract waiting to be signed, but could he get $10,000 from the banks in South Australia? Of course not. It was not available to him. He could not go through the State parliamentary process of committee investigation and wait six to 12 weeks for a response; he needed the money within a fortnight. It was only by the appropriate State public servant bending friendships in the financial area that that gentleman was able to get his $10,000. Within five years he was employing 120 people. It was a dramatic failure of the financial system as we knew it in the late 1960s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course with the personal background I have always been a strong supporter of the AIDC. I have known personally the retired Chief Executive, Mr Bob Thomas, and I congratulate him on his stewardship in that position. Of course he left the organisation in the strongest position it has been in. Having said that, I must without prejudice or ideology ask the question: Is the Corporation needed now in its current form? Things have occurred since 1968. I am still in politics, but that is a long while ago. The Government itself, by its financial actions in the last several years, has indicated that things are different. It has made them different and it has opened up the financial scene. I look without prejudice at the annual report of the Corporation and I wonder now whether the financial needs of these companies being assisted could be met by the private organisations that we currently have. I think I would have to say in all fairness that in the newly competitive scene we now have this mania in the community for takeovers has bred so much debt that money is flowing throughout the community. Shares are bought up and the capital is flowing. One can get money anywhere-even on the value of a share one has yet to purchase. It seems to me that the need we once had, so dramatically illustrated to many of us, no longer exists as it did. I am not saying that the situation will not arise again; of course changes occur. I believe that the private financial system needs to be niggled now and again to let it know that it has to serve all its customers and not those who want $2 billion to take over another company. </PARA>
<PARA> In saying this I would like to direct the attention of the House to the needs of the very small, often single entrepreneur. There are wise heads in the business community who say that the upwelling of ideas occurs within these individual innovators. I know in my own State of South Australia that I can reel them off on the fingers of my hand and double it to arrive at the number of people who have made these various commodities. Some of them have been very fortunate in the past that they have kept their innovations in their own hands and still own-or their families still own-those companies of great wealth which have been built often on the basis of a single initial innovation. The whole of the industrial world depends on the innovation and, as I have said, so much comes from the individual operator. </PARA>
<PARA> If I had any advice to give, I suppose from afar, to an organisation such as the AIDC, it would be that I would like to see it aim at assisting smaller and smaller operators because I believe the bigger ones can look after themselves. They may not have been able to before but they can now in the current commercial situation. So I would like to see assistance in those areas involving risk taking expanded, particularly if it is directed to the smaller innovators. There needs to be an arm of government involved with this. Here I pay tribute to some of the State governments, which of course are involved. They get expansive at times and they get wasteful, as State governments are wont to do, but I believe if this organisation is to fulfil a need this Parliament must scrutinise its success by assessing what it does in areas in which other organisations cannot operate. Parliament will not year after year approve of this organisation because it is doing what banks can do. Why would it? I believe the AIDC has to turn more and more to the innovator. After all, why should it compete with the sort of socialistic attitude experienced in Queensland and put up by Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, the Premier of Queensland, who has turned his State Government Insurance Office into one of the most socialistic enterprises in Australia? I think it is called Suncorp. I do not know whether I have the name correct, but I think that is what it is. It is involved, like an octopus, with the commercial and industrial life of Queensland. It is a product of the man who now is rampaging around Australia as the head of the so-called New Right, the free enterprise party. But the product he has at home is one of pure socialism which would make the Hawke Government look like a rightist government, even in the United States of America. So let us not have this organisation compete with the sort of socialism of Joh Bjelke-Petersen. I direct the attention of the Corporation, as I have said, particularly to the need of the small innovator who represents the upswelling of new ideas which big business buys to the profitability of both and which will re-energise from time to time the commercial and industrial enterprise of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In these few remarks I do not criticise the existence of the AIDC: I just draw the House's attention to redirecting our thoughts to new needs, to not decrying it, to giving it new life. The Corporation should redirect its attention to the small person who is the basis of the existence of the Liberal Party. We believe in fostering those who cannot get help from anywhere else, giving equal opportunity and certainly letting the new innovators come through to the benefit of the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The constructive remarks that have just been made by the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) are in sharp contrast with those of his Liberal colleague, the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards). After listening to the honourable member for Berowra, the well known economist, I can understand why people lose faith with politicians and in politicians. It seems that for the sake of political point scoring he has presented the House with another lot of misinformation. He talked at length about Australia's foreign debt. There would be many listeners who would not fully understand the situation but the honourable member did not bother to explain that he was talking about the gross foreign debt. I believe he led everybody listening to this debate to think that the $100 billion that he talked about was owed by the Hawke Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member made no variation to that statement; he simply made that point. He purposely omitted pointing out that this nation has reserves of almost $14 billion and that another $7 billion is owed to Australians by overseas people. So Australia has a net debt-I think the latest figures are for the June or September quarter-of about $80 billion. The honourable member further attempted to mislead listeners to this debate because he failed to point out that for every $10 billion owed by this nation, more than 60 per cent-more than $6 billion out of $10 billion-is owed by the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2K4">Mr WRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member did not say that. He made out that the debt was all owed by the Government. I am very pleased with the points made by the honourable member for Boothby. He referred to the takeovers that bred so much debt. Maybe the honourable member for Berowra ought to listen to the honourable member for Boothby. Let us go a little further. The honourable member for Berowra also did not bother to point out that another 20 per cent, or $2 billion out of every $10 billion, is owed by the States and the statutory authorities. To take up the case of Queensland, some $3 billion is owed by the electricity authority in that State. The Liberals particularly-I separate a number of the so-called wets who, I think, at least understand what this is about-are trying to make out that the Australian Government owes all this money. However, 20 per cent of the total debt is owed by the Commonwealth and we have reserves amounting to some $13 billion or $14 billion. Whilst it is not a satisfactory situation, it is not as the Liberals are painting it, and it is certainly not as the National Party members are painting it. I follow the point of the honourable member for Boothby and suggest that much of our trouble today stems from the recent takeovers. The high financiers have been providing as much money as people want to take over Australian companies. One can borrow $1 billion or $2 billion. There has been a campaign misinformation. I regret that it is knowingly or unknowingly supported by some members of the media. This Parliament has a special obligation to make sure that these facts are told.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I watched the Channel 9 Sunday program on Sunday morning. I was amazed to see a well known and respected reporter, Charles Woolley, tell the viewers of Australia that a miner in the Northern Territory who is on $50,000 a year is paying almost half of his income in tax. It is totally untrue but because this journalist says it, people believe it because they see it on television. The facts are that under Labor's tax changes a person earning $50,000 a year does not pay $25,000 in tax or 50 per cent; in fact, he pays around 36 per cent. He pays $18,000 in tax. It is not 50c in the dollar; it is a little less than 36c in the dollar. People do not seem to understand that one does not pay any tax on the first $5,100 that one earns and that one pays 25 per cent on the next $7,000. I shall give an easy example. A person on $35,000 a year does not pay half of it in tax, as the Liberals are running around saying. They say that such a person is caught up in the 60 per cent tax bracket, which will fall to 49 per cent. That person on $35,000 a year now pays $10,676 in tax, which is just on 30 per cent-30c in the dollar. I suggest that the honourable member for Berowra has done his profession no good, nor his own reputation, in generalising here tonight and making out that this is the situation in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the legislation before us. The Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill provides for the current Commonwealth statutory guarantee on borrowings and raisings by the Australian Industry Development Corporation now to become optional at the Corporation's discretion. I noted in a report that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) released that the AIDC had a record after tax net profit of $19.1m. The amendment simply acknowledges the commercial strength of the Corporation and its proven ability to stand on its own two feet as a successful government owned development bank. I think that the success of the AIDC under the Hawke Labor Government has been one of the many triumphs that this Government has chalked up in the business-industry area since 1983. I congratulate the Minister for Science (Mr Barry Jones) for the part that he is playing in this House. But because of the ignorance that exists in the community I regret to say that many people in the business world simply are not aware of the assistance that is available. I have spent some three months contacting department after department, both State and Federal, to gather information that I can put together in some type of booklet to explain what sort of assistance is available to business. I assure honourable members that an enormous amount of assistance is available, but regrettably most people do not know about it. The report shows that the AIDC approved 853 research and development grants worth $16m in 1984-85, so people ought to know that they can apply for some of that money for research and development programs. The report also shows that total AIDC assistance for 1984-85 was more than $64m. But it is very hard for a business person to find out what is available for him and where to go to get it. I am pleased that for that reason this Government has introduced a new scheme, the national industry extension service, with toll free numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone understands the frustration of any individual trying to ring a department for information. The switch person may be keen to help but has to pass the inquiry to someone else. It may be the wrong extension and the person who answers has to pass the call on to someone else. Fifteen or 20 minutes later the person inquiring still does not have the information. The Federal Government understands this problem. Whilst there have been many types of extension services in the private sector, we now have a government set up national industry extension service using toll free numbers. I am sure it will do much to assist Australian industry. It will help us to develop world class firms in the internationally traded goods and services sector. It is so important that Australians understand what is available to them. We have had problems. Honourable members from both sides understand the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to understand also that these problems did not start in 1986 and 1987. In August last year I read the Metal Trades Industry Association report. It pointed out very specifically and clearly that our real problems occurred from 1979 to 1982 when the Liberals and Nationals, through their policies-or lack of policies-brought about the deterioration of our national manufacturing base. Many companies went off-shore. Many companies, simply because of the high cost of the Australian dollar, which was overvalued, and due in part to the high cost of labour, started manufacturing in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong an other places. It is vitally important that we rectify this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard an excellent speech made by the Minister for Science (Mr Barry Jones) recently, about the need to get quality into our products. If we are to do this, if we are to broaden our manufacturing base and if we are to get quality into our products so that we can compete, there must be government assistance. It irks me to hear members of the Opposition stand up and say that now is the time to privatise. I put it to all listeners that anyone going to the banks today has to bleed to get money out of them. Whether it be $10m or $10,000, people bleed for it. Then they find that other banks, because they consider some people to be a high risk, instead of charging 18 per cent, they put a loading on. One well known bank admitted to a committee of this House that the normal bank rate was 18 per cent but in some instances, because some applicants were a high risk, it was charging 23 per cent. That is not good enough. We need to come to grips with these particular problems. Now is not the time to walk away from the role of the AIDC or other government instrumentalities in helping business. Now is not the time to say, `Leave it to the banks' because, as I said, the banks make people bleed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition also believes that, just as we keep the AIDC in place, and just as we introduce the NIES, the extension service program, we have also to overcome the delays. I ask the Minister at the table, the Minister for Science, to take back to departmental heads, especially on a regional basis that whilst people are starting to understand that money could be available for grants through the gross expenditure on research and development scheme, through the export incentive schemes or from the money we are giving through the States for the Queensland Industrial Development Corporation and the small business development corporations, the delay is unbelievable. </PARA>
<PARA> I also appreciate that it is government money, it is the people's money, so the Minister cannot just sign each application, say `It will be okay, mate' and then find out later on that it did not meet the guidelines or that the venture was not viable. But we have to ensure that that assistance is available and, moreover, that people know about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am most concerned about the failure rate of business in this country. I recently saw some figures that showed that in the small business sector some 60 per cent-six out of 10-of every small business that starts up, fails within three years. Regrettably, in my home State of Queensland, that statistic has jumped to 72 per cent. So 72 businesses out of every 100 that start up fail within three years. I often wonder whether this is because of not only a lack of management skills, but a lack of knowledge. It surprises me, when all the information is available, when we have, through the Commonwealth Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, some 50 different booklets, films and cassettes on every aspect of business, such as on the buying and selling of a business, on small business and the law, on presenting a case for finance, on job costing and estimating, on advertising, on credit management that businesses still continue to fail. I believe that with the States we have a very serious task ahead of us. We first have to educate businesses as to their special difficulties and we also have to educate them as to the advice and financial assistance that are available, and then, importantly make sure that that assistance can be given to them forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA> I am impressed with what we have been able to do in Australia over the years. I read recently of a fellow from Sydney, Arthur Bishop, a veteran Sydney inventor, who can now say that half the cars made in Australia use his steering gear components. I am told that a third of the cars in Germany now use his Australian invention, and that within a few years something like 30 per cent of all American cars will be using this invention. I read also of a new etching process, discovered by the Australian National University, which could develop into a multi-million dollar industry. A Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation scientist, John Coleman, has invented a high speed process for waxing cardboard boxes. It is so simple, but it actually means $5m to our country already and we can project this into tens of millions of dollars in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have an exciting world reputation for our inventions and our innovativeness. Back in 1870 the Smiths, Robert and Clarence, invented the stump jump plough. The rotary hoe was invented by Australians by the name of Cliff and Albert Howard. It was Falkiner who developed the mechanical cane harvester. In 1880 the Australian James Harrison invented commercial refrigeration. Four years later, in 1884, McKay invented the combine harvester. The rotary mower was the brainchild of another Australian, M. V. Richardson, in 1952. Barely a decade ago Graeme Clark invented the bionic ear. Everyone has heard about the black box flight recorder, which is another Australian invention which was invented in the 1950s by David Warren. There are all sorts of other inventions that we can be proud of. But I regret that so often the records show that these inventions have gone overseas and we have not gained from them. So it is important that we do not start privatising the AIDC. It is important that we take note of the innovativeness, the expertise and the skills of Australians and that we back them. I give full credit to this Government and to the Ministers involved for the role that is being played here. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently a farmer in my electorate was given approval in principle for a $30,000 loan because he has come up with a quick freeze process for freezing paw-paw or papaya, as many people know that fruit. It looks as though we can crack the Japanese market with this process. Another fellow in my area has marble deposits which the other day were estimated to be worth about $400m. Regrettably, he cannot get money. Regrettably, he needs some $1m to get the project moving. He needs $350,000 for the saw, but under the rules that exist today he cannot get it. He can get a subsidy on the interest that he might pay on a loan up to $100,000 through the QIDC and he can get an export grant if he can get the things going. Austrade, the Australian Trade Commission, can find markets for him. We can subsidise interest rates and do all sorts of things for development and research, but many projects just do not fit into that mould; they do not fit those guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to my final point. We need to make sure that people know what assistance is available. We have to make sure that that assistance is available readily, that it can be expeditiously made available, and finally, we need to understand that today people do not need just an interest subsidy, they do not need just assistance in finding markets, they do not need just this back-up for research and development, they need up-front capital. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a barramundi farm in my region. The locals have already spent $150,000 on it, but they need capital right now. Another project that they have developed is a harvester that can cut range grasses and inject nutrient feed for arid countries and for drought ridden Australia, but again, this needs up-front capital. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude simply by saying that Australia has the expertise. We have the potential in our population. We certainly have noted that, with the assistance given by this Government, and previously by the Fraser Government, in setting up the AIDC. But there is a need for this Government to understand that today companies need not only the other assistance that is available, but also direct, up-front capital. I would like to think that if we do this, Australian inventions will stay in Australia for Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it interesting that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards), claims to have been misrepresented. It is interesting to notice how the Opposition parties are quick to run away from their true responsibility, which is to examine the economics of the country as they exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This debate has been characterised by the absolute failure of the Opposition to address the topic, and the topic is essentially industry policy. In looking at what has been put forward, the vacuum that exists in the industry policy area in both the Liberal Party of Australia and National Party of Australia in perhaps their most glaring failure. But we should not be surprised by that, because the fact is that in the best of all possible worlds we would not need the AIDC or anything like it because we would have Australian owned, aggressive, dynamic, organic manufacturing industries. The fact that we do not have such industries is largely a legacy of the previous Government, to which the honourable member for Berowra belonged for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the future of this country at a time when there is a need for a manufacturing culture, one has to be somewhat amazed by the emergence of an agrarian culture within the Opposition and within the so-called New Right. I do not call usually that group the New Right because that does not mean a great deal. The term I use for those people is neo-feudalists, because they hark back to feudal days when the worker knew his place and he thanked the lord of the manor for his house, his pittance and his right to work on the lord's land. He thanked the lord for the right to exist and to feed his children. If the lord of the manor was having a bad time, he did not mind conscripting his serfs into his armies in whatever form was appropriate. The neo-feudalists hark back to those days. In fact, virtually all of the policies coming forward from the other side of the chamber are aimed at saying to those people who have nothing: `Because you have nothing, your place is controlled and you will be dictated to'. The would-be lords on the other side of the House fail to recognise the change that this society needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect that has been disappointing in recent years has been the business culture shock that we have experienced in this country. Our business community was born and raised on a diet of fixed exchange rates and high tariffs. For many years a number of businesses said that that was not a good culture or a good climate. Yet now, when the climate and the culture have been dramatically shifted and we have a floating and competitive exchange rate and much less importance placed on tariff policy in manufacturing decisions in Australia, the fact is that so many of the people who were brought up in the previous culture are having great difficulty handling the new one. I am quite convinced that, as our business community goes through this process of culture shock, at the other end will emerge a viable manufacturing society. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole process is being slowed, retarded, and I suppose one could say sabotaged, by the failure of the Opposition to probe industry policy. That is where the vacuum is. One needs only to look at the ministries within the previous Government to see the significance of the Minister responsible for industry, the Minister for commerce or the Minister for business. The ministries involved a whole range of titles. The Ministers were invariably junior. They never had Cabinet status. They rarely had significance. To be honest, more importance was placed on the portfolios of customs and tariffs. The industry policy of the previous Government was one of customs and tariffs policy. The generation of manufacturing was inappropriate to that Government because it was generating the decimation of Australian manufacturing industry. After all, it was thought that, if we were to sell our resources, raw materials and primary products, it was fundamental that we had to import manufactured goods from the countries to which we sold our raw materials and commodities. As a result of the cultural cringe, the business cringe, the political cringe that this country exhibited for so long, it would not have been acceptable in trade terms to have suggested to the buyers of our raw materials and primary products that we should also sell manufactured goods, so we did not dare take the risk. We can look back at the 1960s and to the decimation of, for example, our aircraft industry by the purchase of the F111. We can look at the decimation of various other industries by a government and by a business community which tended to refuse to accept the responsibility for the future generations of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The current evolution of the AIDC is a fundamental necessity in terms of changing, adapting and developing an appropriate manufacturing industry culture in this country. When we came to government we saw this need. Honourable members will recall that, when we came to government, industries were in crisis all over the countryside. In my area the steel industry was involved. Let me put on record that in 1982 the then responsible Minister and/or the then Prime Minister were invited to come to Newcastle to talk to the thousands of people whose jobs and whose businesses were at stake. Many of those small business people fed off or into the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. But the then Minister was too busy to come. In fact, even at the time of the election in March 1983, the previous Government's sole position on the steel industry was that it would be looked into at some stage in the future. That indicates the vacuum that existed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, when we came to government we were beset by a crisis of confidence, a crisis of investment, a crisis of industry but, most importantly, a crisis of morale. Very quickly, a number of our Ministers, including the Minister for Science (Mr Barry Jones), who is at the table and who then had responsibility for the AIDC, brought to Caucus committees and to Cabinet a number of proposals, which included, among other things, a massive injection of capital into the AIDC and an extension of its terms of reference and its objectives. One can argue that it was too little too late, and that, if we had had a chance five years earlier, we may not have needed such dramatic measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition now talks about making the AIDC into a merchant bank. But we have a plethora of merchant banks. We probably have more merchant banks per head of population than any other country. Yet the Opposition suggests that the role of the AIDC should be of one of a merchant bank. The Opposition's statements and its actions indicate that the fundamental lack in the finance field has been in the form of appropriate finance for manufacturing industry. Our finance markets and houses were dictated by, geared to and oriented towards speculative capital gains in land and building developments, not manufacturing. The Opposition by talking now of letting the AIDC become a merchant bank is saying: `We do not need an investment capacity or a finance capacity that is geared towards manufacturing'. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members should go around the country and talk to small business people. It is clear that Opposition members do not do that. They should find out how hard it is for a small company, compared with the big companies to borrow at a low interest rate. The smaller the business, the higher the interest rate; the greater the need, the greater the cost. Finance is psychologically and economically geared to the wrong end of the market: Those who have money can get it easily; those who do not have it have great difficulty in borrowing it. Therefore, the function of the AIDC is to fill the gap left in the Australian investment market by the previous Government's industry policy and in the whole spectrum of industry development and technological development. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is an appropriate one to give the AIDC the choice as to whether it uses a government guarantee. There is nothing more sensible than that. I find it appalling that members of the Opposition have attempted to oppose the AIDC and the Government's actions in relation to it over the last four years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we approach the witching hour of 10.15 p.m., I just want to make a few comments to wind up. In the debate there has been heavy concentration on the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill and hardly any reference to the Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill. I thank honourable members for their contributions. I just want to correct and restate one or two points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The AIDC paid up capital is now $100m, not $87.5m as stated by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). An additional $12.5m was paid as of 30 June 1986. The functions of the AIDC are set out in the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act. They are to promote sound industry growth and Australian ownership in industry. The Corporation is required to perform these functions in accordance with sound business practice. The focus of the Corporation is somewhat different from that of a purely commercial institution, although the distinction may sometimes be a subtle one. The AIDC also makes direct contributions to specific industry programs-for example, the very important malaria joint venture involving the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, the recent heavy engineering package and the consequences of the restructuring of the textile, clothing and footwear industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point of correction is that the AIDC has not sent a submission to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, seeking to be privatised, as was suggested earlier. The Corporation has sought additional capital from the Government and has made a number of suggestions if budgetary circumstances preclude such a capital contribution. One such suggestion involved seeking capital from the private sector in the form of a perpetual debt. However, no detailed proposal has been put to the Government. Of course, the point of seeking additional capital is to assist the Corporation in contributing to the Government's industry policy. Such capital would particularly assist the Corporation in financing the high risk, delayed earnings equity investment essential to industry restructuring and high technology industry. I endorse the remarks particularly of the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) and the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) when they referred to lost opportunities and the traditional conservatism of the banking system. I think we are going in the right direction now. I thank honourable members for their contribution and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise the issue of the Federal Government's lack of involvement in Expo 88 and the dishonest way it is going about letting a contract for the Australian pavilion at Expo 88 to an American company. This has serious implications for Australia. Other countries are set either to diminish their involvement or to pull out if the Federal Government is not seen to be serious about supporting its own Expo. There are three elements of this fiasco. The first element is the audio-visual contract for the Australian pavilion. The Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism (Mr John Brown) is all set to let this contract to an American company. Four Australian companies were asked to put forward proposals for the audio-visual set-up in our pavilion. They were each given 30 minutes to make a presentation which cost them anything up to $15,000. One has to ask whether the Minister had made up his mind before these proposals were called, or whether the committee had made up its mind to give them such cursory attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is some evidence to suggest that some members of the committee which made the decision not to proceed with the Australian companies had at least been talking to this particular American company before the Australian companies made their presentations. There are also serious rumours to the effect that the system of tendering has been short-circuited. I, for one, intend to ask the Auditor-General to look at the system within the Department of Sport, Recreation and Tourism to make sure that all the proper procedures were followed. It is common knowledge that within the Department there has been great resistance to what the Minister has been trying to do, to the extent that some officers of his Department have refused to go along with his wishes. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that tonight, tomorrow or on Thursday, when there is to be a launch of this exposition in front of Parliament House, the Minister will say that there are no Australian companies capable of fulfilling this contract. That in itself will be dishonest because there are Australian companies which are quite capable of fulfilling this audio-visual contract. In addition, no Australian company has been asked to tender for the contract. Australian companies have been asked to put forward some proposals but they have not been asked to tender for the contract which is in the process of being let to an American company. So it is rubbish for the Minister or anyone else to say that Australian companies have been given a go and have been found wanting. They have not been given the chance to tender for the contract. </PARA>
<PARA> I say tonight that there is some way to go in this matter before it is finalised. If the Government thinks it is going to get away with putting an American audio-visual company's display into the Australian pavilion in the Australian Expo, which is the centrepiece of our bicentennial year, it is very much mistaken. I see the Minister for Science (Mr Barry Jones) looking interested. He should be interested because it is his Government that is proposing to bypass Australian companies in a project which should be all Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another element to this fiasco. The Australian pavilion is some four months behind schedule and there is no sign yet that it is going to get off the ground. The effect on other countries which have said that they are going to come to Expo is very severe indeed, as I will show honourable members. The report of the Commissioner-General of the Bureau of International Expositions, Mr Galopin, which is floating around this country says:</PARA>
<PARA> The presence of the Federal Government hardly makes itself felt. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner-General of the BIE goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The lack of commitment is equally noticeable on other fronts. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes through a list of other fronts. The Federal Government's role in Expo 88, the centrepiece of our bicentennial year, has been abysmal. I remind the Federal Government that this is a Federal, an Australian, exposition and not a Queensland exposition, if that is the reason that the Government is stepping back. The Minister's response to all this, which has been floating around the media for the last week or so, has been to disappear entirely. I understand that for some three days he was completely out of contact and no one knew where he was. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a launch in front of Parliament House on Thursday to try to give the Expo a bit of a lift. No doubt the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will be saying what a great job the Federal Government is doing in relation to Expo 88. Let me say that it is an abysmal job and throughout this country the lack of commitment of the Federal Government to our own Expo is becoming quite apparent. If the Government decides to tough it out and give the audio-visual contract to an American company there will be an almighty row. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to pay a tribute to those associated with the Hellfire Pass project located in the Kwai Noi Valley in Thailand. I draw the attention of the House to this very important project which is to commemorate the thousands of Australians who served on the construction of the Burma death railway and the thousands upon thousands of humans who lost their lives during the course of this project. On the Anzac Day weekend in April this year there will be a special commemoration and series of functions which, amongst other things, will include an address by Sir Edward `Weary' Dunlop on location and the unveiling of a plaque in memory of 16,000 prisoners of war who lost their lives on the construction of the Burma death railway. I might add that some 90,000 enforced labourers from Asia also lost their lives in this horrific and tragic chapter of World War II.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last week, in company with the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks), I visited the area, assisted by the Australian Embassy. Our escort on this occasion was Mr Ken Bradley, the Vice-President of the Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce and the project convenor. The project is well along the path to completion in time for Anzac Day. It involves the construction of an easy walking path for visitors and veterans to make their way from the nearest highway down to what is known as Konyu Cutting, which was built by the bare hands of many Australian soldiers in World War II under the enforcement of the Japanese occupying forces. To bring about around the clock construction and speed up the progress of the Burma death railway, fires were lit on either side of the rock cuttings under construction. I understand that that is the aspect which led to the terminology `Hellfire Pass', which is an area located some three hours driving north-west of Bangkok. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to pay a tribute to all those associated with this project, which I think will be a very appropriate commemoration of a very important chapter in Australian war history and in our heritage, and which is regarded equally importantly by the Thai Government, the people of Thailand and the many others who found themselves involved with this horrific railway line which, in some 12 months, was rushed through the mountain range between Thailand and Burma in many areas where human beings had not been before. In drawing the attention of the House to this matter I recognise that we live in volatile and difficult times. I suppose everything is relative. No one could give a better, more accurate or more moving description of all that took place in Kanchanaburi and in the Hellfire Pass than two members of this Parliament, the Minister for Local Government and Administrative Services (Mr Uren) and Senator Sir John Carrick, who served as prisoners of war and who were forced to work on this project, particularly in Konyu Cutting, which is a feature of the Hellfire Pass project. Both are very supportive of the project and I hope that the Australian Government will send both up there officially on the Anzac Day weekend to participate with Sir Edward Dunlop, the Australian Ambassador, and Thai Government officials at the dedication. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to veterans and ex-prisoners of war, association members and others around Australia to take an interest in this project and, if at all possible, to travel to the area, difficult though it is for them to relive some very harsh memories from the past. I assure them at the same time that some war graves which were damaged late last year in a tragic accident at Kanchanaburi war cemetery have now been repaired and that the Kanchanaburi war cemetery is once again in excellent condition. The Thai authorities were very apologetic for that damage, which saw the earth removed from the top of some 108 Australian war graves. It should never have happened and, indeed, the position of supervisor for the Kanchanaburi war cemetery, where the special Anzac Day observance associated with this very important Hellfire Pass project will take place, is being readvertised at this moment. I commend to the House the whole project, all involved with it and in particular the Convenor of the Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce, Mr Ken Bradley. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Hawke socialist Government came to power on election night 1983 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) pledged that he would be a Prime Minister for all Australians. On election night 1983 he said on national television that he would be fair as between the States and as between Australians living in the individual States. He sent a special message to Tasmania on that night. As he put it, he noted the way in which Tasmanian voters had voted. I remind the House that the Tasmanian voters had, in some cases with increased majorities, returned the five sitting members of the Liberal Party of Australia for the electorates of Denison, Franklin, Wilmot, as it then was, Bass and Braddon. The Prime Minister assured Tasmanians that they would be treated fairly and that our State would not in any way suffer or be disadvantaged because the voters had had the good sense to re-elect for the fourth term-in one case a fifth consecutive term-Liberal members to the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sadly, within a few short months, Tasmanians to their horror saw the action of the Hawke socialist government in trampling on our State rights and moving to prevent the construction of the Gordon below Franklin dam. We suffered the indignity of having part of our State of Tasmania, to quote the former Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, hot-dogged by Royal Australian Air Force spy planes. We had the ignominious situation that part of the defence forces of this country were used to spy on a State of the Commonwealth. But worse was to come. Utilising what I regard still as spurious powers, the Hawke socialist Government, claiming that it was acting in accordance with the external affairs power, proceeded to take action which effectively negatived the will of the people of Tasmania as expressed in the State election of 1982, as expressed in a referendum and as expressed in several other polls, including local government elections. The upshot was that Tasmania was trampled on by a centralist government, Canberra dominated, determined to impose its will on the people of Australia's smallest but most beautiful State. </PARA>
<PARA> We still smart at what was done to us with respect to the Gordon below Franklin. It is now history how the High Court of Australia, by the narrowest possible margin, upheld the constitutionality of the Hawke socialist Government's actions. We would have thought that the Prime Minister and his Government would have learnt a lesson. Following the 1984 Federal election in which again I and my colleagues the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) were re-elected and two new members, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), were elected, we thought that the Prime Minister would realise that Tasmania would not tolerate again the intervention of Canberra, the trampling and the treading down of a small population but very proud State. Sadly, over the last few weeks we have seen the tentacles of Canberra stretching in the direction of Tasmania. Unfortunately, some of the things that have been said about current logging operations in Tasmania are so untrue that they are almost beyond comprehension. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a place in Tasmania called Jackeys Marsh. The Prime Minister should definitely be nominated for miracle worker of the year because he has talked about Jackeys Marsh as unique and untouched virgin rainforest. The plain fact is that Jackeys Marsh has been logged for over three generations and nearly 100 years. The extraordinary thing, if the Prime Minister would like to check, is that where trees have been cut down others have been planted two to one-two planted for every one cut down-and new trees have grown. Now we see the Federal Government threatening to intervene in the operations in Jackeys Marsh-not the Lemonthyme-once again trampling on Tasmania's State rights. The people of Tasmania have had a gutful of the Hawke socialist Government. We have been robbed by Canberra of over $200.25m in the last two years and now once again Canberra is trying to put over 6,000 Tasmanians out of work and on the dole, because that is the impact the Hawke socialist Government will have on our forest industries if it succeeds in closing us down. We will fight and we will win. It will never treat us like this again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it is a blatant distortion of the truth. My apologies, Madam Speaker. The Commonwealth's proportion of the Budget for the Expo in Brisbane is quite generous; it is $18m. I notice that Llew Edwards, a former distinguished leader of the honourable member's own party in Queensland, has been at pains over many months to defend the Commonwealth Government against unbridled, stupid, mischievous attacks by the senile Premier in Queensland who constantly runs the line that the Commonwealth Government has denied any support for Expo. This Government, to use the words of Dr Edwards, has been magnificent in its support for his Brisbane Exposition and South Bank Redevelopment Authority Committee, in doing all it can to attract overseas countries here and in providing financial and spiritual support for Llew Edwards in his attempt to run the World Expo in Brisbane in 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take great exception to the line that the honourable member runs that the Commonwealth is not doing its share. He is the same stupid person who comes in here complaining about government expenditure, saying that we should have smaller government, smaller expenditure, and who then runs around supporting some stupid line that the Queensland Press runs saying that more money is needed. Llew Edwards is saying that they need $30m from the Queensland Government to support Expo. I deny that the Commonwealth Government has been in any way delinquent in its support for the Brisbane Exposition. </PARA>
<PARA> A line has been run in the Press. It was not in the written Press but certainly on the Schildberger show in Melbourne and on the ridiculously inaccurate 7.30 Report on Australian Broadcasting Corporation television. The other night its opening line was that this time nearly all of the $15m being spent on the Expo is being spent through American contractors, that an American company is building the pavilion and that an American animation expert is being asked to compile a theme about the Aboriginal dream time for $8m. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, that is a total fabrication. The person who was the research officer for the 7.30 Report-Basher, Dasher, Dancer or Vixen, or whatever her name is-ought to go back to school. The facts are that the Australian budget for Expo is $18m. The Australian pavilion will be built by an Australian company, designed by an Australian architect under the supervision of the Australian Department of Housing and Construction. The audio-visual contract for use in that pavilion has been let to an Australian company, AAV. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to pursue this matter a little because I am not sure whether the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism (Mr John Brown) is genuine in what he is saying. In case the Minister does not understand, the proposals that the four or five companies were asked to put forward were general proposals as to what they could do, but those companies have never been given the chance to tender for the contract which the Government has let, or is about to let, to a company called Raffi, one of the principals of which is a man called Mr Rodgers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not disputing the $18m and the other things that the Minister mentioned. The Minister knows as well as I do that there is considerable concern in other countries about the Federal Government's support for Expo 88. If he is not sure, I will read from the report of the Commissioner-General of the Bureau of International Expositions who says that `the presence of the Federal Government hardly makes itself felt'. That is what the Commissioner-General says. He goes on to say that Canberra's lack of commitment is equally noticeable on other fronts. He goes on to say that funds for the Federal Australian pavilion have been juiced. This is the report of the Commissioner-General on the Federal Government's involvement in Expo 88. Of course, the States, except for Tasmania, taking a lead from the Federal Government, have all been reluctant to come forward. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get back to this audio-visual contract which is really the centrepiece of what I am saying. The Government is all set, despite what the Minister says, to give one company-AAV I think it is called-a $2m contract. It is about to let a $7m contract to a company called Raffi, a principal of which is Mr Bob Rogers. If that contract is not let and if it goes to an Australian company we will all be very pleased. I ask the Minister to look at the laughing stock he will make of this country if he puts an American company into the Australian Expo, the centrepiece of our bicentennial year, and bypasses Australian companies which are well and truly able to do the job. That is the guts of it. I ask the Minister in all sincerity, for the sake of Expo 88 to get behind it in a more meaningful way, to get the pavilion under way and to ensure that the audio-visual contract is let to an Australian company. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report to which the honourable member for McPherson (Mr White) refers is a report which he has obtained by dubious means. It is not a report of the Commissioner-General of Expo; it is a member of the Commissioner-General of the International Committee. Llew Edwards, the former leader of his own Party in Queensland, has been at pains to deny the substance of that report. It has been quite pooh-poohed by Llew Edwards and I think it would be fair to say that Commissioner Patrick Reid who is a Commissioner at Expo in Vancouver told me that the Australian Government's contribution to Expo in Brisbane has been quite magnificent. The Brisbane Exposition is in front of any comparable exposition, in terms of the international countries that have signed up at this stage, for the last 20 years. For the honourable member to stand there and mouth those sorts of palpable distortions does him no good at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the $7m contract that the honourable member speaks about is concerned, he is wrong again. The contract is something of the order of $5m. I do have a recommendation from my Committee, a committee of estimable, talented and first class Australian businessmen and women, headed by Geraldine Paton, the publisher of the Australian, which has given me the unanimous decision that we should sign a contract with Bob Rogers.

He staged a theatrical concept at Vancouver which by any estimate was magnificent and was considered the best exhibit on the ground. He also had the second and third best exhibit. If it is any information to the honourable member as a Queenslander, the Queensland Government is presently negotiating with an American film producer to produce the exhibit in its pavilion. I cannot find insult in an American being the best in the world. We want Expo in Brisbane to be the best in the world. We want the Australian pavilion to be the best on the place so that every Australian who goes there can come away with a feeling of pride. The $5m contract, which we may or may not let to Bob Rogers, would include a substantial Australian proportion in its spending. Approximately $3m of the $5m would be spent in Australia. The actors would be Australian, there would be Australian Aborigines and the staff employed would be Australian. The only thing imported would be this magnificent technique that Rogers has developed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the honourable member has been listening to a man called Browning who has been parading around the country as someone whom this Government has let down and mistreated. I would not take too much notice of Browning. Browning claims to be a sub-contractor to AAV-Australia Pty Ltd. If that is the case, why did AAV not produce him when that company had an hour with the committee to put forward its submission? It had an hour to put forward its submission on the audio-visual project and the theatre, yet it did not produce Browning. The company has disowned him. Nobody wants to know him, yet he has been the bloke on television with his little black box. Does the honourable member know what is in his little black box-his great Australian technique, where one can press the button and look in it? It is Garfield the cat and another cat, presumably Mrs Garfield, with a disappearing wedding ring. Is that what the honourable member wants us to show as an Australian exhibit in Brisbane? The Australian exhibit in Brisbane, the dreamtime, whether it be done by Rogers or whoever, will be a magnificent exposition of the marvellous legends of the Australian Aborigine. The Rogers thing in Vancouver was the legends of the Red Indians of Canada and it was voted by everyone who saw it as a stunning theatrical, if not spiritual, experience. </PARA>
<PARA> All I want this Parliament to understand is that this Government is quite sincere about producing in Brisbane an exposition of which all Australians can be proud, particularly in the Australian pavilion. I can assure everybody here that if there were any possibility of finding an Australian company which could come anywhere within cooee of the concept that has been given-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed laundering money. This is a straight out rort of the tax system and an abuse of the status of the ACF as a recognised charity under the Income Tax Assessment Act. Contributions to the Foundation have long been tax deductible to encourage Australians to support its task of environmental protection. That policy existed under the Fraser Government as well as the present Government. However, it is quite outrageous that this recognised charitable status should be abused in the way the present management of the Australian Conservation Foundation is abusing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Groups which are benefiting from this rort include the Campaign Against Nuclear Energy, which was one of the main groups responsible for the highly unpopular and at times violent Roxby Downs pickets which cost the taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars in overtime for the police. The Movement Against Uranium Mining, Friends of the Earth, the Peace Publications Co-operative and the major political group, People for Nuclear Disarmament, are other beneficiaries of this rort. Direct contributions to these groups are not tax deductible, yet the ACF is getting around this through the operation of its so-called preference grants scheme. Under this scheme, the ACF tells donors to express a preference that their donations be used towards a grant for another organisation. It then tells donors to make cheques payable to the ACF and to send those cheques to the Foundation. In turn, the ACF makes grants to the so-called approved organisations-they are approved, of course, by the management of the ACF-and those grants are made from the general funds of the ACF. So blatant is this rort that the ACF has specific pro forma circulars it sends out, which state:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an absolutely disgraceful example of, as the honourable member for Denison says, tax cheating. Taxpayers would be disgusted to learn that they are, in effect, subsidising the activities of groups which are opposed to the Western alliance and which are trying to halt the development of Australia's uranium resources at a time when Australia's balance of payments deficit is sending us broke. This blatant abuse of the spirit of the Income Tax Assessment Act must cease forthwith and the ACF should immediately publish details of those groups which have benefited from this rort. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) should also set up a full investigation with a view to stripping the ACF of its tax deductible status, particularly bearing in mind that the ACF is a very significant beneficiary of government grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This story, which I have now revealed for the first time to this House, is really one of the truly great scandals which the taxpayers will soon hear about. It is an example of the hard working, investigative Waste Watch Committee digging up and getting to the bottom of the sorts of things that this Government is allowing to pass by. More than that, the ACF is an organisation which this Government is very generously subsidising with taxpayers' money. The Government says that it supports the United States of America alliance and the Western alliance, yet it is allowing taxpayers' money to be spent with the view to undermining that alliance. The Government says that it will allow the Roxby Downs uranium mine to go ahead in my State of South Australia, yet it is using taxpayers' money to undermine the existence of that very beneficial project to my State. This is a blatant abuse of taxpayers' money. Taxpayers need to know about how this is happening, particularly now when they are crying out for tax relief. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have never heard such a load of garbage in all my life as we have just heard from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). The Australian Conservation Foundation does a great job in preserving for future generations the benefits Australia has to offer. What he has just said is completely wrong. I am quite certain that when the ACF replies to this scurrilous allegation that has been uttered out of his mouth, he will find that he was wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have come here this evening to talk about trees, in particular about holes in trees. Honourable members might think that this is a very strange sort of subject; however, it is very important. Our forests, which the honourable member for Mayo wants to chop down and turn into woodchips to export, are for all Australians. That includes not just humans but also our native fauna. Trees are vitally important for nature conservation, their natural beauty, their recreational aspects for man and, where necessary, their value as providers of timber for homes, furniture, paper and so forth. But there is another very important use of trees of which very few people are aware; that is, as a home for a large variety of Australian animals. The hollows in trees provide nesting and breeding sites for many different animals and therefore constitute an important aspect of woodland and forest ecology. </PARA>
<PARA> Very little is known about the cause, incidence or distribution of cavities in trees anywhere in Australia, largely because damaged trunks are of little commercial use and are therefore ignored, but as the native vegetation is cleared from land for primary production the total number of hollows available to animals for nesting purposes decreases very rapidly. For that reason, I believe that it is extremely important for all of us to try to understand the factors involved in the clearing of land and the effect that it has on our precious wildlife. The widespread clearing of forests has led to massive deterioration of our environment. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia, the arrival of Europeans heralded a period of rapid changes in the landscape. The area which was most affected was the agricultural region of the State, which lies between the mouth of the Murchison River in the north and Esperance in the east. Nine different cockatoos occur in this region, eight of them being present before 1827, while one, the sulphur-crested cockatoo, was introduced some time after 1930. All of these species have been influenced by the environmental changes that have followed European settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> The cockatoos which occur in that area are obligate hole nesters and trees are the only source of such holes in the region. In other parts of Australia, some species do nest in holes in cliffs, but there are few such sites in the south-west of Western Australia. Some cockatoo species feed predominantly on native vegetation, but throughout the wheat belt there is little or no native vegetation under or around the remaining trees. Western Australia is one of the few places in the Western world to undergo large scale land development in recent years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member does not know, let me tell him that it is in Victoria. It is a very beautiful electorate. However, it has been cleared of trees and we do not have many cockatoos there. One of the problems in Tasmania is the reafforestation of areas where all the old trees are being pulled down. They are being replaced with those nice, you beaut, plantations. The only problem is that there are no nesting holes for birds, and so on. What is to happen to the bird population in Tasmania in a few years time? The birds will be gone forever because there will be no holes there. As I have walked through Telopea Park in Canberra on my way to Parliament House in the mornings I have seen a couple of cockatoos scratching a hole in one of the trees. It has taken them weeks to make any impression on the tree. Where will such birds nest if all the suitable trees are knocked down and turned into woodchip? The Opposition is all about destroying our native flora and fauna at a great rate. At present--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to respond to some of the comments which have just been made about the environment and Tasmania. The honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) said that the nesting places of various animals are being lost. That assumes that virtually every mature tree in Tasmania is being cut down. He has been to that State and he obviously knows that that is not the case. It is very interesting that only a week ago there was a meeting in my electorate of about 5,000 people who are involved in the timber industry. The meeting was addressed by people from the Australian Council of Trade Unions. They were united when they said that Tasmania was managing its timber resources very well. There is no doubt that in Tasmania the companies involved in woodchipping and milling are setting about a process of ensuring that we have an ongoing and viable timber industry in that State. Tasmania is dependent on wood as a resource. It enables people to have jobs and families to have good living standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People such as the honourable member for Dunkley try to say to those in Tasmania that jobs do not matter, that they can go, and that it is better to look after holes for animals. That is not the case. There is no doubt that there are hundreds of thousands of mature trees in Tasmania which will provide ample places for animals to reproduce. It is about time that people on the mainland got the idea that in such areas there is never a single forest growing up without a variety of trees, even when they were fired hundreds of years ago. When they were fired hundreds of years ago, they grew up again very much like the plantations do today. That is how it occurs, even with stands of trees. There are a few old trees left around. There is no area in Tasmania in which there are not suitable places for the fauna and flora to develop naturally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian Forestry Commission has set about a program which is very sensitive to the environment-the streams, the plants, and the animals that need nesting places. No State in Australia is more sensitive to the needs of both the people and the fauna. Tasmania has looked after its natural environment very well. In fact, its area of national parks is three times that of Victoria. Why does not the honourable member for Dunkley clean up his own back yard first? Why does he not get 13 per cent of Victoria into national parks before telling the Tasmanians how to run their forest industries? Why does he not do something about it now? We have maintained our environment. That is why honourable members opposite want to stick their noses into our back yard. We have looked after our environment. Why do not honourable members opposite sort out their own States before telling us what to do?</PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania is in good hands. We are looking after it sensitively. The big companies that are involved there and which are providing many jobs for Tasmanians are spending millions of dollars on reafforestation with eucalypt forest. They are spending millions of dollars on setting up research nurseries so that the right types of trees can be grown and so there can be a sensitive reafforestation program in Tasmania. Because we are doing it right, there is no doubt that the forest industries in Tasmania will be viable 100 and 200 years down the way. </PARA>

<PARA>The information sought is not readily available in the form asked for by the honourable member. During 1984-85 114 Telecom staff travelled overseas on official visits and it would require the application of considerable resources in terms of time and cost at the expense of higher priority duties in order to collate the information in such a way as to answer each part of this question. However, the following details are provided:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The purpose of the visits was primarily to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) attend international conferences including participation in Study Group meetings of the ITU;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) investigate overseas technical developments, and management and marketing techniques;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) progress contractual commitments with equipment manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The classification of officers involved ranged from Engineer Class 3 or equivalent, to senior management staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The average duration of each visit was 4 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Countries visited included the United Kingdom, USA, Canada, Japan, Sweden, West Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore and China.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) On average, the cost of each visit was $10,000 of which approximately half was for air fares.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</PARA>
<PARA>To provide the information asked for, the ABC would need to employ someone specifically to obtain the details from numerous files held on overseas visits. The Corporation could not justify the resource costs involved.</PARA>
<PARA>The Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia)</PARA>
<PARA>OTC operates in an international environment with a consequent need for extensive travel by officers of the Commission to attend meetings dealing with operational and commercial matters, facilities provisioning and co-ordination. To provide the information sought would be a task of some magnitude involving significant resource costs which could not be justified.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Yes; however, many factors influence the decision to migrate interstate. A survey of the reasons behind interstate movements in population undertaken by the Statistician (`Internal Migration, Australia, Twelve Months ended 30 June 1985') shows that in 1984-85 employment was by far the most significant factor (accounting for 52 per cent of all interstate moves), followed by housing factors (6 per cent), change in marital status (5 per cent) and retirement (2 per cent).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The following answer to the honourable member's question is based upon information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Although the A.B.C. records the names of all interviewees who appear on A.M. and P.M., it would be an unreasonable strain on limited A.B.C. resources to go back through the Corporation's records to provide the A.B.C. information sought.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The same considerations apply as in (1). However, it would be expected that members of the Government are interviewed or reported more frequently than are members of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Again the same considerations as in (1) apply. Because the A.B.C. destroys tapes of interviews 6 weeks after the date of broadcast, in accordance with 117a (2) of the Broadcasting Act 1942, they are not in a position to make judgments necessary to answer the question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Minister has seen a report released by Professor Goldring on 8 August 1986. The full title of the report is ``An Updated Social Profile of Students Entering Law Courses''. In the process of preparing the report, Professor Goldring surveyed students commencing degree courses in law at six universities (Sydney, New South Wales, Macquarie, Australian National University, Melbourne and Monash) and one CAE (the New South Wales Institute of Technology).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In view of the survey's limited coverage of students, it is not possible to draw conclusions from it about the socio-economic status of university students in general. In relation to law students, however, the report does indicate a disproportionate number of students at the surveyed institutions had previously attended private schools and that ``an overwhelming proportion'' have parents with a relatively high socio-economic status.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The report shows that 47% of students commencing law courses in 1986 at Monash and 40% and 42% of such students at Sydney and Melbourne respectively had attended non-Catholic independent schools. The remaining students were drawn from government and Catholic systemic schools. These percentages, however, relate to those students responding to the survey not to all students.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) (a) The Department of Territories has advised that ``The estimated cost of acquisition of the site on withdrawal of the leases are of the order of $12,000 to $15,000. This amount covers fencing, timber treatment, pasture improvements and other compensable items.''</PARA>
<PARA> (b) construction of the College and supporting facilities is $10.8m at June 1986 prices and</PARA>

<PARA> (2) When operational, the College will cater, at full capacity for up to 270 personnel.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The College is planned to be fully operational in late 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The proposed site is located on part of lots 20, 21 and 22, section 2 at Pialligo, A.C.T.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Department of Territories has advised that ``No offers have been made to lease holders regarding compensation''.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Department of Territories has advised that ``The affected lessees were notified of the intentions for the area in July 1985. They have, through their lawyers, objected to the proposals.''</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The Department of Housing and Construction has advised that</PARA>
<PARA> ``In the regional context, the site is located above the `probable maximum flood' line for the Molonglo River. This represents the highest zone mapped in areal flooding projections and water inundations above this line would only occur given a 1 in 5000 year flood event.</PARA>
<PARA> In the local Pialligo area context, the site water conditions do not pose any serious construction problems or demand building solutions that involve costs above normal allowances to ensure a building free from inundation.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) and (9) No. The Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment has advised that the site identified by the NCDC in Pialligo is appropriate for use as an Aviation College and, as no apparent physical, biological or visual impact will result from the construction, an Environmental Impact Study is not required. The Department of Housing and Construction has advised that drainage works for the proposed site will involve only the re-routing and enclosure of an existing open storm water drain for the extent of the site.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) No. On advice from the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment, my Department did not consider it appropriate that a study be initiated.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) A number of alternative proposals for the College site were received by my Department</PARA>
<PARA> The proposals were as follows</PARA>
<PARA> 1979/83 Consultation between my Department and the A.C.T. Schools Authority regarding the possibility of utilising surplus school accommodation for the Central Training College in Canberra and suburbs</PARA>

<PARA> (12) No. My Department did consider siting the College at alternative locations, but the site at Pialligo was selected for operational and cost effectiveness reasons.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) and (14) My Department wrote to members of the Aviation Industry Advisory Council (AVIAC) on 2 &amp; 3 May 1986 outlining details of the proposals and indicating the intention to seek funds in the recent Budget for the work.

This offer was repeated on 17 September when Committee members were advised of the intention to hold discussions between my Department and interested members of the Industry.

<PARA> full time training staff: 35</PARA>
<PARA> part time training staff: 5</PARA>
<PARA> full time support staff: 18</PARA>
<PARA> part time support staff: 3</PARA>
<PARA> Salary costs associated with those staff are estimated at $1.54M annually.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) Facilities currently being used by Air Traffic control and Flight Service training schools in Henty House Melbourne are neither functionally nor structurally suitable for upgrading to accommodate new generation Air Traffic Control and Flight Service simulators which are due for delivery in September 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> Facilities for the other training functions included in the proposal, whilst interim in nature and not purpose designed, could continue to be used for training purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> (19) Little advantage would be gained in establishing the College closer to one of the major airports in Australia as there are few operational facilities peculiar to major centres which cannot be found at Canberra Airport. However most operational facilities will be fully simulated by the new training simulator equipment to be installed in the Central Training College. In addition, 50 per cent of all Air Traffic Control and Flight Service operational training is carried out in the field, permitting sufficient opportunity for additional familiarisation with the airspace of the Region to which trainees will be ultimately posted. Locating the College in Canberra will also allow Central Office staff to fully utilise the new simulator equipment to develop new operational procedures and doctrine.</PARA>
<PARA> (20) No. Permanent staff will cover foreseeable training commitments apart from occasional specialist courses where an instructor may be required from a Regional centre for short periods only.</PARA>
<PARA> (21) Teaching staff currently attached to the Central Training College in Melbourne will either be relocated to Canberra with the new College or transferred to postings in the field. Any shortfall in teaching staff as a result of relocation will be overcome by transferring experienced field staff to Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> (22) No. Ab-initio trainee ``hands on'' training is conducted on the simulator at the Central Training College as it is inappropriate that this training be carried out in an operational environment. Additional ``on the job'' training is then carried out at the station of final posting. This does not represent any change from existing procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> (23) No. There is no significant additional benefit to be gained from carrying out ab-initio training at a Central Training College adjacent to a larger airport.</PARA>
<PARA> (24) No. My Department has advised that the need for the new College has been clearly defined. In addition, annual expenditure for the proposal has been reduced to a minimum commensurate with the completion of the new simulator building in time for the anticipated delivery of equipment in September 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (25) The Training College will provide training for Air Traffic Control, flight Service, Administrative and Automatic Data Processing Staff, which are wholly or partly attributable functions for cost recovery purposes. The College will also provide training for Search and Rescue and Airworthiness staff which are not attributable functions. Training for these functions is a necessary part of the Department's activities and the provision of a new training college is the most economic way to carry out that activity. Of the estimated $10.8M expenditure approximately $8.4M will be attributable for cost recovery purposes. This will be offset by reductions in expenditure on the existing training facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> (26) Previous consultation with Industry has provided the opportunity to discuss the appropriateness of expenditure for the proposal. As the new College will be specifically for the training of Departmental staff in operational functions, aspects of the proposal such as location and function are not for consideration by the Industry.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) $3.6 million.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The extent to which the tax may be reflected in higher fares is difficult to establish, as Qantas' fare structure reflects the whole range of the costs faced by the Company, the net effect of which determines the level of the Company's fares. However compared with Qantas' total expenditure of $1,967.5 million in 1985/86, the additional cost of the fringe benefits tax to Qantas is not considered to be significant.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr Howe</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I have seen the article. It refers to fraud perpetrated upon the insurance industry and an estimate that 30% of third party claims in Victoria could involve fraud. It also alleges that in one case an individual involved was also charged with social security fraud.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) Combating fraud in the insurance industry is a matter for those concerned. As far as communication between the Department of Social Security and insurance companies is concerned, such companies were recently invited to provide to the department details of persons in receipt of compensation. According to a report in the ``Daily Mirror'' of 21 October, the Director of the Insurance Council of Australia regarded the request as ``bullying'' and stated that he was unaware of any firm co-operating. The honourable member for Richmond's position on the initiative was revealing-he is quoted as saying that the department was ``going through the back-door to compensate for slack administration''.</PARA>
<PARA> In any case in which sickness benefit is payable to a person in receipt of compensation, the amount of sickness benefit otherwise payable is reduced by the amount of compensation received. This information is sought from the insurance company. Again, as a matter of course, where a claim for compensation has been lodged but no amount has been received, the insurance company is notified so that in the event of a lump sum settlement, a recoverable amount of sickness benefit must be remitted to the department before the balance is released to the person awarded the compensation. Similar provisions are to apply to invalid pension, unemployment and special benefit, sheltered employment allowance and rehabilitation allowance as from 1 May 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) These procedures are generally effective.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) See answer to (2), (3) and (4) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The department's statistical system does not allow the separate identification of an overpayment arising from motor vehicle accident or workers' compensation fraud.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The department's overpayment statistics are not segregated into Social Security Act and Crimes Act categories except for the purpose of prosecution details.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Australian oranges and other fresh citrus fruit are prohibited entry into the USA due to the presence in Australia of a number of pests and diseases which do not occur in the USA and which the US Department of Agriculture consider would pose a potentially serious threat to US horticultural industries. The major concern is with fruit flies, citrus black spot, Australian scab and septoria.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Government has made representations regarding the entry of fresh citrus fruit into the USA for more than 20 years. There are now regular technical discussions on quarantine issues including those affecting citrus, between senior officials of the Department of Primary Industry and USDA. The most recent round of these discussions which took place in the USA, 12-14 November 1986 established that there is no prospect of early resolution of difficulties which prevent the entry of Australian citrus fruit. Major concerns of the USA are with Australian internal quarantine measures to prevent the entry of fruit flies and diseases of concern into the areas from which fruit is likely to be exported. These export areas must also be continuously monitored to ensure that they remain free from the pests and diseases. Internal quarantine and other regulating controls are State responsibilities in Australia. The United States, like Australia, imposes strict quarantine provisions to guard against the entry of pests or diseases which could have disastrous consequences for its agricultural industries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The number of applications received in 1985-86 for the main workload activities were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Citizenship...</PARA>
<PARA>1 776</PARA>
<PARA> Change of Resident Status...</PARA>
<PARA>293</PARA>
<PARA> Re-entry Visas...</PARA>
<PARA>1 735</PARA>
<PARA> Temporary Entry Permit extensions...</PARA>
<PARA>660</PARA>
<PARA> Reliable statistics on counter enquiries are not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) At the time of the 1986-87 Budget, the staffing level of the Office was six; one Clerical Administrative Class 6, three Clerical Administrative Class 4s, one Clerical Assistant Grade 3 and one Typist Grade 2. The average staffing level (ASL) at that time was around 8.1.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The range of services previously provided was as follows: migration (including family and occupational migration, and refugees), change of status to resident, temporary entry (including visitors and temporary residents), and citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Newcastle Office services the Hunter and Richmond mid North-Coast and Northern statistical division.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The initial decision to close the Office was made in response to portfolio savings targets developed in the 1986-87 Budget process. Further investigation revealed other savings options which allow the Office to remain open with reduced staff and functions.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The cost to maintain fully the operation of the Office during 1986-87 (at current prices) would have been $374,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Because of the confidentiality inherent in the Budget process, it was not possible to undertake consultation before the initial announcement. Full consultation is taking place currently with those affected.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The Office will continue to carry out its current major functions of handling applications for issuing re-entry visas and providing information. Some workload such as grant of resident status will be transferred to the Parramatta Area Office.</PARA>
<PARA> Citizenship interviews will be conducted by Australia Post-this arrangement already applies in cities and towns throughout Australia, including those which are remote from DIEA offices.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) No</PARA>
<PARA> (10) A reduction of ASL in a full year from 8.1 to 3.5 is planned, i.e. a saving of 4.6 ASL. This reduction is possible because the need for supervision and administrative support will be minimised. Workloads will be handled more efficiently by `streaming' work in the larger office rather than having one officer more frequently move from one function to another as happens in smaller offices.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) My Department's recruitment/promotion policies ensure that a bank of people with bi-lingual skills is established. This skills bank is enriched by normal studies assistance for officers.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Department's Access and Equity Plan places emphasis on the possession of cross-cultural communication skills by all public contact staff. Consequently selection criteria are being reviewed progressively to include reference to these skills. In the meantime a national training package specifically for cross cultural communication has been developed and implemented. In addition, where special skills for dealing with ethnic communities are required in specific positions eg. Grant-in-Aid, Social Workers, this is clearly stated in job advertisement and selection criteria.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Recruits are provided with induction/orientation programs. These differ in duration depending on their level at recruitment and/or the size of the region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) As a general rule, where the average processing time for the particular post has elapsed, and/or where there are special circumstances of an urgent compassionate nature, Immigration Offices in Australia will undertake to seek information about sponsorships being processed overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that as sponsorships are generally lodged overseas by the relative(s) being sponsored, Immigration Offices in Australia normally have no record of these sponsorships. Sponsors in these cases are therefore encouraged to seek information from the relative(s) being sponsored. Sponsors who lodge their applications in Australia (answer PQ4428 (1) refers) should of course enquire at Offices in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> See also answer to PQ4424 (4).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The urgency or priority with which these requests are currently handled is usually dictated by the circumstances. This is determined on a case by case basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) There is no general monitoring of overseas posts' responses to cables. Posts are expected to respond and normally do respond to cables within a reasonable period of time. The performance of overseas posts in responding to cables should be seen in the case by case context in which information is sought from overseas posts. The relative urgency of a request for information is indicated by the degree of priority given to the outgoing cable and the response is generally mindful of this. It should be recognised, however, that progress in processing applications in many parts of the world is comparatively slow because of local factors such as poor communications systems and difficulties in obtaining required documentation. As requests for information about a sponsorship frequently involve the need for an overseas post to contact the applicant or obtain a supporting document, these same local factors inhibit the timeliness of posts' responses.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Section 66E of the Migration Act gives persons the right to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of my decisions under section 12 to deport non-citizens who are convicted of crimes and under section 48 to direct a person not to act as a migration agent. A person is not entitled to make an application in relation to a decision under section 12 unless he or she is an Australian citizen or a permanent resident of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, various provisions of the Migration Act confer rights in relation to the exercise of powers. Those provisions are sections 6, 6a, 7, 8, 11a, 11B, 12, 14, 14a, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26, 27, 31a, 31B, 36, 36a, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43 and 54.</PARA>
<PARA> Those powers are exercisable by myself, ``officers'' and ``authorised officers''.</PARA>
<PARA> ``Officer'' is defined in the Migration Act as meaning:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) an officer of the Department;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a person who is an officer for the purposes of the Customs Act 1901;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a member of the Australian Federal Police or of the police force of a State or an internal Territory; or</PARA>
<PARA> (d) any other person who is, or who is included in a class of persons who are, authorized by the Minister to exercise that power or to discharge that duty or function.</PARA>
<PARA> ``Authorised officer'' is defined in the Migration Act as meaning a person authorised by me to exercise a power or discharge a duty or function.</PARA>
<PARA> Examples of persons, other than officers of my Department, who exercise powers under the Migration Act include the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) locally engaged staff at certain overseas posts who are authorised to issue visas under section 11a;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Officers of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service, who among other things, exercise powers in relation to custody of prohibited non-citizens under sections 36 and 36a and in relation to the arrest of prohibited non-citizens under sections 38 and 39;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Customs officers who exercise powers in relation to, amongst other things, detention of vessels for the purposes of enabling a search of the vessels under section 44.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AV4">Mr Hurford</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Statistics on the number of persons who are authorised to exercise this power are not kept.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The agencies involved are:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the Australian Customs Service;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the Australian Federal Police;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the police forces in each Australian State and internal Territory;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) the Australian Protective Service, Department of Local Government and Administrative Services;</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) the Department of Territories.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the provisions of section 38 of the Migration Act, an `officer' may, without warrant, arrest a person who he reasonably supposes to be a prohibited non-citizen. Under section 5 (1) of the Migration Act, `officer' means:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) an officer of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a person who is an officer for the purposes of the Customs Act 1901;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a member of the Australian Federal Police or of the police force of a State or an internal Territory; or</PARA>
<PARA> (d) any other person who is, or who is included in a class of persons who are, authorised by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to exercise that power or to discharge that duty or function.</PARA>
<PARA> Persons authorised in relation to part (d) are:</PARA>
<PARA> certain specified officers of the Australian Protective Service which provides the custodial staff at Immigration Detention Centres and which provides escorts for persons in immigration custody; and</PARA>
<PARA> specified officers who work in the Territory of Christmas Island;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Statistics are not kept on the number of persons employed by each of these agencies who are authorised to exercise these powers.</PARA>
<PARA> The authority to make arrests under section 38 in normal circumstances is restricted administratively to about 70 officers of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs whose duties involve enforcement activities connected with illegal immigration.</PARA>
<PARA> State Police Officers also exercise these powers occasionally, usually in locations where there is no enforcement staff of my Department. Officers of the other agencies may be called upon to exercise these powers on rare occasions. Examples of the circumstances under which this might occur include: Customers Officers observing a person known or believed to be a stowaway evading authorities by jumping ship; an Australian Protective Service officer re-arresting an illegal immigrant who has escaped from his/her custody while under escort.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) In the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the power to arrest is normally exercised only by field investigation teams which could include officers of the following classifications:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Clerical Administrative Class 7 (Senior Investigation Officer);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Clerical Administrative Class 6 (Investigation Officer);</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Clerical Administrative Officer Class 5 (Assistant Investigation Officer).</PARA>
<PARA> Officers whose primary functions is to investigate organised immigration malpractice sometimes locate illegal immigrants and, on occasions, make arrests. The classifications of these officers range from Clerical Administrative Class 5 to Clerical Administrative Class 11.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Many of the departmental officers engaged in field investigations and enforcement action against illegal immigrants have a prior background in law enforcement in other agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> Training available to officers in relation to the power of arrest include:</PARA>
<PARA> a comprehensive manual specifically written for the guidance of field investigation officers, a copy of which is provided individually to every officer engaged in enforcement functions, and is to be studied before starting on field work;</PARA>
<PARA> a comprehensive instruction on the use of search warrants, arrests and custody, copies of which are provided individually to every officer engaged in the enforcement functions, similarly to be studied before starting field work;</PARA>
<PARA> in-house training which includes a written training program produced especially for the Department and an extensive library of video film;</PARA>
<PARA> attendance at relevant sessions of Police training courses from time to time subject to timetables and the agreement of the authorities concerned;</PARA>
<PARA> training by police officers, former police officers and other external lecturers at departmental training courses;</PARA>
<PARA> on the job training given during field activity under the close supervision of the team leader.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Every officer within the Enforcement and Investigations areas of the Department who could be required to exercise the powers of arrest has undergone some if not all of the processes of training described above.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Those elements of the Defence Department responsible for procurement are required to avoid specifying proven products and systems unless essential and to use known and suitable Australian products when available. They must also acquaint themselves with those goods and services available from Australian manufacturers which may be suitable and must quote Australian standards whenever possible.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Whenever Australian produced equipment can meet the requirements, it is included in the ``short-list'' of acceptable offers, which are then considered on cost and other such factors. Defence purchases are subject to Commonwealth preference policy which automatically adds tariff duty and discounts the price of the Australian content of a local tender by 20 per cent for comparison with overseas tenders. When a suitable domestic tender falls within this price range it is Government policy to procure locally. As Minister for Defence I may, when the strategic benefit so justifies, authorise payment of a higher premium for procurement from Australian sources.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Strenuous efforts are made to communicate to Australian manufacturers Defence Force plans for procurement of high technology equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian industry is advised of selected major Defence projects via Invitation to Register Interest, Requests for Proposals and Requests for Tender.</PARA>
<PARA> Five Year plans for Defence Force procurement of capital equipment worth less than $10 million were recently issued to Australian industry and are to be published regularly.</PARA>
<PARA> Subject to experience with this exercise I envisage publishing Defence five year procurement plans for major capital procurements (that is those worth over $10 million). The major projects are, of course, generally well publicised and known to industry at an early stage of their development.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes, provided that Australian manufacturers realise and accept that Defence procurement plans are subject to adjustment in response to, for example, changed strategic or budgetary circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In considering equipment options many military customers take into account whether or not the equipment is used by the armed forces of the exporting country. To this extent operation of indigenous high technology equipment by the Australian Defence Force will facilitate acceptance of that equipment by potential overseas military customers.</PARA>
<PARA> On 14 October 1986 I announced a package of measures designed to assist Australian Industry to bid for Defence work and to develop and export military and related products.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Australian Defence Force, like other competent military forces, may insist on proven performance of high technology equipment for reasons of safety and reduced technical or financial risk. When buying high technology equipment, Defence project officers are required to acquaint themselves with Australian industry capabilities, use suitable Australian products when available and avoid specifying proven products or systems unless that is essential. Defence procurement procedures provide for Australian industry involvement in high technology projects via indigenous design and development, adaptation of overseas technology to Australian requirements, local production of overseas designs and, where overseas equipment like the F/A-18 is being bought for the Defence Force, via offsets, co-production, or Defence Designated Australian work in major overseas procurements.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) Information is provided in response in the attached table and is tabulated according to each Minister's portfolio. The table does not provide the information precisely in the form requested because, while the Department of Finance collects staffing statistics for departments and most Budget-dependent statutory authorities, there is no such central collection in the case of non-Budget dependent authorities. Thus the table only covers departments and those Budget-dependent statutory authorities subject to the Government's staff budget controls.</PARA>
<PARA> Other points to note are:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the data collected by the Department of Finance does not distinguish between permanent and temporary staff although it does identify casual and part-time staff who are included in the table converted to the equivalent full-time number</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the data which is drawn mainly from the cental PAYROLL System represents the average staffing level paid for in particular fortnightly pay periods and not the number of staff on 30 June or any other single day</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) while the data for the last pay period of 1985-86 is derived from a firm count, the figures for the equivalent period at the end of 1986-87 are the estimates shown in agencies' staffing plans for 1986-87 as agreed to by the Department of Finance.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the data is for paid operative staff (ie those at work or on leave for less than 12 weeks)</PARA>
<PARA> (v) the figures exclude the effects of staffing in the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the Population Census.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also to be noted that the Public Service Board collects statistics of the numbers of Public Service staff at 30 June each year. This data is different from Finance's collection in that</PARA>
<PARA> (i) it excludes significant numbers of employees of Budget-dependent agencies who are not Public Servants (ie are employed under legislation other than the Public Service Act)</PARA>

<PARA> Does the 10% sales tax on fruit juice products (a) constitute a tax on food and (b) decrease effective protection against imported citrus products; if so, does this conform with the Government's desire to encourage the purchase of Australian products.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="24" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WAKEFIELD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) The Government announced in the 1986-87 Budget that the sales tax exemption previously applying to a number of non-alcoholic beverages, including flavoured milk, non-alcoholic wine and cider, and fruit juice and fruit juice products containing not less than 25 per cent Australian fruit juice was to be removed and those products taxed at 10 per cent of wholesale value.</PARA>
<PARA> The measure broadened the indirect tax base and reduced the tax discrimination against carbonated soft drinks, mineral waters and similar beverages which have been subject to sales tax for a number of years (since 1982, at a rate of 20 per cent of wholesale value). Nevertheless, fruit juice and fruit juice products continue to receive comparatively favourable tax treatment by being taxed at a rate of 10 per cent. Whether fruit juice products may or may not be described as food is not considered germane since most beverages are already subject to indirect tax in one form or another.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The previous sales tax exemption for fruit juices and fruit juice products containing not less than 25 per cent Australian fruit juices was structured as an indirect form of assistance to Australian fruit growers, particularly citrus fruit growers. However, its protective impact was significantly undermined in practice through arrangements whereby fruit juice was imported for making up the volume of pure fruit juices (which therefore contained 25 per cent Australian fruit juice and 75 per cent imported fruit juice). The imported fruit juice was considered to be a `raw material' for sales tax purposes and accordingly escaped sales tax entirely. As a result, the Government believed that the sales tax arrangements were, in practice, a particularly ineffective form of protection to citrus fruit growers.</PARA>
<PARA> The citrus fruit industry remains one of the most highly assisted rural industries. In 1983-84 (the most recent year for which reliable data are available), the effective rate of assistance provided to the citrus industry was estimated at 53 per cent, compared with the agricultural-sector average of 11 per cent. Further, the Government recently commissioned the Industries Assistance Commission to report on whether temporary assistance should be extended to the citrus industry. This report has now been received and is being considered by the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 November 1986 (Hansard, page 3396) Mr Carlton asked Mr Hurford, as Acting Treasurer, a question relating to changes to taxation reporting requirements under the Australia Card Bill and the compliance costs of those changes. The question has been referred to me. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Persons who currently report information to the Tax Office will have only the additional requirement of reporting Australia Card numbers. Some persons who do not currently report to the Tax Office may well face future reporting requirements under tax legislation. That will be a matter for the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA> In deciding on any such requirement, the Government would be conscious of their impact on the private sector. Any such requirements will be introduced over a period of time sufficient to allow reporting mechanisms to be put in place.</PARA>
<PARA> The banking industry has concluded that establishment costs under the Australia Card program would be approximately $60.6m, with annual running costs of $4.6m. It is recognised by the Australian Bankers Association, however, that at the present time banks do not fully comply with current taxation requirements and to do so would involve costs of $25m, as well as a further $5m in reporting unverified accounts.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report released on 24 June, 1985 by the International Task Force on the Prevention of Terrorism, a private group of Western scientists and engineers, in which it concluded (a) nuclear power plants and research reactors are vulnerable to sabotage by infiltrators and to attacks by truck bombs, (b) all nuclear-armed nations should equip their arsenals with safety locking devices (PALS) which prevent guerillas who manage to steal nuclear bombs from arming them to explode, and (c) anti-guerilla intelligence capabilities be upgraded and there be more sharing of intelligence on nuclear terrorism, including US-Soviet co-operation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Has his attention also been drawn to press reports that the chief Soviet delegate to the Geneva Conference on disarmament, Mr V. Issraelyan, has called for (a) reliable measures to deter nuclear terrorism, and that the problem of protecting nuclear power plants against attacks should be a top priority item and (b) that such measures should be developed under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) My Department confirms that the points in these questions are correct.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government agrees that the nations which have nuclear weapons thereby also have awesome responsibilities, including the responsibility to take every conceivable precaution to prevent the nuclear weapons from being stolen or getting into irresponsible hands. There is every reason to believe that the nuclear weapon States themselves share this appreciation. There has been considerable publicity about the comprehensive measures put in place by the United States to ensure the security of its nuclear weapons. The Government has every reason to believe that other nuclear weapon States take similar precautions. The Government appreciates that many of the details of security measures of this type must properly remain secret. The Government also notes that one of the purposes for the special channels of communication which have been established between the nuclear weapon States to handle nuclear emergencies is to be ready for the contingency, however remote, that nuclear weapons might be taken out of the control of one of the States concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government sees effective international cooperation as the key to combating all forms of terrorism and has consistently encouraged this in international forums. It would naturally expect all responsible members of the international community, including of course the United States and the Soviet Union, to share a close and common interest in protecting nuclear plant and weaponry from attack or theft by terrorists. Australia's activities, notably through its Ambassador for Disarmament, have been directed at the prevention of nuclear war and at the reduction and ultimate elimination of nuclear arsenals. This is of course the only long-term, completely satisfactory solution to the problem alluded to by this question.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia also has signed and is taking steps to ratify the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. This convention obliges States Parties to take steps to ensure that nuclear material is subject to stringent measures of protection within its territory, on board a ship or aircraft under its jurisdiction, and during international transport.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I am advised that the nuclear research reactor at Lucas Heights, which falls within the responsibility of the Minister for Resources and Energy, is adequately protected against potential threats.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1. Australia has Ambassadors and High Commissioners resident in a total of 72 nations.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. See attached list, column 2.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. (a) see attached list, column 3 (b) Ambassadors and High Commissioners generally serve in their positions for three years, but may on occasions be extended beyond that period.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. (a) and (b) Column 5 of the attached table shows the most widely spoken and written languages in the countries in which Ambassadors and High Commissioners are posted. In some countries there is more than one major official language e.g. Canada. This is indicated in the table. In many nations a major European language is widely used in commerce, education, or administration, and this has been indicated in the list by including the relevant language in brackets.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The attached table shows the level of proficiency of all Ambassadors and High Commissioners. Those who are completely fluent in the main non-English language of the country, or another widely used non-English language, are indicated by two asterisks; those who are generally fluent, that is, who have a working proficiency, are indicated by one asterisk.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. It is not expected that Heads of Mission with heavy work loads should become generally fluent in a language in part time study. With many difficult languages this stage could barely be reached in 12 months of full time study. For a Head of Mission to be fluent it would in most cases have been necessary for her or him to have studied the language at an earlier stage of their career.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. One of the factors taken into account in selection of Ambassadors and High Commissioners is the requirement for a language other than English to ensure effective operation in their country of posting. There are, however, many qualities required of a Head of Mission other than the ability to speak the main non-English language of the country of appointment. Thus, language ability is not the only factor taken into account in selecting Heads of Missions to serve in a particular country.</PARA>
<PARA> While it is possible to acquire a reasonable facility in many languages within six months of full time study, in other cases much longer periods of intensive study, reaching up to three years, are required. The relative priorities of Ambassadors or High Commissioners and the pressure of staff and monetary resources seldom permit this.</PARA>
<PARA> Only by a program over many years of learning languages at junior level can it be reasonably assured that there will be a pool of officers with wide language coverage from which Ambassadors and High Commissioners can be chosen who speak the local language. Within the constraints of available resources, the Department of Foreign Affairs is following this course of action.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CV4">Mr Jacobi</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 8 May 1986:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to the Annual Review of the Australian Insurance Association (AIA) for 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is the Government wholly satisfied with Australia's policy is general insurance of allowing any risks to be placed directly outside the Australian market.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is it a fact that large overseas markets recognise the need to restrict to some degree flows of business out of their country, and so help them maintain a sound market home market base.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Is the Australian approach of no restrictions practicable, in view of the practices of the EEC, Japan and the USA insurance markets and the fact that those markets represent 84% of world insurance premium volumes, compared with the Australian market representing 2%.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Is is a fact that (a) the Australian insurance market has not developed statistics on its international insurance flows, (b) the Government does not know the full volume of these and only has estimates of whether insurance transactions result in a net debit or credit on current account and (c) overseas countries have statistics and other details on their international insurance earnings.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) If Australia does not have these statistics and other details, will he consider proposals for the collection of statistics on the outflow of insurance funds as outlined by the AIA and in my question No. 415 of 1981 parts (5) to (8).</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Is it a fact that (a) in overseas countries insurance/investment strategies complement each other by encouraging retentions and inflows of insurance moneys in a variety of ways such as tax concessions, establishment and management of overseas-based subsidiaries and international broking and (b) in Australia, in addition to comparable taxes, competitive disadvantage is suffered due to its system of statutory charges such as stamp duties and fire brigade levies, plus taxes on reinsurance.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Does the avoidance of these charges in Australia create an important incentive to place business outside the market and result in a very low level of Australian ownership of the reinsurance sector.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Is the definition of the Australian insurance market, as presently employed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, at variance with the definition and practices of leading markets, in that they recognise the need to limit the outflow of insurance related earnings, so that the Australian market, by ignoring direct overseas placements and working only on statistics given in returns to the Australian Insurance Commissioner, is making the task of ascertaining its invisible earnings unnecessarily difficult; if so, will he take steps to rectify the problem.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) Does the definition make any examination of the question of Australia's invisible earnings unnecessarily difficult and will he take steps to rectify the problem.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Has he considered the approach of the AIA that a study be effected of the reinsurance activities of the insurance industry to analyse ways Australian companies can share more in Australian risks, as well as gaining reinsurance from overseas.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="34" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HAWKER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The present policy of permitting local purchasers of general insurance to arrange cover overseas reflects the need for access to overseas insurance markets to facilitate the placement of risks that are beyond the capacity and/or the expertise of the local market. The ability to arrange cover in overseas markets assists insureds in Australia in obtaining competitive prices for insurance services.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) While some overseas countries may, for varying reasons, impose restrictions on the outflow of general insurance business, Australia and most other OECD countries seek to adhere to certain international obligations aimed at the liberalisation of current account external payments. By not imposing restrictions on residents insuring overseas, risks are spread around the world market-a tenet of insurance being that the larger the pool of risks the more stable the overall outcome. Given the present capacity of the Australian insurance market and Australia's vulnerability to natural disasters, restrictions on the outflow of reinsurance business could have a detrimental impact of the domestic market, particularly in regard to the levels of premiums that would be necessary to maintain a viable insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) See (3) above. It should also be noted that a signficant volume of insurance business where the genesis of the risk is in Japan, the USA and EEC (i.e. including countries other than the UK) continues to be underwritten at Lloyd's.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) Neither the Office of the Insurance Commissioner nor the Australian Bureau of Statistics is aware of any insurance market entity which has developed accurate, detailed statistics on international insurance flows into and out of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Australian Bureau of Statistics has advised that it is inot aware of any comprehensive or detailed official data on the full volume of international insurance flows (with premiums and claims identified separately) relating to the Australian insurance market. However, some estimates of international insurance flows are made by the Bureau for inclusion in Australia's balance of payments statistics. As a result of improved methodology introduced in February 1986, the Bureau is now able to separately identify the service and income components of insurance transactions by direction of flow and these are recorded where appropriate in the items `insurance on exports', `insurance on imports', `insurance services nec' credits, `insurance services nec' debits, `insurance income' credits and `insurance income' debits. In compiling these items, the Bureau takes account of general insurance business placed overseas by Australian resident insurance enterprises, insurance brokers, insurance agents, and other enterprises. Account is also taken of general insurance business placed in Australia by non-resident insurance enterprises, insurance brokers and insurance agents.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Bureau is aware that a number of overseas countries record statistics on their international insurance earnings in their respective balance of payments statements. These statistics are compiled broadly in accordance with international statistical conventions as is the case in Australia. The presentation of such statistics varies from country to country, largely because of the differing institutional structures of the respective insurance markets.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Bureau has advised that it obtains adequate data on international insurance flows for the purpose of compiling balance of payments statistics. While it has no plans to expand its data collections in this area, it will continue to investigate ways of maintaining and improving the quality of the insurance component of its balance of payments statistics. In addition to the Bureau collections, however, consideration is being given to an amendment to section 34 of the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 to require the reporting to the Insurance Commissioner by insurance intermediaries of premiums they remit overseas by class of business and country of destination.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) (a) While I am aware that some oveseas countries have adopted strategies such as tax concessions to assist the operations of insurers, it is not clear that these strategies are necessarily appropriate to Australian conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Government recognises the existence of certain competitive disabilities arising from the imposition of State taxes and charges. On 17 September 1986 the Prime Minister announced that the Commonwealth had decided to remove stamp duty on contracts of international marine insurance written in the ACT and he has written to the State Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory advising them of the Commonwealth's decision and requesting their co-operation in removing the duty Australia-wide.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) While there is an incentive to avoid State stamp duties and charges by arranging cover overseas, the extent to which this might be causing insurance to be placed outside Australia is unclear. See also 7 (b) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) As indicated in the answer to 5 (b), the Australian Bureau of Statistics does not ignore direct placement of insurance overseas in estimating insurance transactions in the balance of payments. It uses data obtained from ABS surveys and taxation sources in estimating these transactions but not statistics prepared by the Insurance Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The definition of insurance transactions used by the Bureau in compiling balance of payments statistics conforms with international statistical conventions. It is not restricted to transactions involving only the Australian general insurance industry. The Bureau is not aware of any difficulties in balance of payments analyses caused by its definition of the Australian insurance industry (market).</PARA>
<PARA> (11) I doubt whether there is any need for the Government to undertake a study of this kind, particularly given that there are already approximately 30 specialist reinsurers operating in Australia and that a number of the direct underwriters authorised under the Insurance Act (approximately 150) also undertake some reinsurance business as part of their overall operations. It is, of course, open to the industry itself to explore ways in which its share of the overall insurance and reinsurance market might be increased.</PARA>

<PARA> (8) Yes. At the time it was unattained the material was under the control of the Metropolitan Rail Division.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) and (10) At the request of the AAEC, my Department has been delivering radiopharmaceuticals to to Metropolitan Rail at Spencer Street for onforwarding to Upper Ferntree Gully Station for a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA> Metropolitan Rail was aware of the consignment on 1 May 1986 which was transported by rail to the requirements of the Australian Code for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail, and the Australian Code of Practice for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Substances. Packages of radioactive material despatched by the AAEC carry labelling and instructions as indicated in reply to the Member's question No. 4038 (refer Hansard of 16 September 1986). Any additional instructions to transport personnel are the responsibility of the carrier, in this case Metropolitan Rail.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) The consignee Radclin Pty Ltd provides the transport from the Railway Station to William Angliss Hospital. I understand a vehicle with a portable lead container is used.</PARA>

<PARA> (15) My Department delivers the material by road using its own dedicated vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) The Freight Section of the Transport and Storage Division.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) No, Apart from Metropolitan Rail which was engaged with the agreement of the AAEC. I understand that differences do exist between the various States concerning licensing requirements for the transport of radioactive materials.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) No. The primary responsibility for ensuring that personnel involved in the transport of radioactive material are instructed as necessary in its safe handling rests with the carrier organisation. It should be noted however that the stringent packaging requirements specified in the Australian Code of Practices for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Substances mean that the contribution required by the carrier towards ensuring safety during transport is minimised. The overall responsibility for ensuring the implementation of the applicable requirements for the safe transport of radioactive materials by road and rail within each State rests with the designated Competent Authority in each State which in most cases is the State Health Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (19) (a) My Department must comply with the regulations as laid down in the Australian Code for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail, published in the Commonwealth Gazette No. P 8, 9 April 1984; (b) All regulations were followed except for the external placarding of the Commonwealth vehicle. Although the vehicle had a placard advising MEDICAL SUPPLIES it did not have the correct placard in accordance with the Code for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail. This has subsequently been rectified.</PARA>
<PARA> (20) The precautions taken by my Department are as follows: (i) Consignments are collected in a radio controlled lock up van; (ii) All deliveries are either signed for or placed in special security areas to which the driver has keys; (iii) The drivers wear a film badge which is checked each week by the Australian Radiation Laboratory. To date all readings have been well below the acceptable safety level.</PARA>
<PARA> (21) My Department has not experienced thefts or losses of radioactive material whilst it has been in its possession. However, it is aware that on three occasions radiopharmaceuticals whilst under the control of the Metropolitan Rail Authority were misdirected causing late delivery.</PARA>
<PARA> (22) It is understood that the Metropolitan Transit Authority is implementing procedures to improve the method of control over the movement of the material.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sewage discharge from the Hamilton Island tourist resort is treated to primary standard prior to release into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Hamilton Island Pty. Ltd. holds a Water Quality Council of Queensland (WQCQ) licence (issued March 1985 and renewed March 1986) to discharge sewage. This licence imposes water quality criteria on the discharge and imposes a deadline by which the criteria are to be met. The criteria are considered to be acceptable by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The Authority has issued a permit to the company giving permission to discharge sewage into the Marine Park. A condition of this permission is that the company will meet the WQCQ water quality criteria by March 1987. Recent advice from the company is that a treatment plant will be installed that will allow these criteria to be met.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The requirements for cabin attendants are detailed in Air Navigation Orders Section 20.16.3. The relevant paragraphs are:</PARA>
<PARA> ``6.1-Aircraft engaged in charter or regular public transport operations shall carry cabin attendants appropriate to their passenger complement as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) aircraft carrying more than fifteen but not more than thirty-six passengers shall carry a cabin attendant, except that aircraft-</PARA>

<PARA> (ii) carrying not more than nineteen passengers; and</PARA>

<PARA> (b) aircraft carrying more than thirty-six but not more than 216 passengers shall carry at least one cabin attendant for each unit of thirty-six passengers or part thereof;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) aircraft carrying more than 216 passengers shall carry the number of cabin attendants as prescribed by the Secretary which shall not be less than one cabin attendant for each floor level exit in any cabin with two aisles;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) notwithstanding the specifications of (a), (b) and (c) above, in an aircraft in which cabin attendants are required to be carried, there shall be not less than one cabin attendant in each separate compartment occupied by passengers, and, where the number of cabin attendants used in the emergency evacuation demonstration required by Air Navigation Orders Section 20.11 of this Part was in excess of the numbers required by (a), (b) or (c) above, the number of cabin attendants on an aircraft shall be not less than the numbers required by (a), (b) or (c) as applicable plus the excess number of attendants used in the demonstration.</PARA>
<PARA> 6.2-Notwithstanding the requirements of para 6.1 above, the number of cabin attendants required need not be increased when infants or children are carried and the total number of passengers exceeds the number of passengers permitted by-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the number of cabin attendants carried; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the number permitted by the emergency evacuation demonstration required by Air Navigation Orders Section 20.11 of this Part including any increase allowed without demonstration,</PARA>
<PARA> provided that the number of excess passengers does not exceed five per cent to the nearest whole number of the lesser of (a) or (b) above and that the excess passengers are infants or children.''</PARA>
<PARA> (2) If a major or significant change in the cabin interior configuration is proposed by an operator my Department would require that the relevant Air Navigation Orders relating to aircraft loading, carriage of persons, cabin safety, weight and balance and structural integrity be adhered to.</PARA>
<PARA> However an operator may change the seating configuration in accordance with any previously approved configurations, or minor variations thereto, without any further approval or Departmental requirement. This occurs, for example, where a number of alternative configurations were submitted and approved when the aircraft was first certificated or registered.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A change to the seating configuration would only require a change to cabin attendant requirements where there was a corresponding change in the number of passengers or compartments.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. Provided that operators comply with safety and operational requirements they are free to adjust aircraft seating configurations in order to meet demand on differing routes in accordance with their commercial judgement.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. The present safety and operational requirements are considered necessary and appropriate.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr Willis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) The specific objectives of the Community Volunteer Program (CVP) are yet to be determined in detail. In general terms the CVP will aim to provide increased opportunities for the unemployed, especially young people, to undertake voluntary community work. Such work will enable participants to</PARA>
<PARA> contribute to the community;</PARA>
<PARA> broaden their experience;</PARA>
<PARA> enhance their self esteem; and</PARA>
<PARA> compete better for paid work.</PARA>
<PARA> The characteristics of the CVP are to be determined on the basis of extensive consultations recently conducted throughout Australia. The new program will, however, be based on the following principles:</PARA>
<PARA> participation will be voluntary;</PARA>
<PARA> young unemployed people will be the principal target group (although all unemployed people will be eligible);</PARA>
<PARA> participants will be given the opportunity to undertake worthwhile community service activities while retaining their entitlement to unemployment benefit;</PARA>
<PARA> work opportunities will not be in areas normally involving paid employment, nor will they be a substitute for such employment;</PARA>
<PARA> participation will be part-time, so as to allow unemployed people to continue their efforts to find paid employment in the open labour market; and</PARA>
<PARA> relevant non-government groups and individuals will have a key role in assisting with the development and operation of the initiative to the maximum extent possible</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (b) The objectives of the Volunteer Youth Program (VYP) are to assist unemployed young people to maintain and develop their capacity to obtain and retain employment and to promote their integration into the community.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the VYP, grants are made available to and are administered by approved sponsor organisations to operate projects which act as referral agencies to facilitate the placement of unemployed young people in voluntary community service work. VYP project activities include:</PARA>
<PARA> identification of relevant community service opportunities;</PARA>
<PARA> regular placement of individual participants in voluntary community service activities;</PARA>
<PARA> monitoring individual participants' progress;</PARA>
<PARA> promotion of project activities to the community;</PARA>
<PARA> provision of appropriate advice and information to participants within the limits of the project officer's competence to do so; and</PARA>
<PARA> referral of participants to other agencies when appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> The main characteristics of VYP as announced by the Fraser Government included the following principles:</PARA>
<PARA> participation is completely voluntary;</PARA>
<PARA> the activities of volunteers must be controlled by the sponsor organisation so that no problems arise in relation to paid work already undertaken where participants are placed; and</PARA>
<PARA> the placement of youth volunteers must be arranged by the sponsor organisation to avoid interference with the valuable services currently being provided by the existing network of volunteers in community service organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) and (b) As the details of the CVP have not yet been determined the similarities and differences with VYP cannot be specified in detail at this time. However, CVP will not be restricted to unemployed young people.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) See answer to (2) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The CVP was announced only in principle in the 1986/87 Budget. Community and business organisations were not consulted prior to this announcement.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="42" SPEAKER="Bowen The Hon L.F." NAMEID="ZE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HAWKER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr Lionel Bowen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) As indicated in the Reserve Bank of Australia Bulletin for December 1984/January 1985, the daily turnover of Australian dollars in the deliverable foreign exchange market averaged $2,894 million for the six months ending December 1984 and $883 million for the six months ending December 1983. It should be noted, however, that the increased turnover in 1984 reflects a number of factors including the removal of most exchange controls in association with the floating of the $A in December 1983 and the authorisation of non-bank foreign exchange dealers from June 1984. This latter move has contributed to greater depth and competitive efficiency in the foreign exchange market.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Under Australia's current foreign exchange arrangements persons wishing to buy or sell foreign currency in Australia must do so through a dealer authorised by the Reserve Bank. Under the terms of their authorities dealers are in turn obliged, before making foreign currency available to their customers for purposes of effecting a specified range of transactions, to either: receive a tax clearance certificate where the transaction is to be directed to a designated (tax haven) country; or, in the case of transactions directed to other countries, require the customer to complete a declaration form where the amount of the transaction exceeds $A50,000 or the foreign currency equivalent. These forms are then remitted to the Taxation Office by the dealer. It is an offence under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations to make a false statement in the declaration form.</PARA>
<PARA> The purchase by residents of Australia of foreign currency outside Australia and the placement by Australian residents of any amount of currency to the credit, in Australia, of non-residents is also subject to the tax screening requirements detailed above.</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, where funds in excess of $5,000 are transferred from Australia other than through an authorised dealer (by, for example, the direct remittance of a bank or personal cheque) the institution in Australia ultimately required to give value to the instrument is obliged to report the transaction to the Taxation Office. Exchange controls also prohibit, without the Reserve Bank's authority, the sending of Australian currency notes and coins abroad and limit to $5,000 per person the amount of Australian notes and coins that may be taken from Australia in any journey.</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member will note, the above arrangements are quite comprehensive. The Government has no documentary evidence to support any claims of widespread avoidance of these requirements. I would also emphasise that the information which becomes available to the Taxation Office under these arrangements forms but one part of information which is available to it in detecting tax avoidance in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) &amp; (4) It is not proposed to establish an inquiry into money laundering at this stage. However, on 28 September 1986 the Government announced its intention to introduce legislation dealing with the proceeds of crime. That legislation will also create money laundering offences and impose a number of obligations on financial institutions in connection with the verification of the identity of persons seeking to open an account and the retention of banking records. It is expected that the legislation will be introduced shortly. The Government is also examining the practicability of introducing requirements that financial institutions report certain cash transactions, including remittances of funds overseas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Local Government and Administrative Services, upon notice, on 16 September 1986:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Does the Government require (a) government departments and (b) statutory authorities to purchase goods and services from small businesses as defined by the recent EPAC report `Some features of small business and its policy environment'.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What directions has the Government issued for this purpose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Industry Economics in its recent small business paper `Government Procurement and Small Firms' noted `that information collected in surveys indicates that small firms do not face any significant constraints in supplying to government. Although small firms are less likely to be involved in government work than large firms, in most cases this is simply because they do not deal in, or have the capacity, to produce those goods and services normally required. For those small firms which do apply for Government work, the success rate is quite high.'</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Small Business Council has made a submission to the Committee of Review on Government High Technology Purchasing Arrangements. The views of small business will be taken into the Government's consideration of this committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) None. Small businesses are eligible to apply for all forms of general industry assistance provided by the Government. Such assistance includes the application of the policy of preference to Australian-made goods and related services in Government purchasing by departments and those authorities not exempt from the policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The preference policy provides for the application of a number of measures directed to both large and small businesses interested in supplying government requirements. The directions are set down in Commonwealth Purchasing Circulars issued by my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> The directions on preference require the use of unbiased specifications, consideration by purchasing authorities of alternative offers of Australian-made goods and related services, specification of Australian-made materials and services in certain construction-works tenders, use of minimum economic order quantities for Australian conditions, application in tender evaluations of a twenty per cent margin of preference applied to the local material and manufactured value-added content of tenders and, in the evaluation of low value quotations, to the total value of local supplies. There is also discretionary preference consideration by Ministers for tenders valued above $100 000 where a twenty per cent margin of preference is insufficient to award the contract to a higher priced, higher Australian content suitable offer.</PARA>
<PARA> The margin of preference is also applied to the New Zealand content of offers in accordance with the Australia/New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of the National Preference Agreement recently signed by the Commonwealth and the States these measures have been reinforced.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AV4">Mr Hurford</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as folows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a), (b), (c) and (d) There is a need to distinguish between wide ranging reviews which, while not specifically concerned with the performance of Immigration funtions overseas, impinge upon those functions and management oriented reviews which are solely concerned with the Immigration function. Examples of the former are the Fraser Government's Review of Commonwealth Functions in 1981 and 1982 and the current Review of Overseas Representation. Management reviews tend to be on-going internal administrative exercises aimed at ensuring a continuing high level of performance.</PARA>
<PARA> It would not be appropriate to give details of such a wide ranging exercise as the Review of Commonwealth Functions, except to mention that it did result in reductions to Immigration staff overseas. The current Review of Overseas Representation is a major Government initiative and is concerned with Australia's effort overseas as a whole and the extent to which it meets Australia's essential requirements. While a number of matters are still being considered by the Government, one major outcome of this review already has been a significant reduction in the size of Australia's overseas representation. This has involved a reduction in the number of Immigration positions overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> The primary means of ensuring that overseas posts are functioning efficiently and effectively is through regular monitoring of their performance rather than by formal inquiries. Before the introduction of the computer-based Migration Program Management system (MPMS) in 1983-84, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs conducted annual reviews of workload/staffing ratios at individual posts in order to assess required staffing levels. The MPMS and supplementary workload reporting systems now enable continuous monitoring and assessment of overseas posts' activities.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the emphasis on continuous review rather than separate inquiries as a means of managing the overseas operation, administrative change tends to be incremental and derive from a continuing flow of proposals. Factors which affect the nature and volume of work overseas include changing immigration policy, shifts in the propensity of residents in Australia to sponsor relatives overseas, changes in the number of occupations for which there is a demand for skilled labour in Australia and variations in refugee and temporary entry patterns.</PARA>

<PARA> While no specific study of the new sponsorship arrangements has been undertaken to date, my department continuously monitors procedures and workloads at overseas posts to ascertain their efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) A survey of client reaction to the new arrangements at nine key posts (London, Belgrade, Pretoria, Bonn, Damascus, Hong Kong, Manila, Santiago and Suva) showed that the streamlined procedures have been very favourably received.</PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements eliminate the need for Australian offices of the Department to check sponsorships prior to applications being considered overseas. Where necessary, sponsorship checks are now undertaken in Australia concurrent with overseas processing. This has clearly shortened processing.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) Wollongong Area Office services the Wollongong Statistical Division, part of the Wollondilly local government area and Jervis Bay.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The initial decision to close the Office was made in response to portfolio savings targets developed in the 1986-87 Budget process. Further investigation revealed other savings options which allow the Office to remain open with reduced staff and functions.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="49" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HUGHES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (2) and (3) The Naval Communications Station at North West Cape is not a `US Communications Base'. It was in 1978 and is today a joint Australian/US defence facility.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1978 a number of changes were made to the equipment at the Station after consultations between Australia and the US. In addition, there was extensive public discussion of US plans to install a new satellite communications terminal, at that time designated AN/MSC-61. The new terminal, which was later redesignated AN/GSC-39, became operational in 1984. The changes were made to improve the efficiency of the Station but did not alter its agreed role and functions.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Procurement of third generation Defence Satellite Communications System (DSCS) satellites is being undertaken, but the DSCS communications terminal at North West Cape still operates with the second generation satellites of the DSCS. It has not yet been established when the DSCS II satellites serving North West Cape will be superseded.</PARA>
<PARA> The Station has been operational for almost twenty years, having been commissioned on 16 September 1967.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. US leaders have repeatedly emphasized that US nuclear strategy is defensive, that the US does not have a first strike strategy, and that the US would not be the first to initiate conflict with the USSR. Secondly, because the US lacks the ability to carry out successfully a `disarming' first strike on the USSR it would clearly be contrary to the US' own vital interests for it to attempt to conduct such an attack. Thirdly, the primary characteristic of strategic ballistic missile submarines remains their survivability, and this ensures that they will remain essentially second strike retaliatory weapons, notwithstanding improvements in missile capability.</PARA>
<PARA> The US considers that deterrence of conflict with the USSR depends in part upon the credibility of its threat of nuclear retaliation in the event of major Soviet conventional attack upon the US or its allies-credibility which would be diminished significantly were a guarantee to be given that the US would not be the first to use nuclear weapons. For reasons such as these the US has not regarded such a guarantee to be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> For its part, the Australian Government is confident that it is well informed of US strategic thinking and the part North West Cape plays in it, would know if there were any major changes in these matters, and would know if the US wished to make use of the Station's capabilities in support of combat operations. Australia and the US consult regularly and in detail not only on technical matters relating to the Station and its activities, but also on the broader strategic and policy issues covering the role of North West Cape and the international context for its operations. These consultations include the frequent Ministerial level talks in Australia and the US between the Australian Government and the US Administration, and the regular formal and informal meetings between Australian and US officials.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is satisfied that it is well informed of all issues relevant to the functioning of North West Cape, including possible changes to the equipment at the Station and the reasons for those changes, and that the operations of the Station do not impinge on Australian sovereignty.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Yes. This occurred before the Station became a joint facility in 1974.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) As at 30 September 1986 there were 629 personnel working at North West Cape. Of these 354 were US and 275 Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) US personnel do not have automatic access to the Australian national communications centre, and Australians do not have automatic access to the equivalent US centre. Arrangements are routinely made, however, for Australian personnel to visit the US centre, and for US personnel to visit the Australian national room. In all the other areas of the Station there are no limitations on access made on the basis of nationality.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Comprehensive records of all Members of the Federal Parliament who have visited North West Cape since the Naval Communications Station became operational have not been kept. Members who have visited the Station on one or more occasions between 1981 and 30 June 1986 (with their titles at the time) have been included:</PARA>
<PARA> Hon. L. Bowen</PARA>
<PARA> Hon. W. G. Hayden</PARA>
<PARA> Mr R. Shipton</PARA>
<PARA> Sen. R. Elstob</PARA>
<PARA> Sen. K. Sibraa</PARA>

<PARA> Hon. M. McKellar</PARA>
<PARA> Sen. Hon. F. Chaney</PARA>
<PARA> Sen. elect J. Vallentine</PARA>
<PARA> Mr G. Campbell</PARA>
<PARA> (12) No rent is payable by the US for its share of the use of the North West Cape Station. The provision in the original `Arrangements for the Use and Occupation by the United States Navy of Commonwealth Land and for Associated Matters' (the North West Cape Land Use Arrangements), providing for payment of an annual rental of one peppercorn, was removed as a consequence of the Station becoming a joint facility in 1974.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) Yes. However, some facilities such as canteens or recreation facilities may not be jointly manned at all times, and the Australian and US national communications centres are manned only by Australian and US personnel respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) There is no `lease' between the Australian and US Governments covering North West Cape. However, the Agreement between Australia and the United States of America relating to the establishment of the Station, which entered into force on 28 June 1963 (Australian Treaty Series 1963 No. 16) is to remain in force for at least 25 years, and thereafter until either party gives 180 days notice of intent to terminate the Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) Not with the same capability. The only mobile communications facilities which could be used in lieu of North West Cape are the TACAMO airborne relay aircraft which have a VLF capability to provide local area back-up support for parts of the US VLF fixed site network. These aircraft do not provide an alternative broad area VLF support or capability.</PARA>
<PARA> The US Navy keeps TACAMO aircraft continuously airborne over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, operating from bases in Maryland, California and Hawaii. Since the aircraft are mobile, the potential exists for them to be deployed into areas covered by the VLF transmissions from North West Cape. However, the TACAMO aircraft have a relatively low power output compared to that of North West Cape, and a lower efficiency of their VLF transmitting aerial. When these factors are added to the present deployment areas of the TACAMO aircraft, it becomes clear that they do not provide an alternative to North West Cape.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) a. Yes. The Government is fully and regularly consulted by the US on all proposed updatings, upgradings or additions to North West Cape. Some of the existing proposals for changes or additions to the equipment at the Station are not to be implemented before 1992. The US also provides preliminary advice on its tentative proposals for changes, but has asked that such proposals be kept confidential. However, the firm proposals for changes are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) a new electronics maintenance shop;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) a new automotive maintenance shop;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) replacement of cryptographic equipment;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) replacement of HF radio antennas;</PARA>
<PARA> (5) replacement of secure-voice communication terminals;</PARA>
<PARA> (6) replacement of HF radio transmitters;</PARA>
<PARA> (7) conversion of the cooling system for the Station's generating equipment from salt to fresh water;</PARA>
<PARA> (8) a new maintenance facility for harbour boats;</PARA>
<PARA> (9) expansion of public works maintenance/storage shop;</PARA>
<PARA> (10) emergency cooling system for air conditioning;</PARA>
<PARA> (11) replacement of analog microwave system by digital system;</PARA>
<PARA> (12) fire protection for fuel tanks;</PARA>
<PARA> (13) fire protection for communications centre;</PARA>
<PARA> (14) new voice communications at control site and HF site;</PARA>
<PARA> (15) new time-standard clocks to be installed;</PARA>
<PARA> (16) improved voice communication system;</PARA>
<PARA> (17) support equipment for microwave upgrade;</PARA>
<PARA> (18) improved word processing techniques;</PARA>
<PARA> (19) new post office;</PARA>
<PARA> (20) new electrical generators;</PARA>
<PARA> (21) new storage area for commissary;</PARA>
<PARA> (22) auto hobby shop.</PARA>
<PARA> None of the planned upgrades to the equipment at the Station will alter its agreed role and functions.</PARA>
<PARA> b. RAN submarine broadcast control equipment will be upgraded in 1987.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) Schools and teachers joined the program in response the open advertisements placed in the major national newspapers. Those who responded were sent details of the program and an application form which asked them to spell out the nature of the human rights project they had in mind. In 1985 applications were assessed by the program director in the Human Rights Commission to ensure that the proposed project was relevant to human rights education. In 1986 applications were assessed by Education Department panels in those States (WA, SA, VIC, NSW) which had allocated project officers to supervise the program.</PARA>
<PARA> The project offices were fully briefed by the Commission's program director. In those States or Territories where no project officer had so far been appointed, assessments were done by the program director as in 1985. The same criteria were applied. The successful applicants became participants and received copies of the kits.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article written by Max Walsh in the Age of 17 March 1986 stating that (a) the interesting thing about sections 50 and 50B of the Income Tax Assessment Act is that, combined with section 6 and particularly sub-section 6 (4), the Commissioner of Taxation would appear to have a case to reclaim a lot of tax that has been avoided in both preference share issues and takeover deals and (b) what all this boils down to is that this would seem to be another instance when there has been a loss of major proportions in revenue that could have been avoided with aggressive administration of the existing tax legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Has the Commissioner of Taxation a case to reclaim tax as suggested in the article; if so, what action has been taken to reclaim the money.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) My attention has been drawn to the article.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised me there is no case to reclaim tax in the circumstances suggested in the article.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. This is not a question of aggressive administration of the law. The Commissioner's statutory duty is to administer the tax laws enacted by the Parliament having regard to the way they have been interpreted by the courts and other appellate tribunals. I am informed that his administration of the provisions of the income tax law referred to in the article is consistent with the interpretation placed upon them by the courts. I would also draw the honourable Member's attention to a decision of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory in Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd v. Grace Bros. Holdings Ltd &amp; Ors where the Commissioner's approach to the operation of sub-section 6 (4) of the Income Tax Assessment Act was referred to with approval.

While the former's provisional liquidation has been finalised by a scheme of arrangement approved by the creditors and assented to by the Courts, the latter is still at the provisional stage.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Two cases involved alleged misappropriation of funds by company executives.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) See answer to Question (2) below.</PARA>

Improvements have been made to the supervisory arrangements in recent years, including more stringent solvency requirements and improved quarterly returns. The arrangements are subject to continuing review and monitoring.</PARA>
<PARA> I should add, however, that the Act does not purport to be a guarantee against failure of an insurer; such a guarantee would involve an unacceptable and costly level of intervention in the affairs of insurers and insureds.</PARA>

This examination, which also embraces the possibility of incorporating similar provisions in the Life Insurance Act, is nearing completion but there is a need to explore some aspects further with the Insurance Commissioner, the Life Insurance Commissioner and industry representatives.

<PARA> (1) (a) and (b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Some findings of limited research into the situation in Australian cities was provided at the National Infrastructure Conference held in Canberra in October 1985. Some further research is currently being undertaken by the CSIRO into the extent of the problem. However, more research needs to be carried out by all levels of government in Australia as comprehensive information on the extent and rate of decay of infrastructure in Australian cities is not available. It might be noted that the infrastructure (especially hydraulic systems) of some Australian cities is of equivalent age to those in Europe and North America. For example the water supply system of Melbourne was installed at a similar time to that for London.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) At the 1985 Local Government Ministers' Conference it was agreed to establish a Task Force to examine the maintenance of infrastructure under the control of Local Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The Task Force is chaired by a representative of the Australian Council of Local Government Associations and includes officers of the Local Government and Regional Development Division of my Department, the Department of Housing and Construction and the Institute of Local Government Engineers. The Task Force is required to report on the extent of information available on the deterioration of engineering infrastructure under the control of Local Government and to recommend what further action, if any, might be undertaken in this area. The Task Force is expected to complete its work and two reports by February/March 1987.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Within the Arts, Heritage and Environment portfolio there are a number of programs which facilitate the showing of works of art and craft throughout Australia and which involve co-operation with State, Territory and local governments.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment administers a scheme whereby exhibitions of cultural property valued at greater than $2 million may be approved for Commonwealth indemnity against loss or damage.</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the scheme is to ensure that the Australian public has opportunity to see major international and Australian touring art exhibitions which would not be possible without indemnity, because of the prohibitive costs of insurance. The International Cultural Corporation of Australia and the Australian National Gallery are approved managing organisations for these exhibitions, many of which are initiated by State Art Galleries. The exhibitions are shown in at least two States.</PARA>
<PARA> The total value of the seven exhibitions of cultural property indemnified by the Commonwealth during 1984-85 was $254,353,029. However, there was no expenditure by the Commonwealth for claims under the indemnity scheme in 1984-85.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australia Council provides a coordinated network of support for exhibitions at regional and State levels through the National Exhibitions Touring Support Program (NETS). There are three interdependent components of the scheme:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) State and regional based exhibition development, including the coordination and facilitation of intra State touring,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) National communication of exhibition practices and broad based professional development and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) National management, coordination and facilitation of interstate exhibition touring.</PARA>
<PARA> The Council allocated $87,454 towards the development of NETS in 1984-85.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Crafts and Visual Arts Boards, and to a lesser extent the Aboriginal Arts, Design Arts and Community Arts Boards of the Australia Council operate a number of programs to facilitate the showing of works of arts and craft throughout Australia. Such programs may include exhibitions, acquisitions of art works and craft demonstrations and are intended to meet perceived needs and/or complement existing programs. The Australia Council also provides funds to the Arts Council of Australia and the Crafts Council of Australia, for many purposes, some of which encourage the showing of art and craft works at a regional, State and Territorial level. It is not feasible to identify specific sums provided in 1984-85 through the Australia Council for these co-operative exhibition programs.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian National Gallery lends works of art to art museums and other institutions (including State and regional galleries) in all States and Territories. In 1984-85, 383 works were lent to 33 institutions to enhance their exhibitions and to enable the Australian National Gallery collection to reach a wider public throughout Australia. Two travelling exhibitions were organised for 1985 and three were organised in 1986. Under the Gallery's loans program all costs are borne by the borrower.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Library of Australia, as part of its Exhibitions program, lends works including paintings, works on paper and photographs for exhibition by State, Territory and local organisations such as libraries, art galleries and museums. On occasions, the Library also borrows material for exhibitions displayed at the Library. The costs of individual loans under the Library's Exhibitions Program are negotiated on a one-off basis. It is not possible to identify the exact cost to the Library of the various components of its Exhibitions Program for 1984-85.</PARA>
<PARA> Looking to the future, the newly established National Maritime Museum will also work with State, Territory and local government collecting institutions in its task of developing policies, collections and facilities which will adequately preserve, record and display all aspects of Australia's mercantile and naval history, as well as the life of Australians on its shores and waterways.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Federal Police (AFP), is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1)-(3) Statistics on crime involving the use of credit, cash and other plastic cards are not available as all offences involving abuse of such cards are categorised as theft.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Most credit card fraud results from the theft of credit cards. In this instance, the only preventative method is to increase the awareness of the community towards the security of such cards. I am advised that in the ACT the AFP endeavours to do this through the media (e.g. the Police column in The Canberra Times) and through addresses to groups and professional and community organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> In the course of inquiries into credit card theft from letter boxes, the AFP has informally suggested to financial institutions that prospective cardholders be required to attend the institution, produce adequate identification and sign for receipt of the card. The AFP has also suggested to banks, building societies and credit unions that they:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) not allow withdrawals of uncleared funds through Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs); (2) require adequate identification before opening accounts; and (3) not allow withdrawals from ATMs which overdraw the accounts. The honourable member will appreciate, however, that decisions regarding the adoption of these measures ultimately rest with the financial institutions themselves.</PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Government recently endorsed the new procedures recommended by the Working Group Examining the Rights and Obligations of the Users and Providers of Electronic Funds Transfer Systems. These voluntary procedures, which are aimed at protecting the users of ATMs, have the support of major bank and non-bank financial institutions in Australia. The Working Group will monitor the implementation of these procedures and will advise the Government whether more formal arrangements, including legislation, would be warranted.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) As indicated in parts (16) and (17) of my answer to Question No. 11, the Government is sympathetic to the idea of increased disclosure in this area. However, the publication of Form 4 in its existing format could convey a misleading impression of an insurer's solvency. This derives from that fact that the solvency calculation included in that return is based on the insurer's assessment of the relevant assets and liabilities which does not always accord with that made by the Insurance Commissioner. The Government will be considering measures for increased disclosure with industry representatives.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The examination referred to in part (24) of my answer to Question 11 is nearing completion. There are, however, some issues concerning possible approaches to fit and proper persons tests for directors and owners of authorised insurance companies that will need to be explored further with the Insurance Commissioner, the Life Insurance Commissioner and industry representatives. It is my intention, however, that these processes be concluded very soon.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is envisaged that this matter will be considered in the context of assessing the Australian Law Reform Commission's final report on its general insolvency reference, which is expected to be available late in 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The honourable member will be aware that, as announced on 11 June 1986, the Government is proceeding with arrangements for the existing life insurance and general insurance regulatory functions, as well as the proposed new superannuation regulatory functions and the functions of the Australian Government Actuary, to be brought together in one office under the control of a new statutory position to be known as the Principal Commissioner for Insurance and Superannuation.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Pensioners Living Overseas</PARA>
<PARA> Medical Services: Pensioners and any other Australian citizens living overseas are eligible for Medicare (medical only) benefits provided they are considered to be Australian residents. The definition of `Australian resident' for Medicare purposes includes those persons who are overseas for up to two years. In certain circumstances, this period can be extended by one year, making a total of three years, but generally, someone who stays outside Australia for more than two years is not regarded as an Australian resident unless there is clear evidence of intention to return. A pensioner who does not satisfy the Australian resident criteria is not eligible for Medicare benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> Pharmaceutical Services: Pharmaceutical benefits are only available to persons (including pensioners) receiving medical treatment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Pension Payments: Of the 1,324,600 persons receiving age pensions at 30 June 1986, 11,900 reside overseas. The same eligibility criteria apply to age pensioners living overseas as in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matters raised by the honourable member in the adjournment debate on 29 May 1986 relating to allegations of sales tax avoidance centre on an isolated instance involving a single official of one charity. As the honourable member is aware, the secrecy provisions in the sales tax legislation preclude the Commissioner of Taxation from supplying specific information regarding the affairs of any person or organisation. I am therefore unable to respond to the honourable member's specific questions regarding this charity.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the more general matters raised, the honourable member referred to the establishment of a prima facie case that serious breaches of the sales tax law occurred in this matter. As I understand it, the proceedings in the New South Wales courts did not canvass the question of breaches of the Commonwealth sales tax law.</PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated earlier, this case was an isolated instance and the Commissioner has advised that there is no evidence to suggest that the fraudulent practices allegedly employed in this area have been used elsewhere. The Taxation Office has in place extensive procedures to safeguard the revenue where exemption from sales tax on motor vehicles is sought. The Commissioner also advised that breaches of the law of this type are ordinarily referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for advice on possible prosecution action.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NF4">Mr Cohen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No. The Total Environment Centre (TEC) publication to which reference is made lists a large number of species by conservation status categories similar to those used by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. These categories range from `very rare and believed to be decreasing in numbers' to `not endangered at present'. The preparation of individual action plans for each species would be a major undertaking. Conservationists now generally recognise that habitat protection is the key to species conservation.</PARA>
<PARA> Prime responsibility for wildlife management in Australia rests with the Governments of the States and the Northern Territory. Where appropriate, liaison between the States and Territories and the Commonwealth on wildlife issues occurs through the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers (CONCOM).</PARA>
<PARA> In 1974, CONCOM published an agreed national list of endangered vertebrate species, most of which are also included in the TEC publication. This list is updated periodically by a Working Group comprising research biologists from each State, Territory and the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NF4">Mr Cohen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Government takes action to protect the natural values of Christmas Island, including the shore terraces, through the provision of advice to the Christmas Island Assembly on environmental protection and conservation matters, including the implementation of wildlife protection ordinances, the establishment of national parks on the Island and through the requirement that clearing proposals have the approval of the Government Conservator.</PARA>
<PARA> Christmas Island National Park contains important areas of shore terrace. With the proclamation on 31 January 1986 of Christmas island (Stage 2) and Christmas Island (Stage 3) National Parks, additional areas of shore terrace were included within the national park, including very significant seabird breeding habitat around North West Point. The National Park now covers 2370 hectares or 17 per cent of Christmas Island, including approximately 25 kilometres of continuous shoreline.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the terms of a 1984 agreement, the Phosphate Mining Corporation of Christmas Island submits all clearing plans for approval to the Government Conservator. Where agreement on a clearing plan cannot be reached, there is provision for the matter to be referred through the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) to the Minister for resolution. I understand that a plan was recently submitted for the western shore terrace of South Point but that this has now been withdrawn following adoption of a new Corporation Plan which does not require phosphate rock from this source at this time.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Sections of the shore terrace do contain very high concentrations of nesting seabirds on a seasonal basis. Species using the shore terraces for breeding include Red-footed Boobies, Brown Boobies, endemic Christmas Island Frigatebirds, Great Frigatebirds, Red-tailed Tropicbirds and White-tailed Tropicbirds. Most numerous is the Red-footed Booby which nests in colonies in trees on many parts of the shore terrace and slopes of the inland cliff. The endangered Christmas Island Frigatebird nests only in colonies on the north-east terraces of the Island and measures are in place to ensure the protection of its habitat.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In the past, before there was a proper awareness of the conflict between mining and Abbott's Booby, nesting habitat of this species was extensively cleared. This does not happen now. The Phosphate Mining Corporation jointly funds, with the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, an Abbott's Booby Monitoring Program and, in accordance with the 1984 agreement, following any clearing undertakes rehabilitation on a routine basis. Extensive safeguards are now in place.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I am unaware of any breaches of international conventions as a result of mining activities on the Island since conservation guidelines were introduced.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) I am aware that a number of instances in the general nature of the honourable member's questioning have been widely reported over the last 12 years. The Department of Defence monitors reports that are likely to involve Australian orders.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Each year the Department of Defence places a wide range of orders with commercial suppliers in the US and the US Government through its Foreign Military Sales arrangements. The number of orders would aggregate to many hundreds for spares, replacement items and new capital equipment items. Payments for these orders would be spread over a number of years. Accordingly, to provide an exact answer to the honourable member's question would require the application of a great deal of Departmental resources for a considerable period. However, as an indication of the volume of business carried on with US suppliers the following are the totals of payments made since 1983-84:</PARA>
<PARA> 1983-84-$907m</PARA>
<PARA> 1984-85-$1,272m</PARA>
<PARA> 1985-86-$1,391m</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) Two avenues of procurement in the US are open to Australia: direct commercial purchase from a US Company; or through US Foreign Military Sales Arrangements, under which the US Government essentially makes the purchase on our behalf. In direct purchasing, Australian interests are protected through competitive pricing and acceptance of the lowest priced technically acceptable offer; or if no competition is possible, a number of checks such as previous price paid, price paid by other customers, and audit of costs. In procurement through Foreign Military Sales, US procurement agencies perform the same kind of function. If overcharging were proved, we would pay an amended price and receive any refunds due.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Two principal methods are used to ensure that US sourced material is not defective:</PARA>
<PARA> we seek to include warranty provisions in contracts to allow the Commonwealth to seek appropriate compensation from the manufacturer, including the emergence of latent defects, and appropriate internationally and nationally agreed standards are specified within the contract.</PARA>
<PARA> manufacturers' Quality Assurance (QA) plans are validated and a comprehensive system of QA procedures/inspections is imposed including the use of either the US Services' or Australian Services' QA organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Department of Defence seeks the inclusion of performance warranties as appropriate in contracts for defence equipment. The Department also requires that on delivery, equipment meets all technical specifications including performance specifications.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) A Public Servant or member of the Defence Force who believes he or she has been victimised for any reason may pursue the matter through established grievance mechanisms. Public servants have a right to request the relevant delegate of the Secretary of the Department to review the matter; if the officer is dissatisfied with the outcome of that process he or she has a further avenue of redress through the Merit Protection and Review Agency of the Australian Public Service. A member of the Defence Force is entitled to submit an application for redress of grievance through his or her chain of command and to request its reconsideration at successively higher levels if dissatisfied with the outcome. A member of the Defence Force may also take complaint to the Defence Force Ombudsman subject to provisions under the Ombudsman Act 1976-83.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr Blewett</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. The Model Food Act was prepared by a joint Commonwealth-State-Territory working party set up by and reporting to the Health Ministers' Conference.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), a joint Commonwealth-State-Territory body with the function of enquiring into, advising and making recommendations to the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments on health issues, develops Model Food Standards Regulations (MFSR) which include the control of food additives. These are then recommended to State and Territory health authorities for inclusion in their respective regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) While New South Wales has not adopted the Model Food Act, it has made major modifications to its existing Food Act to align it with the model act. Amendments to update the New South Wales Act are ready for presentation to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory Food Act has been passed by the Legislative Assembly and is awaiting assent.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Australian Capital Territory, the Health Authority and the Attorney General's Department are developing an Ordinance derived from the Model Food Act. The date of completion of this is unknown.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Regulations, the NHMRC MFSRs are being redrafted into a format suitable for endorsement by Health Ministers and adoption by all States and Territories following gazettal before April 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. Monosodium glutamate is an approved food additive which may be added to foods other than infants' foods, where flavour or condiment may be added. No maximum level of use is specified.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) See 3.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) See 3.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) There is some evidence that a small sector of the community is hypersensitive to monosodium glutamate and can react adversely to large doses of the chemical. With respect to the majority of the community, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation/World Health Organisation Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives has studied the toxicology of monosodium glutamate and established an acceptable daily intake of 120 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. This is the amount which could be consumed every day over a lifetime without risk of adverse health effects.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Discussions regarding the Pacific Patrol Boat project have been held with Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Western Samoa, Tonga, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Tuvalu and Tonga. We have also consulted New Zealand on the project.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The design characteristics of the Pacific Patrol Boat were developed in consultation with all interested countries of the South Pacific Forum and the ASI 315 design represents a consensus of countries' views and requirements. Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Solomon Islands and Tonga expressed reservations about some of the required characteristics of the vessel and whether it would satisfy their perceived operational requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> These reservations were discussed with the countries concerned in the light of their proposed use of the vessel, operating cost penalties and the overall design philosophy. With the exception of Tonga, whose concept of surveillance operations is different to other countries in the region, all countries are now satisfied that the ASI 315 design will meet or exceed their requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Five countries have accepted our offer with firm requests for 8 boats.</PARA>
<PARA> PNG has requested four boats.</PARA>
<PARA> Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Western Samoa and the Cook Islands have requested one boat each.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, Fiji is now also participating in the pro- ject and is finalising details of the number of vessels it requires. Kiribati and Tuvalu have expressed interest in participating in the project, but are concerned about their ability to meet operating costs.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Tonga has advised that its maritime surveillance policy is centred around a fast reaction principle, involving aerial surveillance supported by patrol boats capable of at least 30 knots reacting to specific incidents, and has therefore declined our offer to participate.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Based on a usage rate of 1,200 hours per year operating costs (fuel, oil, amortised maintenance) for each vessel, would be in the order of $A100,000 per year at December 1985 prices. This figure could vary depending on the actual hours the vessel is underway per year and will vary from country to country, depending on the cost of fuel, oil, etc in each country. Inclusion of the crew salary, victuals and consumable stores components in the definition of operating costs would add an estimated $A100,000 per vessel per year to the running costs. This figure will also vary, depending on the cost of each item in individual countries.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Construction of the first vessel began in February 1986. The first vessel is planned to be handed over to Papua New Guinea in February 1987. Subsequent vessels will be delivered at about four monthly intervals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I announced the establishment of the Committee of Inquiry into Folklife in Australia on 26 March 1986; it is to report to me by 31 January 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Committee has now received written submissions from 114 individuals and 59 community-based organisations. A further 60 written submissions have been received from persons associated with tertiary institutions, and from Federal and State Government Departments and Authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Chairperson, Mr Hugh Anderson, is engaged as a consultant on a full-time basis, and is being paid a fee of $39,807. The other two Committee members, Mrs Gwenda Davey and Dr Keith McKenry, are engaged on a part-time basis, and neither is receiving any remun- eration in addition to their normal salary, although Ms Gwenda Davey's employer, the Footscray Institute of Technology, is receiving a payment of $13,302 to compensate for making her time available. Dr Keith McKenry is a Commonwealth employee and his costs are being absorbed by the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment. All three Committee members have their travel costs met from the Inquiry's budget. Mr Anderson and Dr McKenry receive the standard travel allowances for Senior Executive officers. Ms Davey receives travel allowances equivalent to those for a Third Division Officer of the Commonwealth Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Committee has no employees. Modest Secretariat support for the Committee is provided by the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment from within existing resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Nil. See (4) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) In Australia, despite determined efforts by institutions such as the National Library of Australia, there has been no co-ordinated, nationally-based program of folklife collection and documentation. Rather, these activities have largely been left to a comparatively few self-funded private individuals with specialised interests, whose activities often have been focused in specific geographic regions. Despite their invaluable work, major aspects of Australian folklife are poorly documented and understood. For example inadequate attention has been given to the folklife of women, of factory and other urban workers, and of communities from other than English speaking backgrounds. Also, there has been very little collection generally of folklife in some major geographic regions in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Material which has been collected often remains poorly indexed and uncatalogued, and thus is not generally available. In some cases this material has also deteriorated for want of proper storage and care.</PARA>
<PARA> Most national governments in Europe and North America have recognised the significance of folklife to their national heritage and have supported its collection and subsequent conservation on a professional basis for generations. At least 46 member countries of UNESCO have participated in that organisation's program on the safeguarding of folklore at a national and international level. This program, which commenced in 1973, has resulted in agreement on action governments might take to safeguard their folklore. Australia participated for the first time only in 1985, and has been slow to take action.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The Inquiry is co-sponsored by the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment, the Australia Council, the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> These bodies have allocated the Inquiry a total budget of $152,000, exclusive of Secretariat costs mentioned in (4) above from within existing resources of the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is assumed that the estimates of ``annual inflows and outflows of insurance payments for Australia'' referred to by the honourable member relate to the total value of premiums paid and claims received on general insurance business placed by Australian residents with foreign residents and premiums received and claims paid on general insurance business placed by non-residents with Australian residents. Broad information collected by the ABS for purposes of compiling balance of payments statistics suggest that the total value of such premiums and claims would be considerably less than $2,800 million in 1985-86.</PARA>

<PARA>1,193</PARA>
<PARA>1,726</PARA>
<PARA>533</PARA>
<PARA>(*) `Insurance services n.e.c.' includes general insurance and life insurance (although the contribution of life insurance is very small). It excludes marine insurance which is classified as part of `Shipment'. The measure of insurance services provided abroad (credits) is premiums received less claims paid. The measure of insurance services received from abroad is premiums paid less claims received.</PARA>
<PARA>(a) The above table shows that, in 1985-86, insurance services provided abroad (credits) were not as large as shipment, other transportation or travel services provided abroad (credits). Similarly, insurance services received from abroad (debits) were not as large as shipment, other transportation or travel services received from abroad (debits).</PARA>
<PARA>(b) In 1985-86, the deficit (net result) on insurance services was significantly less than the deficits on shipment, travel and other services; the `other transportation' component recorded a surplus.</PARA>
<PARA>(c) The ABS collects data on international transactions in insurance, as well as data on transportation, travel and other services, for the purpose of compiling estimates for inclusion in balance of payments statistics. There are several other statistical collections of varying content and detail, relating to transportation, travel, insurance and other services conducted by the ABS and other bodies such as the Australian Tourist Commission and the Insurance Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The sources that the ABS uses in compiling insurance estimates in the balance of payments are taxation data and annual surveys of foreign investment. While details of gross premiums and claims relating to international insurance flows are not available, analysis of information from these sources suggests that, in 1985-86, the `annual inflows and outflows of insurance payments for Australia' would have been considerably less than the amount estimated by the Australian Insurance Association.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government recognises the need for close consultation with the insurance industry and maintains regular formal and informal contact with industry bodies and individual company representatives. The matter raised by the honourable member has been discussed during such consultations, both at the Ministerial and official level and the Government is always receptive to constructive proposals designed to improve out external trade and service balances. In this connection, I note that the Prime Minister announced recently that the Commonwealth, with the objective of removing impediments to the writing of marine insurance in Australia had decided to remove stamp duty on contracts of international marine insurance written in the ACT and that he has written to the State Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory advising them of the Commonwealth's decision and requesting their co-operation in removing the duty Australia-wide.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) In a decision given on 1 June 1983 the Security Appeals Tribunal (SAT) concluded that the CPA was not subversive within the meaning of the definition of subversion in s.5 (1) (a) of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1979 (as the Act then stood) and that mere membership of the CPA would not justify an adverse security assessment by ASIO. The definition of subversion in s.5 (1) (a) referred to activities that involve, will involve or lead to, or are intended or likely ultimately to involve or lead to, the use of force or violence or other unlawful acts for the purpose of overthrowing or destroying the constitutional government of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Security Intelligence Organization Amendment Act 1986 (which came into operation on 1 February 1987) repealed s.5 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1979. Amongst other things, the term `subversion' is now deleted from the definition of `security' in favour of a concept of `politically motivated violence'. This covers the matters previously contained in the definition of `terrorism' and a more precisely defined and limited version of the matters previously covered by `subversion'. The matters previously covered by s.5 (1) (a) are now covered by a reference to acts that involve violence or are intended or are likely to involve or lead to violence and are directed to overthrowing or destroying, or assisting in the overthrow or destruction of, the government or the constitutional system of government of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The responsibility for deciding whether to allow officers access to national security information lies with the head of each agency. ASIO assists the agency by furnishing security assessments. A security assessment expresses ASIO's recommendation, advice or opinion. Security procedures require the agency head to be satisfied on the basis of all availale information, including the ASIO assessment, that the person concerned is reliable and trustworthy. In considering whether to grant a security clearance, an agency head is not restricted to the requirements of security as that term is defined in the ASIO Act; for example, he or she may have regard to personal qualities, such as honesty, discretion, or loyalty.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It has been the established practice of successive Australian Governments to neither confirm nor deny the activities of ASIO. However, the SAT in the decision referred to in (1) above, pointed out that its decision did not and could not in any way affect the exercise of ASIO's functions, under s.17 of its Act, to obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to security.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="79" SPEAKER="Uren The Hon T." NAMEID="EE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="MURRAY">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EE4">Mr Uren</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) On 15 December 1985, the Project Director (Second Sydney Airport), Department of Aviation visited the Sydney office of my Department to discuss the anticipated announcement of a selected site for a second Sydney airport. Discussions revolved around the requirement for planning controls, the method of acquisition and resources. There had been consultation between the Department of Aviation and my Department on the generality of the project during the planning and environmental assessment phase prior to that time.</PARA>
<PARA> (2), (3) and (4) Given that any actual airport development (and therefore any need for physical possession of properties) was at least 5 years and probably 10 years away it was indicated that my Department would propose to respond to requests from affected landowners for acquisition of their properties rather than engage in an aggressive campaign of acquisition.</PARA>
<PARA> At a meeting on 3 March 1986 the 1986-87 budgetary allocation was first discussed. My Department provided some preliminary estimates for acquisition costs. The estimate provided for 1986-87 was $9.5m on the assumption that about 20 per cent of landowners (i.e. about 50) would seek to sell immediately.</PARA>
<PARA> By April 1986 a significant number of property owners had sought a valuation of their property although very few of those had indicated a firm desire to sell immediately. By 8 April my Department advised the Department of Aviation that the rate of acceptance by owners of offers made by the Commonwealth was increasing. During Budget considerations, Government decided to acquire in 1986-87 only those properties where the Commonwealth had already made a firm offer to purchase and for those cases where owners had entered into a commitment to purchase a replacement property on or before 25 July 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> In late July and early August, the number of property owners wishing to sell increased dramatically. This coincided with speculation in the press over the lack of certainty about the timing of actual airport development and speculation over a possible limit on available funds in both the 1986-87 and ensuing financial years.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The $9.5m allocation will enable the purchase of 50 properties. Settlement of the purchases of these 50 properties is expected to be completed by February 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) 71 Commonwealth valuations had been completed and 21 private valuations had been received, prior to withdrawal (on 26 August 1986) of the offer to pay the cost of private valuations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth valuation program is being maintained and landowners are being advised of the results of valuations as they are completed to assist them with longer term planning. Valuations are current only for a limited period and would need to be reviewed at the time that acquisition of the property was to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) There have been differences between Private and Commonwealth valuations. These have been up to 15% but mostly of the order of 10% which is more or less normal in commercial practice. Where there are differences the Commonwealth valuer is asked to review his valuation in the light of the Private valuation. In these instances the Commonwealth valuer usually contacts the Private valuer to seek out reasons for the difference. Where the private valuer produces evidence of which the Commonwealth valuer was not aware, and which is material evidence for valuation purposes, or if other reasonable grounds are advanced to indicate the Commonwealth valuer was low in his estimate then the official valuation is increased. An increased offer is then made to the landowner.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) In those cases where my Department will not now be able to acquire properties this financial year, the offer to pay for a privately commissioned valuation was withdrawn for the time being. This action was taken to ensure the most effective use of the limited funds available and to ensure that the private valuation obtained by the property owner would be current at the time of negotiation for sale of the property to the Commonwealth. (The Commonwealth is prepared to pay the cost of only one private valuation for each property).</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Commonwealth valuers employed in the Valuation Branch, Australian Taxation Office, Department of the Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) Commonwealth valuers employed in the Australian Taxation Office are professionally qualified. Each valuer has completed an approved course of study (at degree or diploma level), and is eligible for Associate membership of the Australian Institute of Valuers.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) The Real Estate Valuers Registration Board did contact the Australian Taxation Office about its policy on the registration of valuer personnel. The Attorney-General's Department advised that valuers working in the Australian Taxation Office are not required to be registered under the Valuers Registration Act 1975 (NSW).</PARA>
<PARA> (12) No decisions have been made on the level of funding beyond 1987/88.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) Revised Lands Acquisition legislation is at an advanced stage of drafting. It is intended that the draft legislation be tabled for public discussion in the not too distant future. In the meantime it is inappropriate to speculate on what the Parliament may decide upon.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) See (13).</PARA>
<PARA> (15) The Government has limited the funds available in 1986/87 to $9.5m to acquire those properties where the Commonwealth had already made a firm offer to purchase and for those cases where owners had entered into a commitment to purchase a replacement property on or before 25 July 1986. Requests are being received from owners who do not fall into these categories, seeking purchase of their property on the grounds of hardship. These cases are being considered on their merits and are to be referred to the Government as additional requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) See (15).</PARA>
<PARA> (17) In consultation with my Department and the Department of Aviation, the New South Wales Department of Environment and Planning is finalising details of planning controls to be imposed over the site. A draft State Environmental Planning Policy has been prepared by the Department of Environment and Planning. Further consultations are proposed before the Planning Policy is implemented.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) See (17).</PARA>
<PARA> (19) It is understood that the New South Wales Department of Environment and Planning has prepared a Macarthur Regional Environmental Study and it is considering submissions in relation to that study. The study deals with matters around the site such as access and potential noise contours. It is generally independent of the State Environmental Planning Policy, which specifically addresses development controls within the site and the height of structures in the surrounding area.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the intention of the Department of Environment and Planning to prepare a Macarthur Regional Environmental Plan in due course after considering submissions on the Study and after further consultations with the Local Government authorities and the Commonwealth-particularly the Department of Aviation in relation to development of the airport. Planning controls are initiated by the State in consultation with the Commonwealth and future planning is a State responsibility.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question in regard to the industries covered by his portfolio:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is not possible to quantify the real percentage increase in the level of protection to local industries due to the devaluation of the Australian dollar. The impact varies from industry to industry and depends upon not only the existing level of assistance but also on a number of other factors. These include the effect of the devaluation on input costs for both imported and domestically produced goods; higher freight, insurance, and interest payments; and the flow on of higher prices to wages. These factors reduce the competitive boost to industry from the depreciation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The widening of the current account deficit as a result of the terms of trade collapse has disguised a significant improvement in export and import volumes. In the first three quarters of 1986 the volume of imports fell by 2.2 per cent compared with the same period a year earlier while the volume of exports rose by 3.3 per cent. For 1985-86 as a whole, export volumes increased by 7.1 per cent while imports increased by only 9.0 per cent. Further benefits to the trade account are expected as Australian industries adjust to their new competitive position.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Local industry has been subject to direct price increases for the imported goods it uses due to the devaluation. In 1985-86 as a whole import prices rose by 13.7 per cent. Imported capital goods increased in price by 21.3 per cent, intermediate goods by 8.6 per cent and consumption goods by 18.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The extent of cost increases resulting from the depreciation has been limited by the willingness of overseas producers and importers to absorb some of the currency movement. Import prices have not increased as much as would at first be indicated by the depreciation.</PARA>
<PARA> The depreciation has led to some increase in the rate of domestic inflation. The ABS has estimated that in the September quarter 1986, for example, the direct effect of price rises for goods wholly or predominantly imported and of petroleum products was 0.66 percentage points of the 2.6. per cent rise in the Consumer Price Index.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) It is not possible to quantify the net effect of the devaluation, nor is it possible to explain (with any certainty) trade volume improvements solely in terms of the devaluation.</PARA>
<PARA> As noted above there has been an improvement in trade volumes. This reflects the impact of the devaluation but the slowdown in economic activity is also likely to have had a moderating effect on the volume of imports.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact on Australia's economy of Australian aid to Papua New Guinea, although I can make some general observations about the size of Australia's aid to the country in relation to Australia/PNG trade and investment generally.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1986/87 Australia will provide $328.2 million in aid to Papua New Guinea principally in the form of budget support. This represents around 28 percent of Papua New Guinea's budget resources. Australia's exports to Papua New Guinea totalled $558 million in 1985/86 while Australian imports from Papua New Guinea for this period totalled $174 million. After taking into account invisible earnings, this represents a trade imbalance of 5:1 in Australia's favour. In addition Papua New Guinea is Australia's third largest overseas investment base.</PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, it is reasonable to assume that the Papua New Guinea Government would continue to draw on Australian budget support to finance its imports from Australia which in turn would have a beneficial although small impact on the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA> The 1986/87 aid program to Papua New Guinea also includes an amount totalling $10.5 million for projects, training (including the contribution to the education of Papua New Guinea students in Australia) and technical assistance. This is an increase on expenditure in previous years, reflecting an increased emphasis on this form of aid within the overall arrangements between the two governments. In developing this program in accordance with Papua New Guinea priorities, the Australian Government is seeking to maximise the use of Australian goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) About 91 per cent of bilateral aid expenditure in 1985-86, excluding aid to Papua New Guinea, was spent on goods and services sourced from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Detailed information is not available on the proportion of all multilateral aid spent on Australian-sourced goods and services. In the case of the Australian funds supplied to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, however, an average of about 65 per cent has returned to Australia for the purchase of goods and services.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr Peter Morris</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government has identified and declared a system of roads comprising four categories for the purposes of Federal funding. These categories are: national roads, urban arterial roads, rural arterial roads, and local roads. However, there is no direct comparison between the Federal road categories and the State classification of roads in Victoria. For example some two thirds of ``unclassified roads'' fall into the Federal category of local roads and the balance are arterial roads. Federal funding for arterial roads in Victoria has increased from $106.1 million in 1985-86 to $106.8 million in 1986-87 while the local roads allocation has increased from $52.0 million to $52.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that ``unclassified roads'' is only a State category. No published information is available on funds allocated to this category in 1986-87 by the Victorian Government.

<PARA> (2) No. While care is taken in assigning frequencies, there is no assurance in the assignment of any frequency that the licensee will be able to use it free from interference. Interference may be substantial or minor and may be as a result of sources within Australia or from overseas. Heli-Muster Pty Ltd were assigned frequencies 5059.5 kHz, 9307.5 kHz, 10184.5 kHz and 15675.5 kHz for a point to point fixed service. They were also assigned the frequencies 3705.5 kHz and 6861.5 kHz for an aeronautical mobile service.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. The frequency 5059.5 kHz is shared with a number of other enterprises which include an Aboriginal community based at Tennant Creek.</PARA>
<PARA> Only a limited number of frequencies are available to provide communication over long distances. In view of the heavy demand for high frequency communication and the shortage of suitable frequencies, the use of most high frequencies is on a shared basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As outlined in (2) above the frequency 5059.5 kHz was assigned to Heli-Muster Pty Ltd for a point to point fixed service. The use of this frequency by them for aeronautical mobile operations contravenes the conditions of the licence and is an offence under section 25 (1) ((a)) of the Radiocommunications Act 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> Heli-Muster Pty Ltd should use the frequencies 3705.5 kHz and 6861.5 kHz for their aeronautical mobile service.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr Peter Morris</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In 1985, there were 183 958 landings and take-offs at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airpot, by aircraft other than helicopters. This level of use results in some traffic delays in peak periods. Using 1984 cost information the loss to all users including airlines is estimated to total between $9m and $10m per annum. This estimate is for aircraft operating costs, and excludes consideration of the delay costs to passengers and costs of airline schedule disruption.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Delay costs cannot in practice be eliminated at any airport as there remains the probability of more than one aircraft planning to use the airport at the same time, in which case one will take precedence, and the others will be delayed. The challenge is not to attempt to eliminate delays, but to properly manage airport congestion so that the cost of delay does not exceed the benefits of additional services scheduled during peak periods. At Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport a priority system operates which generally accords preference of use to scheduled over non-scheduled services, and this has proven effective during the period it has been applied. The options for management of peak traffic have been improved by the selection of the second airport site at Badgerys Creek and the efficiency of traffic movement is being enhanced by the taxiway improvement works currently in progress.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Two large longliners owned by a South Australian company have fished off the east coast and, I understand, have taken marlin, mainly striped marlin, and other billfish in addition to their principal target-tunas. The fish was transhipped in Eden, New South Wales to a Japanese carrier vessel for transport to the Japanese sashimi market.</PARA>
<PARA> I have no knowledge of its being processed in Australia, apart from gilling and gutting aboard the catcher boats, nor of its being marketed as tuna. I am advised that striped marlin on the Japanese sashimi market averaged $A7.50 per kilogram in 1985/86 and that marlin does not make a suitable canning product. Consequently I doubt that there would have been either the opportunity or the intention to use marlin take for canning.</PARA>
<PARA> Although marketing of fish in Australia is generally the responsibility of the State and Territory Governments I would be concerned if marlin were being misrepresented as tuna and I instructed my Department to consult with the fisheries and health authorities in New South Wales and Queensland. As the vessels are South Australian owned and given the availability of canning facilities in that State my Department made similar enquiries of South Australia. The Department of Primary Industry, as a result of those enquiries, found no indication that marlin was being canned and sold as tuna.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) New South Wales legislation prohibits the commercial taking of marlin in State waters and its marketing in New South Wales. Marlin taken beyond State waters may be marketed subject to adherence to the requirements of the New South Wales Pure Food Act which sets the permissible mercury level at 0.5 milligrams per kilogram. Inspectors sample marlin offered for sale and if that level is exceeded the fish is destroyed and the vendor is liable to prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland legislation does not ban specifically the sale of marlin but under its Food Standards Regulations 1982 the permissible level of mercury for fish is 0.5 milligrams per kilogram. The South Australian Food Act 1985 prohibits the sale of fish in any form with a mercury content in excess of one milligram per kilogram. Also it is illegal to represent marlin as tuna.</PARA>
<PARA> The questions raised by the honourable member are related mainly to the responsibilities of the State and Territory Government. Should it be established that marlin is being misrepresented as tuna then I would certainly bring it to the attention of the responsible Ministers.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Sections 23 (g) (iii) and 23 (g) (iv) of the Income Tax Assessment Act provide for exemption from income tax of a society, association or club which is not carried on for profit or gain to its individual members and is established for, or has as its predominant activity, the encouragement or promotion either of an athletic game or sport in which humans are the sole participants or of animal races. Pony clubs, motor sports clubs and many other sporting clubs do not satisfy the criteria for those specific exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, as with non-profit clubs and associations generally, pony clubs do receive favourable treatment under the income tax law. They are free from tax on income received from members under the `principle of mutuality'. This principle recognises that members of an association, society or club do not make a profit from dealing collectively amongst themselves. Therefore, such organisations only pay tax on income from investments and from trading with non-members. In addition, a tax-free threshold of $4,416 per annum applies in determining tax payable. This threshold is phased out over the income range $416 to $2,542.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Pony clubs have not been singled out for discriminatory income tax treatment. The tax treatment of pony clubs remains unchanged, as it has for many years. Indeed, many other types of sports and games clubs are also not covered by specific exemption provisions. These include clubs such as motor racing clubs, motor boat racing clubs, aero and aerobatics clubs, and equestrian clubs generally. The Section 23 exemptions referred to above also do not cover non-profit clubs and associations established for predominantly social purposes such as RSL clubs, clubs serving ethnic groups, workers' clubs etc., as well as sporting clubs whose predominant activities are judged to be the provision of amenities for their members rather than the promotion of an athletic sport or game.</PARA>
<PARA> Any extension of the exemptions, to pony clubs or others, would make it extremely difficult for the Government to refuse the numerous calls for similar exemptions that have been received from bodies representing other sports not presently receiving exemption and from non-profit clubs and associations generally. Such a development could have substantial budgetary consequences, which could not be contemplated in the current economic environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 18 November 1986:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is it a fact that between one third and one half of residents of Tallaganda Shire, NSW will lose, or experience a reduction in, their television reception when Channels WIN 4 and ABC 5A, Wollongong, convert to broadcasting in the UHF band.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What steps are being taken by the Government to ensure that the residents of Tallaganda Shire do not suffer the loss of existing television services.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="91" SPEAKER="Duffy The Hon M.J." NAMEID="6G4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GOLDSTEIN">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. It is true that some residents of the Tallaganda Shire, who presently obtain long distance reception of WIN-4 and ABC-5A from Wollongong, will lose that very marginal reception when these stations cease their VHF transmissions early in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) While part of the Tallaganda Shire lies within the Service Area of CTC-7 Canberra, much of the Shire falls within the Service Area for the South East Remote Commercial Television Service (RCTS) and is not within the Service Areas of either WIN Wollongong or CTC Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from a few settlements, most of the Shire is sparsely populated and consists of terrain that is difficult to effectively serve by terrestrial means. Television viewers in these areas generally have patchy reception which is, at best, of marginal quality. The new UHF transmitters in Wollongong are not designed to serve these residents, who live well outside the stations' service area.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, CTC Canberra has recently undertaken to provide a new UHF translator to serve the township of Braidwood. As a result of the CTC decision, at least half the Shire's total population will shortly obtain access to high quality reception of CTC's programs and, under the Government's equalisation program, their choice will increase to include three commercial television services over the next few years. This will be a major improvement over the poor quality fortuitous reception they currently enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA> It is residents in the sparsely populated eastern half of the Shire who are most likely to be affected when Channels 4 and 5A switch to UHF in January 1989. By purchasing domestic satellite earth stations (costing approximately $2500) they will gain access to the high quality RCTS and ABC Homestead and Community Broadcasting Satellite Service (HACBSS) television and radio services, which again will provide vastly superior reception compared with their present marginal reception of distant stations.</PARA>
<PARA> With few exceptions, viewers living within WIN's formal Service Area will have access to high quality reception from the new terrestrial UHF transmissions-provided they install UHF receiving equipment. In most cases, their UHF reception will be noticeably superior to existing reception of VHF stations.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr Lionel Bowen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is not correct to say that the ASRB has been accepting, virtually without amendment, standards prepared by the Australian Accounting Research Foundation. Before approving a proposed accounting standard the ASRB has to consider whether:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the information generated by application of a proposed standard is relevant to informed decision making and discharges directors' accountability in a manner consistent with community requirements and expectations;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the proposed standard is well formulated and logically derived;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the proposed standard is consistent with approved accounting standards; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the proposed standard is practicable (for some or all companies) having regard to the commercial and economic consequences which might flow from its implementation.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that, as a result of applying the above criteria to the proposed standards submitted by the AARF, the ASRB has had to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) substantially re-draft most of the proposed standards;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) reject one proposed standard and a substantial proportion of another proposed standard because the content was not considered to be correct; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) limit the application of some standards in order to avoid imposing onerous disclosure requirements on smaller companies.</PARA>
<PARA> 2 (a) My answer to part (3) of question No. 3798 does not indicate that the ASRB is contemplating abandoning historical cost accounting. I understand that, for the foreseeable future, historical cost accounting will remain the principal method of accounting. However, this would not prevent the ASRB from monitoring the development of other methods of accounting, such as current cost accounting.</PARA>
<PARA> 2 (b) World-wide interest in the various methods of accounting for the effects of changing prices (of which current cost accounting is one example) has, for the past decade or so, waxed and waned depending on the rates of inflation in major western countries. Consequently, with today's lower rates of inflation, it is true to say that there is now less interest in current cost accounting than there was some years ago. Some work is still being undertaken on current cost accounting, although it seems that such information may be used to supplement accounts prepared on an historical cost basis rather than replace them.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. The ASRB has established a Working Party to consider the work involved in a transfer of disclosure requirements from Schedule 7 to approved accounting standards. However, the Ministerial Council has not yet received the Working Party's report on either the magnitude of the task or a time table setting out the period over which the transfer is to be achieved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) As stated in Section 8.5.1. of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Second Sydney Airport Site Selection Programme, the principal basis for selecting the chosen runway alignment was its lesser noise impact on people in surrounding areas.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes, numerous runway alignments were considered and the preference of planners changed during the course of the study as more data became available. The three principal alignments considered are depicted in Fig 8.2 of the EIS. Several factors are also very important in the selection of runway alignments, e.g. wind direction, topography of the site and obstacles such as high ground in the flight path. However, as stated previously, the principal factor in the case of Badgerys Creek was the desire to minimise the potential noise nuisance.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A north/south alignment would have affected mainly the rural areas of Cobbitty, Greendale, Bringelly and Orchid Hills. The total noise affected population within the 20 ANEF contour for this alignment was potentially 4380 persons. The north east/south west alignment, the one selected, will affect mainly the rural areas of Silverdale, Greendale, and Kemps Creek and a small residential area of Horsley Park. The total potentially noise affected population within the 20 ANEF contour for this selected alignment is 1951 persons.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The sales tax exemption for plans and plan printing materials used for construction was formerly contained in Item 113F of the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. The First Schedule sets out sales tax exemptions. The previous Government removed Item 113F from the First Schedule with effect from 1 January 1983 and at the same time inserted the goods concerned into Item 7 of the Third Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. This resulted in such plans and plan printing materials being taxable at 7.5 per cent. Subsequently the Third Schedule 7.5 per cent sales tax rate was increased generally to 10 per cent as a result of this Government's tax reform package. In the 1986 Budget, Item 7 of the Third Schedule to the Act was repealed, resulting in the applicable tax rate being increased from the Third Schedule 10 per cent rate to the general rate of 20 per cent.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr Peter Morris</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Resolution 6 of the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue 1979 invites the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to develop a Future Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (FGMDSS) to replace the current marine safety communications system. Part of the distress alerting element of FGMDSS involves the use of Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs). These beacons are detected and located by polar orbiting satellites of the current COSPAS/SARSAT system which will be integrated into FGMDSS. In early 1986, at the 52nd meeting of the Maritime Safety Committee of IMO, the Committee determined that the 406 MHz frequency would be used for float free EPIRBs operating as part of the COSPAS/SARSAT element of FGMDSS. The formal incorporation of the FGMDSS requirements into the Safety of Life at Sea Convention and the determining of an official implementation date will be decided at a Diplomatic Conference, scheduled during 1988. President indications are that FGMDSS equipment is likely to be fitted to those ships built after mid 1991, with full implementation for all ships in 1997. However, in anticipation of the introduction of FGMDSS some vessels are already carrying 406 MHz beacons on a voluntary or trial basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The 406 MHz frequency offers several advantages over the 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz frequencies currently used: the most important being that 406 MHz is a frequency subject to much less radio interference and signal distortion. As a result the receiving COSPAS/SARSAT satellite can more quickly process the 406 MHz EPIRB signal and more accurately determine the beacon's position. This also allows 406 MHz EPIRBs to have built into them the ability to transmit to the satellite vital information, such as the vessel call sign and nature of the emergency, which is then stored by the satellite and transmitted to the next available ground station when it comes ``into view''. For a distress alert from the 121.5/243 MHz EPIRB to be received by a ground station it is necessary for both the station and EPIRB to be ``inview'' of the satellite at the same time; the satellite cannot store information from these types of EPIRB for later transmission to a ground station.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The two aeronautical distress frequencies of 121.5 MHz for civil aviation and 243.0 MHz for military aviation have also been authorised for use in marine EPRIBs. The continued use of these frequencies by aircraft is primarily a decision for the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). ICAO has not indicated any change of plans for the future use of these two frequencies.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The partners to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) covering the space and ground segments of the COSPAS/SARSAT system are the U.S.A., U.S.S.R., Canada and France. Certain other countries have installed the ground segment designated a Local User Terminal (LUT) and these include the U.K., Norway, Brazil, Bulgaria and Finland. The internationalisation of the COSPAS/SARSAT system and how it can be integrated into FGMDSS is currently the subject of negotiations between the MOU Partners and INMARSAT. Whilst Australia has no plans at this time to be involved with the space segment of the system, consideration is being given to the cost/benefit of acquiring one or more LUTs for detection and location of marine and aviation EPIRBs in the Australian search and rescue area.</PARA>

<PARA> Passed the relevant theory examinations</PARA>
<PARA> Acquired the prescribed amount of aeronautical experience, including at least 500 hours aeronautical experience on Australian regular public transport aeroplanes (or such other experience as the Secretary may accept as equivalent)</PARA>
<PARA> Demonstrated his ability to perform prescribed manoeuvres in an aeroplane which meets the performance standards prescribed for airline aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Australian airlines train pilots to qualify for the APTL only in the sense that they train them to operate the aeroplanes used by the airline, provide a means whereby candidates for the first-class ATPL (ie a captain's licence) can achieve 500 hours in Australian airline aircraft and provide a vehicle for the proficiency test. It is now highly unusual for an airline to employ a pilot who is not already qualified in respect of theory examinations and all facets of the prescribed aeronautical experience except the one dealing with experience in Australian airline operations. Airline training consists of training on the type of aircraft upon which the pilot is to be employed. Company check pilots are authorised to carry out the flight test which is required before an ATPL may be issued.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) In Australia there is no aviation activity other than airline operations which requires the practitioner to hold an ATPL. However, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has recommended that the Senior Commercial Pilot Licence should be discarded, and Australia, as an IACO signatory, is examining that proposal. Should it be adopted, then the field of application of the ATPL would be expanded.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Mr Taylor, an Australian citizen, held a licence issued by a foreign country but that licence was not acceptable to the licensing authority of a third country where he sought employment. In order to facilitate that employment Mr Taylor sought an Australian ATPL on the basis of his foreign qualification, notwithstanding that it had already been rejected as equivalent by the third country. Contrary to the honourable member's information, Mr L. G. Taylor did not possess the appropriate qualifications for the issue of a first-class ATPL. Specifically, he had not completed the flight proficiency test to the satisfaction of an authorised examiner, although every effort was made by the Department to facilitate the conduct of such a test. In the circumstances there was no substantive reason to issue him with an Australian licence, particularly as the assessment of his foreign qualification was shared by at least the country in which he sought employment.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) At a meeting with representatives of the Australian Pork Producers Federation and the Australian Veterinary Association on 10 November 1986, I asked that representatives of industry, the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) and my Department examine the feasibility and desirability of undertaking the trials at AAHL. I have asked that the group report back to me within 2 months so that I may determine whether to proceed with the trials or not.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In establishing the group to report back to me on this matter, I have stipulated that any proposal to carry out trials must ensure that the trials are designed in such a way as to provide results which will add to the current knowledge on the transmission of transmissible gastroenteritis in pigmeat. The trials must have pre-determined objectives and the experimental protocols must be such that the results can be meaningfully interpreted. If agreement can be reached within the group then I will examine the proposal and, should I believe that the work will assist me to make a more informed judgment on this issue I will have the research proceed. If not I will decide on the basis of available information.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) During my discussions with industry leaders on the quarantine aspects of the Canadian request for access to the Australian market for uncooked pigmeat some economic issues were raised. I have made it quite clear, however, that this Government will not use quarantine restrictions to give economic protection to industries. As a country which depends for its economic well being on agricultural trade, Australia would be a net loser if quarantine barriers were erected or maintained to provide no-tariff assistance to rural industries.</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the leaders of the pig industry appreciate the need for a strong stand by the Australian Government on this issue and are also aware of the appropriate courses of action available if the industry's viability is threatened by dumped or subsidised imports.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Investigations undertaken in Australia and New Zealand indicate that the Australian and US isolates of Septoria belong to one and the same species. However US authorities feel that further investigations are necessary to confirm this. Currently US and Australian plant pathologists are collaborating on definitive research which is expected to be completed by mid 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Australian view is that the disease in the two countries is caused by one species of Septoria is based on microscopic examination of specimens. This view has been confirmed by cultural, morphological and biochemical tests conducted recently by the Victorian Department of Agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There are no sound scientific reasons to suspend importation of US citrus because of Septoria. Imports from Florida area prohibited for a different reason. In August 1984 citrus canker was detected in that state and a prohibition was immediately imposed to prevent introduction of this serious disease.</PARA>
<PARA> I should mention that Septoria spot is not the only reason for the US prohibition on entry of Australian citrus. Black spot and Australian citrus scab are not present in the US and are additional reasons for the US prohibition.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Agreement relating to the establishment of the Joint Defence Space Research Facility at Pine Gap was signed on 9 December 1966. The agreement did not require Australian ratification, and does not expire in 1987. I refer the honourable member to the answer to question no. 48 given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 31 May 1985, Hansard, page 3268.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The agreement did not require ratification by the US Congress. It entered into force for both Parties on signature and is equally binding on both Parties.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. The Facility is operated by the two Governments through the Australian Department of Defence and the United States Department of Defence as co-operating agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) TRW and E-Systems perform certain designated functions at the Facility under contract to the US Department of Defense. As is appropriate for an equal cooperating partner, Australian Government concurrence is required for all activities at the Facility, including those conducted by contractors. I am satisfied that the consultative and organisational arrangements in place, and the extensive involvement of Australian Department of Defence personnel in all levels of the management and operation of Pine Gap, ensure that the Australian Government is fully informed of all activities at the Facility.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes. Relevant Ministers and senior members of the Opposition are fully briefed on all aspects of the operations of the Facility. I am satisfied that all briefed Ministers understand those operations clearly.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) &amp; (7) On 6 June 1984, the Prime Minister explained to Parliament the general purpose of the joint defence facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar. He said that among the functions performed are the provision of early warning by receiving from space satellites information about missile launches, and the provision of information about the occurence of nuclear explosions.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Searches of records in the Departments of Defence, Foreign Affairs, and Prime Minister and Cabinet have not revealed any evidence that such a request was made.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7J4">Mr Scott</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 30 April 1986:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Will the Government direct that no further promotion of food irradiation be undertaken until a federal public inquiry is held; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is it a fact that the irradiation of food reduces the need to use insecticides, such as halogenated hydrocarbons, and other chemcials such as ethylene oxide; if so, does the Government expect food irradiation to be encouraged at State level.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Does the Government accept the need for a federal regulatory agency to set standards and to protect the environment and public health from hazards such as radioactive substances, radioactive waste and hazardous chemicals; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Does the Government accept the criticisms made by J. Braithwaite and P. Grabosky in `Occupational Health and Safety Enforcement in Australia' that State health departments rarely prosecute for infringements of radiation standards and that Government checking of exposure levels is aimed more at a diagnostic service to licensees with problems than at policing the integrity of their self-monitoring; if so, does this policy inevitably allow hazardous exposures to occur.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="110" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HINDMARSH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr Blewett</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Government has not been involved in promoting food irradiation. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) recently recommended to the States and Territories a Model Food Standards Regulation for the Irradation of Food.</PARA>
<PARA> To allow adequate debate regarding the implications of food irradiation and also because of particular concerns raised by consumers, I have contracted with the Australian Consumers Association (ACA) to conduct a consumer inquiry to examine the impact of food irradiation on consumer health and the environment, and the cost of food irradiation to consumers. The ACA is to present its report to me by March 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> I have also asked State Health Ministers to take no action on food irradiation until the report from the ACA is available.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. As far as I am aware, only Queensland has so far shown an interest in this process.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A number of federal bodies are already involved in setting standards for the protection of public health, the workplace and the environment from hazardous agents. These include the National Health and Medical Research Council, Worksafe Australia, the Australian Environment Council and the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment which administers the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act 1978. Standards, recommendations and codes of practice are prepared by these bodies, with State and Territory consultation, and these are made available for use by the States and Territories in their legislative programs to control these substances. Legislation to establish a National Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme is being prepared by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I am advised that such criticisms have been made. The approach to implementation of regulations and law enforcement by a regulatory authority in relation to radiation standards is dependent on the perceived risks to health arising in any given situation.</PARA>
<PARA> Law enforcement is appropriate where the health of an individual is likely to be immediately affected due to non-compliance with specified safety requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> Law enforcement is also appropriate in those situations where prescribed protective facilities have not been provided and prescribed work procedures have not been instituted or followed and where continuance of those situations could demonstrably lead to prescribed exposure limits being exceeded.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The statutory responsibility for the listing and deleting of PBS items rests with the PBAC. Occasionally the PBAC has sought technical advice from the NHMRC. Records indicate that such advice was sought on five occasions regarding four matters since 1976: February 1986-listing of tobramycin eye preparations; August 1985 and December 1984-listing of tetracycline and doxycycline used in treatment of non-specific gonococcal infection; June 1985-penicillin listing, and October 1982-netilmicin and metronidazole listing.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) When and why did his Department discontinue the practice of accepting the US air transport pilots' licence as an equivalent to the Australian senior commercial pilots' licence without the need for additional requirements to be met.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="111" SPEAKER="Morris The Hon P.F." NAMEID="HI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="MURRAY">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr Peter Morris</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honour- able member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) All information concerning the granting of licence dispensations to individual overseas pilot licence holders is maintained on that individual's Flight Crew Licence History File. This would include the original applications, copies of any correspondence and the decision advised to the applicant.</PARA>
<PARA> Information concerning the formulation of policy in this area is contained in policy files held in Central Office. Internal guidance to Departmental officers implementing the policy is provided in the Department's ``Flying Operations Instructions''.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The HP3000 computer network recently implemented by my Department services a number of complex systems and has limited capacity available for each individual system. The flight crew licensing systems include, for example, details of the level of qualification held and its expiry date. It was not considered practicable to maintain information concerning the basis on which the licence was issued.</PARA>
<PARA> However a Licensing, Aircraft Registration and Publications (LARP) project team is currently developing proposals for changes in these areas, including use of the Department's new high capacity General Computing Network (GCN).</PARA>
<PARA> At this stage it is anticipated that details of exemptions from departmental requirements on the basis of overseas qualifications will be included in the data base. However the LARP team has not yet finalised its proposals or timetables for implementation of its recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The change of policy followed a review which showed that the written examinations for issue of either the Canadian ATPL or the US Air Transport Pilot Certificate are significantly less searching than Australian SCPL examinations. However it is recognised that practical commercial operating experience in the USA could lead to an equivalent standard through the influence of airline training organisations. Since 19 June 1975 the US Air Transport Pilot Certificate has not been recognised as the equivalent of the Australian Senior Commercial Pilot Licence unless the holder of the Certificate has made significant use of the qualification. ``Significant use'' means at least 200 hours pilot-in-command on heavy aircraft on scheduled commercial operations.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EV4">Mr Young</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) AFP members, in possession of a warrant issued under Section 10 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914, visited the home of Mrs Sellenthin on Wednesday 22 October.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Force was used to enter the premises as the occupants, clearly present in the lounge room, refused to admit the police and because the police had information that a wanted police suspect was on the premises and that he was armed and prepared to shoot to avoid apprehension.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Seven.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) All members were armed with their police issue service revolvers. In addition, two of the members carried single barrel shotguns.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) None of the occupants was threatened at gunpoint. However, police were informed that an armed offender could be on the premises and shotguns were pointed in the general direction of the occupants as police endeavoured to secure the premises. One police officer had also drawn his service revolver in support of the detectives with shotguns. A member also had cause to point a gun temporarily at a male occupant of the house, who had hidden in a bedroom and was believed to be armed.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. When Mrs Sellenthin's daughter expressed a desire to go to the toilet she was escorted by an AFP member, who searched the interior for concealed items before allowing her to enter. The AFP estimate that the delay in the girl's access to the toilet was no more than a minute.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Police estimate they remained in the house for between 45 minutes and one hour.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Officers searched the three bedrooms of the house and examined some personal papers of Mrs Sellenthin. At no stage were any garbage bins upturned.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Police found a radio/cassette recorder on the premises which was later identified as being stolen and claimed by the owner.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) A juvenile male occupant was identified by one of the detectives present at the house as being wanted on warrant for escaping from lawful custody in August 1986. He was arrested at the premises and conveyed to Woden Police Station. Another occupant, also a juvenile male, was apprehended at the premises, since he was in breach of bail conditions relating to another matter.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The AFP members involved followed procedures consistent with the threat assessment of the available information when executing the search warrant.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1)-(3) Under the various research grant schemes administered by my Department only one application for funding for research into the effects of cannabis and other drugs on road safety and driving ability was received in the 1985/86 or in the current financial year. The application from Dr S. McLean, University of Tasmania was for a proposal entitled `Drugs and Road Traffic Accidents'. The proposal was not supported by the Research into Drug Abuse Advisory Committee which was established to advise on research proposals submitted for consideration under the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that in January this year the Federal Office of Road Safety (FORS) released a report of a major study entitled `The Interaction Between Alcohol and Marijuana: A Dose Dependent Study of the Effects on Human Moods and Performance Skills' by Gregory Chesher, Helen Dauncey, John Crawford and Kim Horn, Psychopharmacology Research Unit, Department of Pharmacology, University of Sydney, New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 October 1986 (Hansard, page 1880) Mr Andrew asked a question without notice of the Acting Treasurer, Mr Hurford, concerning the capital gains tax legislation. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the existing provisions of the capital gains tax legislation, if a taxpayer ceases to be an Australian resident, he/she is deemed to dispose of his/her assets that would otherwise cease to be taxable under Australia's CGT (``ex-Australian assets'') and, accordingly, becomes liable for CGT on any accrued real gains on such assets. Examples of ``ex-Australia assets'' include shareholdings in Australian public companies of less than 10 per cent, ``movable'' assets such as jewellery and paintings which are not connected with a fixed business presence in Australia and all foreign assets that would be subject to CGT if the person were an Australian resident.</PARA>
<PARA> Following a review of the operation of these arrangements, I announced changes to the provisions on 23 December 1986. Under the new arrangements, a taxpayer, upon ceasing to be an Australian resident, can elect to treat all his or her ex-Australian assets as taxable Australian assets until the assets are disposed of or until the taxpayer resumes Australian residence status. A taxpayer may decide not to take advantage of the election, in which case the rules which were in force prior to the announcement will continue to apply.</PARA>
<PARA> This election will be an attractive option for a taxpayer who temporarily ceases to be an Australian resident, perhaps to obtain professional experience working in another country. It will not, however, be attractive to a taxpayer who leaves the country for an indefinite period because, under the election, capital gains which accrue during the period of absence would be subject to the CGT on realisation.</PARA>
<PARA> The revised arrangements apply to taxpayers who cease to be Australian residents after 19 September 1985.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) to (4) The Department's explanatory notes on the additional estimates for 1985-86 were prepared prior to the failure of the Tinco plan.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department received advice on 7 March 1986 that the Tinco plan had failed but, because of some uncertainty about the likelihood that a proposal similar to the Tinco proposal might be forthcoming, in consultation with the Department of Finance it was decided that the proposed $11.1 million should remain in the figures at that stage.</PARA>
<PARA> In line with Parliamentary budgetary processes the amounts shown in the Department's explanatory notes were the same as set out in the Appropriation Bills. At the Senate Committee hearings of 17 April 1986 on the Department's additional estimates, although Departmental briefing included reference to the fact that the $11.1 million was no longer required, no questions were asked relating to the Tinco plan (or its failure) and the Department did not raise the issue.</PARA>

<PARA> (6) Yes (however, the request was in fact dated 1 May 1986 with the reply probably despatched 7 May 1986).</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Yes. One of the questions did seek details of the annual cost of running the Department following the separation from AUSTRADE. The relevant question and reply were as follows.</PARA>
<PARA>Quote</PARA>
<PARA>Question</PARA>
<PARA> How much will the Department cost to run annually, now it is separate from AUSTRADE?</PARA>
<PARA> With many public statements asserting that net expenditure on the Trade Commission will be in the order of, or in excess of $200m annually, and with Forward Budget estimates quoting expenditure for the total trade portfolio of $204.7m for 1986-87 and $201.6m for 1987-88, where is the money for the actual Department?</PARA>
<PARA>Answer</PARA>
<PARA> Appropriations in the 1985-86 Budget for the then Department of Trade were $242,487,000. An amount of $106,080,706 was subsequently reappropriated by a Determination made by the Minister for Finance to cover the operations of the Australian Trade Commission from the date it was established on 6 January 1986. The present Department of Trade has sought additional estimates in 1985-86 of $14,630,000.</PARA>
<PARA> The Forward Budget Estimates of $204.7m for 1986-87 and $201.6m for 1987-88, referred to by the Senator were published in November 1985 before the additional estimates process had commenced.</PARA>
<PARA>Unquote</PARA>
<PARA> The Department's bids for additional estimates were not related to the establishment of AUSTRADE but rather represented unavoidable cost increases incurred in the normal course of the Department's operations which had been identified since formulation of the 1985-86 Budget. Details were set out in the Department's explanatory notes and included factors such as a National Wage Case increase, the appointment of the Special Trade Representative to Europe, and once only costs such as Australia's proposed contribution to the Tinco plan and the payment to Victoria to facilitate Chinese participation in the Portland aluminium smelter.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) (a) There was no suggestion in the response that there was a shortfall in the funding agreed in the 1985-86 Budget context. The additional $14.6m sought in additional estimates was to cover costs which had been generated by Government decisions taken after the passage of Appropriation Bills Nos. 1 and 2.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) No. As I have already indicated there was no `shortfall'; rather the need was for funding in respect of decisions taken after the Budget processes were finalised.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) (a) This question has been dealt with in (1) to (4) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) It was not suggested that the $14.6m was to cover a shortfall in running costs for the Department.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Commonwealth payments to non-government schools are made under several separate programs on a calendar year basis.</PARA>
<PARA>GENERAL RECURRENT GRANTS</PARA>
<PARA> Attachment A lists the amount of recurrent grants paid to non-government non-systemic schools and their funded enrolments, in the electorate of Mayo for the years 1985 and 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> Attachment B lists the amount of recurrent funds allocated to non-government Catholic systemic schools and their funded enrolments, in the electorate of Mayo for the years 1985 and 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> Attachment C lists the amount of recurrent funds allocated to non-government Lutheran systemic schools and their funded enrolments, in the electorate of Mayo for the years 1985 and 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> Systemic Schools are those administered by various System Authorities throughout Australia. Grants are paid to each System Authority which allocates funds to its schools according to their needs.</PARA>
<PARA> Recurrent grants are paid for each calendar year on the basis of the number of students enrolled at the census date for that year.</PARA>
<PARA> Note: The figures provided for non-systemic schools include the supplementary payment made in late December 1986. The figures for systemic schools do not however include this last payment because system authorities have not yet advised the allocations made to individual schools. The December 1986 supplementary payment represented less than 2% of system's total entitlement for 1986.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr Blewett</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The National Health and Medical Research Council investigation into the pesticide Chlordimeform noted that West German health authorities consider that 4-chloro-o-toluidine, a metabolite of Chlordimeform, caused seven cases of bladder cancer in workers exposed to 4-chloro-o-toluidine but not to Chlordimeform.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No Australian State currently permits the use of this pesticide.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There are no specific international safety requirements for the use of Chlordimeform. However, the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission does permit extremely low residue levels of Chlordimeform in edible cotton seed oil.</PARA>
<PARA> Safety requirements for users, such as protective clothing and closed-systems for mixing the chemical are normally recommended by those marketing Chlordimeform in each country. These recommendations may be endorsed by the regulatory authorities of individual States/Countries in the form of a Code of Practice and partially in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The MRL (Maximum Residue Limit) for Chlordimeform in edible cotton seed oil recommended by the Codex Alimentarius is accepted and enforced by the States in their food legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> As no State permits the use of Chlordimeform there are no regulations or industry codes to enforce.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) There are no Federal laws to ensure that chemicals and pesticides with identified health risks are withdrawn from the Australian market. However, the National Health Act 1953 (Section 9 (1) (d)) enables the Commonwealth to provide advice to State health authorities. My Department is working closely with the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry in its current consideration of the feasibility of extending this advisory power of the Commonwealth to specific Federal legislation based on the Constitutional powers over Interstate Trade and Imports (51 (1)) and Corporations (51 (20)).</PARA>
