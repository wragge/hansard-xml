                    <para>- The answer is : - 1 and 2 - No doubt it will soon be made clear whether the statement is correct. In the meantime the adoption by the Government of the Commonwealth of the course suggested with the view of protesting would amount to the assumption of a right to inquire officially into the actions of the Imperial Government in affairs which are not under the self-governing jurisdiction of the Commonwealth . </para>

If I am allowed to send it on to-day the Senate will be able to make the second reading an order of the day for Wednesday next ; but if not, we shall not be able to send it forward until Tuesday, and delay will thus be caused. There is very little upon the business paper of the Senate, and under the circumstances I think I might ask for the suspension of the standing orders. I move - </para>

When it is remembered that in clause 239 we have provided that a man shall be comp ell able to give evidence for the prosecution, and shall be liable to be cross-examined, it becomes the more incumbent upon us to consider whether we are not making the penalty under this clause much too high.

                    (Werriwa). - I must protest against the severe penalties proposed. One would think a convict had been placed over convicts to draw up rules, so severe are the penalties. No one would dream for a moment that these penalties were meant to apply to ordinary civilized men of to-day ; we should have to go back to the times of Norfolk Island to find similar rules. If a man fails to produce a document, or fails to answer a question at the sweet will of the Minister for Customs, who is going to assume control over courts, these heavy penalties are to be imposed.

                <para>Mr.V. L. SOLOMON.- I do not think that in regard to the necessary regulations for the working of an Act like this there is any possibility of any such case arising.We have experience as to the Customs throughout the States, and we have the existing regulations to guide us. We have some months of time in which to frame the necessary regulations, over which the House might exercise a certain amount of control, and I therefore suggest to the Minister that the second sub-clause had better be amended. There may be cases in some legislation where it is necessary to provide for extraordinary regulations being framed during recess, but when the House is in session it certainly seems much fairer that honorable members should have an opportunity of seeing and expressing an opinion on regulations. If it be necessary to frame regulations in recess, the ordinary course is that they shall be laid on the table of the House within 30 days after the commencement of the next session. </para>

                    <para>- The form in which the power of making regulations is prescribed is by no means an unusual one. Honorable members know that it may be necessary to make a regulation to come into force at a very early date. We also recognise that in view of the larger area which may be affected by a regulation, it is desirable that fail notice should be given unless there is some special reason to the contrary. But all these considerations must have weight with the Minister before he makes the regulation, and with the Governor-General before he confirms it, in fixing the terms of the regulation. It is not as if it were here provided that it is necessary for the regulations to come into force at once. What is declared is that the. regulations will come into force on the day of publication, or on a later date to be specified in them. That is a fair thing. </para>

                        <para>- If it is entirely in the Minister's hands, why not have it stated so in good set terms, without endeavouring to attach a formal limitation, when, as a matter of fact, practical limitation is not intended. I would ask the honorable member to consider whether any such limitation has ever been previously attached to a clause of this sort. I know of none, and under all the circumstances I would ask that the provision be left in the usual form, feeling sure the committee will believe that the Executive will not exercise a power of this sort recklessly. I further say that in connexion with the bringing of a Bill of this sort into force, a number of regulations may be in course of preparation, and it may be desirable to enforce them earlier than at the expiration of the interval suggested. I hope that under all the circumstances honorable members will see their way to leaving the clause as it is. </para>

                    McEACHARN (Melbourne). - We are dealing with circumstances such as have never arisen in these States up to the present time. To my mind the amendment is absolutely necessary, and I intend to press on the Minister that we ought to have sufficient time for these regulations to be considered. The Minister is in a perfectly safe position, because, should he consider a matter to be one of urgency, the amendment leaves it entirely in his hands, whether the regulations shall come into force immediately. It is unfair to the various States to a great extent, that regulations should be passed and come into force immediately, of which regulations they have not the slightest knowledge. If the period of 21 days is too long, I am quite willing to reduce it to 14 days, but I am determined to press the amendment which I consider highly necessary. I may say that I am not dealing with this matter merely from my own point of view, but after communications from various parts of the States, urging that such an amendment should be passed.

                    <para>- I trust the committee will not pass this amendment, which, so, far as it goes, merely states the words of sub-clause (2) in another shape. The honorable member for Melbourne has moved that the regulations should take effect 21 days after publication, or sooner in the case of urgency, while the clause provides that the regulations should take effect from the date of publication. The latter may be assumed to refer to cases of emergency. </para>

It seems to me that the amendment and clause are exactly the same except to the extent that the amendment would limit the notice to be given at the utmost to 21 days. I can quite understand that in some cases it would be wise for the Minister to give notice extending over a couple of months. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment does not say so. I recognise that there is a good deal of force in what has been urged by the honorable member for Melbourne, but I think that it ought to be left to the Minister to make a reasonable use of this power. No doubt it is necessary that regulations should sometimes come into force immediately, and therefore the objection of the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Solomon,</inline> will have to be passed over, because, if we have to wait until Parliament is in session, it may be that there will be a sitting to-day, and then an adjournment for three' or four weeks, and it is impossible to say when regulations would come into force. </para>

                    <para>- As has been already pointed out, the conditions under which this Bill will shortly become law are exceptional. The mercantile community are very much concerned as to what these regulations will be. There is not the slightest wish to restrict the power of the Minister, but the mercantile community do desire that there shall be some limitation, and I hope that the Minister will reconsider the provision, and consent to the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Melbourne. I only wish to say that I shall be bound to support that amendment. I do so, not with a desire to restrict the power of the Minister in any shape or form, but simply to allay the feeling of insecurity which exists among the mercantile community in regard to the introduction of quite a new order of things. I hope that the Minister will see his way clear to reconsider this matter. </para>

                    <para>- It really seems scarcely necessary to appeal to the Minister by pointing out the absurdity of regulations taking effect from the. day of publication all over a continent which has a coast line of about 8,000 miles. These regulations will, to the extent to which they go, have the force of law, and penalties, no doubt, will be attachable to them, with the usual provision that there shall be a minimum. Apart from the question of punishment altogether, would it not be more in the. interests of the Customs, to prevent disputes, friction, and vexation, that the authorities should give people a reasonable time in which to become acquainted with the laws in connexion with business matters which they are expected to observe? In the case of a Bill which is introduced into the House, they have the means of getting a general knowledge as to its provisions during its progress through Parliament. They get a certain amount of notice as to what are the provisions of any Bill. I think that this Bill is not to come into force until a date to be proclaimed. But with the regulations the case is altogether different. Supposing that the Minister feels there is one regulation in regard to which there should be an interval of notice between its publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> and the period when it becomes operative- </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that is a perfectly sensible remark to make. Surely if I find that one of two positions is not correct, that does not involve the destruction of the other? Is there any sense in that idea? I go back to the original idea which struck me, namely, that it is contrary to common sense that a regulation conceived in an office - conceived in the dark so far as the public are concerned - should appear in an equally mysterious publication called the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> which not one person in a million ever sees, and should take effect immediately the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> goes out of the printing-office over a coastline of over 8,000 miles. The most rudimentary intelligence on the part of "any member of this House, or any member of a debating club, will show that that is going a little too far. If it is only a week, some period should be allowed in order to enable the telegraph wires to be worked. </para>

                        <para>- They may ; but perhaps a department has been slow in getting the regulations ready, and endeavours to make up for its delay by giving immediate effect without allowing any period for notice. It may be important that the regulations should take effect on a certain day. In the case of a coast line such as I have delicately referred to, does the honorable and learned member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse,</inline> not think that there should be a few days' notice given before the regulation takes the effect of law ? Surely some notice ought to be given, and it should be compulsory on the part of the Minister to give it. We are not asking any favour from the Minister. Regulations affecting Customs business ought to be known immediately, because the business of the next day all over Australia must be governed by that regulation issued from Melbourne. Some interval ought to be allowed. I do not intend this point to have any personal application to the present Minister, because we know that he will always do the right thing. But I do not think that my right honorable friend has been appointed to a permanent office yet, and I want to see that his successor shall be bound by some restriction. </para>

                    <para>- I think that throughout the whole of this Bill we have been disposed to ignore the interests of the public in favour of the convenience of the Customs department. There is no doubt that we have drawn the widest possible distinction between the manner in which the general public are to be treated and the treatment which is to be extended to the Customs officers. But in this matter I certainly think that the Minister ought to give way. It seems monstrous that any person in a distant part of the continent should be liable to penalties for non-compliance with a regulation which has the force of law, before it was possible for him to receive any intimation as to its existence. Surely, if we expect people to respect the law, we should make it possible for them to do so. As this clause stands, it will be impossible for a person to be aware of the existence of a regulation, and yet he is to be held responsible for any violation of that regulation. I ask the Minister, who has shown a commendable spirit throughout - although he has been a little stiff at times - to give way upon this point. </para>

If, also, it were to be a recognised thing that Governments, having the power to do stupid things and being under the control of this House, did. things which could be aptly described as monstrous, it would be necessity to modify the clause, but I wish to put two points to the honorable member. First, this clause does not necessitate the coming into force of a regulation upon the day of its publication, but distinctly contemplates its becoming operative on a later date than the date of publication - on a later date to be specified in the regulation. </para>

                        <para>- While we would naturally resent a suggestion of bringing highly penal provisions into force without proper notice, still, the right of bringing into operation regulations of an altogether opposite character should, I venture to think, be left unchallenged. What I propose to give the Minister the light to do is to fix the date, subject to the control which Parliament possesses. Honorable members will notice that power is given to. either House to interfere and cancel regulations if they wish to do so. </para>

                    <para>- It must be apparent to the committee that we are fighting about nothing. Of course if the Minister in charge of the department were an ignorant man it is perfectly clear what the result would be, but with a thoughtful administration there would be no danger of the clause. I desire to make a suggestion to the Minister. A number of his honorable friends are apprehensive that certain things may be done without fair consideration. It is only a matter of apprehension. In order to get over the difficulty could we not make the clause provide that the regulations shall take effect from a date to be specified in the regulations. In this way we would take out the objectionable part of the clause, which is annoying to the constitutional corner. </para>

                    <para>- It is perfectly clear that if there is any hope of this provision being cast out we must not allow honorable members on the Ministerial side to speak about it, because, as soon as. any Ministerialist gets up and opposes a clause, he at once regards that as a true reason why he should vote with the Government. I think all has been said on the subject that can be said. The Minister appears to be determined to carry out this provision, and as several honorable members behind him have openly declared that it is a. bad clause, we know that they intend to vote for it. </para>

We do not ask our honorable friends to do an unreasonable thing. I would suggest to the Minister, as it is not a very large matter, that he might consent to some alteration, which would involve the principle that no regulation shall take effect on the very day that it appears in the

                    <para>-I do not want to unduly press this matter, but I think the merchants and shipowners should have some consideration. In order to meet the Minister, I would amend the clause so as to provide that the regulations "shall take effect not less than fourteen days after publication, unless for reasons of urgency the Minister considers an earlier date should be specified in such regulations. I think the Minister should accept this suggestion. It is a very important body which is pressing, this matter forward, although I myself am only a very bumble individual. </para>

                        <para>- It would settle the principle that there is to be some notice. Where regulations which would affect no one injuriously were concerned, the Minister could provide for them to come into operation on the day after publication, if my suggestion were adopted, so that he would practically have a free hand. It would enable Parliament to state on the face of the Bill that it considered notice should be given. The Minister would interpret that provision to mean that where a regulation would inconvenience no one, it should come into operation the day after publication, but that where it would seriously and injuriously affect any man, reasonable notice should be given. </para>

                    McLEAN (Gippsland). - I think the Minister might reconsider this matter, and allow that Members of Parliament have some little responsibility in dealing with a question of this sort. We have the interests of the public to look after just as well as have the members of the Government. I have never throughout the whole of the discussions upon this Bill taken up five minutes of time, but I have assisted the Minister on every possible occasion, and sometimes . I have done violence to my own feelings. This, however, is really a matter in which the interests of the public are vitally concerned. The proposal of the leader of the Opposition appeared to me at first to meet the case admirably, but there are some cases - very rare - such as an outbreak of a terribly contagious disease, in which it might be necessary to bring regulations into operation forthwith. The motion of my honorable friend, the member for Melbourne, or some modification of it, provides for that, because it allows of the Minister bringing regulations into operation forthwith if he considers that the matter is one of urgency, while in all other cases it is provided that due notice shall be given to the public before the regulations are enforced. Surely that is not an unreasonable thing to ask for, when, as has been pointed out, the matter is one that affects such an immense territory. The position is now very different from what it would be if we were passing regulations to have force in one State only. I have ha&lt;J experience in these matters myself, and I have known of many cases when it has been very questionable whether it was desirable even in the State to suddenly bring certain regulations into operation. We, however, are now dealing with the whole continent, and the case is so different that it appears to me that a custom that might be tolerated within the narrow limits' of a State could not be permitted when made applicable to a whole continent. Why should the Minister seek to adhere so slavishly to a questionable custom of this kind

                    I think the interests of the public should have some consideration, and that this fighting over small matters is not the way to promote good legislation.

                    <para>- I have been very reluctant to take part in this debate, because the difference between the two sides is so small. I have no hesitation, however, in saying that the Minister might have given way with good reason, because if there is any difference it is in favour of the proposal of the honorable member for Melbourne. There is no restriction of the Minister's power under that proposal, but it possesses the advantage of calling the Minister's attention to what is to be the- basis of his decision. Ministers get into the habit of signing notices put before them by their officers. I do not speak from experience as a Minister, but from the experience of those who have had to do with Ministers, and I believe that Ministers very naturally are given to this habit. The proposal of the honorable member for Melbourne will have the effect of merely fixing the attention of the Minister upon what is to be the basis of his decision that any regulation is to take effect immediately. It will simply show him that he has no right to sign a regulation that will have immediate effect unless a case of urgency is shown by the officer who desires his signature. </para>

                    (East Sydney). - I would like to point out that one reason given for the provision in the clause, viz., that there might be some outbreak of disease which, would require to be dealt with promptly, is a very fanciful and ridiculous suggestion, because such a matter would not come under this Act at all. The Government are not bound by Acts of Parliament when they are called upon to arrest the spread of an infectious disease. When that terrible outbreak of disease took place in Sydney recently, and people were taken from their homes and placed in the quarantine station, there was not a shred of law to justify the action of the Government. There was nothing in the law to warrant the action

                        <para>- The power to do anything in the way of preventing a public calamity is one which the Executive will always exercise with the confidence that Parliament will validate their action, and it is of no use bringing up these small bugbears in the discussion 'of a matter of this, sort. As I pointed out, under my suggestion the regulations would come into force the very next day, and that would be practically immediately, but the member for Melbourne goes further,' and would allow the Minister, where there is a case of urgency, to bring the regulations into operation forthwith. The Minister spoke of the power of Parliament to censure the Minister in cases where he does wrong ; but supposing that we pass this provision and the Minister </para>

To refuse the request of the honorable member for Melbourne seems to be a stretch of arbitrary power ; but it was only when the Minister found that he was supported by the labour corner that he came to the decision to fight the matter out. My feeling is that when thoroughly reasonable amendments are proposed by Ministerial friends and supporters, which leave the Minister in practically as good a position as under his original proposal, his resistance to such suggestions is not calculated to assist the course of legislation. I made a suggestion which I thought was a perfectly peaceable one, and if the Minister will not accept that I think he at least ought to agree to the one proposed by the honorable member for Melbourne. </para>

                    <para>- May I point out the delightful distinction that seems to be made by the Minister between the public and the Customs officials. Whilst the public are not supposed to need any information about new regulations that are to govern them, and are to be made subject to them without any notice, the most leisurely steps on the part of the officials are provided for after the regulations have been duly published in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette.</inline> Every one knows that the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> is one of those papers which nobody except a limited official circle, such as Government poundkeepers, and people of that sort ever reads. The best chance the public have of information regarding regulations that have been passed is when those regulations are placed on the table of this House. The regulations then come within reach of the press, and in that way the public get some knowledge of them. But the Government, who would not allow even a day to intervene between the publication of the regulations in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> and their having the force of law, actually take 30 days after they are published for the task of laying them on the table of this House - the very onerous task of bringing a piece of paper from the Government Printing Office and laying it on the table, so that the public may have an opportunity of knowing what the regulations are. With the assistance of our friends in the corner, we have prescribed a lightning pace for the public, and now I ask my honorable friends whether they will sanction the official pace - 30 days after publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline></para>

                    <para>- I would suggest to the Minister that the last sub-clause be omitted. The clause already provides that regulations shall be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and shall take effect either at the date of publication' or at any subsequent date the Minister may fix ; and finally it is provided that the regulations shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament within seven days. In the last sub-clause it is provided that a resolution of both Houses is required to rescind regulations, and I suggest that provision should not be adhered to. Under the Acts Interpretation Act, section 34, sub-section (3), it is provided that where an Act confers a power to make regulations, that is to include a power exercisable in like manner and subject to like conditions, if any, to rescind or vary them. It will be very questionable, in the first place, whether the express provision of this sub-clause would not prevent the Minister acting under the implied power in the other Act. It might be considered as amounting to a Parliamentary declaration that that was the mode of getting rid of regulations. In any event, I think it is too much to say that it will require a resolution of both Houses of </para>

If there is an intimation under sub-clause (3) from either House of Parliament, but more particularly from this House, requesting him to rescind a regulation, he should have full, ample, and unquestionable power to rescind it. When the Minister comes to consider, I- think he will see that the last sub-clause puts a possible fetter on him, while it cannot possibly give' him any power he has not now. </para>

                        <para>- We have had a practice in another State of making all regulations subject to parliamentary disallowance, and there is a great deal to recommend that course. Whatever there may be to recommend such a course in a State Legislature, there is more, it seems to me, to justify, it in a Federal Legislature. If we were to strike out this sub-clause the simple position would be that there would be no power for the other House to do much in connexion with the suspension or cancellation of regulations. As this is a modified power of legislation, I doubt whether we should be justified in, going to the extent suggested, and the better alteration would be to omit the word "both," and insert "either," making the clause read, "But if either House of the Parliament, " and so on. </para>

                    (Indi).- May I point out the consequence of retaining the sub-clause ? The sub-clause actually says that the Minister, without consulting this House, may make a regulation, and that this House is to have less power than the Minister in saying whether the regulation shall, be disallowed.

                        <para>- In answer to the honorable and learned member's question, I may say I take it that the authority to make will carry the authority to unmake, irrespective of any exercise of this clause. That has been held time and again. Regulations have been made with this authority given to either branch of the Legislature to veto them. That power has not been exercised, and again and again the Minister has repealed regulations and put others in their stead. This is not a limitation of the power of the Minister or the Executive in the slightest degree, but is conferring a power on either branch of the Legislature ; and, as this is a modified species of legislation, it is a power they ought to possess. </para>

Suppose that without this sub-clause the Minister brought into force regulations of which this House did not approve. In such case this House would very soon make the Minister repeal or cancel those regulations, and very properly so, because the Minister is responsible to this branch of the Legislature. </para>

                        <para>- We have advisedly and deliberately adopted, so far as we can do it in black and white, the principle that the Government is responsible to one Chamber.' The clause, as it stands, produces the result that the Minister can almost say, as a matter of law, that he has to get the decision of both Houses, before he can be called on to repeal regulations ; and, if the clause be altered to " either House," there will be a beautiful state of affairs. It will mean that this House is to have taken away from it that control of Ministerial existence which is a portion of the essence of its powers... For example, suppose regulations are framed and gazetted by the Minister, and that this House approves, while the other House disapproves, of those regulations, then this House, to which the Minister is directly responsible, would find itself over ridden by a branch of the Legislature to which the Minister is not responsible, and the responsibility of Ministers to the House of Representatives would thereby be very much lessened and interfered with. We do not want to initiate a system that will in effect enable the other branch of the Legislature to pass votes of want of confidence in Ministries. </para>

                        <para>- At present, of course, we have the two Houses in a state of the utmost friendliness, but if they were in a state of tension we do not know to what results these little things might possibly lead - what subversion of what we consider is the proper constitutional status of Ministers might flow from it. I urge the Minister not to alter the clause in the way suggested. </para>

                    (East Sydney).- I have very rarely found myself at issue with the views advanced by. the honorable and learned member for Indi during the course of the debates upon this Bill. On this occasion, however, I must differ from him. I should like to put forward my view, which, I think, is a sounder view. The Act will be the result of the legislation of the two Houses. The regulations will be legislation in the name of the Parliament by the Minister, and new legislation, because if a thing is in the Bill already it need not be put into a regulation. It is legislation, and new legislation. Just as a Bill requires the concurrence of both Houses to make it law, so, if the Minister legislating in the name of the two Houses takes a line of which either House disapproves, the disapproval of one House should be sufficient to veto the legislation of the Minister, because his legislation should not be more easily passed into law than the legislation of this Chamber. Our legislation cannot pass into law unless the two Houses concur in it. Why should legislation by the Minister pass into law, and be beyond the power of either House to veto it
                    <inline font-style="italic">1</inline>
                    It is giving him a larger power of legislation in that respect then we ourselves possess.

                        <para>- That is raising a very mischievous and unnecessary contention upon this particular clause. Whatever our views on the point may be, we never wish to raise them when it is not at issue. These are among the reserve powers of the Chamber, which we do not wish to parade when they do not come into question. would point out that that question does not come in here, because the other House undoubtedly has the power to throw out a Bill, or any clause of it, if it disapproves of it. It has power to throw out any clause of which it disapproves, and no honorable member will say that it has not the right to throw out a machinery clause. If it is right that the Senate should have the power to reject a clause which this House has approved, surely the other Chamber ought also to have the right to reject a clause which under the authority of both Houses the Minister, by regulation, has enacted, because that would be legislation over which neither House has any control except that which is given by a clause of this sort. Unless this proposal is inserted on the very theory raised by the honorable member, the other House would be debarred from any practical influence over the regulations of the Minister in virtue of the </para>

                <para class="block">Act. This House has a hundred ways of making the Minister do as it wishes. But on the theory of the honorable member, the other House has no such opportunity of carrying out its views. It can do so only by resolution, which the Minister would disregard if it took the form which has been referred to. Consequently, the Minister is making a sound alteration, and one which will not bring the two Houses into conflict. There is no procedure specified here to compel the other House to pass a resolution It is not as if the clause compelled both Houses to express an opinion, in which case there might be a conflict. Such a conflict might arise under the words " both Houses." But if the disapproval of one House will settle the matter there will be no conflict, because if this House passes a resolution the matter is over, and the regulation is dead. So, if the other House passes a resolution against a regulation, that regulation is dead, and there is no occasion for this House to interfere. It is very unlikely that anything would come up which would warrant a conflict between the two Houses, because this House could always assert itself without any provision in an Act. We do not need these clauses, but the other House may need them in order to refuse its sanction to legislation which is proposed. Their privileges, in certain events, cannot be pushed very far. The dearest and best privilege of all is that of dealing with the Executive Government of the country. </para>

I agree with the tenor of the remarks made by the Minister and by the leader of the Opposition. But in answer to the objection put forward by the honorable and learned member for Corinella, I wish to say that it seems to me that unless the amendment be carried, there is a danger, not of this House losing power, but that it may have legislation forced upon it without the possibility of other than a protest. Supposing that the consent of both Houses were necessary to disallow any regulation. This House might protest against any particular regulation, and having so protested - finding the other Chamber in favour of the regulation- the Minister and the other Chamber would prevail', and this House would have no opportunity for its consent being obtained. </para>

Supposing that regulations are cancelled, will they cease to be operative from the date of their cancellation, or will they have no effect from the date upon which they were made? It may happen that certain charges have been made and certain expenses paid under a regulation which does not become law. Under this clause it appears to me that in such a case the money would not be returned. I think that the words " from the date when such regulation came into force" should be added to the clause. </para>

                    <para>- I have been very much impressed by the arguments of the honorable and learned member for Corinella. It seems to me that if another place were to disapprove of regulations passed by the Minister, and this House expressed its approval of them, there would very likely be friction between the two Houses eventually. The Minister might try to ignore the decision of the other Chamber, but he could not actually ignore it, because it is provided for within the four corners of the Act. I think that in such a case a very dangerous precedent might be established, because, if, as has been pointed out by the honorable and learned member for Corinella, a regulation were passed by another place which was not passed by this House, there would be a feeling raised, within a very short time, between the two Houses, which would be very undesirable indeed. I would much rather see the sub-clause passed as it stands, or omitted altogether. </para>

                    <para>- I would point out to the Minister that under our present Constitution legislation requires the sanction of both Chambers before it can become law. If both Chambers do not agree to the passing of legislation, then its passage must be postponed until they become in accord. Now, the regulations Of the Governor-General have the sanction of law. They are to all intents and purposes legislation, and therefore they should have the concurrence of both Chambers. If they conform to the provisions of the Act, then they have the concurrence of both Chambers, but if the Minister departs from the spirit of the Act in the opinion of the other Chamber, then I think it is quite right that that legislation should be postponed until both Chambers are in accord. Therefore it is better to adopt the suggestion of the Minister, and to substitute the words " either House"for "both Houses." No injustice will thereby be done to either House, because the first resolution passed by either House will have the effect of rescinding the regulation. The other House need not move in the matter at all. Thus no conflict or friction whatever can arise. It is an easier method of rescinding a regulation to provide that it maybe done upon a resolution of either House than to insist that a resolution of both Houses should be necessary. We have no guarantee that both Houses will pass similar resolutions. One House might not move at all. Therefore if one House passed a resolution, and the other House did not, friction might be the result. </para>

This House, for instance, might affirm that certain regulations were right, yet a resolution passed in another place would compel the Minister to undo them. Thus, we might have one House expressing disapproval of certain regulations and causing them to become null and void, while the other House might absolutely approve of them. I hope that the Minister will stick to the clause as it is, or else adopt the suggestion made by the honorable member for Indi. </para>

                    (Corinella). - I want to state a case to the committee, taking a subject within our competence in which at present there is no feeling. Supposing on the question of weights and measures the two Houses held very different views ; supposing there was a majority in this House taking one view of a measure on the subject, and a majority in the other House taking the opposite view, and that we had passed a Bill relating to weights and measures at a time when the two Houses did not feel so very strongly on it. If a question afterwards arose, when regulations were being framed to insure the proper enforcement of that Act, then the House which wanted to enforce the law would be at the mercy of the House which did not wish to do so, and the latter could annul the regulations as fast as they were made. I presume that under this Bill a large number of regulations will be necessary, in order to enable the Customs authorities to take proper steps in regard to their Tariff laws and Customs laws. Supposing that one House of the Legislature, owing to heated public feeling, made up its mind that it did not want the Customs or Tariff laws in operation to be carried into effect more than could be helped, and therefore persistently annulled by resolution the regulations which the Minister and the other House recognised were absolutely necessary in order to carry those laws into effect. If the other House continually annulled those regulations, while this House approved of them, the Ministry would be under the whip of the other

                        <para>- There is no power here to adjust regulations when the two Houses are not in agreement. I do not think that we should agree to a power in the Minister to keep bringing down regulations, conferring with either House, until each had suggested proposals, and until finally quasi amended regulations had been got into a certain form. I think we should leave the clause as it is - that is, if the Minister wants it to remain in the Bill at all. In my opinion, however, it is better to leave it out altogether. I am very much afraid it involves a limitation of the power of repeal which the Minister would otherwise have. </para>

                        <para>- That is a reason for omitting the clause. I say that whatever is right, to give this power to either House is wrong. To give to a House which does not approve of a measure a whip over the Minister, and to enable it to repeal the regulations under that measure, would be a very unwise procedure. It would be a power given to one House to control the Minister to such an extent as to alter his position as intended to be settled by the Constitution. I am afraid that this sub-clause, as suggested by the honorable and learned member for Indi, impliedly forbids the Minister to repeal regulations in any other way. </para>

                        <para>- I think it does. I think it gives to the two Houses another weapon with which to smite each other when constitutional warfare arises. I do not consider it is a wise thing to keep giving to the Houses fresh legal constitutional weapons, so to speak, for use when we do come into conflict. No doubt we shall find occasion for quarrel in some way or other. In the interests of peace and good government, and in the interests -of the community, it is not desirable to do anything "which will increase the possibility of friction between the two Houses. </para>

                    (Indi). - I do not think the Minister "has quite done justice to the view put before him. There are two points to be considered in regard to this sub-clause. The first is whether it cuts down the power possessed by the Minister " under the ordinary law, quite independent of this proposal to rescind or vary regulations at his discretion. If it does cut down that power as it now stands it will equally cut down the Minister's power if he alters the expression " both Houses " to " either House." If it does not cut down his power, then he gains nothing whatever in point of power by putting' this sub-clause in. He provides that either House may compel the rescission of regulations, and he would leave himself in this position. There are two ways of getting rid of regulations - either at the discretion of the Minister or at the discretion of either House. The effect of the sub-clause, as pointed out by the honorable member for Corinella, is, that although the Minister responsible- primarily to this Chamber may think a certain regulation is necessary for the purpose of guarding the Customs, and this House agrees with him in that respect, still the joint opinion of the Government and this House may be overridden by the vote of the other- Chamber. Surely that is a novel feature in responsible government. I should like to say to the honorable gentleman that he seems to me to be rather ill-advised in courting friction in this respect. He has the power to rescind a regulation independent of this sub-clause if he sees fit. ' Either as the result of a resolution of the other Chamber or of this Chamber, or as the outcome of an expression of opinion outside, he has. always the power to rescind a regulation. But if this House is called upon to express an opinion, and expresses the opinion that a regulation which is in force should not be repealed, and the other House comes to another conclusion, why should that regulation be repealed by the will of the other chamber ? I certainly think that the right honorable gentleman should strike out the clause and not raise this question. There is no necessity to raise it,, and by doing so he is courting friction.

                        <para>- Exactly. I think it is ill-advised to put such a sub-clause into the Bill. The Minister is giving rise to a question which might have momentous consequences. I think that the right honorable gentleman is rightfully claiming, as . he has done throughout this Bill, to have full power. The Minister would have more power without it than with it, as he could not be coerced practically without a vote of want of confidence in the Government, on the. ground that they had not carried out the resolution of the House. Yet the Minister is proposing to build up material for possible future conflict. The argument of the leader of the Opposition would appear, at first sight, to have considerable force, but, if he will allow me to say so, there is a fallacy underlying it. While the consent of the two Houses is undoubtedly necessary to enact a law, once that law is enacted, and regulations are declared by the earlier part of the section to be an enactment, nothing is void that is done under it. It is also the fact that the joint consent of the two Houses would be required to repeal that law, and therefore the argument of the right honorable gentleman seems to be wanting in force when he considers that the will of one House will be sufficient to repeal it. I do not think that we should have a. provision that the vote of either House should of necessity secure the repeal of a regulation. AVe should leave it law until repealed by the powers which enacted it. Then no advantage would be given to either House on the face of an Act of Parliament. No distinction would be made in the power of either House with regard to repeal, and the whole matter would be guided by ordinary course of Constitutional practice. If the Minister adheres to his present intention, this House will be very chary of granting wide powers of regulation. The House will see that the Minister does not have power to make regulations which may be swept aside, however much this House may wish them to remain in force, merely at the will of another Chamber. I think that the Minister will do well to strike out the clause, which really gives him no power, and which may possibly take power away from him. </para>

                    (Tasmania). - I hope the Minister will take the course that has been suggested by the honorable and learned member for Indi. I must confess that my opinions have undergone a change since I have heard this debate. I thought, and doubtless it was generally recognised, that the Minister framed this clause with a view to conceding to Parliament the power of review over the extreme authority which was to be reposed in him under this Bill ; but, on full consideration of the arguments -I have heard this afternoon, I am constrained to think that the right course will be to leave the clause out of the Bill.

I admit at once that the Executive has no power unless such power has been delegated to it by both Chambers ; but if one of the Chambers in its legislative capacity has given the Executive all the power it intended to give, and the Executive exercises powers which it was not .intended to give, has not that Chamber the right to say - "AVe never gave you the power, and we object to your exercising it against ourselves ;) ? </para>

                        <para>- The matter appears to the Government in this way : That this power of making regulations is a power of legislation by Executive on minor matters, practically with the tacit approval of both Houses of the Legislature ; and we can hardly expect that both Houses would be willing to confer unrestricted power on an Executive that was responsible to only one branch. It seems to me, therefore, that if this regulation of minor matters depends upon the tacit approval of both Houses, there must be some mode provided of enabling either branch of the Legislature to say whether it approves or not. If either branch of the Legislature does nothing, its approval is to be taken for granted ; whilst if it, disapproves it acts accordingly by disapproving of the regulation. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that we can hardly fairly ask the other branch of the Legislature to consent to the large power of making regulations. which is conferred by this Bill, unless we concede to them the same power as we possess ourselves with reference to the making of those regulations. I am satisfied of this - I do not know whether the honorable and learned member for Indi holds a different opinion, but I think he expressed himself in some qualified terms - that the power of the Minister as regards the making and unmaking of regulations exists subject to the Parliamentary control here provided. It has always been held with us that the power to make implies the power to unmake by similar procedure. Our present point is as to whether we should deny to the other branch of the Legislature the power we would undoubtedly possess ourselves. With regard to the suggestion that the other branch of the Legislature, which has first deliberately committed itself to the principle of certain legislation, would persistently obstruct and prevent effect being given to that legislation by the exercise of some power which might be given to it in connexion with the framing of the regulations, I do not think there is any fear of that, and I do not see any reason to withdraw from the position I have already taken up on the matter. </para>

But -I would like to press on the Minister, before we strike this clause out, a suggestion whether something cannot be done to provide that when the Tariff proposals are made - and it will facilitate the operation of the Tariff very much - we shall be able to take that as the date of the establishment of Inter-State free-trade. The great object we had in view by this federal union and by a uniform Tariff, was that these two steps would make it possible to stop at once the interferences which exist between Australians in carrying on their operations of commerce. That is one of the grand objects we have had in view all through. </para>

                        <para>-I think the suggestion I have made would simplify the position of the Minister very much, because J quite see the embarrassment the Minister will be in, no matter what he proposes. There are several troubles ahead which I think we should all, as far as we can, combine in the public interest to remove. It might simplify the position of the Government, and be a distinct gain to the States generally, if we had some provision, the effect of which - and it might be contained in this Bill - would be to establish Inter-State free-trade from the date of the Treasurer's financial statement. That is one part of the federal undertaking which is bound to come about. We may have differences of opinion as to the rate of particular duties, and as to the policy on which the proposals are founded, but it is inconceivable that there can be any difference on the point that we want that part of the business carried out now, at once. I think that must be the feeling all through Australia, now that we are united. I am not quite sure whether such a provision could be put into the present Bill, and, therefore, I do not make any proposal to that end. It is a matter that might be dealt with either in this Bill or in some short Bill of one" clause. I admit that it isa matter which has to be seriously thought out, but if it be feasible to introduce some such proposal between this date and the date of the financial statement, that should be done. I do not expect the Minister to do so in connexion with this Bill, because we are at the end of the measure and there may, perhaps, not be time. But if it be impossible to legislate, even in the form of a short Bill, between now and the date of the financial statement, it would, I think, be desirable. </para>

                        <para>- It is such a good object that I feel the matter is worth looking into, though I confess I have not looked into it, and there may be many difficulties in the way. I do not want to place my utterances before the public as if what I have suggested can be done. I do not want to put the Ministry in an unfair position. If the suggestion cannot be carried out, it would be very unfair for me to put the matter as if it could be. I do not say at present that it could be. But if it can be done - and we have a little time between now and the Treasurer's statement - it is a matter well worth the consideration of the Ministry. I think this is the one element in the financial policy about which there can be no possible dispute or change, because, to begin with, it is provided in the Constitution. We are standing on much firmer ground in this matter than we should be in proposing a new Tariff. A new Tariff has not the sanction of the law behind it ; but in carrying out InterState free-trade we stand behind a principle of the Constitution. We might be anticipating Inter-State free-trade 'by a short time - that is, by the interval between the carrying of the Tariff into law and the statement of the Treasurer - but I should say that that would be a circumstance of which no one would be heard to complain. The carrying on of a uniform Tariff, together with the collection of duties under the InterState fiscal system, would create such difficulty on the part of the Government that I should be very glad if the Minister would consider whether, before the Budget speech is made, a short method cannot be adopted under which the Government would begin their fiscal policy by an arrangement which will bring at once to the people of Australia the benefits of Inter-State freetrade. </para>

                    <para>. - The matter mentioned by the right honorable and learned member opposite has not escaped the attention of the Government. Par from it - we have been giving it very anxious consideration. It is the desire of the Government, if we possibly can, to see that the bringing down of the Tariff is accompanied by Inter-State free-trade. The difficulties in our road are not difficulties of policy, because we are convinced that the people of Australia all round - whatever fiscal faith they may hold - would welcome the consummation of InterState free-trade at the same time as the collection of duties, under whatever authority they are collected. The committee may take the assurance from me on behalf of the Government, that we wish to do this, and that if we can see our way to do it, so as to be free from difficulties and not to imperil the revenue, we shall do it. The personal inclination of every one of us is to do it if we can, and I think I can meet the suggestion which has been made by saying that I am heartily in accord with the right honorable and learned member opposite, and that if this course can be pursued with safety to the public interest, it will be done. </para>

                    B. EDWARDS (South Sydney).This clause is a transcription of the constitutional provision. It strikes me, however, that it will necessitate the retention of Customs barriers for some time to deal with a few very small matters. The definition of "goods" in the Bill is any movable property. Under this clause, the department will be under the necessity to collect duty, if there be any, on personal effects such as pianos, and anything of that class which are not goods in the ordinary common-sense acceptation of the term. Consequently we shall have to keep up all the provisions for ascertaining whether these persona] effects have been imported within the time stipulated. Seeing that that would be a difficulty and would necessitate a lot of search, I think that possibly the Minister might consider the wisdom of adopting a line in the Tariff to exempt certain goods such as personal effects and second-hand machinery.

                    <para>-I wish to point out that this clause and the next embody in effect the same principle, namely, the right of the Commonwealth to demand reports from or to search foreign ships of war. I hold in my hand the1895 edition ofHall'sInternational <inline font-style="italic">Law,</inline> and in that the question is discussed at- some length as to the ex-territorial rights of armed vessels of foreign powers. I do not intend to quote the whole of the references, but I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to two or three. Hall, in discussing how far we can interfere with foreign ships in our waters, says - . </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Turning to England, it is no doubt true that under the Customs Act foreign ships of war are liable to be searched, and that it has been the practice to surrender slaves who have taken refuge on board English war vessels lying in the waters of other -States, &amp;c. </para>
                <para>But on the other hand it is pointed' out that certain things have not been done. The author speaks of the right to search under the Customs Act, with no very great satisfaction or approval. I would remind the Minister that since the cases dealing with this matter were decided, international opinion has advanced considerably in the direction of maintaining far greater immunity" for foreign ships of war. In summing up the position, on page 202, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hall</inline> says the law may probably be stated as follows : - </para>
                <para>A vessel of war, or other public vessel of the State, when in foreign waters is exempt from the territorial jurisdiction ; but her crew and other persons on board of her cannot ignore the laws of the country in which she is laying, as if she constituted a territorial enclave. On the contrary, those laws must as a general rule be respected. Exceptions to this obligation exist, in the case of acts beginning and ending on board the ship and. taking no effect externally to her - </para>
                <para>Until the supposed improper goods leave the ship's side, the act of having them there begins and ends on board - firstly, in all matters in which the economy of the ship or the relations of persons on board to each other are exclusively touched, and secondly to the extent that any special custom derogating from the territorial law may have been established, perhaps also in so far as the territorial law is contrary to what may be called the public policy of the civilized world. In the case of acts done on board the vessel', which take' effect externally to her, the range of exception is narrower. The territorial law, including administrative rules, such as quarantine regulations and rules of the port, must be respected, to the exception, it is probable, of instances only in which there is a special custom to the contrary. </para>
                <para class="block">I would draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that Hall, in summing up the case, carefully leaves out as the modern settled practice, the right claimed under the English Customs Act, of searching foreign vessels of war in British waters. </para>
                <para class="block">I do not know whether as a matter of fact that right is ever exercised. But I should he strongly inclined to hazard an opinion, with a very great deal of belief in its accuracy, that the right of search, which is claimed under the Act, is never exercised. What I wish to point out is, that so long as the matter is within the ambit of the vessel's bounds, except in the case of acts of hostility of course, the English Customs officers do not interfere. </para>

Now, according to Hall's summing up, the modern practice is that it is absolutely in the captain's own discretion whether he reports or not, so that, though not to the same extent, if the second be an infringement, the first also is an infringement.

There are foreign ships, which, although they are by no means men-of-war in the ordinary sense of the term, hold commissions, and if. there were not a provision of this sort in the Bill the results might be injurious to our revenue.

I should have preferred to see- an Executive act made necessary to authorize it, but I should be willing to give the Minister the power to authorize. I hardly think, however, that the collector of a State should have such power. If a State collector was not fully acquainted with the responsibilities attaching!- to his position, and wrongly exercised this' power, great confusion would be created. </para>

                    <para>- It seems a remarkable thing to me that the honorable member holding the fiscal faith he does, should propose to put a bar upon goods being sold to the lowest bidder. What should it matter what they are sold for so long as the consumer gets them cheap. If we can give the people cheap goods, we need not bother ourselves about whether other people are being undersold or not. </para>

                    <para>- I do not see that the point raised by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports has anything to do with the case.' I think there is a very great deal in the argument put forward by the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Solomon,</inline> and I would ask the Minister to see if he cannot do something to prevent goods being sold free of duty to the disadvantage of those who have paid duty. I do not know exactly whether the amendment submitted by the honorable member would meet the case, but, doubtless, the Minister will be able to find some way out of the difficulty. </para>

                    (Northern Melbourne).I think that there is some measure of justice in the contention of the honorable member in its theoretical aspect. It does seem unfair that a man who has paid the duty honestly should have to compete with those who have goods which have not paid duty, but I think that in practice there will not be any great hardship. The quantity of goods that would come in and be sold for less than the amount of duty must be very small - infinitesimally small - in proportion to our total imports. We have to choose between two evils, and if we do not sell the goods we shall have to destroy them.

This is not a matter of certain goods coming into competition free of duty, but we have to dispose as best we can of certain goods which are thrown upon the hands of the collector, and at the same time protect the revenue as far as possible. </para>

                    <para>- I would ask the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Solomon,</inline> to withdraw his proposal. In the State of Victoria there are a number of unemployed who are crying out for food, and yet we find that there is a law in that State in regard to cattle imported from Riverina and slaughtered in bond for exportation, which prevents the possibility of these poor people getting the advantage of the livers, hearts, or lungs of the animals slaughtered. 1 understand that the State Government at the present time has a Customs-house officer stationed at the abattoirs at South Melbourne in order to see that these livers and hearts do not go into consumption, but are destroyed by having imported kerosene thrown over them and burnt. I am told that last month about 200 carcasses were treated in this way, and I say it is a barbarous state of affairs to exist in this country. I object to the honorable member's amendment, because, if it were carried, it would make it impossible, even for the Government of Victoria, to give consideration to the requests of these poor people, and allow this food to be used. I therefore suggest that the honorable member should withdraw his amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I am sure that the people of Victoria will be very grateful to the honorable member for Macquarie for his lecture, but he will scarcely contend that it is fair that where a private trader has paid duty on his goods he should be subjected to the competition of another trader who has been able to import his goods duty free. The present case is not on all-fours with that. I admit that there is a good deal in the contention of the honorable member for South Australia that it would not be fair to private traders who had to pay the full amount of duty if confiscated goods were sold duty free, and I think the object of the Minister would still be carried out if he applied whatever the goods brought, whether the full amount of duty or not, to the payment of that duty. </para>

I might mention instances where every three months or six months there is a sale at the Government warehouses - I know it is so in Western Australia - and goods are sold by auction for whatever they will fetch. The goods are generally sold in the cases unopened, and very frequently fetch high prices, and I scar ely see how, under the circumstances, there could be any reserve. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members are in correct in saying that these goods are sold for what they will fetch, because they are sold with a reserve equal -to the duty. The Minister is fully protected,' because, by sub-clause (e), no bidding or tender is necessarily accepted, and the goods may be re-offered until sold at a price satisfactory to the collector. I contend that in another way, and with a quite different object, we are bound to see that the duty is paid. If the goods are in a sound state, and fit foi~ human consumption, the Minister will hold them over in order to get a price at least equal to the duty ; and if on a subsequent date these goods will not fetch the duty, it is conclusive proof that they are not fit for human consumption, but are in an unsound state and had better be destroyed. Apart from that, which is really a protection to the public, the contention of the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. V.</inline> L. Solomon, is worthy of support, because we should do what we can to prevent the effects of smuggling or malpractices under the customs, affecting honest <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> traders. If we can, by the amendment, prevent goods from being sold for less than the duty chargeable on them, we should do so in the interests of the honest trading portion of the community. I shall support the amendment. </para>

                    (Mernda).- I think too much is being made of this question. Practically, I believe these Customs sales result in very good prices, because people go there with the expectation of getting bargains, with the usual result that they' bid against each other, until prices are very often beyond what the goods would fetch if' sold in the ordinary course. In any case, it seems to me that the honorable member who submitted the amendment has not aided the- Minister in disposing of the goods, which is the object of the clause. The honorable member proposes that the goods shall not he disposed of unless the}' fetch the amount of the duty, but he does not tell the committee or the Minister what is to be done in the event of a price equivalent to the duty not being realized.

                        <para>- 1 do not think the question of justice enters into the matter at all. Very often people who pay duty i have to sell the goods for less than the duty, if the goods deteriorate or become unfit for the purpose for which they were intended. I cannot conceive that in the case of a Customs sale any goods, which were fit for the purpose for which they were intended, would be sold for less than the duty due on them. They might fetch more than was due, but certainly not less. </para>

                    <para>- The committee will certainly agree with me when I say that it is 11Ut often i approve of anything the Minister does. In this case, however, I think the Minister is right, and I was very glad indeed to hear his admission - "Whoever heard of goods not fetching the amount of duty "? That was such a splendid admission by the Minister for Customs, that I hope he will act upon it, and, remembering the great bulk of the population throughout Australia, make the duties as light as possible. I am glad to see a recognition of the fact that it is a wrong thing to destroy good food, as has been done by the Minister for Customs or the officers under him. It appears, as the honorable member for Macquarie has already pointed out, that a great deal of injury to the poorer people has been done in this way. I am glad to see some recognition of the fact that they are the people who will have to pay this duty, and that the Minister intends if the clause is passed, and even before the introduction of free-trade, to do away with the barbarous system that prevails in Victoria at the present time. I feel unable to support the amendment. </para>

                    do not desire to load this debate with any allusions to past State political history} or to make any claim to be particularly a friend of the poorer classes. We know that with the exception of one or two gentlemen on the back Government benches" there are no real friends of the poorer classes in the House ; at any rate, we have been told so frequently. Without touching that particular point, I merely want to say that it will be grossly unfair to the importer who has paid the proper duty if the Customs authorities are allowed to sell goods of a similar class for less money than they have charged duty to the importer. It is all very well to say, as the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne said, that only a small quantity of goods come under this category, but who knows that it is always going to be a small quantity ? I have known instances of large, quantities of tobacco, cigars, and so forth being sold.

In exactly the same way large quantities of tobacco, or a few boxes containing 10,000 cigars, might come into the possession of the Customs authorities and be sold. Would it be fair to the tobacconists throughout the city of Melbourne if these goods were sold at a less price than those tobacconists had been paying in absolute duty I I will not extend this debate, but it seems to me that my amendment is one that ought to commend itself to any reasonably-minded man. </para>

                        <para>- But sometimes goods sold do not realize even the duty. There are cases' where importers are indebted to the Customs. Indeed, there are cases where goods have disappeared altogether without the duty having been paid. I ask the Minister whether he does not think it worth while to insert a provision making it possible to appropriate a portion of the money to the payment of a debt incurred by the same person previously. </para>

                        <para>- I hardly think it is worth while ; the cases are so rare. No doubt it could be done by inserting words to the effect that the proceeds might be applied to the payment of any money due to the Customs by the owner of the goods, but Customs sales are so rare, and repeated default by the same man is so rare, that I do not think it worth while to make the amendment. Had I thought of it sooner I might have put the words in. </para>

                    <para>- I would remind the Minister of the analogy of the Defence Bill, where there is a corresponding provision. But I do not propose a formal repeal of the State Acts. There may be great doubt as to whether we have power to repeal State Acts ; but I would point out a few concrete cases where importers and others may be greatly embarrassed, owing to not knowing exactly the limits of their duties. I see that in clause 59 there is a provision that when a ship is wrecked, the master must report the wreck and deliver an inward manifest either at the main Customshouse of the State, or at the nearest Customs-house. But let us suppose that there is a State Act which requires the master to do something else also? It will be very awkward if the master, having complied with the Federal Customs law, is told - " You were also to deliver another manifest to some one else." No doubt it is provided in the Constitution that if a State law and a Commonwealth law are inconsistent, the federal law prevails. But there would not be anything inconsistent in such a case as I have put. There is nothing inconsistent in a Commonwealth law providing for an inward manifest being delivered to the nearest Customs-house and a State law providing that a similar document shall be given to somebody else. I do not know how it appeal's to honorable members, but to me there is nothing so irritating or prejudicial to trading operations as uncertainty regarding the conditions under which merchants are to act. In the case which I have put, they might think that they were doing all that was required of them by carrying out the provisions of this clause. Then they might be told that they were liable, because they had neglected to do something else which was provided for in a State Act. There are several other matters of a similar character which could be suggested. It may be said that it is very unlikely- </para>

                        <para>- There are several other things which appear to me to show the outside limits of a man's duty, but I think it would be easy to provide in this Bill that' certain sections of specified State Acts shall not, after this Bill comes into force, operate with regard to imports or shipping within the Commonwealth. Such a provision is not formally a repeal. It simply says that we have power to determine under what conditions a man shall carry on shipping and make imports within the Commonwealth. I merely wish it to be intimated to merchants that if they comply with the provisions of this Bill, nothing more is requited of them. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but the honorable and learned member for Tasmania has convinced me that difficulties are only made to be overcome. He seems to worry himself over difficulties in a very energetic manner. There are several other clauses which show . that it is important to a man to have the Customs Act by him, and to be able to say - " Now, I have only to obey this Customs Act, and to do nothing else." I think we ought to make an exhaustive law, if we are to have any law. </para>

                    <para>- I am sure that what the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has suggested is the most desirable thing that can be done. But I am very much afraid, after a cursory examination of the Customs Acts of the different States, that very awkward questions will arise in the administration of the Customs when this Bill becomes law, because there are many things which apparently are to be dealt with by regulation. The honorable and learned member for Indi mentioned one, namely, the question of the restriction of diseased animals. Then there is the matter of the importation of kerosene. Both of these subjects in four out of the six States are dealt with explicitly in their Customs Acts, and I am very doubtful whether the proposal of the Minister to deal with them by regulation will be effective. I doubt whether any regulation which he can frame will be sufficient, to repeal the existing provisions of State Acts. Of course, we have the difficulty all through of ascertaining whether the law we are now framing will be in conflict with State laws. The only satisfactory way of dealing with the matter seems to me for the several States to repeal their own State Acts so far as this Bill is in conflict with the provisions of those Acts. The placing of a schedule into this Bill, detailing the provisions intended to be affected by it, would be a very considerable work to attempt, and I am not at all sure that it could be done satisfactorily. It would be reposing in some one appointed to undertake the task, the same duties possibly as the High Court of Australia will be charged with in construing the law. </para>

We have several different Customs Acts operating throughout Australia.

But at the same time this schedule will press harshly on the smaller class of warehouse-keepers if they are to be forced to pay £25 per annum, in lieu of the £1 which they pay at present. This remark applies particularly to machinery warehouses. 'The matter is one which I think the Minister might look into. Apart from the fee which is paid they have to pay 2s. an hour or part of an hour for the services of any locker. </para>

Where people can afford to pay £200 or £300 a year in a large State like Victoria they cannot do so in a small State like that of Western Australia. </para>

                    <para>- I have been appealed to by the bonded storekeepers of Melbourne with regard to the position which is to be occupied by the second class of warehouses, namely, private warehouses under clause 73. In the case of private warehouses to be used only for goods, the property of the licensee, the charge of £200 per annum is to be made for the entire services of a locker, but only £25 a year is charged when only the partial services of a looker are required, with a further charge of . 2s. an hour for each hour or portion thereof that a locker may be in attendance. The bonding warehousemen, who have invested a large amount of capital in providing bonding warehouses in various cities of the Commonwealth,' appear to fear that if only this nominal charge is made for private -warehouses their business will be seriously lessened, and I think that there is something in the contention. The bonding warehousemen have made every provision for the safety of the goods intrusted to their care, in the interest both of the Customs and of the public. The private bonds which will be charged this lower fee will be warehouses in which only the goods of the licensee may be stored, which limits their usefulness very much, and it is not an arrangement which should be received with favour by the authorities. </para>

                        <para>- To class 2 in schedule 2. If a merchant sold twenty chests of tea which he had in such a warehouse, and passed a Customs warrant for it, the goods would have to be instantly removed to another warehouse, or else his warehouse would become a general bond. Such an arrangement cannot be a great convenience to the general public ; and, as the bonding warehousemen contend with reason, if private bonds are very largely increased, the Customs will not have the same security. Generally these bonds will be portions of an ordinary warehouse partitioned off, and they will be supervised occasionally by a locker. On the whole, I think they are not a class of bond which should be largely encouraged. While the bonding, warehousemen do not object to these bonds being charged a lower fee than is charged on public bonds, they say that the fee should be higher than £25 a year, and suggest that it should be £100 a year. I think it is well, in the interests of the department, that private bonds should not be encouraged by too low a fee, because the public bonds provide ample accommodation for all the goods likely to be placed in bond by the general public, and where individual merchants doing an extensive business wish to have bonds of their own, £100 is not too much to ask them to pay for their accommodation. I do not propose to move an amendment, but I commend the matter to the consideration of the Minister. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. KINGSTON.-</inline> I look upon these warehouses as not so much a subject of revenue-- </para>

                        <para>- It is a delightful thing to have revenue forced upon us. But in my opinion, so long as the goods are secure, there is no reason for discouraging private bonds. In some of the States they are not so generally availed of as in others ; but, so long as there is no possibility of a loss of revenue, I think that they should not be interfered with unnecessarily. In Western Australia, private bonds are very common, and I believe that the charge for them is £50 per annum, and1s. 6d. an hour in addition for the services of a locker. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to accentuate the remarks which fell from the honorable member for Kennedy with regard to the charges upon bonding warehouses in the places mentioned in the schedule. For instance, Rockhampton, with a population of 16,000, according to the last census, is put on the same footing as Sydney and Melbourne, with a population of nearly 500,000 each. Townsville is also mentioned in the schedule. Surely there should be some discrimination. What the honorable member for Fremantle has contended with regard to Western Australia applies with equal force to Queensland, where the whole population of the State is only something over 500,000, and where the volume of business is very much smaller than in Sydney and Melbourne. </para>

                    <para>-I do not know why the people living in the smaller ports should be treated differently from those living in the larger ports. If a bond requires the entire services of a locker, they cannot be obtained for less than£200 per annum. In the larger bonds of Sydney and Melbourne two or more lockers may be required. It would be impossible for this Legislature to give differential treatment in respect to bonding warehouses between the different States. With regard to the fees for private, warehouses, the honorable member for Mernda was speaking entirely in the interests of the large capitalistic bondingwarehouses. </para>

                    <para>- I strongly support the argument of the honorable member for Darling Downs with regard to the fees for bonded warehouses, particularly in connexion with Rockhampton and Townsville. It is well-known that these towns have a very limited population - although they may be flourishing and prosperous, and I hope they will continue to be so- - and I think they deserve every consideration at the hands of the Minister. The Minister has left out the city of Geelong, evidently with the intention that Geelong shall benefit by the relaxation of the conditions, and I hope the Minister will take into consideration the two particular cities I have mentioned. There are no cities in Queensland that can be compared with Sydney or Melbourne, but I sincerely hope that the Minister will keep in mind our smaller centres of population, where the volume of trade is very much less than in the large cities of the south. </para>

                        <para>- I think the Minister has taken a little more power under this warrant than is given by the clause. I suppose that the clause to which this schedule is attached is clause 188, and I think it is rather a pity that the clauses to which the schedules are attached are not mentioned. The form of warrant that is provided for in the schedule gives the right to search any house, premises, or place, but under clauses188, 189, and 190, although the Customs-house officer has the right to break and enter, he has no right of search. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to know whether the Minister thinks it necessary to give a general warrant in these terms to any officer. It is the collector, I understand, who will grant the warrants, and I think it is very important that the warrant should be limited. I can quite understand the authority to the collector being very wide - wide enough to enable the warrant to be granted for any place - but I think it would be well worth the Minister's consideration whether the collector should not specify in the warrant the house that the officer may have the liberty to break open. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that this appears to go a good deal further than can be reasonably expected. I find that in the case of a distillery the Victorian law provides that an inspector of distilleries or other person authorized may enter upon premises and search for and seize any spirits the duty on which has not been paid, and which may be kept concealed. Under the warrant provided for in the schedule a Customs officer can enter any house or premises, and may remove any goods which he has reasonable grounds to suppose are forfeited. I think the warrant goes a great deal further than is reasonable, and I would ask the Minister not to carry things to the extreme, which he is apparently determined to do in this matter. </para>

                        <para>- I can assure the honorable member for Melbourne that a clause of this kind is necessary. Searches will have to be made for goods that are smuggled, and a warrant, which will have a month's currency, will be given by the collector to an officer. The. warrant need not specify any particular place, because it may be highly desirable that the officer should have power to go hither and thither as soon as he can, and if the place had to be specified on the warrant there would be no end of trouble. I will, however, look into the matter, and if I find that the powers generally conferred are exceeded I will modify the provision. </para>

I could not see how the Customs could have any jurisdiction to seal such stores down, or to interfere with the liberty of the ship-owners to use them for the passengers or crew during the continuance of the voyage to another Australian port. That was a matter that seemed to present a great deal of difficult}'', but this clause has reference to stores shipped in an Australian port for the use of the passengers and crew. I do not see the same serious objection to this clause as I had in view regarding another provision in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I would ask! the Minister if this clause does not practically create a preference for the final port of departure from the Commonwealth of these-' ships, as compared with the intermediate ports. For example, if a ship arrives at Adelaide, and is going on to Melbourne and Sydney, and then leaves Sydney for a port beyond the seas, as I understand it, entering outwards means that the next port of call has to be beyond the seas. </para>

                        <para>Instead of having trade between the States with different Tariffs, we have trade in one Commonwealth, and under these circumstances it appears to the Government that the proper course - seeing that the stores are practically consumed within. Australia - is to provide for the payment of duty on those stores for the benefit of the Australian revenue. That will be the natural effect of the Bill, and special reference is made to the matter in part VII. </para>

                    <para class="block">This brings us back to the question that was raised whether under the covering clause 5 of the Constitution Act the Minister has any right to charge duty on vessels entered outwards for ports beyond the seas. The point that they are beyond the limits of the Commonwealth is, it appears to me, a good point, and certainly one that has not been answered up to the present time. The effect of the clause will be that the only vessels which can get stores will be vessels entered outwards for ports beyond the seas, and which have a larger registered tonnage than 50 tons. That means that those vessels which are competing with our Australian - owned vessels will be placed at great advantage as compared with coastal steamers, which are defined in another place, and which are trading between here and Fremantle. I will give an instance. The steamers of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, the Orient Company, or the North German line will not, to my mind, be chargeable with duty under the clause. That being the case, they will have their stores free between here and Fremantle, and will be able to carry passengers with cheaper crews, and compete to the great disadvantage of the coastal steamers. J. know that is not the intention or desire of the Minister, and 1 would like to know whether, since the discussion took place, he has come to any definite decision on the subject. </para>

It would be a great pity indeed if the result of our deliberations were to compel our own people, and our local shipping, to compete at a disadvantage with oversea shipping. . </para>

                            <para>- I think we are all perfectly agreed on a point like that. The rule, as I say, with regard to stores - goods of various descriptions, such as provisions required for the service of the ship's crew and passengers - was that those goods could be delivered free when a ship was entered outwards for a foreign port. The idea was, though not in terms, that the goods were almost an export. The goodsdidnotenteriuto local consumption, and so they might be treated practically as if they were export. But that rule applied only to the case of foreign going ships, and did not apply to coasting ships - ships which as regards the commencement or end of their voyage, did not go beyond the particular State or country- rand for a good reason. The ships were locally employed, and the goods consumed on them were practically locally consumed by our own people, or under circumstances under which they might be considered within the State. Before we had federation, what was the position? Take the case of a State, say Victoria. There were three classes of ships. First, the local coaster going from Melbourne to Warrnambool. No stores were issued to her, she having to pay to the uttermost penny the amount of all duties on goods which the master might desire to take out of bond. On the other hand, take an Inter-State ship, trading between Victoria and South Australia. Victoria was then to South Australia as South Australia was to Victoria, a foreign country for the purposes of the Customs Act, and so the privilege was possessed by Inter-State vessels of having their stores duty free, just as if they took them to England, or elsewhere. They went to a foreign port, so far as the State was concerned. Of course the same rule applied with even greater force to oversea vessels, say from the old country or elsewhere, either commencing or finishing their voyage here. The position, by reason of federation, is now altered. As to the Inter-State ships, they no longer trade to foreign ports. </para>

                            <para>- There are the coasters, and the same rule which applied to State coasters, now applies, if the law is to be continued as we practically find it, to the Commonwealth coasters. These can no longer get their stores duty free. And while last year they competed with oversea ships on equal terms, they are now called upon to pay every penny- of duty on the stores they consume - a burden from which the oversea ship is free. Under these circumstances, it seems to me that it is the duty of the Government to prevent Commonwealth coasters being exposed to that disadvantage. If we leave the matter exactly as it was as regards the old ruling practice, the InterState ship, becoming a federal coaster, is handicapped to the extent of the stores on which she has to pay, which stores the oversea ship will get free. </para>

                            <para>- Of course there are two things in connexion with this question, of stores which we must not forget. There is the matter of getting the stores out of bond duty free, and the matter of surplus stores on the arrival of the ship. To deal with the matter efficaciously, in the interests of the Inter-State ship, which becomes a federal coaster, I think we must look at the two points - not only at the matter of the issue of stores from the warehouse duty free, but the matter of the restrictions to which the surplus stores shall be exposed on their entering into the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- If the right honorable and learned member will allow me I will give every possible information as I go along. This is a matter of some little importance on which honorable members are entitled to have the fullest information.It is a matter on which I have conferred with various Customs authorities, and that with a considerable amount of interest. Honorable members would possibly like to be informed what would be the position if we were to allow all coasters and other ships their stores duty free. It seems to me that we have no right whatever to differentiate between the Inter-State coaster and the purely local coaster. This is one Commonwealth, and it seems to me that we can no longer differentiate as to State ships and the extent of their voyages, but that what we give to the Inter-State coaster we ought to give to the local coaster. I am told in the estimate prepared by the various collectors of Customs that if all the vessels are allowed stores duty free it. will mean a difference of £60,000. Of course that is a matter which it is our duty to look at very closely before we decide on giving up that a mount of money. It is pointed out in the same estimate that if only those vessels engaged in foreign trade are allowed duty free stores, it will be a matter of £15,000. The collectors very properly guard their expressions in this connexion by the statement : - </para>

                            <para>- The system, as regards stores, has undoubtedly been abused, and that abuse has been brought under the notice of the authorities from time to time. I happened to have brought under my notice papers dated back as far as1885, in which the Collector of Customs in Sydney, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Powell,</inline> drew the attention of his Government to the matter, with the ' result that they communicated with the s other Australian Governments; Nothing, however, could be done for the reason which has so often prevented the protection of their common interests, namely, that there was no United Australia to deal with the matter. The honorable member for Melbourne rather took exception to some expression which I used when I was dealing with this question in my second reading speech. I had not then read the report which I now have, but it does seem to me that the conclusions which I drew are found to be abundantly justified if the expressions contained in the report which I am going to read are well founded. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Powell</inline> expressed himself as follows : - </para>

                    <para>I have the honour to bring under your notice for the information of the honorable the Colonial Treasurer an abuse of the allowance of bonded stores for the use of vessels engaged in the intercolonial trade. The general practice of Great Britain is to restrict the free use of bonded stores to vessels engaged on trips exceeding 40 days out and home. </para>
                    <para class="block">The British practice has been altered from time to tune, generally in the direction of enlarged concessions to the shipping trade, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Powell</inline> may fairly be regarded as being familiar with the condition of the law at the time of which he wrote.

                        <para>Before the separation of the colony of Queensland all the territory north of Sydney was regarded as coast-wise for trade purposes, and bonded stoves were not issued from warehouse for ships' use. The quantity of stores now shipped for consumption by vessels trading on the coast, north and. south, is in my opinion so great as to justify the inference that an illegal traffic is carried on to a very large extent - that our intercolonial traders are floating taverns- and that it is quite a recognised custom to sell tobacco to. passengers in small quantities for shore consumption without payment of duty thereon. It appears to me an unanswerable anomaly that passengers overland by train to Melbourne, by their consumption of dutiable articles, contribute <inline font-style="italic">per</inline> force to the revenue of the colony, and that passengers, crew, and all persons travelling by sea are not only allowed the free consumption of dutiable goods, but also abuse the concession by carrying dutiable goods to shore. In bringing this matter under notice, I am not indulging in any wild or speculative opinions. I have tested my conclusions by a close examination of Custom-house records, and they can be referred to in proof. 1 have taken the experience of twelve months, from 2nd June, 1884, to 3 1st May, 1885, limiting myself to steam vessels only, and confining myself to three articles. </para>

                    <para>Then the names of certain firms are mentioned. These I do not propose to read, but the total amount of duty which these firms would have paid - had they paid duty upon the stores which they, took out during that period - would have been £5,746. That is a matter of sixteen years ago, and honorable members can form some idea in the light of these figures </para>

I do not think that in the light of a return of this sort honorable members will be disposed to think that the figures which I referred to just now, and which are the estimate of the collectors, are in the slightest degree an overestimate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Powell</inline> goes on to say : - </para>

                    <para>The return is for Sydney only, and for three leading articles of general consumption. Bonded stores are also taken from the colonies of Victoria and Queensland, in addition to the above. This is a matter requiring unity of action between the colonies concerned. If we attempt to bring about a better state of things without the cooperation of Victoria, South Australia, and Queensland, the effect will be injury to our trade, without any corresponding advantage. I attach very little value to any attempt in the direction of restricting the quantities supplied. It is tried in Great Britain, but rendered almost useless by the difficulty of defining voyages. The old rule of restricting the use of bonded stores to vessels engaged in voyages occupying more than 40 days, out and home, practically met the difficulty. </para>
                    <para class="block">That was the report of the Collector of Customs in Sydney which was brought under the notice of his Government, and which formed the subject of a despatch from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stuart,</inline> who was then Premier. He invited attention to the report from the collector, and suggested the advisableness of the adoption, for the protection of the fair trader, and also for the protection of the revenue, of the English rule, which restricts the free use of bonded stores to vessels engaged on trips exceeding 40 days out and home. The matter was looked into, and the conclusion come to was a very natural one under the circumstances, viz., that they could not do anything without uniform legislation on the subject. They had not the power to deal with the subject in the way its importance deserved. Three or four years ago the matter was again brought under the notice of the colonies, and an estimate was formed as regards three or four firms carrying on business in South Australia as to the difference it made to the colony. That estimate was a sum of £8,000. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, per annum. The amounts were carefully taken out and checked item by item. It seems to me clear beyond the possibility of doubt, therefore, that we are losing a considerable amount of money by abstaining from collecting duties in respect of ship's stores. As regards the one point of loss to the revenue there is no difficulty in establishing that, and I have already put the second point, which is that from the very creation of the Commonwealth, the Inter-State ships having become federal coasters will lose the privileges they previously possessed, and unless we do something in this connexion will be exposed to competition to which it is hardly fair that they should be subjected. What is our position? What are we to do? The Government idea is that we ought to collect from all - that it is practically Australian consumption. It is rather difficult to get a clear statement of the precise position in some of the longer Customs works, but I have had made available for my perusal a memorandum by the Solicitor to the Customs department in England, dated 1888, which treats most clearly of this question of Customs stores. It says, among other things - </para>

                        <para>The word "stores" is a term which has a large technical meaning in Customs phraseology. It relates to vessels going to or coming from a foreign voyage, and means articles of food or consumption on 'board such vessels. It has long been the policy to permit the storing free of duty of articles, otherwise dutiable, on board vessels going to foreign parts, and to give certain facilities for similar consumption in British waters of stores on vessels arriving from ports beyond the seas. </para>

The articles so shipped are particularly specified on papers to be furnished by the master, and must be covered either by a bond given by him, or, in some special cases, by the store dealer, such bond undertaking that the goods shall be duly shipped,' carried clear of the territorial waters, and in due course consumed on board. </para>

                            <para>- The passage which I have just read, makes the breaking of locks; or seals placed on stores on any vessel, whether committed in the port in which the seal is affixed, or in any other port, or in any intermediate waters, a serious offence. If that authority is correct, it means that when a seal is placed upon stores in any port, it is expected that the vessel will arrive in some other port without the seal having been broken while she was in intermediate waters. </para>

                            <para>- The Customs officer can allow just what he pleases, subject of course to his compliance with any rules which may be laid down for his guidance. Whatever the goods he puts his seal upon, that seal must be respected. What a monstrous position we should be placed in, if it were held that immediately a vessel got beyond three miles from the coast, those on board could do what they pleased with her stores, and would not be held accountable in the slightest degree for the condition in which she arrived at the next port. If the Customs seals are to be broken when a vessel gets beyond three miles from the coast, coastal ships as well as over-sea vessels would be able to evade our authority, because in their passages from one State to another, their courses often take them beyond the three miles limit. </para>

                            <para>- Therefore if we are to be held incapable of dealing with oversea ships, we should run a good deal of risk in dealing with federal coasters under the provisions in the covering section of the Constitution. A steamer trading from New Zealand, Tasmania, and on to Fremantle would be entitled to certain privileges which would not be possessed by the truly local coaster, because she would not come within the covering provisions of the Constitution; but I put it to the committee - and I do so with very great diffidence, because of my want of actual personal knowledge on the subject - that the right of the Customs officer to go on board a ship and to seal down her stores, and our right to legislate for certain penalties if the ship arrives in another Australian port with her seals broken, is practically undoubted.It would be strange indeed if we did not possess that right, because' it would lead to results of a character which it is highly desirable we should avoid.

                    <para class="block">Amount matters very little in connexion with a matter of this sort. I think - and I believe honorable members will be disposed to agree with Bie - that we have the power to regulate this matter as we please.. And the next question its - How shall we regulate it? I think we ought to regulate it with some regard for the revenue, and without disregarding sources of- revenue to which we can properly have recourse, and which require coasting vessels, in all cases when within the jurisdiction of the country to which they belong, to contribute to the revenue. The question is whether our coasters shall be exposed to undue competition of the character I have mentioned. This is a subject, of interest, and one which I believe all sides will be prepared . to discuss with a view to do what is best in the interests of our trade and" commerce and credit, and without any party feeling whatever. And now, having in response to the requests of honorable members stated the way in which it appears to the Government that the matter ought to be regulated, we leave it in the hands of the House. </para>

                        <para>- I think I followed the Minister correctly, but as the question is one of considerable importance, there should be no I doubt in the matter. I would ask the Minister to tell me if I have followed him correctly. I will put a concrete case. We will, assume that a ship arrives from England at Fremantle, intending subsequently to call at Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and possibly Brisbane. If the ship takes her stores from Fremantle or Adelaide for the whole of the subsequent voyage, and seals up the portion ' which is intended to be consumed between the final port of departure and the port beyond the seas, do I understand that the other portion of the stores intended to be used on the voyage along the coast from one port to another will have to pay duty ? </para>

                        (Corinella). - As far as I am concerned I think it is perfectly clear that oversea ships while engaged in federal traffic should be on the same footing as federal ships, but I confess that I cannot see in the Bill so far' the provisions necessary to secure that object. I should like to know if it is the Minister's view that the sealing up of the ship's stores can be done under regulation, because I do not- see any authority in the Bill for sealing up stores under the circumstances detailed by the Minister.

                            <para>- I would suggest to the Minister that there is a possible means of getting over the question of jurisdiction, if we have not already got over it under the clause. Clause 181 provides that the seals -placed on any goods by an officer of the Customs are not to be broken. I think it was the honorable and learned member for Bendigo who raised the question as to whether the breaking of seals on the high seas, even between ports within the Commonwealth, could be regarded as within the scope of our power of regulation, in view of the limitations of covering section 5 of the Constitution Act. I would point out, however, that we could make it an offence for a ship to come into port with a broken seal it would not matter where the seal was broken, we could make the offence punishable. I do not think clause 181 does that, but if it is made an offence for a ship to come into port with a broken seal, we could get over the difficulty that has been raised with reference to our jurisdiction. </para>

                            <para>- I think we would have the power to do it, although we should not do such a thing. At Fremantle, a Customs officer, under the authority of the Act or regulation, would put seals on the goods, and we could make it a punishable offence for the ship to turn up at, say, Adelaide with a broken seal. If we framed the clause properly, the court would not inquire where the seal was broken, but would hold that it was apparently within our power to say that the ship should not come into port with a seal broken: That seems to me to offer a certain way of getting over the jurisdiction difficulty. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; we could prohibit all red-haired ship's captains from coming into port if we chose ; but what we could do, and what we would do, are two different things. This is a matter of insuring jurisdiction in a case in which we probably ought to have jurisdiction. The honorable member for Gippsland put the case of a ship coming from oversea, and -proceeding from Fremantle to Melbourne and Sydney, after having shipped at Fremantle the stores necessary to carry her from Sydney to a port beyond the seas, in addition to the stores required for her passengers and crew while she was on the voyage along the coast. I do not think that a ship could take free stores on board at Fremantle or before Teaching Sydney, because she would not be entered outwards. </para>

                            <para>- But the Minister cannot take security for a thing he has no authority to enforce in someway under the provisions. I do not think it could be held that the Customs could take security for a ship to do something if there was no law authorizing the Customs to require the ship to do it. I draw the Minister's attention to the matter, because we ought to make sure that ships will not be able to take stores from Sydney, duty free to Fremantle, on the way to London, because in such case a large portion of our object will be defeated.

                        (East Sydney).- No doubt, this is in one sense a small matter, but it is. really one of the most difficult matters the Ministry will have to deal with. There would be no difficulty at all if ships arriving from beyond sea or departing from our ports, to places beyond seas, were ships belonging to the Commonwealth. But we are not exactly in the same position in regard to those-ships as are ships in relation to the British law. For the purpose of safeguarding our Customs revenue against the landing of ships' stores, we have every power we possibly want. But I think the Minister is. wrong when he .says, that, if these oversea . ships can go behind the law, the coasters . also can go behind our law. There is a great distinction between the two.

                            <para>- That paragraph means, something. It means that vessels arriving ; in the ports of the Common wealth from, beyond the sea, are not subject to the laws . of the Commonwealth. Of course there is, I .' admit, a qualification, because for the purpose of protecting the Customs against the landing of dutiable goods without paying the duty, there is, of course, full power of legislation. But the difficulty is in the fact that these stores are taken on board beyond our jurisdiction in the case of oversea ships, and are not intended to be landed. They are never intended to reach any Australian port or to be consumed on Australian soil ; therefore they are not goods which come under the control of the Customs, except for the purpose of preventing their being landed. That is a distinction to which we must pay some regard. The strongest test of our power is, I think, to be found in the mother country. Surely we have no greater power over foreign vessels than the Imperial Parliament have over foreign vessels. I suppose we will all admit that what the Imperial Parliament cannot do with regard to French ships, we cannot do with reference to ships beyond our jurisdiction. Even the most patriotic Australian will admit that. Foreign ships can go to the ports of England, and can trade, calling on their voyage at different ports on the coast of England, and yet the British authorities cannot touch the ship's stores. </para>

                            <para>- It is not a concession,, but it has been held in the courts over and over again. I am sure I am going on very good authority when 1 rely on the book which the Minister has handed to me. It was in consequence of the fact that foreign ships could not be interfered with in this way that the same concession was extended to British ships. This book was prepared, I believe, by the solicitor to the British department of Customs. </para>

                            <para>- It is very singular that the book touches all the difficulties in a few paragraphs that we are concerned about. It first of all deals with the surplus stores on vessels arriving from foreign ports. There is no difficulty about the stores taken from on shore, because the Customs department can prevent any movement of dutiable goods from the shore. The more serious difficulty is as to the surplus stores brought by vessels from beyond the seas. Do not let us forget that there are two sides even to the question of our trading interests. "We must not forget that after we shall have attempted to deal with this matter in the way proposed, ships coming from beyond seas can possibly escape by bringing a sufficient quantity of stores so as not to be compelled to do business with Australian merchants at all. </para>

                            <para>- I am not on the question of sealing. If the vessel's taking out of stores is to be made the subject of difficulties and duties whilst she is in Australian ports, clearly she will not buy her stores here at all, but will bring a sufficient quantity for all her requirements. One of the serious difficulties will be that a very large trade in the sale of ships' stores to vessels going along our coasts will be destroyed. </para>

What a French ship can do in spite of British laws and of the British Government, a French ship can do in spite of the Commonwealth laws. I submit that the mother of Parliaments has greater power of legislation than we have ; at least I should think so, especially when she has expressly exempted oversea ships from the laws of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I did not mean in the case of which the honorable member is thinking, but in the case which I am about to state. Supposing that a ship from London takes 50 passengers from Sydney, is not that ship entitled to have stores for the crew and passengers who travel on board between London and Sydney ? That is not an unjust proposal, surely. That is the trade in which the ship is engaged. But the effect of this provision will be that the ship's business will be interfered with, and she will be held to have arrived with her Sydney passengers when she arrives at Fremantle, because within that time they will be considered to be practically within the Commonwealth. The authority , goes on to show how, in England, they met these difficulties in a perfectly fair and reasonable way. He says - </para>

                    <para>However the arrangement has to be carried out with a careful provision against abuse ; estimated quantities for use while the vessel lies in the first port, are allowed out there only ; and when the vessel leaves that port a further, estimated quantity to last until arrival at the second port, and so on. </para>
                    <para class="block">Here is a ship which lands her passengers at Fremantle. They go off the requirements of the ship. Then the Customs authorities, knowing how many passengers are going from Fremantle to Adelaide, estimate the quantity of stores which will constitute a sufficient allowance for the passengers and the crew till they reach the next port. They give them their own stores free of duty. If there is any power to put persons travelling on oversea ships under the same rule that would apply to coasters, every one must see the thorough fairness of the proposal. We are all behind the Minister there. If a person gets on board at Fremantle, and if the law is to be that coasters from Fremantle are to pay for their stores taken on board, we are all. absolutely with the Minister in endeavouring to provide that passengers going on board a foreign ship at Fremantle shall be treated on exactly the same terms. Does the Minister admit with reference to passengers who come from London to Sydney, that it would be the duty of the Customs, while sealing up the surplus stores to leave out sufficient for the consumption of such passengers in such oversea ships, whilst they are travelling between Fremantle and then port of destination? </para>

                            <para>- This subject is difficult enough without starting other conundrums. If Canada did what the honorable member suggests, it must have been with the sanction of the British authorities. Either they gave power to Canada to frame such laws, or they assented to the Bill which contained such provisions. But the point in my mind is, first of all, " Can we put foreign ships on the same footing as coasters with reference to passengers coming from London to the last port of call " ? I do not think we can. I hope that the Government will, if there is any possibility of trouble, separate that matter from this Bill. It will be a calamity if some infinitesimal thing, compared with the utility of the measure itself, were to hang it up in any way. I do not wish to express any opinion contrary to the Government. If there is any doubt about it, however,would it not be better to separate this thing, which may touch important issues ? But that is a matter for subsequent consideration. What I wish to point out is the practice in the mother country in this respect. There, when a vessel leaves the first port of call on the British coast, a further estimated quantity of stores to last till her arrival at the second port, is given out. Applying that practice, let us suppose that a vessel arrives at Fremantle. There a sufficient allowance of stores is given out to last the vessel until her arrival in Adelaide. At that port the Adelaide passengers go out. The Customs authorities then estimate the quantity of stores that will be required to, last the ship until her arrival at Melbourne, and so on. That is the practice in the. mother country, and according to the language of the book which I have quoted, it has been held that foreign ships are entitled to the same treatment. If a ship is foreign territory - and a British ship is foreign territory in certain respects in connexion even with us, just as is a French ship - and the passengers are on that ship upon the high seas, there seems no power in this Commonwealth to tax the goods consumed by those passengers. But I admit the absolute power of the Customs, with reference to any vessel trading between our ports,' to protect the revenue of the Commonwealth, against ships' stores being consumed within the Commonwealth under circumstances which make them liable to duty. I consider, however, that a man who is in transit from London to Sydney upon a vessel calling at Adelaide, is not in that position. The goods which he consumes have not been imported into the country. </para>

For instance, if he commits murder or theft, he may be tried within the Commonwealth ; but 1 am not speaking so much of the presence in port of a ship. The moment a ship gets away on the high seas, our jurisdiction would not follow it, except under special enactment. Of course, we know that certain persons who commit crimes on the high seas, can be tried at our local courts. But that is under special enactment. I do not wish to discourage the Minister's idea to put coasters and foreign vessels upon an equality. It is not to be forgotten that there is a method of simplifying this difficulty, and of making the conditions absolutely equal. </para>

                            <para>- That is another matter to be considered, but we must not forget that it is so. It is possible to put the coasters on a footing of absolute equality with foreign going ships by allowing them to have their stores" duty free. If the revenue requires that we shall make this charge in reference to coasting traffic, I have not one word to say in antagonism to .the Minister's idea to put both coastal and foreign-going ships upon an equality. My only doubt is as to whether the Customs would have power to, deprive the class of passengers to whom I have referred of the use of ships' stores whilst continuing the voyage between Fremantle and Sydney. It may be perfectly right to say that we want to safeguard the revenue by giving them an allowance sufficient for all purposes ; and to add " as you are approaching other ports where the ship's goods may be smuggled ashore, we, for the protection of the revenue, put our seal upon your stores." That brings the matter down to a mere figment. In that case it would be mere talk about words. But the Minister wants to go further and to say - " I want to give you out an allowance on the inward voyage, but the moment you touch our ports everything consumed by. the London passengers, and by the crew going to Sydney, shall pay duty to the Commonwealth." That is a substantial matter, about which it is worth while talking. I question very much whether we have the power to go so far. I admit the right of the Customs to take every precaution to prevent these goods from being landed and consumed; but, as long as they are genuinely applied to the purposes for which they were put on board, I. very much question the power of the Government to enforce such a provision as is proposed. I might point out that by the very intention of this clause the Government recognise that a ship may bring a ship's stores from abroad into the Commonwealth, and bring enough to last her on the home voyage. Therefore, the main point as to the right of a ship to have dutiable goods on board - so as they are not landed and consumed in the Commonwealth - is not at all in question." "What I have said would undoubtedly follow. Even if the Government ' were able to apply this provision to all dutiable goods consumed between Fremantle and Sydney, we must be prepared for a great sacrifice of Australian trade, because assuredly, instead of buying their goods in Australia for the home voyage, ships would lay in a sufficient quantity at the other end to last them that return voyage. " Ships' stores " is a much wider term than is commonly supposed. It comprises all sorts of things necessary to the working of a ship which come under the head of ship chandlery. There is a large Australian trade done in these things with oversea ships. Of course, if the ship chandlery is free of duty, as in the New South Wales ports, there is no trouble. </para>

                    <para class="block">But if we impose a Tariff similar to the Victorian Tariff, where I suppose almost every -article of this kind is, to some extent, liable to duty, we must seriously consider whether, in the case of a vessel which has come from over the seas, what we may gain in duties on the consumption by passengers between Fremantle and Sydney would warrant us in destroying what I am informed is a very valuable trade - the supplying of oversea ships with stores. I am sorry that the Minister, who has had a calculation made as to the amount of the duties that the Customs authorities might lose, has not also had a calculation made as to the amount of the Australian trade that may be lost in supplying these ships with stores. There are two sides to the question, and I hope that the Government will take it into consideration. </para>

                        (Indi). - I think we all agree with the Minister that we must see that the .Australian coasting vessels are not 'placed at any disadvantage in competing with oversea vessels which engage in coastal trade. But it seems to me that one or two of the observations which have fallen from the leader of the Opposition contain a large amount of justice, and I do not think that the cases he put are provided foi'. If a vessel bringing passengers' from London for Fremantle, and various other Australian ports round to Sydney, carries no Australian passengers from port to ports it seems to me' that she does not enter into competition with the coasting vessels, and therefore 1 fail to see why she -should pay duty upon the stores she has brought from London, and which are consumed by her passengers and crew between Fremantle and Sydney. But if she takes Australian passengers between ports, and thus comes into competition with the coasting trade, she must take the consequences, inasmuch as we could not discriminate be- tween the quantity oE stores consumed by her through passengers, and the quantity of stores consumed by the passengers travelling from port to port.

I should like to point out, however, that, as was pointed out by the honorable and learned member for Corinella, -a rather inconsistent state of things will exist under the Bill as it stands.

The- Minister interjected that those stores would be sealed up, but it seems to me that under the Bill they could not be sealed up.

                            <para>- Of course we can, and I am pointing out that it will be necessary to amend the clause. I want to emphasize the fact that the honorable and learned member for Corinella is perfectly right, and that as the Bill stands we deal in one way with ships' stores between Fremantle and Sydney, and in another way between Sydney and Fremantle. With regard to the doubt expressed by the leader of the Opposition with respect to the power of this Parliament to enforce regulations, it is quite true that a Messageries Maritimes vessel leaving an Australian port with her stores sealed might go 10 miles to sea and break the seals and use the goods, and not be liable for any penalty under the Commonwealth laws for what she did whilst at sea : but it is also true that if that vessel came again within the Commonwealth jurisdiction without a seal which had been placed on her stores at a previous port, or with that seal broken, the Commonwealth might inflict a penalty upon her for coming into port in that condition. I think there is no question as to the fact that we can make any laws we like for the regulation of the InterState and foreign commerce of the Commonwealth. Our power is certainly not( so shortened that we are prevented from safeguarding our revenue, and enforcing our laws, merely where a ship has gone outside our territorial jurisdiction to break them. In my opinion, it is quite competent for us to enact that if a foreign merchant vessel leaves one Australian port- with her stores sealed up, and arrives at another Australian port with the seals broken, the captain, officers, or owner shall be liable to a penalty. </para>

                        (Werriwa).- Section 5 of the Constitution Act clearly gives us power to deal Avith the stores of vessels whose first port of clearance and port of destination are within the Commonwealth. I think that the members of the committee are agreed that Ave have power to legislate Avith respect to such vessels, even though they may go beyond the 3-mile limit. The real point at issue seems to be whether we have poWer to deal Avith ships arriving from over the seas, whose port of destination is within the Commonwealth, because they happen to touch at some port within the

That is to say, if a vessel from over the seas calls at Fremantle on her way to Sydney, have Ave power to charge her duty on the stores she consumes between Fremantle and Sydney? I think that Ave should be very careful before trying to exercise such a power. Take the case instanced by the leader of the Opposition, that of a French ship whose stores are. sealed at Albany. Does the Minister for* Trade and Customs think that if the seal's were broken while the vessel was outside the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth the French Government would sit quietly by and allow us to exercise rights over what they would consider French territory ? </para>

                            <para>- That seems to me a case that Ave should take notice of. We have passed beyond the time when Ave legislated, as individual States. If in the State Parliaments Ave had tried to assert an authority such as Ave are. trying to assert now, our remarks Would have merely provoked contempt and ridicule.. Now Ave are legislating as a Commonwealth. Our actions here- not the utterances of members - but the actions of the Parliament itself, and of the Executive of the Commonwealth Will be a'ery much more serious, and </para>

                    <para>Ave shall be held responsible for them. If Ave are to be held responsible for these actions, and it is intended to attempt to exercise . authority over German or French ships, it seems -to me our first duty will be to provide ourselves with a A'ery large navy, because we shall certainly come into conflict Avith those nations. Honorable members must remember that some of the most, bitter struggles that took place at the beginning of the last century were due to the right of search claimed by British ships oyer foreign ships, in many cases for the purpose of trying to prevent smuggling. England. gave up that right. One of the chief objectors to her exercise of the right was America, and the Avar of 1814 was brought about by the difficulties arising over this a'ery question. As a Commonwealth Parliament Ave are bound to take matters o£ this kind into consideration, when it is proposed that we shall exercise control over these foreign boats. It has been stated that a penalty may be claimed for an act committed on board one of these foreign ships, when they are entirely outside our jurisdiction, but I do not think that the Minister of Customs ought to raise such a contentious point in a Bill like this. If the Minister desires to get the Bill through, would it not be advisable to see that we are clearly within our rights under the Constitution, and that the powers we propose to exercise come within the definition of covering section 5 of the Constitution Act. If it is desired to reach these foreign ships, some separate provisions might be made after this Act is assented to by the Governor-General, or the matter might be dealt with in a separate Bill. If we intend to have our Customs Regulation Act brought into force before the uniform Tariff comes into operation, and I suppose we do, it does not seem desirable that we should risk the delay that would occur in the case of the Governor-General having to reserve the Bill for the Royal assent. I was a little struck by hearing one or two strong protectionist members make an admission that the collection of these duties on ships' stores would increase the price of the articles. </para>

                            <para>- In view of the very serious international difficulties that might arise in connexion with this question, I would ask the Minister whether it would not be wise to deal with the question in two divisions, dealing in one case with the ships over which we know we have full jurisdiction, and in the other case with foreign ships, regarding which our jurisdiction is doubtful, even according to the views expressed by some of the Ministers themselves. It seems to me that the proposal to tax these ships' stores all round will probably have another effect which it behoves the representatives of Western Australia and Queensland to consider. Supposing that we are able to establish our jurisdiction over the oversea, ships in the way that is contemplated, I would like honorable members to consider what the probable effect will be upon our outlying ports. We know how difficult it is to get these large ocean steamers to call at outlying ports where it is especially desired that they shall call, in order to develop trade. These steamers have sometimes as many as 700 or 800 souls on board, and if the cost of ships' stores, whilst these vessels are travelling along our coast, is increased to any appreciable extent by the imposition of duties, the effect may be to prevent ships from calling at the outlying ports. </para>

                            <para>- We have been told that the prices of stores will be raised by these duties, and supposing that we are successful in taxing the stores used on these boats, and there is no international difficulty, is there not a danger of our preventing these great steamers from calling at such ports as Albany in Western Australia, and Cairns and Townsville, in Queensland, and thus to a very large extent destroying the trade of those places. It may be that if we carry things with too high a hand the whole of our outlying trade will ultimately be carried by tramp steamers coming direct from one place to another, whilst the big ships will call only at Melbourne and Sydney, without touching anywhere else. Take the case of one of the boats such as came out only a few days ago with over 1,000 souls on board. The difference in the cost of the stores duty free, and subject to duty, would be probably quite £1,000, and that would be a very important consideration. I think the Minister for Customs might well consider the, propriety of adopting the suggestion I have thrown out. </para>

                        (East Sydney). - I want to put only one point in reference to the view expressed by the honorable and learned member for Indi. It only shows how different two sets of circumstances must be if, as has been contended, there is an authority which protects the Customs seal over property on a French ship on the high seas. Let us suppose that a Customs officer has been put on board a French ship in Sydney - that a seal has been put upon the stores of that ship, and that the officer has been placed on board to see that the stores, are not used between Sydney and Melbourne. The captain may use physical force to remove the officer and take the stores, and in the course of the struggle - perhaps not intentionally but actually - the Customs officer may be killed. In such a case, could that captain be tried by the Commonwealth law, on arrival at Melbourne, for the murder of the Customs officer? The captain would be under the French flag on a French ship, and would be a Frenchman himself. The law is carried so far in that case that the court here would have no jurisdiction to try the captain for the murder of the Customs officer.

                            <para>- That is a reply worthy of the honorable member, and the corpse, and the argument - I do not make any distinction between the three. As matters stand now, let us suppose that on a British ship trading between New Zealand and Sydney a murder was committed. We could only try the supposed murderer for the offence in Sydney under an Imperial statute that gives us power to do it, and the basis of our right to proceed is that it must be proved that the ship on which the alleged murder occurred was a British-owned ship sailing under the British flag. I say that the matter is one of great difficulty. I do not wish to say that the honorable and learned member for Indi is wrong-- </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps not, but it shows the integrity of a French ship as French territory on the high seas, and if that integrity is strong enough to prevent a French captain being tried for the murder of a Customs officer engaged in protecting Commonwealth interests, according to the law of the Commonwealth, it throws some doubt upon the question whether he could be punished for breaking a Customs seal. </para>

                        <para>- I would like to know what attitude the Minister is going to take up in regard to this question. If there is anything in the position taken by the leader of the Opposition we are presented the alternative of exempting from duty all stores on our coasting vessels, or declaring that no foreign vessels shall carry colonial goods or passengers between Commonwealth ports. That is the attitude that I believe has been taken up by Canada. I know it has been taken up by the United States, and I think Canada did the same thing byway of retaliation. I hope it is not contemplated to allow a distinction to be made between Commonwealth-owned boats and those that come from abroad. That would be manifestly unfair, and even if the consequences be, as the honorable and learned member for Werriwa has stated, it would not be proper to allow that unfair competition with our steam-ship owners. </para>

                            <para>- There is no complexity whatever about that. An attempt has been made to cast some doubt on the position contended for, namely, that we have a right to see that the seals which are put on stores in Australian ports shall be respected, and to punish the vessel if she makes an appearance in another port with those seals broken. I confess I really cannot recognise the force of any contention to the contrary. Wherever the goods may come from - whether they be cargo or stores - we require a proper accounting for them in accordance with our law. As to the vessel when she first appears, if she does not account for her cargo, she is subject to penalty, and similarly as regards her stores; and what we can do on her first appearance we can do afterwards. </para>

                        <para>- When this subject was debated on the second reading speech I entertained considerable doubt as to whether the Commonwealth had jurisdiction over ships coming from oversea, say Orient liners from London, while they were on the seas travelling between Australian ports. I was inclined to agree with the right honorable member for East Sydney at the time, but on reflection I am now disposed to think that the attitude Of the Minister is correct, and that the Federal Parliament has complete and full jurisdiction over, at any rate, British ships coming from the old country and travelling between Australian ports. My authority for that view is the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act, 57 and 58 Vict., chap. 60, section 736, where it is provided - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the Imperial Statute. Power is conferred on the Parliament of the Commonwealth to deal with all British ships engaged in the coastal trade. Here we have authority to exercise the same power that the Imperial Parliament itself can exercise over shipping within the British dominions. So far as statutory authority is concerned, I think we have ample power to deal with British ships. It has recently been suggested in England that the power conferred in this Act is not limited within territorial waters, but follows a ship anywhere along its course between port and port, beyond the 3 miles limit. </para>

                            <para>- According to the definition, "coasting trade" within the meaning of that Act, is not limited to vessels travelling within territorial waters. So it seems to me that the Minister is right in the contention that he has power to legislate - and it ought to be done by legislation and not by regulation - for British ships in the direction suggested. The power ought to be founded on express legislation within the four corners of the proposed Bill, and should not be dealt with by regulation. </para>

Undoubtedly serious difficulties and complications may be anticipated, and these will have to be dealt with - with a considerable amount of caution, judgment, and discrimination. But as regards British ships, such as the Orient and Peninsular and Oriental ships, and others coming from British possessions, I entertain not the slightest doubt that legislation in the direction proposed by the Minister will be not only just and reasonable, but absolutely constitutional and consistent with the principles of international law. </para>

                        McEACHARN (Melbourne). - I am very pleased indeed to observe the tone of the debate, and the disposition on the part of the committee to do that which is fair and just to the steamers owned on the coast. That has been my main point right through the consideration of this Bill. I have endeavoured to fight any questions where I thought any hardship was involved to those at a distance, and have tried to improve the Bill. Where ship-owners are interested from a monetary point of view, we have no desire to shirk the responsibility to pay what is due to the Customs, so long as we are put on a perfectly fair footing with those who compete with us on the coast. The difficulty I have felt up to to-day is that under section 5 of the Constitution Act there might be no possibility whatever of dealing with foreign trading vessels. That difficulty, however, appears to be wiped away to-day, and therefore we have to see how we can amend this Bill or make some arrangement by which both classes of shipping shall be fairly dealt with and put on an equal footing. I would like the Minister to consider whether that would not be better done by &amp; separate Bill. If, however, he is desirous that it should be. done under the present Bill, he should frame a clause that will meet the matter. So far as coastal steamers are concerned, there will be no difficulty whatever. There will be no necessity for seals or anything of the. kind, because the steamers will take their goods on board, having paid the duty, and, therefore, they will be free of the Customs, because it will be known they cannot gain any advantage by landing duty paid goods. But there will be greater difficulty where steamers from abroad are concerned. The case in London has been very well put by the leader of the Opposition. A steamer or a sailing vessel arrives there - it does not matter whether it is a foreign vessel or not - and as soon as she arrives her dutiable goods are put under seal, a certain quantity being left out free for the use of the crew - not passengers - because there are seldom passengers. When the vessel arrives they are landed. But the officer will come down at the end of three clays, and will allow other goods out only for two or three days at a time. That would be very inconvenient here, so far as steamers trading on the coast are concerned. It might very well be done with timber vessels, which cany only small crews on board, but even in that case it is doubtful, whether it would be wise to allow them that privilege. The Minister has given figures showing that it will cost the coastal steamers about £45,000 a year.

                            <para>- Yes, on the New South Wales rivers ; but£4,000, or £5,000, or even £10,000 is not a great deal. Assuming that the amount represented £10,000, that would mean £35,000 altogether, apart from the £15,000 of which the Minister has spoken. I do not think it would be as much as that. The estimate which I gave was £21,000. That estimate was arrived at in a rough and ready way by taking a steamer of a certain, size, and calculating what the duty would be upon the goods consumed on board, and by allowing so much additional for the larger steamers. </para>

                            <para>- No ; we could make our regulations for sealing up the stores. These steamers when they arrived would have to announce whether they were going to carry passengers from Fremantle. If they were going to carry passengers the seal would be put on the stores, except on a quantity sufficient to allow the captain to provide food and liquor for the passengers as far as Adelaide, and so on, till the next port was reached. It could be dealt with by regulation, and I do not see why the Minister should not accept my proposal as a solution of the difficulty. </para>

                            <para>- They are not my arrangements as proposed to this House. It would not be at all a desirable thing to offer a premium to boats either to refrain from or to engage in the trade. They come here, carry passengers and goods over Australian waters and into Australian ports and during the time they are so engaged, irrespective of whether they take a passenger from here or from there, they undoubtedly compete with trade which would otherwise be enjoyed by the Australian coasters, and I ask honorable members to vote for the clause as we have it. I should like to say to the honorable and learned member for Bendigo that I am glad he is with us upon the point of our having; authority ; but I think it is not necessary to rest our case on the statutory authority to which he particularly referred, for that seems to be aimed more at legislation with respect to shipping. This is a matter of customs laws, and there is some distinction between shipping and customs laws. We enjoy the largest powers as regards the framing of necessary legislation for the protection of our revenue, and I do not think it is. necessary to rest our claim for the exercise of those powers on the statutory authority to which the honorable and learned member has referred. </para>

                        (Werriwa).- I regret that I cannot agree with the quotation given by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo. I do not think that the Merchant Shipping Act applies. This is a matter that affects interests far beyond those of our nation. We are affecting the rights of others, and I think therefore that the fullest- opportunity should be afforded for discussion, and we should thresh the matter out as far as we possibly can. I disagree with the quotations from the Merchant Shipping Act. I do not think they have any application whatever to the point with which we are dealing. That Act does not provide for circumstances such as confront us. No discussion has taken place as to the right of the Customs to make regulations dealing with any kind of ship - whether British or foreign - while it is within our harbors. We can place our seals upon all the stores and goods of any French or German ship within our harbors, and the consumption of the stores would then be a matter entirely for the Customs, except of course in the case of a ship of war, which is considered for the time being the territory of the particular nation to which it belongs. But as regards merchant ships - French,German, or American - the moment they come within our waters they are within the jurisdiction of our customs laws, and can be dealt with accordingly. I. did not intend to ask the Minister to debate that point. The point with me is as to our position the moment we get outside those limits. The question is, " What power can we exercise over foreign going ships the moment they have passed outside of the three-mile limit "? That is the point with which we have to deal. The Minister claims that he can exercise control over them. I do not think he can, and I do not think he ought to jeopardize this Bill in that way. I think that possibly he will be delaying the introduction of the Tariff during the current session if this Bill passes in its present form, because it seems to me that the Governor-General, if properly advised, will not give his assent to a Bill which might bring us into collision with other nations. One point which I desire to emphasize is that when we were in State Parliaments we were accustomed to hear honorable members talk in a braggadocio tone about going to war with 40 or 50 millions of people. At that time nobody attached any importance to our utterances.

                            <para>- Eight years ago. I have not had the pleasure of being brought up in the same colony as the honorable member without knowing something about it. The Minister seems disposed to brush this question aside, but now that we are a nation, we must speak in an entirely different fashion. We cannot have men proposing - as one man did - to annex the whole of the Pacific Islands in a light and airy fashion. When we have the Executive of the Federal Parliament attempting to assume powers, we shall find that we cannot go beyond the law of nations; and at the present time it seems clear that we are attempting, by the Customs Act, to go beyond that law. That is what I am protesting against. The difficulties already in connexion with this matter are great enough without trying to add to them. I feel surprised at the light manner in which the Ministry seem disposed to treat this matter. If we are going to bring in questions: of this sort we shall require not only a large standing army of a million men or more, but we shall also require to create a large navy. I am opposed to both a large navy and a large military force. It seems to me, from the tone adopted by certain honorable members on the Ministerial side of the Chamber, that it may be necessary for us all to submit to conscription, since at the dawn of our nationhood we are preparing to infringe the law of nations by compelling French and American and other foreign vessels to carry our Customs officers on board when outside our territorial limits- </para>

                            <para>- I believe that we are considerably exceeding our powers ; and that being so I have tried to enter as strong a protest as is possible. I guarantee that if' we place a Customs officer on board an American vessel the captain will know bis rights, and will not care twopence whether we do or do not know ours. Moreover, he will enforce his rights, and then what shall we do Nothing will be able to save us from a well-deserved snub. Possibly the United States Government may be courteous to us because we are a young and small nation; but they would none the less insist on their right to prevent us from putting any body on board their ships outside our territorial limits. They would allow us only the same rights as they can claim themselves with regard to foreign vessels entering their ports. The Minister, because he framed the clause without thoroughly seeing all the difficulties, is disposed to deal lightly with the matter ; and as the committee do not seem to consider it an important matter, I shall not, now that I have entered my protest, take up further time. </para>

                    <para>- Has the attention of the Prime Minister been called to that section of the Constitution which provides that an extraordinary vacancy in the Senate shall be filled by the Parliament of the State in which it arises, until the next elections, while if a vacancy occurs in the House of Representatives it can be filled only by an election? The States of South Australia and Tasmania elected their representatives in the House of Representatives as single electorates, and consequently, in the event of a casual vacancy occurring, through death or retirement from ill-health, among the seven representatives of South Australia, the State might have to spend £5,000 or £6,000 upon an election. I would ask the Minister whether it would not be advisable to pass a short measure to prevent such a contingency - a measure which would enable the Parliament of the State to deal with a casual vacancy arising in the House of Representatives in' exactly the same manner as it deals with one arising in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, she exercised her discretion, and I am not complaining of that, but a doubt is raised in my mind as to whether, in consequence of that, it would be necessary to undertake what amounts to an amendment of the Constitution. Unless the honorable member thinks that section 29 or section 31 gives the opportunity for making the alteration he desires, the probability is that there is no section in the Constitution which affords an opening for making the change, unless we propose an alteration in the Constitution itself, which would require a double referendum as well as an absolute majority in each House. These expressions, like those of the honorable member, are only by-the-way, and I will give that consideration to the matter which it merits. </para>
