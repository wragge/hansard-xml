                    <para>- I wish to say a word or two upon this paragraph before the Prime Minister moves his amendment. I was not in the House when the words at the end of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> were inserted, and I feel even now that in justice to myself I must draw the attention of the committee to the effect which it appears to me the words &#34;directed by the officer&#34; will have. Is it really intended to put upon the statute-book a provision that an officer in the Customs shall be left to administer this very important part of the Bill at his own discretion ; and, secondly, that an officer of the Customs shall be quite competent at his own discretion, or under Government instruction, to subject a French subject to the test of writing out at dictation 50 words in the Turkish language ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, no doubt ; but I have to deal with the Bill as it stands, and I do not see how any explanation could be read into a Bill of this sort. If the explanation were in the Bill it would be all right. I should like to point out - with all respect to the committee - that this is a matter affecting the credit and character of this Federal Parliament. Can it possibly be contemplated that we intend calmly to put in this Bill words which would permit of a Frenchman being set a task in Turkish, or a German being called upon to write out a passage in the Spanish language, and so on right through the category? I. do not say that that would be done by the present administration, or by any administration, or by any Customs officer apart from any administration, because I do not suppose that any Customs officer would really do that sort of thing without some direction from a superior authority. I do not think he would be capable of such trickery, because I do not suppose that this Government intends to publish to the world that the real meaning of this legislation is that, unless a Frenchman comes here prepared to submit to a test in every European language, he is to be regarded as a prohibited immigrant. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether the honorable and learned member requires to have it pointed out to him that the possibility of doing a thing under any statute is worthy of consideration. I see the words &#34; may be &#34; staring me in the face. The officer may be directed to take a certain course and he may not, and the Government may or may not direct certain action to be taken. But do we mean to contemplate the possibility of a subject of France coming to Australia and having put before him the task of writing out a passage in any other language but his own - in any one of the other European languages but <inline font-weight="bold">Ms own</inline><inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Do we contemplate such a possibility ? If we do not, why should we embody it in our legislation ? This legislation will be keenly canvassed, and properly so, in all civilized countries, and really we should endeavour - without re-opening the matter - to make the Bill quite clear. I do not wish to refer to the long debate we had upon paragraph (a), but, without opening that issue, and simply directing my remarks to the structure of the Bill, as the committee has determined to accept it, I would appeal to the Prime Minister, since I do not think he contemplates any such possibility as I have indicated, to make the meaning of the clause perfectly clear. I very strongly dislike any words which would leave it open to us to contemplate the possibility of anything such as I have described happening. I quite admit that under these words it would be perfectly easy for the Government to see that no injustice is done. The Government can see that a Frenchman, or a German, or an Italian, or a Dane shall be tested only in his own language ; but what I object to is that the words are put in such a form that the other course to which I have referred might be taken, and that then it might be said that that course was expressly provided for by this legislation. That is so, but any such action would indeed be an outrage upon any feelings of equity we may have. I feel the inconvenience of bringing this matter up at this late period, and, therefore, I do not wish to press my view upon the committee too strongly, but in justice to myself I feel that it is due that I should make my attitude clear. </para>

                <para class="block">Considering this clause, as we have had an opportunity of considering it again, it is quite clear, to my mind, that unless the passage to be written out is dictated, an opportunity will be afforded of defeating the Bill. The Acts which deal with the writing out of an application - as some of them do, notably the New South Wales Act - are free from the difficulty I mention, because there is a form of application which the intending immigrant has to write out. There is a certain liability of defeat there, but in the case of a passage to be written - not being a mere application, but selected from some author, as this is to be - unless somebody dictates the passage, the difficulty will be that the otherwise prohibited immigrant might have no other way of writing out the passage except by seeing it, and in that case a man could learn the thing by rote, and would have matters all his own way. <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> do not want to say that the officer shall dictate the passage, as was originally provided, but we wish to leave it open to the officer to have the passage dictated under proper instruction. The words &#34; directed by the officer &#34; were introduced as a concession to the honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> because he pointed out that the officer would not always be able to dictate, but that there should be a dictation by some person ; and the words now proposed to be inserted will make the Bill closer and tighter in its provisions. </para>

                        <para>- With regard to the suggestion of my right honorable friend, the leader of the Opposition, I would point that the matter was raised in the committee on Tuesday last, and the honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> suggested that the passage should be dictated by or at the instance of the officer in any European language selected by the immigrant. The feeling of the committee then was that it should not be left to the immigrant to select any language for the test, because he would then be to a certain extent administering the Act himself. It will be impossible to administer the Bill to the satisfaction of this House, unless the Minister who has the administration of it sees that injustice is not done to Europeans, and I gave very full guarantees on that point, which I think were accepted by the committee. I pointed out that any desirable classes of European immigrants, such as those to which the leader of the Opposition has referred, would not be touched by the application of this Bill, because it is not the purpose of the Bill that they should be affected. I find that in the New South Wales Act, passed by my right honorable friend in 1898, the words are &#34; fail to write out in some European, language, and send in, an application,&#34; &#38;c. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister who has the administration of the Bill will, no doubt, have regard to the recognition of the nationality of the applicant ; but we may get fraudulent applications from persons who might learn off certain passages by rote, and write them at dictation even better than a paragraph in their own language. It would be very easy to do that, with a certain amount of learning. We wish to do two things. We wish the officer to be able to dictate the language so as to prevent fraud ; but we do not wish to touch Europeans unless they come under the application of the other prohibitory provisions of the section. We also desire to change the test passage in such a way that nobody can slip in by learning it off, and so defeat the operation of the Bill. These matters were explained the other day, and I think the sense of the committee was that we should leave paragraph (a) in its present form. I do not think we could do any good by inserting now words which the sense of the committee then rejected. </para>

                    <para>- As one of those who assented to this European test, and who echoed the sentiments expressed as to the hypocrisy of the Bill in the form in which it was first introduced, I have listened with astonishment to the explanation that has been offered with regard to this clause. If paragraph (&#171;) were left in its present condition on account of the explanation offered by the Prime Minister, the committee will be a much more credulous one than I have ever in my wildest moments credited it with being. It is the deliberate intention apparently to leave this clause in an equivocal condition, so that if some improbable case should arise the officer would have it in his power to call upon a Frenchman to pass an examination in Russian or Turkish, in order that he might by some insidious means be excluded under the wording of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I made a very full explanation of ray attitude on this Bill, which may be expressed in half-a-dozen words now. When the Bill was introduced in its original form it provided that the test should be made in the English language, and it was made quite clear by the Prime Minister that although the English language was made a <inline font-style="italic">si/ne qua non,</inline> it was not intended to touch the other nationalities of Europe. I stated then that the Bill was a hypocritical measure, and I say so again. </para>

                        <para>- But I said that as soon as this Bill was put into such a form that any European language might be used for the purposes of the test, the hypocrisy would, to a large extent, be taken out of it, because it would be a plain statement to the people of Europe, and for that matter, to the people of Africa and Asia, that they must pass an examination in some European language, and it would place the Bill on an infinitely more honest and above board plane than it was before. Now the hypocrisy is to be carried to an extent to which it has never been carried before in an Act of Parliament, because although the committee- - -and I am quite sure that no honorable member will dissent from this proposition - has assented to the proposal that any immigrant shall be allowed admission to Australia if he can write out a passage of 50 words in any European language, the Prime Minister has practically told us that it is the intention of the Government to use this provision, not for the purpose which every honest reader would understand, but for the purpose of imposing upon any undesirable European the necessity of writing out 50 words in some language other than his own. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that honorable members on my left will not encourage the Government in their endeavour to retain this clause in its present equivocal form so that it can be used for ulterior purposes. They have had their opportunity. They have had a division upon this matter, and I think that when once a majority has registered a decision against them they ought to recognise it fairly and honorably as the verdict of the committee. The simple question which honorable members have to put to themselves is : &#34; Does not this provision mean that any European coming to this country shall be entitled to admission to the Commonwealth if he can pass the prescribed examination in his own language <inline font-style="italic">1 &#34;</inline> The Prime Minister has said that he does not wish to express that meaning so plainly, because, forsooth, a Frenchman might learn off by rote a passage of 50 words in some other language. </para>

                        <para>- It was proposed, and the Prime Minister made an explanation. The outside world is concerned in this question. The honesty of purpose of this Parliament is involved in it. If we mean that any European is to be allowed to come into the Commonwealth if he can write out a passage of 50 words in his own language, should the. provision be left in such an equivocal condition that it is in the power of the officer to ask the immigrant to pass a test in a language other than his own? If we mean that an immigrant is to be allowed to enter the Commonwealth upon passing an examination in his own language, what possible objection can there be to intimating that fact in the form of some amendment in the Bill? At present it is clearly expressed that the immigrant himself shall be able to name the language in which he is to be examined. </para>

                        <para>- I would point out that there was no division upon that proposal. The Prime Minister made an explanation, it is true. I read that explanation, and I am bound to say that I thought it quite as plausible as the one which he has offered to-day. For that very reason, prior to the leader of the Opposition rising to deal with this question, I intended to say something about it. It is one of the points which I raised at an early stage of the debate upon this measure, because I felt that so long as any European could come into this country by passing an examination in his own language we had nothing to fear from the criticisms of other nations. But when it goes forth to the world that the Prime Minister refuses to allow the meaning of this clause to be made so unequivocal that it will be plain to every one that a European can gain admission to Australia by passing an examination in his own language, we make ourselves the laughing stock of other civilized peoples. I take it that, failing to pass the amendment providing for absolute prohibition, even the members of the labour party are prepared to honestly carry out what is contained in the Bill, and what is evidently intended by it. It would be very unfair after that amendment has been lost for the members of the labour party to encourage the Government to leave this clause in such a condition that another construction can be placed upon it than that which every one reading it would understand. The Prime Minister moved a resolution just now of a much more microscopic character. He inserted words to provide against the possibility of any immigrant choosing or learning a passage of which he had heard. He has inserted words of a highly technical character. What for? As he said &#34;to make the provision closer and tighter.&#34; Why is there this anxiety for closeness and tightness? To make it equivocal - to make it impossible of understanding. Why is closeness and tightness desired in one case and deliberate laxity provided for in the other.? Are the Government not creating what is popularly called a &#34;loop-hole&#34; in order that cases may be provided for which are not otherwise included in the drag-net measure ? </para>

But I am as much interested as any honorable member or as any citizen, in seeing that the meaning of whatever Act we pass shall be honestly and plainly expressed. I for one never intended - and I am quite sure a majority of this committee never intended - that by reason of its equivocal form the Bill should be used as a means to keep out of Australia any citizen who can pass an examination in any of the European languages. If honorable members choose that the Bill shall go forth to the world in its present form, and that our neighbours shall know from this debate that, though we have said that any European who comes here and can pass a test in his own language shall be admitted, we have up our sleeve, in true &#34;heathen Chinee&#34; fashion, a means of checking him, because we can prescribe a language other than his own. Well and good. 1 am not content that it shall do so. I am glad that my protest will be recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> against the hypocritical and equivocal form of this clause, which is put into the Bill not merely with the consent but with the connivance of the Government. </para>

                    <para>- I quite understand the attitude of the honorable and learned member for Parkes, because he looks at thi3 Bill from an utterly different stand-point from that of a large majority &#39;of this committee. Judging from his speech the other evening upon the main point at issue, he was prepared to allow into Australia any citizen of the world, coloured or white, so long as he was able to pass the educational test. But that attitude is not sympathized with by a majority of this committee ; in fact, the honorable and learned member is almost in a minority of one. </para>

                        <para>- Just so; even the honorable member for Melbourne is not with the honorable and learned member for Parkes, as to the admission of blacks, and he is, therefore, in a minority of one. From the point of view of the honorable and learned member, I can quite understand the desirability of making this test of the character he suggests ; but so far as subterfuge and equivocation are concerned, of which he speaks, he deliberately, with the assistance of his vote, committed himself to that course. A number of us thought that we should take only the straight-out course of declaring the desire, intention, and fixed determination of Australia on this point ; but we were in a minority, owing to a set off circumstances it is not necessary to go into again. Those who went to make up the majority on that occasion are not at one in the intention or method . that the honorable and learned member for Parkes desires ;. and so those members, and the majority of the committee as a whole, being desirous of making this measure as. effective as it will in its essence allow, favour the course proposed under present circumstances by the Government. That course is that although the Government have not seen fit to take the straight method - the straight method in our opinion, anyhow - those of us who desire to see coloured people kept out must leave a weapon in the hands of tine Government of the day that will allow them to bar any person who may have qualified in one particular language, but who, nevertheless, is a most undesirable immigrant. If we make the alteration suggested by the honorable and learned member for Parkes, it will be quite possible that the millions of coloured people about whom he spoke the other evening as being well educated and, therefore, able to pass a. test in some European language, may gain admission ; and while he may look with equanimity on such a possibility, I for one cannot do so. Having no desire to let those people in, although they can pass in some European language they might select, I intended to support the alteration proposed by the Government </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. REID</inline>(East Sydney). - I shall not enter into the old discussion of which we have had so much, because I do not think to do so would be fair having regard to public business. At the same time I wish to make my position in this matter perfectly clear. I was with the honorable member for Bland in his proposal, which the committee refused to adopt when it adopted the proposal of the Government. In my remarks this afternoon I was quite disposed to put out of my mind the Japanese or the coloured race question, and to simply direct my attention to the European phase. It is perfectly clear that the committee have decided to deal with the coloured races in this indirect method, and I was simply thinking of the question as it bears on European races and nations. It is from that point of view that I wish to get this matter put in a more satisfactory form, but it now appears from the statement of the Prime Minister that this is another indirect method of blocking the Japanese. </para>

But with reference to the European nations we, I think, are under no sort of embarrassment. We are perfectly free, in my opinion, to alter the clause in reference to Europeans at any rate. I really did hope we should have been able to put the clause in a more definite form, but I admit now that the intention of the Government is that if any of the people of these coloured races come here and are educated enough to speak one European tongue, the officer is to be on the watch for them to find which tongue they do speak, and then to test them in some other language which they do not know. We, wishing the exclusion of those races, cannot personally be very bitter about that. It is carrying out our more direct method in a manner which the Government are making characteristic of themselves. </para>

But I see now that this is one method of carrying out what we all have in view. I take the assurance of the Prime Minister that, in point of fact, this Bill is not aimed at European nations. I accept that assurance, though I regret the form in which the proposal is made. </para>

                        <para>- On the fiscal question, the Premier must not talk about change. I am where we were together 30 years ago, when he spoke of the Chinese wall that protectionists built round Australia. I have had the satisfaction of carrying out the glorious ambition he and I had, as young politicians in New South Wales, in the way of freedom of commerce. The Prime Minister went the other way ; he had to do it, I admit, because there was not room for him on our side. But I do not want to go into any of these old matters, though the Prime Minister has tempted me to say a word or two. I hope there will be, at least, the satisfaction of an assurance that so far as Europeans are 16 n concerned this clause is not intended to be applied. </para>

                    <para>- I rise to express my sincere sympathy with the honorable and learned member for Parkes in the way in which he now finds he is trapped. I am really astonished that the honorable and learned member takes such great exception to this new phase of the question. He must have known that the Bill as it stands to-day is in fact, or will be when it becomes law, a legalized lie. If a similar Bill had been administered as this one reads, it would have kept out half the pioneers of these States. We ought to blush for shame in this first Federal Parliament, when, instead of having the courage to state our case and make our position clear, we legalize a lie. </para>

                        <para>- I have read the Bill often. Each day shows fresh developments in connexion with it. The other day the honorable and learned member for Indi, when trying to get an amendment inserted, uttered a tirade against the measure on the ground of its ineffectiveness. The honorable and learned member for Parkes stands in a different position in regard to the measure from other honorable members, because he made no secret of his intention to vote for the Bill on the ground that it would let people in. </para>

                    <para>- The other evening, when this matter was discussed, there was really no debate so far as honorable members on the Ministerial side of the Chamber were concerned. Honorable members on this side represented the very anomalous position in which we should be placed if we passed the clause as it stood, and we only had the statement of the Prime Minister, which he reiterated this afternoon, that it would do what was desired. I think that the honorable and learned member for Parkes has been hardly dealt with, and that he did not foresee, when he took his previous attitude, the tremendous anomalies which would occur under the Bill. Perhaps, if he had done so, he would have voted for the amendment. What he desires to point out now is that in the action we are taking to-day we are to a certain extent transgressing the very principles of legislation. An ordinary person reading the clause would say that it meant that any European coming here might be required to submit himself to a test of his knowledge of his own language. That is the common-sense reading of the clause, and, under ordinary circumstances, when a question arises as to to the interpretation of a provision in an enactment, Parliament is willing to assent to an amendment which will make its intentions perfectly clear. The honorable and learned member for Parkes asks that that be done in this case. We are dealing now with an international question, and our determination may have a serious effect upon shipping interests. Unless it is distinctly declared under what conditions persons may come here, how can a ship-owner or ship -charterer know whether he will be permitted to land certain passengers? The clause as it stands would prohibit all immigration, because it practically amounts to a statement to the world that we do not want any people, whatever their race or language, to come here. What ship-owner would take the risk of bringing any large number of manual labourers to this country if there were the slightest risk of having to take them back again? If the clause is passed as it stands, we shall declare ourselves to be an absolutely uncivilized people. In my opinion we should clearly state what our intention is. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to say that he will issue certain instructions and regulations, but it must be remembered that they will have to be carried out by subordinate officers all over the Commonwealth. </para>

It is only definite and distinct instructions that the Customs officers can act under. By passing the clause as it stands, we publish it to the world that we not only prohibit the immigration of aliens from Asia and Africa, but make it questionable whether any ship-owner or ship-charterer may bring to our shores any body of men from European countries as well. </para>

                        <para>- As the clause stands, if a Messageries steam-ship came here with a number of Italians on board, the captain could not be sure that, because of some ephemeral excitement, the Government would not instruct the Customs officials that it was undesirable to allow them to land ; because it would be open to the Government, acting strictly within the provisions of the Bill, to require those Italians to pass an examination in Russian, which, of course, would be tantamount to prohibiting their landing. In the State of New South Wales there was for a short time a most violent agitation against Italians, because of the large number of persons of that race who had engaged in fruit-selling in Sydney, and it was felt that they were interfering very much with English, Irish, and Scotch people who were following the same pursuit. Honorable members will recollect, too, that some time ago there was an agitation in New South Wales in regard to the importation of a large number of Italians who came with some special knowledge of street asphalting.I mention these instances to show that I am within the province of the practical in dealing with this difficulty. But under the clause it is open to the Government to instruct a Custom-house officer to do what would result in the shutting out of a body of Italians, or of any other persons of European race, by requiring them to pass an examination in a European language not their own. But the committee never intended that an European should be submitted to an examination in some language other than his own. I can see now how the difficulty has arisen. When I left the House on Friday last, the word &#34; dictated &#34; was in the place now occupied by the word &#34; directed,&#34; and any one reading that clause would understand that the word dictated did not refer to the language but to the words, and therefore it was intended that the 50 words should be in an European language, which words should be dictated to the immigrant. </para>

                        <para>- Very likely, but that is not my fault. When I was last acquainted with this clause, it was in such a condition that it would have permitted any European to come into the Commonwealth after passing an examination in fifty words of bis own language, dictated by the officer. Even as the clause stood then it was open to objection, which I privately pointed out to the Prime Minister before I left. I stated that the form of words was. liable to misinterpretation, because it might be contended that the officer or person administering the Act could determine the language to be used for the test, whereas the intention might be that the language should be selected at the option of the European who came here. As to my being caught in a trap, I am not at all anxious to clear my reputation with regard to my liability to be caught in traps - not at all - and the honorable member&#39;s little &#34; twitting &#34; phraseology does not affect me. I admit that I saw the danger last week - I sow the danger even before the word &#34;directed&#34; was substituted for &#34;dictated &#34; - and I have the satisfaction of knowing that I pointed it out to the Prime Minister. I remember now, and read in quite a new light, the answer he gave me on that occasion, because I can see that this equivocal feature of the clause has been kept back as a means of shutting out people who are not directly and honestly excluded by the Bill. I am very much obliged to the honorable member for Wentworth for his sympathy, but I do not at all regret having voted against the amendment to exclude all Asiatics, Africans and Pacific islanders. If I had voted for that I should have remembered it with great regret, and I have the satisfaction of knowing that joined in passing the clause in such a form that, read in the light of common every-day interpretation, it would have allowed a civilized European citizen to come into Australia so long as he could pass the test in his own language. If it is now open to the Government by an insidious method to exclude Europeans by asking them to pass a test in a language other than their own, that is one of the unfortunate results of using language which is sometimes capable of two or three interpretations ; and I protest against any measure which goes forth to the world conveying a meaning other than that which any person reading it in an every-day way would put upon it. </para>

                    <para>- What took place the other day was this : - I suggested that the paragraph should be amended by providing that the test should be &#34; a passage of 50 words in length dictated by or at the instance of the officer, in any European language selected by the immigrant.&#34; That, of course, would have been perfectly fair, and would have been an ingenuous method of legislating in order to secure our object. The Government, however, abandoned my suggestion, and substituted the word &#34; directed &#34; for the word &#34; dictated and as I could not carry my own amendment I had to accept theirs. I did, however, object to it as being bad for the reasons given by the honorable member for Parkes - that it made it more clear that the choice of the language was to be in the hands of the officer. We got rid of one difficulty, which would have arisen if the officer were not able to read some of the European languages, but we created another difficulty which has been pointed out by the honorable and learned member for Parkes. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. REID</inline>(East Sydney). - 1 desire to make a suggestion quite apart from the matter we have been discussing. It has been represented to me by the manager of one of the big shipping companies that arrangements might be made for the appointment of inspectors, who might subject intending passengers to the necessary supervision at the principal ports of departure. This is a matter of administration, and it might involve some alteration of the Bill, but I commend it to the earnest consideration of the Government as a practical suggestion which might relieve the Government as well as the shipping companies and the intending immigrants. I think it must be obvious that with regard to prohibited immigrants of the classes set forth in this clause, such as persons likely to become a charge upon the public, idiots, persons suffering from infectious diseases and so on, it would be a great protection to the shipping companies if the Government were to take power to appoint agents at the principal ports abroad so that an opportunity might be given for examining passengers before they leave for the Commonwealth. The great bulk of our immigrants come from a few ports in the mother country and in Europe, and it would not be necessary to make many appointments. The Government, therefore, might consider the propriety of altering the Bill - in another place, if it is too late here - in the direction I have indicated. The agents should of course be men in whom the Government could implicitly trust, and the shipping companies could afford every facility for the examination of their passengers so as to insure the rejection of prohibited persons. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the Bill as drawn would permit of such appointments, because the definition of &#34; officer &#34; means not only an officer of Customs, but any officer appointed under this Act, and clause 14 provides that subject to any Act relating to the public service, the Governor-General may appoint officers for carrying out the provision of the Bill, and may prescribe their duties. Practically, therefore, there is no limitation to the appointments that may be made. The suggestion made is practical from every point of view. It is not desired that persons who are certain to be rejected should be brought here at great expense and inconvenience, and it would facilitate the operations of the shipping companies, and also our own, if an inspection were made at the port of departure. So far as ship-owners are concerned, we might consider whether by affording facilities for a prior practical scrutiny of passengers, they might not be absolved from any accusation of wantonly bringing undesirable immigrants to our shores. Of course the Government would not renounce its right to reject those passengers if circumstances should arise to render that course advisable. </para>

                    <para>- This clause was accepted at the instance of the honorable member for Coolgardie. As it stands it relates back to people now here who would have been prohibited immigrants, and provides that if they are afterwards convicted they shall be liable to be deported. There are persons in Australia at the present time, who if they come within the scope of any part of clause 4, will be liable to be dealt with in the manner described in this clause. Clause 4 not only deals with persons who come under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(a),</inline> but prohibits persons who are likely to become a charge upon the public, idiotic or insane persons, persons suffering from infectious or dangerous diseases, or persons coming here under contract to perform manual labour. So that if honorable members look at the clause as it stands it will be seen that it relates back to a great variety of persons. A man, for instance, might contract an infectious disease, and be brought within the scope of this clause. </para>

                        <para>- This- clause covers Europeans as well as others, and is very extensive in its scope, and I am sure the honorable member who moved it did not intend that it should be so far-reaching. If you admit that what is required here, as in other places, is, without putting it on the face of the Bill, to as far as possible reach those not of European birth, then it is necessary to introduce some restriction, lt is not sufficient to limit it to clause 4, paragraph (a), because that provision applies also to Europeans. Consequently, the only manner in which I can suggest a limitation which will get rid of most of the coloured people - for after all this is not an important power, and it is one which will rarely be exercised - is by the proposal which has been submitted. As the honorable member for Coolgardie proposed it, it would not apply to those who are naturalized in the Commonwealth. This is the only form in which I find it possible to restrict the operation of the provision in such a way as to carry out the intention of its mover, without sweeping into the net the whole body of Europeans who might, from some circumstances, come within the meaning of clause 4. </para>

                        <para>- What I think the Attorney-General wishes to do is to say that any person who is not a British subject either naturalized under the laws of the United Kingdom, or of the Commonwealth, or of the State, and who is convicted of any crime of violence against the person may be, asked by the officer to comply with the conditions of paragraph (a) of  clause 4. If he is unable to do so, the Attorney-General wishes to have the power to deport him. That, I understand, is the end intended to be arrived at. But it is necessary first of all that such a person shall be lawfully within the Commonwealth. Then we need to describe him as a person who is not a British subject. We also require to have the power to ask him to comply with certain conditions, and if he fails to do so to order his deportation. At present it seems to me that the clause will not effect the object desired. </para>

If the clause remains in its original form, it will simply be inoperative. I think that the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne made a suggestion a few moments ago, the adoption of which would render the clause effective in regard to those who had arrived in the Commonwealth after the passing of the Act.

                    <para>- I wish to make a brief explanation. The original object of this clause was to give power to deport from Australia, on conviction of any serious crime, persons now within the Commonwealth who, if this Act was in existence when they arrived, would be within the &#171;lass of prohibited immigrants. The difficulty with which I was confronted was that we could not return any persons except those who entered the Commonwealth subsequent to the passing of this Act. I took into account the statement of the Attorney-General made during the progress of this debate that there were already between 70,000 and 80,000 coloured aliens in Australia, and J considered it very desirable that a clause of this kind should be made to apply to them as well as to those who may enter the Commonwealth after the passing of this Act. The difficulty arose through attempting to make the people who are already here liable to the consequence of deportation for any crime which the}&#39; might commit hereafter. If the words &#34; prohibited immigrant&#34; are retained, the Attorney-General will confine the operation of this provision -to those persons who enter the Commonwealth after the passing of this Act. I want the Bill to be retrospective to the extent of reaching aliens already here, and in so far as future crime is concerned, but not as the honorable and learned member for Corio desires - retrospective in regard to past crime- that is, I desire it to deal only with crimes committed after the Bill becomes law. As I had the clause drafted originally, it dealt with any person who, if this Bill had been in force, would have been prohibited, and who is now within the Commonwealth. But I found great difficulty in regard to that provision. My immediate object is to ask the Attorney-General whether, if he uses the words &#34; prohibited immigrant,&#34; the Bill will not then be confined to people who come into Australia after the Bill becomes law <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                    <para>- The words &#34; European immigrant &#34; may give rise to difficult considerations. There is a vast difference between &#34; European language &#34; and &#34;European immigrant.&#34; The European language is the language of the United States, but an American immigrant is not an European immigrant, and this clause places American immigrants in the same position as Asiatics, </para>

                <para class="block">The clause says that, <inline font-style="italic">prima facie,</inline> a master of a ship is liable for bringing a prohibited immigrant here. But in the case of an European immigrant, and an European immigrant only, the captain may prove he took all reasonable care. A just complaint may arise, when least expected, that America is placed in the same category as Japan and China. </para>

                    <para>- I would ask the Attorney-General not to omit the words as proposed. This paragraph was put in to avoid taking out the words &#34; in the opinion of the officer,&#34; and I feel certain that the words &#34;intention to detain&#34; were suggested by the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- That was so, rather than accept another phrase which the honorable member for Melbourne suggested to the same effect. But notice has to be given forthwith, and it can be proved what &#34; forthwith &#34; is in regard to the actual detention of which notice must be given ; but how to give notice forthwith of the &#34; intention,&#34; it is very hard to say. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the words proposed to be added are very objectionable. It often happens that contracts are made for the performance of special work. I have made such contracts in connexion with works at Brisbane. Where the delivery and erection of perhaps a certain kind of boiler is contracted for, the contractor will not intrust the work to any but men of whom he has had considerable experience. But, under the amendment, if a contractor sent out experienced men to do special work he would render himself liable to a penalty. I ask the Minister if he cannot amend the clause so as to provide for these cases? </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that the amendment should be agreed to. Throughout the Bill, what is punished is an act of immigration or attempted immigration ; but the amendment goes further, and makes it a penal offence to enter into a contract to import labour, although the immigration never takes place. I do not think we should put a provision of this kind into the Bill. It is really not necessary. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the Minister will accept the suggestion of the honorable and learned member for Indi. In America the Act is directed against, not the persons abroad who make the contract, but those who in America agree to it, or authorize the making of it. The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has stated very clearly what would be the position if the amendment were not made - that if the contractor succeeded it would be so much the better for him, whereas if he failed he would not suffer, although the workmen whom he tried to import might suffer. I think that any one who attempts to import labour against the provisions of the Bill should be severely punished. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ISAACS</inline>(Indi).- I do not know if we should stop even at this point. It seems to me that where an Act of Parliament is clear and distinct, as this Bill will be, and the capitalist endeavours to introduce labour in contravention of its provisions, not only should we make the contract void, but he should be made liable to the Commonwealth for any expense incurred in the maintenance or deportation of the persons imported or attempted to be imported. I would apply to such a person a provision similar to that which applies to persons who introduce idiots or insane persons into the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- I think that there is a great deal to be said in favour of the suggestion of the honorable and learned member for Indi, that the person who is responsible for causing the contract to be made should bear at least some portion of any expense that the Commonwealth may be put to for the maintenance of the persons imported, or for returning them to their homes. I am doubtful whether the words proposed to be inserted by the Attorney-General will quite meet the case that we want to meet. It is very unlikely that the person in Australia who pulls the strings will actually make the contract himself. </para>

He has pointed out that they may be valuable citizens ; but the chances are that, although the contract is rendered null and void, if they are allowed to remain here they will do the work at the rates of pay to which they originally agreed. I think they should be sent back at the expense of the person who authorized the contract to be made.

                        <para>- Yes; and it is a distinct evil, because in some cases I believe foreigners are imported by them to work at very low wages. Of course it is very hard to say whether they are under contract or not. They are mostly men who cannot speak the English language, and it takes some time to find out the conditions under which they reach Western Australia. These contracts are entered into in Europe, and if the honorable member for Indi desires to make some one here responsible for them, it is just as well, before he completes his amendment, he should be aware that no person in Australia has authorized them. </para>

                    <para>- He referred to the schedule, and said it showed that the certificate of exemption was intended to be of a temporary character. I made a note against the paragraph myself, but it seems to me that if anything is done it will have to be done under clause 5. If the substitution of the word &#34; shall&#34; for the word &#34; may&#34; in that clause will meet the case, I will make the alteration when the clause is recommitted. </para>

                    <para>- With regard to clause 10a, I think the amendment that the Attorney-General was arguing in favour of a few minutes ago will have the effect of nullifying the clause altogether. The amendment limits the application of the clause to persons who come within the scope of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(ff)</inline> of clause 4, and, seeing that these people are prohibited from entering the Commonwealth, I do not see that clause 10a is of any value, because it simply nullifies contracts in respect of people who do not come here. </para>

                        <para>- Referring first to the question raised by the honorable member for Oxley, I may say that the exemption under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(J)</inline> is a very wide one, and refers to the masters and crews of all vessels, but not to any other persons employed on them. The preceding paragraph relates to all. public vessels, and paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(J)</inline> has reference to all private vessels generally, and does not exclude pearl-shelling or any other kind of boats. It relates, however, only to the masters and crews of such boats. With regard to clause 10a, the position is this : that first of all we prohibit the entrance of certain people into the Commonwealth, but some persons may, after all, reach the Commonwealth before we discover that they are under contract, and in clause 10a we take power to declare that the contracts under which they come are absolutely void. Clause 10a, therefore, affords a second and very valuable safeguard similar to what exists in the United States. </para>

                    <para>- I think I see the difficulty that occurs to the honorable member for Bland. Paragraph(ff) says that persons under contract or agreement to perform manual labour within the Commonwealth are prohibited immigrants. But there are exceptions, namely, workmen of special skill, or persons serving as part of the crew of a vessel engaged in the coastal trade if the rates of wages paid to them are not lower than the rates ruling in the Commonwealth. Clause 10, as it stood in the first instance, would make null and void any contract for manual labour within the Commonwealth, and, therefore, would void contracts for skilled labour or for labour employed on vessels trading within the Commonwealth. The Attorney-General, by his amendment, while securing the nullification of such contracts as would make the workmen prohibited immigrants under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(ff)</inline> of clause 4, keeps intact the classes of contracts coming under the two exceptions named in the paragraph. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to agree with this amendment, which has reference to limiting the authority of officers in connexion with the making of beer. We discussed and settled the proper form of this clause when it was before the committee on the previous occasion. I am informed by the officers of the department that practical experience has shown that, in order to detect the evasion of duty, it is necessary that they shall be able to view the process of manufacture. If officers had not possessed this power in a recent case, the department would have been defrauded. The Comptroller of Customs tells me that it is a very common provision, the absence of which would do harm. To quote from the minute with which he has favoured me, he says - </para>

                    <para>I strongly object to amendment in section 46. Practical experience has shown that in order to detect evasion of duty the officer should be able to view every and the entire process of manufacture. There has never been any objection to such inspection in the State of Victoria, where a large number of breweries are in operation. Once permit a place where officers cannot penetrate, and room will be created for fraud. The right of access might be given to senior officers only if so desired, but is necessary. No other objections. I have no other objections to offer to the clause. </para>

                    <para>- This certainly looks a very innocent amendment, but it raises a very important constitutional question. We purport to do here what we have done more directly in other Bills, namely, to repeal or declare by express words the nullification or exclusion of State legislation. The question arose in relation to the Canadian Parliament, and it is worth the while of the Government to consider the matter in connexion with any future legislation. In the case of the Attorney-General of Ontario, against the Attorney-General of the Dominion, which is reported in the 1896 Appeal Cases, page 348, the Privy Council very distinctly laid down, so recently as 1895, that; - </para>

                <para>It may be the Senate has struck out the remaining words of the clause in recognition of that principle. In view of that position we should be very careful to see that the substantive provisions of our laws actually do override - if we intend them to override - State legislation. It will not be sufficient to rely upon a clause which says that the Federal Legislature purports to repeal an Act of the State Legislature. Although this is a small matter - and I have no doubt that the main provisions of the Bill carry out all what the Minister desires - still a day or two ago we had an express provision in one Bill purporting to repeal State Acts. </para>

I think that the provisions of the Bill itself will effectually do all that we require, and that the repeal of these State Acts is therefore comparatively immaterial. But it is a matter which ought to be carefully looked at in order that we may see that the actual substantive provisions of the enactments proposed, attain the aim which is looked for, because there is a possibility of the matter being challenged, and of a decision being given similar to that which was given in Canada. </para>

                    <para>- I recognise that this is a matter of very considerable importance. I confess that my first inclination was to provide for a direct repeal. But afterwards we came to the conclusion that the modified form would be better. I think we should do the best thing of all if we accept the position which is here laid down, and rely on the strength of the provisions in the Acts themselves to do what is necessary. The Customs Act stands in a different category to all other Acts on account of the express provision for cesser in the event of certain things occurring under the Constitution. </para>

If they still remain as something to fall back upon in the event of federal legislation being imperfect, they must be capable of being revived. If we change our policy in relation to immigration, the mere repeal of our legislation would be useless, because the State Acts would all be revived. </para>

                        <para>- There has been a happy compromise here on the subjects upon which we previously differed. In the Bill, as it left this chamber, this clause provided that no spirits should be used for fortifying wine unless they were approved by the officer, and were of a strength of at least 30 degrees above proof. The Senate has now provided that no wine spirit shall be used for fortifying wine of a less strength than 30 degrees over-proof, whilst in the case of any other spirit the strength shall be 60 degrees over-proof. I think that the proposal is fair enough. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is a fair enough provision. What we have reckoned on is that wine spirit can be used at a less strength than another spirit, and we have, therefore, provided that, as regards wine spirit, 30 degrees over proof shall suffice, but that, in regard to other spirit, 60 degrees is necessary before it can be passed. That having been provided in this clause, it seems a fair and proper thing to provide in the following clause that the same test shall apply. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to suggest that this amendment is altogether out of order. The Minister is now endeavouring, I think very unfairly, to reverse the vote that we gave some time ago. Clause 57 provides that, unless otherwise prescribed, no spirit shall be used for fortifying wine - that is any wine - unless it is approved by the officer and is of a strength of at least 30 degrees over proof. An amendment has been inserted by the Senate, drawing a distinction between wine spirit and other spirit ; but when we come to clause 58, we are not talking about -wine in general, but Australian wine, and the committee have determined - and the provision was afterwards sent on to the Senate* by this House - that no Australian wine shall be fortified under this Bill so as to contain more than 35 per cent, of approved spirit, nor shall be fortified with any other spirit than pure wine spirit. </para>

                        <para>- I am now talking on the point of order. The Senate has said that there is a doubt about this being a pure wine spirit, and in order to define a pure wine spirit, and with no other object, they suggest an amendment which specifies the strength of that spirit. But that does not alter the fact that it is pure wine spirit in all cases. This House has determined and the Senate has determined on pure wine spirit; and now the Minister wants to do something that I apprehend is not within the competency of the committee, because what he proposes is no part of the amendment and not consequential on it, inasmuch as he wants to odd a provision to the effect that spirit other than pure wine spirit may be used. This seems to me an endeavour - no doubt the Minister thinks rightly, though I think wrongly - to obtain a reversal of a vote which has been passed by both this House and the - Senate. The present proposal is foreign altogether to the Senate&#39;s amendment. The Senate has proposed that pure wine spirit should be of a certain strength, and it is nonsense to say that we may not only agree to that being the strength, but may add something else of a different strength. I hope the Minister will adhere to the forms of the House, and that this amendment will not be allowed. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member does not seem to understand the difference between a point of order and wine spirit. The Senate altered the description of the wine spirit which is to be used - the Senate did not alter the description of the spirit, but the description of the wine spirit. An amendment is now proposed which says, not merely that wine spirit&#39; of this or that kind must be used, but that some other kind altogether may be used. When we recall the debate that took place in this House on the question, we can all see that that amendment is a change in substance. As the honorable and learned member for Indi has said, both Houses have definitely agreed that wine spirit of some kind or another shall bc used in fortifying wine spirit, and that nothing but wine spirit of one kind or another shall be used. How is it relevant to the clause or the Senate&#39;s amendment to turn round and say that we shall use some other kind of spirit ? In a discussion as to what is strictly relevant, we have to look at the .scope and object of the clause, as we sent it up and as the Senate amended it. The whole fight was as to what kind of spirit - wine spirit or not wine spirit- Australian wine is to be fortified with, and it seems to me to be clearly irrelevant to introduce a fresh issue by proposing to change the kind of spirit. Instead of varying the character of the wine spirit, we are varying the kind of spirit altogether, and that is a new issue which is not within the competency of the committee. Apart from that, I confess to some* surprise at- what appears an attempt to. alter a decision of the committee arrived at after a good deal of debate. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable and learned member will permit mc, I will put the matter in a better shape. I have a disposition to agree, but; at the same time, I humbly wish that the Senate shall also agree with us in a little matter which will make their proposal more acceptable to us. The whole thing in so many words is - what was the Senate thinking of in the preceding clause? The Senate made two varying provisions - one as regards wine spirit of 30 degrees over proof, and another as regards any . other spirit of 60 degrees over proof. The Senate said that either one or other of these spirits may be used, and it &#39;follows, almost as a natural corollary, that wo should alter this clause. Indeed, I might almost claim this as a consequential amendment. It is said that clause 57, which has no qualification as regards any -particular wine, applies to wine generally. To say that we may use either of the spirits of different strengths - the wine of the lesser, and the other spirits of the higher strength - and that we cannot make a similar provision in the next clause, seems to me absurd. I think the Chairman will see that a distinct difference is raised. The Senate has not agreed with us, but they have substituted some other spirit to be used for the purpose of fortification, and they have abandoned our suggestion- that it shall be pure. When it is said that we cannot have it pure at 30 per cent., then at least we ought to give the alternative of something else. My proposal is a fair one, and is simply a qualification of the Senate&#39;s amendment. </para>

I felt rather chagrined at the Minister allowing the recommittal of the Bill as regards this clause, when he had already obtained a victory. But when it&#39; was recommitted there was a majority of, I think, one against the Minister&#39;s proposal, and if it had not been that the other Chamber has sanctioned that provision, I think there might have been fair justification for another recommittal; Seeing, however, that the Bill has gone to another place which has approved the action of those who voted with the majority in this committee, it is scarcely fair at this hour of the day to reopen the discussion. </para>

                        <para>- Because o&#163; my good nature. There are various systems which have been adopted for the purpose of deciding differences ; and in one of these systems a &#39; &#34; copper &#34; forms the chief factor. The Government won on the first occasion, and then the honorable and. learned member for Indi objected to making it a case of &#34; sudden death,&#34;and urged that there must be another attempt. When we facilitated another attempt and the honorable member won he said that that was the last throw, even though the Government who first won would prefer &#34; two out of three.&#34; There seems, however, to be something to be said in favour of a further exhibition of good nature, which is not altogether appreciated. There is not such a large attendance of members to-night as - there was on the occasion when we last debated this question. The first time the Government won by four &#39; votes, and the last time our adversaries - using the word in its mildest form - won by one, so that there is a balance of three in favour of the Government. Seeing that we cannot get as good a fight over the question as we had last time, owing to circumstances over which wc had no control&#39;, I shall not ask the House to take a division on the subject, and I hope honorable members will remember this fact to the good record of the Government at some future time. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment of the Senate is quite different from the provision as it left this Chamber. The proposal, as it was carried here, was &#34; pure wine spirit,&#34; and that is a different thing to &#34;:pure wine spirit&#34; of 30 degrees overproof. No honorable member will contend that 30 degrees over proof ie pure wine spirit, and to a very great extent the amendment was agreed on in the Senate on a , misrepresentation. Honorable members were told that on the continent, and. in various other places, all spirit, except the spirit of the grape, was prohibited for this purpose. But in certain places where wine is produced, spirit distilled from other material is used. Even under the Act passed this year by the Parliament of the United States, spirits made from potatoes, grain, molasses,, rye, and roots are allowed, though it is insisted that the spirits shall be pure. Will honorable members contend that , a provision that the spirit must be 30 degrees over-proof is any guarantee that, even if the spirit is the produce of the grape, it will be pure ? Do not honorable members know that the Senate inserted this amendment because they found that pure wine meant 45 degrees overproof a$ the very least <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I ask the Minister to reject that portion of the amendment at any rate. I arn not particular whether or not we have a contest on the other part of the amendment, but I am as particular as any other honorable member about having pure wine. We insist on 60 degrees overproof in the spirits used for. fortifying imported wines, which are drunk by our people without any question being raised as to their deleterious qualities. People are allowed to drink imported wine, fortified with any other spirit than the spirit of the grape ; but in regard to Australian &#39; wines we insist that they must be fortified with impure wine spirit of 30 degrees over proof. The whole. crux of the thing is that this, is a huge monopoly, for the benefit of a few distillers, and all the talk we have heard about the small vine-grower goes .for nothing. </para>

                    <para>- We cannot but admire the tenacity of the honorable member for South Australia, who has just resumed his scat ; but, in stating that the amendment which was carried here was adopted under a misapprehension, the honorable member is not exactly fair to those who are opposed to him. The expression used here, &#34; pure wine spirit,&#34; is susceptible of two interpretations, and I invite the honorable member to say which interpretation was intended to be placed upon it by the committee. There is such a thing as wine spirit which may be pure, and pure spirit which maybe made from wine. Pure wine spirit means a spirit which is not mixed with any spirit obtained from other materials than wine - that is pure wine spirit. - 1 cannot say What was in tho minds of the committee when they passed this clause previously, but there is a great difference between pure spirit as a spirit and pure wine spirit. Distillation makes a spirit pure, but all the distillation in the world will not make a pure wine spirit out &#39;of potatoes. The Senate were anxious that pure wine spirit should be placed on exactly the same level as the spirits which are referred to in clause 57, and they wished the same strength to be allowed. I was one of those who opposed a reduction of strength. </para>

With regard to the merits of the case, we are right in accepting this amendment, in the first place because it will make the clause accord to some extent with the previous one. In the next place we have definitely decided that only wine spirit shall be used for the fortification of wine. It was with the view to preventing ambiguity with regard to the word &#34;pure&#34; that the Senate inserted the amendment. I understand that the idea of putting in the words providing that the spirit should be at least 30 degrees above proof was to prevent misconception as to what was meant by pure spirit, as some people might take that as indicating spirit of 70 degrees over proof. </para>

                    <para>- There seems to be a good deal of misapprehension as to what constitutes purity of wine or any other spirit. As I understand it, given a sound wine, and putting it through the process of distillation, a sound wine spirit can be produced. Such spirit may not bo chemically pure, but with each increase of the proof strength, the spirit is taken further and further away from the characteristics of wine, so that if you have absolutely pure spirit from a chemical point of view, you naturally have something which has no connexion whatever with the material from which it is produced. It is contended that when wine-spirit is used for fortification purposes it should possess some of the essential characteristics of the wine. Now, so far as the distillation of whisky is concerned, it is one of the greatest anxieties of the distiller not to put the spirit through at too high a degree of proof strength, but to derive from the process of distillation certain of the characteristics of malt, and exactly the same end is held in view in connexion with wine-spirit distillation. To argue that chemically pure alcohol is what is wanted is equivalent to arguing that you can go to the chemist and receive from him the equivalent in chemicals of the component parts of an apple, and thus secure a good substitute for the actual fruit. Noone, however, will contend that the combination of chemicals supplied by the chemist would be at all palatable or as wholesome as the original fruit. I take it, therefore, that the intention of this clause as it stands, is to give a good sound wine, fortified with a spirit which may not be chemically pure, but which will contain the essential, and, as far as blending is concerned, the necessary qualities of the wine. </para>

With regard to the statement of the honorable and learned member for Laanecoorie, I repeat that this clause was passed by the committee on the former occasion under a misapprehension, the impression being that a provision similar to that in the clause was generally enforced in the wine growing countries of Europe. I challenge the honorable and learned member to name any place on the continent, or elsewhere, where they have insisted upon the use of pure grape spirit only for the fortification of wine. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SALMON</inline>(Laanecoorie). - If it pleases the honorable member for South Australia to assume that this amendment was carried previously as the result of misrepresentation, I am not going to say any more in regard to it. I regret that he is under any such misapprehension. The whole question was decided upon its merits. The honorable member for Perth put the matter as well as it could be put. I feel that he thoroughly realizes what is the true position. What we desire is that wine spirit only shall be used for the purposes of fortification. The honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> said that we wish this provision inserted in order that inferior wines may be used. Nothing of the sort. Of this we may be sure, that the process of distillation will remove dangerous impurities. I admit that 30 degrees over proof will not completely clear the spirit of impurities, but the impurities which are left will not be deleterious. If the vignerons use potato spirit of an inferior character for the purpose of fortifying their wines, they run a very great risk indeed of poisoning them. I feel that the Senate has been anxious that there shall be no misapprehension regarding the interpretation of the words &#34;pure wine spirit.&#34; I would point out that in clause 58 it was not desired that there should be a pure spirit so much as that the spirit should be made purely from wine. Had it been otherwise, the ordinary expression would have been used, &#34;pure spirits of wine.&#34; What merchant would ask for pure wine spirit to be sent to him if he wanted pure spirits of wine ? The amendment of the Senate provides a necessary safeguard, and its adoption will place the desire of this committee beyond all doubt. </para>

                        <para>- When we were discussing this matter some time ago, it was repeatedly put that we were proceeding on the lines of Victorian legislation. There is no doubt whatever that, whilst we were able to discount some of the force which it was attempted to attach to the argument by pointing to the age of the Victorian Act, yet a deal of weight was carried by this sort of reasoning. The honorable and learned member for Indi claimed great credit in connexion with that wonderful Act. Why is he now attempting to depart from it ? The measure provides not only that vignerons shall not fortify except with pure wine spirit, but that the spirit must be of a certain age, and that anybody who is in possession of wine fortified with any other than this pure wine spirit will incur all sorts of penalties. I am sure that the life of any vigneron who was detected in violating the Act would scarcely be worth living. Why not do the same thing here? I was seeking for information when I asked the honorable and learned member for Laanecoorie what the rectified distillate would be, and he told me that it would be pure alcohol. We merely propose to provide for pure wine spirit, and if there is any difference as to what we mean, the Victorian Act, of which we have heard so much, certainly leaves no room for doubt upon the question. It tells us what the rectified distillate is. In the very forefront of that Act is a definition of pure wine spirit. It says - </para>

                    <para>In other words it is absolute alcohol. Under the circumstances I ask the committee to allow the Bill to stand. I think that the measure in its original form, which provided that the strength of the spirit to be used should be 50 degrees over proof, was preferable. I am sorry that I gave way and allowed the strength of the spirit to be reduced to 30 degrees, but I do not propose to give way any more in this respect. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ISAACS</inline>(Indi). - There is one spirit that will never abate, and that is the spirit of the Minister. There is no doubt about its purity and its strength. At the same time, I wish to point out that the Senate appears to have met this matter in a practical, business-like fashion, and it has really carried out the intention of this Chamber. That intention was to declare that no spirit should be used for fortifying wine which was not produced from wine. Vignerons were not allowed to use any admixture of other substances whether they ranged from potato spirit to vitriol. The Senate, however, fairly saw that in the heat of our struggle we did not fully express our intention, and accordingly that Chamber has made an amendment, which not only does not alter our intention, but effectuates it. The observations of the Minister, if carried out, would go far to nullify the provision under which wine can be fortified at all. In the Victorian Act, the words &#34;pure wine spirit&#34; are defined for the purpose of that Act. There are certain limitations which I am not scientifically capable of explaining, but in one of the sections I observe that the strength of the spirit is prescribed to some extent. I do not care, however, what that Act provides in regard to this particular matter. I say that we shall be carrying out our intention by assenting to this amendment, which I think the committee ought to adopt, because it will protect the public against the adulteration of wine, and enable vignerons to carry on their businesses in a proper fashion. </para>

                    <para>- I suggest to the Minister the propriety of disagreeing with the Senate&#39;s amendment. The reason actuating the Senate in omitting the last portion of the regulation seems to be that, in as much as we have not power to prescribe that labels stating the materials from which imported spirits are made shall be affixed to the bottles in which those spirits are imported, we should not require the local product to be labelled. But it seems to me a good principle that each person shall be required to keep clean the pavement in front of his own door, and it rests with each community to insure, as far as possible, that its people shall know what they are consuming. Most of . us, I suppose, hope that gradually the local article will successfully compete with, and eventually supplant, the imported article ; and, if that happens, it will be more than ever necessary to have this provision. A firm that has made somewhat of an outcry in regard to it is that of Joshua Bros. They point out that they are selling a spirit which is as near brandy as anything else on the market, although only a portion of it is brandy. But the excuse that other people sell materials under a wrong name is not, I think, sufficient justification for allowing local manufacturers to do so. I trust that the committee will insist that where spirits are sold to the public, they shall be sold under their real name, and not as something which they are not. </para>

                    <para>- If I recollect rightly, the Government originally opposed the insertion of words providing for the specification of materials which Regulations 59 and 60 requires, but amendments were carried against them. It was seen, however, that it would be unfair to require certain things to be done by our own distillers which foreign distillers, whose goods come into competition with theirs, are not required to do, and it was therefore determined that the better thing would be to call these provisions into existence only where they could be fairly applied, without hampering or doing injustice to the local distiller. For that reason, the words &#34;if so prescribed &#34; were inserted, and I think that the regulations as they left this Chamber were fair and practicable. Considering the unanimity of the committee on the question before, I think we should disagree with the amendment. </para>

Various minor articles enter into the manufacture of tobacco, and while the manufacturer is charged on the full weight, it would not be proper to charge him twice, that is both on the minor articles as delivered, and on the full weight of the manufactured tobacco. This is only carrying out a similar provision in the Customs Bill. </para>

                    <para>- It is proposed to leave out these words, because it is represented that it will be inconvenient if cigar and cigarette manufacturers have to mark upon every package the name of the manufacturer and the other particulars required. So long as the authorities are furnished with sufficient information with regard to the manufacture of these goods, I do not think we need bind the manufacturers to publish all the particulars that are specified. </para>

                        <para>- Very many goods of local manufacture are put up with false labels giving the name of some English firm, and this abuse has reached such a stage in New South Wales and perhaps Victoria that the wholesale merchants will not take anything from the local manufacturers if they bear their own labels. People are gradually being educated up to the idea that nothing is good unless it has an English or foreign label upon it, and it seems to me that Australian productions will have no chance of making a name for themselves unless we insist that they shall bear the name of the maker, and that he shall get the credit that is due to him. I do not sympathize with the idea of striking out these words, but think that what applies to other classes of manufactures should also apply to cigarettes and cigars. The sooner our people find out that the greater number of the cigars they smoke are of Australian manufacture, the better it will be for the manufacturers and for the public generally. It is only the first plunge that our manufacturers have to fear, and I think that the Bill as originally drafted should be adhered to. The provision in this clause seems to require that the particulars specified shall be placed on the larger parcels of goods and not be attached to each individual article, but I should not object to a proposal that there should be a label affixed to every cigar. There is not the slightest objection to the retailer knowing what he is buying. The wholesale men know very well where the goods come from, and that they are not of foreign make, and that knowledge should be generally extended, so as to reduce the fraud upon the public as much as possible. </para>

                    <para>- A number of small manufacturers of cigars have represented to me that they would suffer very considerably owing to the practice that the honorable member for Bland has referred to, but at the same time I would urge that they would profit in the long run if their articles merited approval. This fraud of foisting upon the public locally-made goods under foreign labels has been very largely practised in Victoria, and goods made in Collingwood are very frequently sold under the pretence that they were manufactured in England. People have been led to believe that they have been getting first-class Continental goods, whereas they have been buying the products of their own local labour - equally of first-class quality. I believe it would be to the interests of the men themselves if the truth were told about their productions. A number of small cigar-makers, who sell to the large hotels, urge that if the purchasers of their cigars were made aware that they were manufactured locally, the hotel-keepers would at once discontinue their orders, as they would not be able to sell the local article. That might be the case at first, but the position would soon improve if the article were such as to merit public patronage. I should like to see a general Trade Marks Act which would compel every one to mark his goods accurately, stating where they were made and the conditions under which they were manufactured. </para>

                        <para>- I am a little surprised at the reason which is given for the amendment. I understood that it was simply an innocent proposal that the name of the local manufacturer should not be required to be blazoned abroad on the package containing the cigars or cigarettes manufactured, because there was a prejudice against the local manufacturers; but I confess that I did not know of or appreciate the suggestion which is now made that the suppression of the name of the manufacturer is intended to facilitate fraud. </para>

                    <para>- There might be something to be said in favour of omitting cigarettes from the operation of the clause. I understand that the honorable member for Bland wishes to insure that these cigarettes shall be labelled as having been made in Australia, and not represented as goods made in Europe; but why we should go further and insist upon every package of cigarettes having the name of the manufacturer upon it I do not know. We know very well that in England the wholesalers and the great manufacturers are supplied by numbers of small people, and it seems to be going rather far to say that in the matter of cigarettes, which might be made by a number of small people, the manufacturer should be compelled to put his name on the packages containing his goods. Probably the name placed upon them in the ordinary way would be that of the wholesale distributor of the goods ; and I think cigarettes, at any rate, might be very well omitted. </para>

                        <para>- In this clause it is provided that the manufacturer&#39;s name and address, a consecutive number, the gross weight of the package, and the net weight of the contents shall be marked upon every package before it is removed from the factory. Some of these provisions are absolutely necessary for the protection of the revenue. If we cut out cigars and cigarettes from this clause, we shall lose, not merely the name, but other things. If the size of the package is a reasonable one, I cannot see that any harm would result from requiring the name of the maker of the goods which it contains to be stamped on the outside. Of course we could not expect the name of the manufacturers to be put upon every cigar or cigarette. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HIGGINS</inline>(Northern Melbourne).I think that a very much larger issue has been raised by the honorable member for Bland and the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. It has reference to the marking of goods by the maker of them. Of course it is a great advantage to struggling manufacturers to get their goods sold by any means, but I should not like in an Excise Bill to force too far the view which has been taken by honorable members in regard to this matter. We&#39; ought not to thrust it upon the manufacturers without :first consulting them in some way. At the same time I think that the Government might fairly confer with those interested and see if it is not to their advantage that the name of the maker should appear upon all packages of goods. I admit that &#34;the ordinary public as a rule do not see the brand on a package. Of course they would see the brand on a package of cigarettes, but they would not see it on a bale of wool. For the sake of the permanent advantage to the local manufacturers, I think it is worth considering whether we should not insist upon the name of the manufacturer appearing on the face of his goods, and also upon imported goods bearing the imprint of the fact that they have been manufactured abroad. </para>

I do not desire that the colonial product shall be placed at a disadvantage as compared with the imported article. I am quite satisfied that the warehouseman would not take the manufactured article from the manufacturer if he found that the manufacturer had his name upon it, because in that case the retailer would go direct to the manufacturer and obtain it. I am quite in favour of having a stamp placed upon the goods to intimate to all who are interested that they have been made in the States. I may mention that I have been waited upon by a number of employes who desire that the name of the State in which any particular goods are manufactured shall be branded upon them. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston</inline> is, I believe, agreeable to that proposal. In the United States it is provided that the number of the factory and of the district in which goods are made shall be stamped upon them. I think that is all that is necessary. Our workers would be placed at a disadvantage if we compelled manufacturers to stamp their names and addresses upon every package of goods which they turn out.

To my own knowledge there was a case in Sydney where a firm had for years been putting up a large quantity of goods with foreign labels. Legislation was foreshadowed in the State Parliament compelling manufacturers of that class of goods to brand their goods with their name and address, with the result that this particular firm anticipated legislation by putting their own name on the goods. As a consequence, that firm are to-day doing a bigger business than they ever did before. People are using their pickles, jams, and preserves in preference to the imported articles. There is nothing whatever to fear, therefore, from a provision of this sort. </para>

                    <para>- I support the remarks of the honorable member for Yarra. As that honorable member points out, the retailers will, in the event of such a provision as this being adopted, go past the wholesale distributor to the manufacturer. That will be all the better for the big men and all the worse for the small men who depend on the wholesale men to take the distribution out of their hands. This provision will operate very adversely in the case of the small men. I would point out that it is only colonial goods which are supposed to be branded with the name of the State and the manufacturer&#39;s number. There is no doubt that goods numbered in the manner proposed get the reputation enjoyed by the worst manufacturer. If the purchaser gets a bad article he cannot trace it to the man who made it, but he simply resolves never to purchase the same class of goods again, and will avoid numbered goods in future. </para>

                    <para>- I scarcely think this is correctly worded. It says that the defendant shall have the right to elect, and &#34; thereupon &#34; the proceedings can be shifted. I think the wording ought to be &#34; on such election,&#34; because there is no period or moment of time fixed by the clause as it at present stands. </para>

                        <para>- I think the clause is right enough. It is almost a precise copy of the clause which was thrashed out by the honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. V.</inline> L. Solomon, and myself, when the Customs Bill was before us. I do not think it is worth making any alteration, because it says that the claimant shall have the right to elect, and that the proceedings shall be shifted &#34; thereupon,&#34; that is on that election. </para>

It is all very well for us to say that all judgments may have the benefit of this Bill, but whether it should extend to judgments already on the record is a question which the committee ought to consider before we agree to reinsert the words. . </para>

If the honorable member refers to clauses 22 and 23 he will see that the court has power to deal with any of the cases if a re-hearing is required.

                    <para>- This clause seems to put in a general form what is put in a particular form in clause 46. It appears that this Bill is to apply generally to property which has been acquired under section 85 of the Constitution. To some extent I think that is invalid. Under sub-section (2), of section 85, the mode of valuation prescribed is the mode of valuation under the law of the State in force at the time of the establishment of the Commonwealth. This clause, so far as it concerns property not exclusively used in connexion with any department taken over, isultra <inline font-style="italic">vires,</inline> because it fixes the mode of valuation prescribed in the Bill as the mode applicable to properties taken over, but not exclusively used, although the Constitution fixes the mode as the law of the State. </para>

This is a general sub-section, empowering the Commonwealth to acquire property for any purpose in respect of which this Parliament has power to make laws, and I do not see that such property is included under this or succeeding clauses. It may be that it is intentional, but I do not see any provision to deal with the acquisition of land under section 51, sub-section (32), of the Constitution, and I would like some explanation from the Minister. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HIGGINS</inline>(Northern Melbourne).I hope the reference to the last difficulty will not obscure the reference made by the honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> to another point. Clause 47 distinguishes between lands vested in the Commonwealth under subsection 1 of section 85 of the Constitution, and land acquired under sub-section (2) of the same section. It provides that where land vests in the Commonwealth under the 1st sub-section the Commonwealth is to determine the amount of compensation in a certain way, and where land is acquired under the 2nd sub-section the compensation is to be estimated in another way. I think, however, that it is clause 46 that will create most confusion, because if it means anything it provides that whenever land is either vested in or acquired by the Commonwealth under either of the sub-sections of section 85 of the Constitution it is to be deemed to be vested in the same way as if acquired under this Bill. I suppose the intention is to apply the provisions for compensation which are prescribed in this Bill to all lands whether vested under sub-section 1 or acquired under sub-section 2 of section 85 of the Constitution. I am afraid, however, that that will not work out very smoothly, but will lead to a good lead of litigation. I should like the Minister to consider whether anything is to be gained by retaining section 46. All they want is provided for in clause 47, and even as regards that clause, I think that if we were to follow the wording of the Constitution more closely, it would answer the purpose better suggest that clause 46 should be postponed. </para>

                        <para>- The whole trouble in regard to small pieces of land would be that they would probably be in cities or towns, and the Government would not want to be bothered with them ; but as a matter of fact the greatest amount of increment that is likely to accrue to land in the course of years would attach to city and town lands and not to lands situated in the country. In connexion with town lands, speaking generally, there is a constant increase in value owing to the growing pressure of population, and I think the Government might very well be content with the power to dispose of land by lease. The Government have committed themselves to that general policy in respect to the capital site, and I think it will be in consonance with that policy to omit the provision for power of sale from this clause. </para>

                    <para>- I am quite at one with the honorable member in his desire that we should not sell large areas of land, but this power of sale is intended to meet a different class of cases altogether. It is not likely that the Commonwealth will take up large areas of land, but we shall probably buy an acre or two acres in various places, and may not require the whole area. It would be scarcely worth our while to hold the balance, and allow it to remain practically useless, and if the land is not required there can he no harm in disposing of it by sale. When the draftsman showed me the Bill I at once raised the question as to the desirability of giving power of sale ; but after, discussion I came to the conclusion that there was no harm in putting in this provision, because it is not only really necessary but entirely free from any risk of abuse. I think under the circumstances it would be wise to give the Government the power of sale, because if their hands are tied they will perhaps be required to hold a lot of land that is not really needed by them. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the honorable member will not press this amendment, because without the power of sale the hands of the Government would be tied very tightly, and the Commonwealth might be placed at a great disadvantage in consequence. I would ask the honorable member to remember what has been done in the State of New South Wales. The Government there have had the power of sale; but in consequence of the general feeling that the Government land should not be sold, the Ministry have deferred to the wishes of the people, and have refrained from disposing of their property. The Parliament can always exercise control over the Ministry, and if there should be a very valuable piece of land that could be leased, the Parliament could practically direct the Ministry what they are to do with it. We are not exactly in the same position as a State, and we are not likely to resume land, except for the most important and necessary purposes. If the power of sale is taken away from the Government, it may be necessary for the Commonwealth to enter into building speculations, which it would be better for us to have nothing to do with. We do not want to traffic in land. <inline font-style="italic">.1</inline> think that the Commonwealth will be very careful indeed not to traffic in any way in land. This provision is merely inserted in case it may be required. Under these circumstances, I hope that the honorable member for Bland will not press his amendment. </para>

This provision simply applies to land which has been resumed. We arbitrarily take away a freehold from the individual, and surely if we find that we do not require it, it is only reasonable to allow its former owner an opportunity of re-purchasing it. Under such circumstances, it will be very unwise to tie the hands of the Executive. We cannot possibly for see all the contingencies that may arise.

                        <para>- That is a very fair principle. But by adopting the amendment proposed, we should very often paralyze the operations of the Commonwealth Government. The Government might purchase land and afterwards secure other land which was more suitable, but under this amendment the very land, which, if they had the power to sell, could have been got rid of at once thus, relieving the public Treasury, might remain on their hands for years. We must all recognise that the principle underlying the disposition of our people is to have a freehold. In regard to land which we do not intend to retain for Commonwealth purposes, it would be absolute folly to carry out the principle which we are trying only as an experiment for ourselves. </para>

                    <para>- I ask the honorable member for Bland not to press his amendment. I have had a slight experience of selling to the Victorian Railway department, and of purchasing from that department. As a matter of fact, they have found it cheaper in many instances to purchase a whole block rather than pay for its severance. I do not suppose that the Commonwealth is going in for bartering in land, and to tie their hands in the way proposed would mean adding largely to the cost of any land which we may desire to possess, and which we would have to retain for ever. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HIGGINS</inline>(Northern Melbourne).I would point out that it is not proposed that the Commonwealth shall become a trader in land. The amendment simply means that if an odd corner has been acquired, it ought to be allowed to get rid of it in the way which happens to be current at the time. There is no power for the Commonwealth to acquire land, unless the acquisition is reasonably incidental to the purposes of the Commonwealth. For instance, it might acquire a piece of land for a post-office, and it might subsequently transpire that the population of the town in which the building was to be erected has moved half-a-mile further, so that instead of the post-office being at one end of the town, it ought to be at the other. </para>

                    <para>- I want to take an intermediate view. The Ministry have laid down a very important principle with reference to the Federal Capital. They say it is not well in the interests of the community that land should be sold, but that the community should have the advantage of the land, and it should never be alienated. That is a principle to which I am very glad the Ministry have given their adhesion. It shows how, in spite of the arguments of certain economists, people are coming to a state of sanity in regard to these matters. Concerning this particular proposal I would suggest that it is not expedient, in a Bill which deals only with the acquisition of property, for the Commonwealth to meddle with this large question, which may give rise to a great deal of discussion. I suggest that we might insert a provision that superfluous land should be disposed of in a manner to be directed by a resolution of both Houses. </para>

Ministers have a good deal of reason behind them when they do not desire these big questions to be settled or discussed at this stage. If we are going to apply the principle of the non-alienation of Commonwealth lands to the federal capital I do not see why that principle is not good enough to be applied elsewhere. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to point out that land will only be acquired by the Commonwealth for post and telegraph offices and Custom-houses. This is a very simple provision. There may be an odd piece of land which no one would lease, and which it would not pay the Commonwealth to collect rent from. No Ministry would abuse the principle of sale, because they would be under the control of Parliament. The Commonwealth Government are limited in their operations, and the necessity for holding land is also limited. This is a wise provision, and I heartily support it. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Sir WILLIAM</inline>MCMILLAN (Wentworth). - I contend that it is absolutely wrong for the Commonwealth to hold lands of this kind. The Commonwealth holds land in the different &#34; States simply for its own public purposes, and the moment it finds that it does not require any of it for public purposes that land ought to be sold. We want to strictly confine the Commonwealth to the holding of land for its own purposes, and not allow it to speculate in land. I do not believe in the principle that all land should be leased. I think that some should be held in fee simple and some should be leased. It would be absolutely dangerous to say that all land acquired under any possible circumstances, but not occupied for federal purposes, should be kept under lease, thus increasing the assets of the Commonwealth, the machinery of government, and the general expenditure, against all the rules of common sense. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the principle of leasing hardly arises upon this question. It is not intended that the Commonwealth shall acquire any lands which they do not believe they need for public purposes. I think it would be unwise to tie the hands of the Government, and compel them to accumulate little remnants of land which they cannot use. I agree that the experiment of leasing lands in . perpetuity should be tried in connexion with the federal capital, but that is a different matter altogether. I am glad to think that there is every prospect of that experiment proving successful. The unearned increment in that case should be very large, and it is only right that the Commonwealth should reap the full benefit of it. But to apply the same principle to little remnants of land in outlying places would be a mistake. I think there is more danger of the Government erring in the other direction than there is of it selling land with undue haste. </para>

                    <para>- It is undesirable that the Government should be asked to part with any land which they have acquired for public purposes. I disagree with the honorable member for Wentworth when he says that the Commonwealth have no powers to hold land which they do not require. They have power to deal with every kind of property which comes into their possession. The chief argument urged against the amendment of the honorable member for Bland is, that the Government might become possessed of certain land, and might not require the whole of it for the particular purpose for which they acquired it. I am somewhat surprised to hear honorable members who say that they favour the application of the principle of the non-alienation of Commonwealth lands to the federal capital opposing this amendment. If the Federal Government is a good tiling, will not the value of land which is acquired by them be enhanced in every case? If not, we must admit that, generally speaking, the Federal Government is a bad thing for Australia. I understand, however, that the Minister has some suggestion- to make. </para>

A building was purchased from a Melbourne suburban council some time ago for a post-office, and has been found to be absolutely useless for the purpose, and it would cost more money than the object is worth to erect a suitable building on the site. The suburban council occupies premises in the same block, and a recommendation has been made to me to ask the council to buy this building back in order that a more suitable piece of land for the purposes of a post-office may be got elsewhere. </para>

The building can be utilized by the municipal council, but it is no good to us as a post-office, the site of which in any case must be removed. The amendment would load the Government with properties which the Government do not wish to keep. The suggestion I have to make is that the words &#34; sell, lease, or &#34; be omitted, and at the end of the sub-clause the words &#34; in such manner as the Governor-General in Council may think fit &#34; be added. That will throw the responsibility on the Governor-General in Council. </para>

We have the system of perpetual leasing in South Australia, and, while I am in sympathy with the honorable member, I would not like to be forced to a division on the amendment, because I might be misunderstood.

                        <para>- But the Commonwealth is not a dealer in land, except for the purposes of the federal territory ; and inconvenience would arise out of our forcing the Commonwealth to hold general lands in any part of the Commonwealth outside of the territory required for the immediate purposes of the Constitution. These outside lands would not be subject to State taxation, so that the Commonwealth might own lands in the States, and would not have to pay a single penny of municipal rates or direct taxation to the States ; and that is not advisable. I therefore ask the honorable member for Bland not to move generally that there shall be no land sold, because that would be implying that one of the functions of the Commonwealth is to hold land. We could, if we wish, add a proviso that land becoming vested in the Commonwealth under or for the purposes of section 125 of the Constitution, shall not be sold. That would be a complete declaration of the principle, and would show that we are against porting with any land which becomes the property of the Commonwealth. I prefer that the whole question of leasing should be deferred until we deal with the federal territory in regard to which the Commonwealth will be the landlord. </para>

                    <para>- I am very much in sympathy with what has been advanced by the honorable member for Bland, but I am afraid that the land acquired under the Bill cannot be leased in the way he desires. There is a peculiarity in the title under which the Government is to hold land. It has apparently to hold the land on a title somewhat inferior to that on which the States at present hold land. The Commonwealth is to have the fee simple, and its method of parting with the land is by conveyance, as is the case with all subjects of the Crown, including corporations. But a State may grant land in the name of the King to the Commonwealth, and apparently the Commonwealth will not hold land in the same way as the States do. </para>

                    <para>- I think the amendment of the honorable member for Bland will have an opposite effect to what most honorable members think. The Minister has told us of a case in which there is a piece of land practically useless to the department, but we have not been told whether that land was acquired recently. The honorable member for Wentworth suggested that the Commonwealth might acquire a piece of land, and then find it possible to get another piece which would answer the purpose better. If the amendment were carried the Government would exercise the greatest care before they purchased any land, knowing, as they would, that they would not be able to dispose of it. The honorable member for Gippsland told us that it might be possible for the Commonwealth Government to get an acre of land for the same money as half an acre of land, in a case where half-an-acre was enough for the purpose ; but, if that were so, the Commonwealth would have half an acre of land which had practically cost nothing. The amendment is a wise one, which we would do well to incorporate in the Bill. </para>

                    <para>- The principle of the amendment is a correct one. When once a principle is embodied in a statute, it is referred to as a precedent, and what we do now, more particularly as this is the first time we have had to deal with the sale of land, will be referred to as a guide in the carrying out of purchases on a larger scale at some future time. We should show that we do not believe in the principle that, when once land has been acquired for a specific purpose, it shall be sold or trafficked in by the Government. If the amendment were carried, no doubt the Commonwealth would think twice before they purchased land, and would come to a decisive conclusion as to what they were going to do with the land before they purchased it. It is only right that we should put on the statute book the principle that we do not believe in the Government having the power of sale. </para>

We have seen the development of questions such as this, and fortunately there is always a tendency to preventing the Government selling any land. As there seems to be a general desire not to press this matter further under this Bill, I would like to ask whether the Minister will promise to insert a clause to provide for an annual return to Parliament giving details as to the prices paid for the acquisition of the land, and also the particulars as to the prices received for any land sold by the Government. If that return be promised, it may not be necessary to take this amendment to a division. I feel very strongly in this matter, and unless there is some way of getting proper information, it will be necessary to protest on every occasion. </para>

                        <para>- A bit of railway line could not be leased to a State. I can see clearly that, both with regard to the municipalities - which are, after all, the ground-work of the constitutional system of government - and to the State, there may be many occasions on which, in a friendly way, it would be necessary perhaps to exchange land, which would practically mean selling land ; in other words, to deal with land might be just as necessary for the public interest in the particular locality as for the Commonwealth interest. The clause does not infringe on any principles honorable members may hold in regard to the general desirability of leasing public land. We ought in matters of this kind to give a. very free hand in regard to the interests concerned - not to private interests, but to the public interests arising out of municipal or State government. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WATSON</inline>(Bland).- Some private railway companies at present lease land from the State in New South Wales, and if such leasing pays private companies, surely it would be profitable to the State. But there is something in the contention put forward by the honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> that the transfer of an area of land from private people to the State might mean a loss of revenue to the municipalities. Still, if I thought there was a chance of carrying my amendment that argument would not affect me. My feeling is very strong on this subject, and has been so ever since I was able to think on political affairs at all, and in New South Wales I have said a word or two on the question so far as general land administration is concerned. As there seems no chance of carrying the amendment, and the Minister has: agreed to the suggestion of the honorable member for Wide Bay as to the presentation of a return, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment. </para>

I think the particular mode in which the Commonwealth is to hold lands is worthy of the full attention of the Ministry. I never knew of the King being his own tenant, but clause 7 practically provides that the King, in his capacity as the head of the Commonwealth, is to hold land in fee simple under the King in his capacity as head of the State. I think the committee is indebted to the honorable member for Tasmania <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Piesse)</inline> for the attention which he has given to the titles in connexion with this Bill. I can foresee that the most difficult questions of title will arise unless great care is taken in regard to the expressions used in the Bill. </para>
