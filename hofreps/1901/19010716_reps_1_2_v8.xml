                    <para>- The honorable member was kind enough to inform me that he intended to ask this question at the instance of the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce. I had intended, after making the second reading speech, to adjourn the debate for a week; and I do not like to promise definitely to adjourn it for a longer time. But if there be any good reason advanced for a longer adjournment, the Government do not desire to proceed with the second reading debate with any undue hurry. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot tell the honorable member, because I do not know what returns have been ordered to be printed. I know there is some delay in connexion with the printing of papers, owing, I understand, to a congestion of work at the Printing office, where the printing for the State Parliament as well as that for the Federal Parliament has to be done. But I know the Government Printer has been urged to prevent any unnecessary delay, and there is no desire on the part of the Government that any delay should be caused. I will again communicate with the Government Printer, and endeavour to ascertain whether there is any delay ; and,- if so, what is the reason. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the phrase in this clause "any alteration takes place in the Tariff." As he is already aware, from the discussion that has taken place on another clause, the exact meaning of the words "Tariff alteration" is somewhat in doubt, but it seems to me that according to the Government view of clause 257 the use of these words would preclude the object of the clause being attained in the case of goods as to which an agreement is made before a Tariff alteration is proposed, and which are delivered for home consumption before the altered Tariff is actually agreed to. If the goods were delivered in the interval between the period of the proposition being submitted to Parliament and the adoption <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> Parliament of the Tariff, the use of the words mentioned would absolutely preclude the clause being taken advantage of. If an agreement for the sale or delivery of goods duty paid, were made prior to any proposal to alter the Tariff, and if then a proposal to alter the Tariff were made and the goods were delivered after that proposal had been submitted to Parliament, but prior to the adoption of the altered Tariff by Parliament; in other words if the goods were delivered in the interregnum - about which there has been so much discussion in connexion with the Tariff which is to come into force at an early date - I do not think that under this clause either seller or buyer would be able to make any alteration in price. As a matter of fact, however, the altered duty would be collected by some means or other, either under a resolution of the House under the old constitutional practice, or under clause 257 if it becomes law. I do not think that this clause provides for that 'particular case. </para>

                    <para>- On this subject of drawbacks I should like to hear the views of the Minister on the question of the Western Australian Tariff. Section 95 of the Constitution Act provides that the State of Western Australia may during the first five years, after the imposition of uniform duties of customs, impose duties of customs on goods passing into that State, and not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, and that such duties shall be collected by the Commonwealth. Under the existing circumstances of the State laws manufacturers in Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales, and the rest of the States are enabled to send their manufactures into Western Australia, and to recover drawbacks on duties paid upon the articles used in their manufactures. If, however, Western Australia levies duties on Inter-State" manufactures which- come from the States after having already been subject to the payment of duty there - take such things as sugar, jam, preserved fruit, and biscuits - the States will be placed in a very unfair position in competing with the old country or America. For instance, American fruits would be manufactured with practically duty-free sugar, and the English jams would be made in the same way, whereas if the Commonwealth Government puts a duty of £6 or <inline font-style="italic">£7</inline> per ton on sugar, or levies an excise duty, we should have to enter Western Australian ports and compete with English and American goods at a corresponding disadvantage. Of course we cannot say what duty will be levied on English jams and confectionery ; but, at any rate, it seems to me that the manufacturers of the other States will be placed at a manifest disadvantage if some drawback is not allowed to them during the five years for which Western Australia is to be allowed to collect duties on imports from the other States. </para>

                    <para>- The matter is one which has not been overlooked, but my attention is now being directed to the preparation of a special clause to meet the case. Of course we do not know what Western Australia is going to do, but we know that she will have power to levy duties on Inter-State goods according to a certain graduated scale. Therefore, it may be that, in respect to these goods, if these rates are levied, Western Australia will in some respects stand in the same relation to the Commonwealth as a foreign country. I think the matter will be best dealt with by preparing a special clause, and I will frame one and put it on the file, or I will give the honorable member the opportunity of doing so himself. I shall be glad to afford him any assistance I can. </para>

                    <para>- I think that after the last word "circumstances" there should be added the words "or explanation to the satisfaction of the collector," or whoever the proper authority may be. There are often occasions on which a ship with cargo may pass a port because she may receive a telegram directing her- to call off a port for instructions, and she may then carry her cargo on to a place which was not intended when she left London. </para>

                        <para>- The same thing often happens to even the coasting vessels. A merchant may telegraph from Fremantle desiring that certain cargo, instead of being delivered at Melbourne, shall be carried on to Sydney. In such a case as that, probably the collector would not raise trouble, but at the same time it should be provided for in the clause. There are two distinct points dealt with in this clause - the first relating to the removal of goods from one ship to another at sea, while the second provision is that a ship shall not deviate from her- voyage unless forced to do so by unavoidable circumstances. I think the Minister might agree to the addition of the words I have suggested. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he has considered the question of adopting the system, which works so satisfactorily in Victoria, of having . licensed Customs agents? The clause apparently contemplates any person being employed or appointed an agent. An agent is of no use in reference to Customs unless he knows the procedure, and it is desirable for the sake of those who employ them that these agents should be men who understand the business. A large importer employs his own clerks, who understand the business, because their employers are continually importing; but there is a large number of people who, in dealing with the Customs department, feel very much at sea. If they know they can <inline font-style="italic">go to</inline> a licensed agent who has some knowledge of his work, they can trust their affairs to him with confidence. </para>

                    B. EDWARDS (South Sydney).I think there -is some confusion in this clause between Customs-house agents and ordinary business agents. If 1 may allude to clause 172 at this stage, it will be observed that provision is there made for making the agent responsible as though he were the- principal. A Customs-house agent is in a very different position from that of an ordinary business agent. He knows only what his principal chooses to inform him of, and gets no other information ; but an "ordinary business agent would have to take much greater responsibilities than that. We' should therefore make some clear distinction between business agents and Customs-house agents.

                    <para>- I also desire to obtain some information with respect to clause . 170. The custom in Victoria and in South Australia has been to license certain persons as Customs agents. Apparently the clause contemplates the abolition of that provision and the authorization of any person to act as a Customs agent. The Victorian agents have waited upon me and requested me to put their case before the Minister for Customs. The right honorable and learned gentleman will recollect that I have spoken to him upon this subject on one or two occasions, but we have not had sufficient time to go -into details. Under the system in force in Victoria - I am not quite so familiar with the position in South Australia - certain persons have been authorized to act as Customs agents. They are required to enter into a fidelity bond of £500 each, and having entered into that bond they are permitted to carry on business. It has been found in: Victoria that these men are of great assistance in facilitating Customs-house work. They are expert men, with years of experience which helps them very materially in carrying out their duties. They have proved of assistance to the Customs-house authorities themselves. It was a Customs agent in Victoria, who upon one very celebrated occasion, showed the Commissioner of the day where a very serious leakage had taken place, with- the result that a large sum of money was recovered by the State. These agents are of opinion that their rights and privileges, if they have any, are being . token away from them by this clause, The honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> has circulated an amendment which it appears to me might meet the difficulty. He proposes to add the following new clause-after clause 170 : - </para>

                <para class="block">Reference- has been made by the honorable, member for South Sydney to clause 172, which makes agents personally liable for any penalties recoverable under the. measure. Surely this provision is not contemplated with respect to Customs-house agents pure and simple. It may be intended with regard to those who act as Customs-house clerks or shipping clerks in the employ of large firms, and other business people. It could hardly be intended, however, that the provision should apply to a business agency, pparticularly when such agencies are licensed in the way I have suggested. In order to save time I would inquire whether the Commissioner of Customs has read a very trenchant article on this subject, which appeared in yesterday's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> under the heading of " Trade and Finance." The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> devotes half a column to the subject, and the question is summed up by it in this way - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para class="block">The question that must naturally suggest itself is what are the reason's for abandoning the ; present system, that has been proved to work well, in favour of letting any person, responsible or irresponsible, honest man or rogue, expert or ignoramus, come and try a hand on Customs agency work ? It has been said that the system of. licensed agents is not adopted in England. But the answer is very clear, which is that with its virtually free ports their services are not required. It may be fairly suggested that this licence system may be made a source of revenue to the Customs department, and this should favorably suggest itself to the Minister. Impose a licence-fee on a scale graduated on the amount of business done at the port for which the licence is granted. If the sum of , £25 is made the maximum, with a minimum of say £5 per annum, a fair return will be obtained, whilst the.regulations on which a licence will be granted will be so framed, as to secure the best results to the State and the public. </para>
                    <para class="block">That in short sums up the whole position. I believe that these provisions have been inserted largely as the result of suggestions made in Sydney. New South Wales, however, has very few items, comparatively speaking, to be dealt with through the Customs as compared with Victoria and South Australia, and has not had the same necessity for employing skilled men in this direction. To dissect a list of goods, and to put it into proper form for entry, is no light work. I have some examples here, which I am prepared to lay before the Minister privately. It requires greater knowledge and experience than will be found in the case of any person casually appointed or authorized to do the work. I would suggest to the Minister that he might add the words which have been proposed by the honorable member for South Australia, and that he should make it quite clear that the persons to be made personally liable under clause 172 are the clerks of business firms, and not Customs-house agents as such. </para>

                    <para>- I would urge the Minister of Customs to accept the suggestion which has been thrown out in regard to this clause. I think it would be very unfair if those who are at present acting as Customs agents were not allowed to continue in that capacity. </para>

                        <para>- It would be very unwise to allow everybody and anybody to come in and deal with what will become an even more technical and troublesome work than it is at the present time. The fact that agents are required to give a substantia] bond to the Government, will be an assurance to those having business to place in their hands that their work will be carried out properly and their goods delivered. If there were no guaranteed Customs agents any one might put himself forward, obtain possession of a man's luggage or goods, and make away with them. The effect of having an agent under a substantial bond to do the work is a guarantee, and it will satisfy persons that their business will be properly attended to. </para>

                        <para>- Under this clause a man may employ any one he pleases for the purpose of doing customs work, and so long as the employer is satisfied why should the Government interfere ? What I understand is proposed is' that a provision shall be inserted declaring that no one but a licensed agent shall undertake customs work, and requiring from any person desirous of entering upon such business a security before he undertakes it. I think it is better that we should leave the matter as proposed by the Government. If the party interested is satisfied why should the department interfere ? As it has been remarked, this desired provision is conspicuous by its absence, so far as Great Britain is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- It is to some extent, but I venture to think that we can allow people to manage their own affairs, and to decide whom they employ and whom they will not. If we do not do so we shall create a monopoly in favour of the people who choose to comply with the conditions which have been specified. It seems to me that to interfere as regards a matter of this sort would be to unnecessarily embarrass the people interested.

                    <para>- Speaking as who one has had a quarter of a century's business experience, and especially of Customshouse work, I think the Government are adopting a wrong course in not adhering to the custom which has been in vogue in South Australia and in Victoria for many years past, the custom of having licensed Customs agents under proper bonds. It is fi protection, not only to the importer, but a protection and a help to the Government also. There can be no greater annoyance and worry to the officers of the Customs department than that which is caused by amateurs attempting to pass general Customs entries. It is always very much better, both for the owner of the goods and for the Government, that the man who has the duty of passing entries should understand the various entries under which goods require to be passed, the rates of duty collectable, and the general routine of the Customs department. It would be of benefit to the Government and to the owner, especially, iri respect of a drastic Bill such as this, and of the probable equally drastic regulations that will be made under the Bill, because in many cases, owing to innocent errors of agents, who are not educated in Customs work, owners of goods may be involved in litigation and trouble with the Customs department. The system of having licensed Customs agents has been in vogue in South Australia for many years past, and I believe I am right in saying that it has also been the custom in Victoria, and I have no doubt that, for the merchants, the agents, and the Government department, it would be very much better that that system should be adhered to. I shall therefore have very much pleasure in supporting any amendments proposed in the direction suggested by my honorable friends on the other side of the House. </para>

                        <para>- A little verbal alteration may be required in the earlier part of the clause,' where a couple of words have been transposed. There seems to be a disposition on the part of the committee to have an amendment of this description made. There is a good deal to be said as regards the practice of the States, and as the practice of the States seems to me in a good many cases to be in effect what is proposed by the amendment, the Government are not disposed to divide the committee against the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I admit there is a good deal to be said on both sides of this Customs agent question, but the absence of the provision for licensed agents does not prevent the establishment of Customs agents who are not licensed, but who become recognised in the trade as persons who can be looked to for the proper passing of the necessary entries through the Customshouse. I am inclined to agree with those who think that as we are likely to have a widening of our duties, as compared with those existing in some of the States and in Great Britain, it may be desirable to have licensed agents, so that security is given to the Customs department, which they would not otherwise possess, for the proper fulfilment of the law as laid down in this Bill and in the regulations which may be passed under it. But I think the proposition to add the words submitted by the honorable member for Corinella may go further than he possibly intends, because under the clause, as he proposes to amend, it, an agent may be a firm, and, as defined in the interpretation clause, the word " owner " includes all sorts of persons. </para>

                        <para>- I think there is some confusion of terms here, and I suggest that if the Minister takes the proposed amendment into consideration he will also take the wording of the clause into consideration. There is, to my mind, some confusion between " owners and agents " ; and clause 170, as proposed to be amended, would evidently mean that a consignee of goods could not pass entries for the goods, but that the owner, in the ordinary sense, must employ a Customs agent. If you take it with the interpretation clause, all agents are owners, including the Customs agent. </para>

                    <para>- I have listened carefully to the arguments presented in connexion with the clause. The Minister himself said that, so far as the owners are concerned, if .they were satisfied there would not be much danger to be expected. The only argument used in support of the. amendment is that it is in keeping with the practice adopted in South Australia and in Victoria.. There is no proof that there will be any guarantee for the revenue of the country by the establishment of licensed Customs agents. The honorable member for Bourke, in suggesting an amendment, said that the clause was probably due to the practice in Sydney. If this idea has been suggested from Sydney that does not make it bad. Then he argued that because Great Britain has a lesser Tariff than has Victoria probably that is the reason why they have not licensed agents. But there was a time in Sydney, when- for about two years we had a Tariff nearly as strong as the Victorian Tariff, and there were no complaints from the Treasury in regard to the invasion . of the law, or difficulties in regard to people passing entries for goods. I think it is. much wiser to provide for freedom of action. It is said that a servant can be used by the indentor. That practically gives away the difficulty arising as to a Customshouse agent, but suppose that a small indentor himself wished to do the work he could. I am afraid that the only reason why' Customs-house agents- have been used, has been simply because, by being practically on right lines, they have the run of the Customs-house.- It has been known for some, time past that Customs-house agents present facilities to various business people, and that through their relations with Customshouse officials they manage to pass entries for goods more speedily than other persons can do. Unless some reason be given to me showing that the provision now' suggested will be a safeguard for the revenue, or that there is some necessity for it, I shall vote for the- clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>- Perhaps the Minister will explain exactly what is intended by the clause. As I understand it, he means to make those persons who are, under the terms of clause 170, exclusively in the employ of owners, personally liable ; but as it reads, it seems to me that it may also have application to those who act as Custom-house agents. What we want, therefore, is clearness, as between the person exclusively employed, who ought to be liable as being the direct representative of the owner, and a Custom-house agent, who ought to be liable under the bond he will have to give, which is another kind of liability. Perhaps, if the Minister will explain the situation, or suggest words which would make it quite dear, the whole matter would be righted. </para>

                        <para>- I do not understand what else the amendment can mean. Clause 172, in. effect, says that any person who deals with goods at the Customs as an agent shall not be allowed to shelter- himself behind the statement, " I am only an agent ; I am not the owner." If we expressly extend the protection afforded by such a statement to the Customs agent, it "seems to me we shall give the agent a loop-hole for escaping in all sorts of ways. Looking through the Bill hurriedly, I do not find any, or many, clauses which create penalties in respect of matters the agent might not very well know the truth or falsity of. If the honorable member for South Sydney can point out to me clauses which create penalties for offences which the agent might be ignorant of committing, the point he has raised might be considered in connexion with those clauses. But the vast majority of the provisions of the Bill to which any penalty is attached are provisions dealing with matters of which the agent especially has knowledge. In moving the amendment recently, which created, or rather extended, the system of licensed Customs agents, I certainly did not contemplate that in addition to giving licenses, we should also give license to agents to do what they choose without being subject to penalty. I know the honorable member for South Sydney does not desire the latter, but I am afraid that, so far as I understand, the amendment will have that effect. It seems to me that the effect of the clause as amended would be to say that every agent, except a licensed agent, shall be responsible for breaches of the law as if he were the owner of the goods, but that licensed agents shall not be responsible for breaches of the law, because they are not the owners of the goods. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with what the honorable and learned member for Corinella has just said. I am sure it is not the intention of the honorable member for South Sydney to allow an agent who has a licence, or anybody else, to have freedom from the obligation to strictly comply with the Customs law. But I would draw the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs to the framing of this clause, and point out to him what I think is a loophole by which an agent, whether licensed or' not, might find a means of escape. The first part of the clause reads - </para>

                    B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). - In defence of my amendment I may put a case to the committee. A man could go to a Customs agent and say - " Pass entries for me for 30 cases of flour." That so-called flour may turn out to be tobacco, but the agent, not
                    <inline font-style="italic">knowing</inline>
                    anything of that, may pass the entry, and when the cases are stopped and found to contain tobacco, the innocent agent may be made to suffer for the fraud of his employer It may be that being a mere layman I cannot construct my amendment in the way I would wish, but it is quite clear what I want to get at, and I should be glad of any assistance. Customs agents, as the clause now stands, will be made responsible for a great deal more than they are undertaking, and they may be the victims of fraud. Having regard to the latter part of the clause, which provides that nothing therein contained shall be taken to relieve any principal from liability, I think the revenue would be amply protected if my amendment were passed.

The clause would make the Customs agent liable not only for any neglect of duty in regard to the manner of passing entries on his own part, but also absolutely personally liable for fraudulent invoices, for under valuations, and for a host of other offences of which he has no possible means of possessing proper knowledge. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, and the owner of the goods should be liable. The Customs authorities always have the owner of the goods at hand, and the goods themselves in the Customs' possession are the very best guarantee of liability. Is that not the system in Victoria and in South Australia to-day? The Customs agent is liable for any breach of any Customs Act. He is liable for wilful misrepresentation ; but this clause as it stands would make him liable, not only for any offence that may be laid down and will be laid down under the regulations, which will have to be framed for the guidance of Customs authorities, but also liable for fraud on the part of the principal. For bogus invoices, invoices which do not represent the full contents of cases, invoices which represent improper and under valuations and a host of other offences, which might and which do come fairly under previous clauses of the Bill, the Customs agent, who merely receives the half-crown, or whatever is the usual charge for the entry will be held responsible exactly in the same way as a principal. That, I think, is absurd. We undoubtedly want Customs agents, not only for the assistance of owners and principals, but also for the assistance of the Government and the Customs department, in order that the work may be done properly. The experience of every business man in the House will indorse the statement that properly licensed and experienced Customs agents are a benefit to the whole business community ; and we do not want to prevent the employment of such agents, who pay reasonable licence-fees and give bonds for good behaviour to the extent of some hundreds of pounds. The bonds amount, I think, to £500 in South Australia, but I do not know what they amount to in Victoria. We do not want men like that to be debarred by any clause so stringent as this, from carrying on business which they may have been conducting for the last quarter or half a century. I would suggest that as the question of licensed Customs agents is a new one, with regard to this Bill at any rate, having only been introduced this afternoon by the amendment of the honorable and learned member foi1 Corinella, the Minister for Trade and Customs might reasonably consent to postpone the consideration of this clause. </para>

                    <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member for South Australia, Mi-. V. L. Solomon, that, as this is a new matter which will need, perhaps, several clauses to deal with it in all its aspects, the Minister might postpone it and consider other legislation. Some remarks have been made to the effect that an excessive amount of tenderness is being shown to the Customs agents, seeing that other agents who may be equally innocent with them, are made liable to the full penalties of this Bill. For instance, a carrying agent passes his entries, and neither he nor the Customs-house agent can be acquainted with the contents of the cases for which he is passing those entries. He does not know - if <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> duties are being levied - that the values given are legitimate values. He simply passes the entry on the faith of his instructions, and he is equally innocent with the Customs agent if there is error or an attempt to defraud. The clerk to the firm is also made liable under this Act, although he may be absolutely innocent of any attempt to defraud. It has been said that the owners are the security behind the agent, but I would point out that the owners are very often beyond our jurisdiction. Then the goods are security in addition. But the goods very often are not worth anything like the amount of the duty imposed. For instance, when it is attempted to smuggle goods, the value of those goods is often very small in comparison with the amount of duty that would be levied. Where is the security there?- I have not agreed with some of the extremely drastic provisions of this Bill, but I do agree with the necessity for holding responsible somebody who is ".get-at-able." I do believe in holding the agent who passes an entry responsible for frauds which may be attempted on the Customs-house authorities. But if we let the Customs-house agent escape, because he cannot know - and it is a fact that he cannot know - then we must let the other people, such as forwarding agents, carriers, clerks in the employ of firms, business firms who act as delivery agents to pass goods from another firm in another country, who cannot know anything about the goods, be fully freed from responsibility. The principle of Customs provisions is . this - that any agent acting takes care to see that the people he is acting for are such as are not likely to commit fraud, or to insure that he has sufficient security from them to pay any penalty to which he may become liable. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HUME</inline>
                    COOK (Bourke).- By the amendment which has just been carried, we have created two kinds of agents. One class includes those who act, and who are, in point of fact,, clerks, and the other class comprises those who are not clerks, but who act for all and sundry who have to do Customs-house work. The latter are to be licensed. I have just taken up the Victorian Customs Act, and I find that licensed agents have to enter into a fidelity bond of £500 for themselves and their clerks acting for them. The penalty is that these licences may by order be cancelled or revoked, and their holders' businesses stopped for any fraud or misconduct. There is no such provision in this Bill. -Whilst I am not opposed to some kind of penalty being imposed in the case of a certain class of Customs agents, it does seem, in view of the fact that we have attempted to do two things, that the Minister ought to consider whether he will extend the same kind of penalties to the licensed man as he proposes to extend to those who are not licensed, but who act exclusively for their principals.- I rose chiefly to support the request which has been made, that in view of the new provision the Minister might reconsider the whole matter. Whilst I think that licensed agents ought to be subject to some kind of penalty, it ought not to be the same penalty as is meted out in the case of- owners or their clerks. I suggest that the Minister should consider the section of the Victorian Customs Act, and also look up the South

                </para>
                <para>When any person is expressly or impliedly authorized by the owner to act as his agent in relation to any goods for all or any purposes of any Customs Act, or represents or passes himself, or acts, or assumes to act, as such agent, such person shall for such purpose be also deemed to be- the owner of such goods, and shall be personally liable for any penalties recoverable under this Act in the same manner and to the same extent as his principal. </para>
                <para class="block">The provision clearly contemplates that the principal shall be liable. As I say, the party who passes himself off as the agent might not actually be the agent, and this clause certainly contemplates that the principal shall be made liable for his acts. </para>

                        <para>- But he would not be. There was some little fear on the part of some honorable members that he would, but we propose to make the matter clearer in the way suggested. I thoroughly agree with what has fallen from the honorable member for North' Sydney. The position is this : We were asked to do two things. One was that we would create a class of licensed agents. Well and good, we have done that. But then we are asked to go further, and to declare that those agents shall not be liable for inaccuracies. </para>

                        <para>- It would just amount to this, then : that instead of having men transacting business with the Customs, as it has been transacted from all time, subject to the condition that in case of error - in point of fact one is punished for error for the security of the revenue and for the prevention of error in the future - we should have it set up as a plea - " I did not know - the knowledge was not within my power." Agents would be employed all over the place and our whole security would be gone, because if their want of knowledge were accepted as an excuse, they would be in a position to cut at the whole root, bottom, and foundation of the Customs Act. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that it will be necessary to go a good deal farther than the Minister has so far expressed his readiness to go, and that, as an honorable member has suggested, we should provide that agents shall give bonds or other necessary security for the proper performance of their duty. I think the Minister would hardly be able to provide for this merely by prescription under regulation, and as there must be a very stringent provision for voiding the bonds in certain events, I submit that it is necessary to introduce some provision in the Bill with regard to these bonds. I would like to point out to those honorable members who are desiring to relieve Customs agents of liability to penalty that they are not at all concerned about the innocent clerks who may make declarations for owners who have an intent to defraud the Customs. </para>

Those who are engaged in the business must be ready to undertake all the risks attached to it, and although I sympathize, to some extent, with the amendment of the honorable member for South Sydney, I regard it as one that cannot very well be entertained. </para>

                    B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). - I shall feel justified in pressing this amendment, unless the Minister will consent, as suggested, to hold it over for further con sideration, so that he may consult his officials, and bring it forward again in some more acceptable form. I hold that these agents might be made quite innocent perpetrators of fraud, and they should not be held responsible with regard to declarations of values. The difficulty that has been suggested by the Minister, could easily be got over, because it could be insisted that the declaration as to value should come from the owner or his business agent. The Minister has not answered the case that I put of a man passing an entry for say 30cases of flour which afterwards turned out to contain tobacco. It would be impossible for an agent in such circumstances to discover the actual facts, and he ought not to be held responsible for the incorrect description of the goods. The owner of the goods ought to be called upon to declare the value, either personally or through his business agent, and the matter should not rest with the Customs agent at all. As it is not fair or just that the agents should be held responsible for all the frauds that might be perpetrated through them, and considering that in cases of fraud the department has the owners or principals to fall back upon, I will press my amendment. These agents cannot be in collusion with the principals.

It is really a very- important matter which will affect a large number of people in various parts of the States and involve a large sum of money, and, as the Minister has already admitted, it is one really vital to the collection of the duties. 1 hope he will give the matter further consideration, and that the representations made will show the Minister clearly that, while there is a strong feeling on the part of some honorable members as to the undesirability of pressing the obligations too heavily on the agents, it is recognised that the department is entitled to look to the agents to take some share of the responsibility. A middle course will have to be taken, and I am strongly of the opinion - -which I believe to be shared by several other honorable members - that the clause should be postponed, so that the obligations and responsibilities of agents may receive consideration. </para>

                    (North Sydney). - In view of the determination of the honorable member for South Sydney to press his amendment, I would like to add a few words to what I have already said. I would point out that all classes of agents dealt with in this clause might be the innocent perpetrators of fraud or error - all of them - but the only proposal so far is to relieve those who happen to be licensed Customs agents. Why should this protection be given to one set of men and not to others
                    <inline font-style="italic">1</inline>
                    I have- already directed the attention of the Minister to one matter, and that is that while I quite recognise the need of protecting the Customs by imposing penalties even where there has been innocent error, I do object that, with these penalties, there shall be any imputation of fraud, or any description of the offence as a crime, when no crime has been proved or any evidence of intent to defraud produced. In another part of the Bill where smuggling is dealt with, I pointed out that, whilst there should be a liability to penalty, there should be no charge of crime or any description of crime unless such crime could be clearly proved. The penalty may be imposed, but-what is often worse to an honest firm - the suspicion that they have been committing crime should not be imputed to them. I agree that there should be opportunities of imposing penalties, or else carelessness would become so frequent that the Customshouse would have great difficulty in dealing with it.

                        <para>- If the agent attempted to pass tobacco as flour, and got an invoice from the merchant, if he was not to be liable under the circumstances, the question arises - who should be liable? First, the department would bring its action, or attempt to impose penalties upon the agent. He would turn round and offer the defence that he was not responsible. He would escape. Next, it would be attempted to enforce the remedy against the merchant. The agent would not be a willing witness under the circumstances. The - department would not know from whom the consignment came or by whom it was obtained. If .excuses of that sort were allowed, it is impossible to over-estimate the danger to the Customs revenue. </para>

                    <para>- I am afraid that this is a rather strange way of doing business. A number of honorable members have very courteously asked the Minister to postpone this clause, and the right honorable gentleman, in reply to them, says - - "Let- us fight it out now, and after we have fought it out we may go back to it again." If the Minister has the slightest intention of yielding in any. event to the postponement, it will save time that that course be taken now ; because there are only a few clauses which will offer trouble, and the effect of postponing a debatable clause very often is. to get the work through more readily.Honorable members are justified in calling jointed attention to some of the provisions of this clause. Right through the Bill the provisions are, as honorable members who are familiar with the Customs Acts will admit, very severe. They multiply the possibilities of persons being punished by the Commonwealth Customs department in a fashion that is entirely unknown at the present time. All sorts of things are attempted against persons who have business with the Customs department ; there are all sorts of penalties and conditions in favour of the department, and enabling the Minister to punish as fraudulent actions which are not in all cases fraudulent at all. The Minister might see his way to reconsider some of these matters. In the case of the licensed Customs-house agents the Minister will see that the department has such persons completely under his control. The bread and butter of the agents depends largely on the confidence and favour of the department. That is evident. What is a penalty in connexion with a shipment of goods to a Customshouse agent as compared with the risk he would run of being deprived of his licence ? The amendment suggests that these persons should be licensed in the manner prescribed . That means that the Government may surround the licences with every precaution and may take pains to secure themselves in any conceivable way. They can take away the licence of any! agent who comes under the suspicion of the department in connexion with his business. Could there be a heavier penalty than that ? I put it earnestly that that is the greatest penalty that could be imposed upon any Customs-house agent - that if he is not acting in a manner that is straightforward with the department he is immediately exposed to the forfeiture of his means of living. </para>

                        <para>- I was not aware of that. A special provision is scarcely required,' however, because if the agent is licensed the power to license implies a power to revoke. It follows as an incident of the licensing that the Minister, if he found a Customhouse agent associated with any suspicious character or a party to any suspicious transaction, might immediately say, "We can have no confidence in this man we will take away his licence." That is the hold which he possesses over the licensed Custom-house agent. I think that every well-administered Customs department does its best to remain on good terms with these agents, because they are practically of great advantage to the department. They save the Customs officers a great deal of trouble. They are persons skilled in their work and the department finds them a positive convenience. In dealing with them they are dealing with skilled persons, instead of with a number of persons more or less ignorant, perhaps, and perhaps more or less tricky. A. Customhouse agent cannot afford to be tricky, because the Minister has his thumb on him all the time. The more the Custom-house agent is encouraged the better it will be for the department. As a rule, these agents take a good deal of care of themselves. My anxiety goes a good deal further. I can see that clerks in offices may be liable to these penalties in simply carrying out their masters' business. They may come down to the Custom-house to pass an entry, and some unfortunate man may, perhaps, be designedly put forward by the principal. Sometimes there is a tendency to take the smaller instead of the larger man. </para>

These things can be overdone, and I think there is an attempt to rather overdo the penalizing provisions of this clause. I certainly would vote for the amendment distinctly on the ground that by it these persons will be brought directly under the control of the Minister, and therefore we shall have some assurance that they will be kept in order. </para>

It has been drawn as if every attempt at trade were a criminal offence, and in certain prescribed offences the penalties accruing are laid down in a manner rather worthy of Draconian legislation than legislation of to-day. Therefore we should not allow agents to be made liable, provided that they can show that they have acted in a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> manner. The Minister for Customs says that they are liable. I presume, therefore, that he is also liable for the acts of his Custom-house officers ; and as his Custom-house officers last month' destroyed the heads and livers of 150 head of cattle and some 1,200 or 1,300 sheep,which would have done very well for food, he must take the responsibility of that act. </para>

If the right honorable and learned gentleman had been living in the time of the French Revolution, and had sanctioned such a proceeding, we know the fate that would have befallen him.

                    B. EDWARDS (South Sydney).I . am sorry that I am as obstinate as the Minister for Customs, because the Minister has been asked to do what is a very reasonable and a very expedient thing. We have already amended clause 170 by introducing a provision for licensed Customs agents ; and I am sure the Minister himself does not see what the effect of this sub-clause will be. To give him an opportunity of considering the point, and the question how far agents should be held responsible, as well as for considering any further alteration, we ask to have this clause postponed. I think the Minister by resisting this request has hardly treated the committee in a way that will help us to get through the Bill. If the right honorable and learned gentleman had agreed to the postponement half-an-hour ago, we should have been half-a-dozen clauses ahead. 1 am quite certain that if he allows the clause to be postponed and comes down to the committee with some qualification, which, while it might not give all that we ask, would meet the position I have taken up, we should get on much faster. I am of opinion that we ought to take the amendment a little further so as to include innocent agents outside licensed Customs-house agents, and at the same time, if the Minister thought fit, he might make some further amendment so as to protect his revenue from fraud, where these people were clearly participating in that fraud. I think it is the Minister who is really wasting the time of the committee, because if he were to postpone the clause and to come down subsequently and say that he could not meet us to more than a certain extent, we should be prepared to help him. I am certain he has not fully considered the clause.

We have had a very fair debate on the clause. The question is not a particularly complicated one, and I do not think that it has been rendered more complicated by the amendment which was carried in clause 170. The effect of that clause is to give certain agents a licence and practically a monopoly, and to make their positions very much more profitable.

                    mceacharn (Mei- bourne) - I am not disposed to support the amendment, but at the same time I would urge the Minister to recommit these clauses. I do so because I feel that the amendment made in clause 170 may have such an effect upon other clauses, that it is wise to give the matter full consideration before passing them. I think the Minister may undertake to recommit that clause, because I shall certainly move the recommittal of clause 172 upon another point, and also of clause 173.

                        <para>- Very well; that will not be opposed. I am sorry if honorable members think I am too much attached to this Bill. We have not introduced its provisions without giving them some consideration, and we may therefore be expected to adhere to them until we are satisfied that they are wrong. So far as the amendment of the honorable member for South Sydney is concerned, we are not satisfied that there is any error. We would ask the committee therefore to take a division, and give us the clause, as I am perfectly prepared, seeing that a new point has been raised by the introduction of licensed agents, to recommit these clauses. </para>

                    <para>- I do not know whether the Minister has intentionally departed from the provisions of the Victorian Act, but I would like to draw his attention to the difference, because it seems to me that very great and unmerited hardship may be cast upon owners of goods by this clause.

                <para class="block">It matters not whether he can prove absolute innocence in the matter, or whether he has given written directions which have been wilfully violated, the clause holds simply that because the declaration is made, it is made with the consent of the person. In the Victorian Act, which has never been found to be defective, we have section 83 under which it is provided- </para>
                <para>Any declaration made under any law now or hereafter in force relating to the Customs by any shipping clerk or known employe of any importer or owner of goods or merchant shall be held to have been made with the knowledge and consent of such importer or owner of goods or merchant unless the contrary be proved. </para>
                <para class="block">And the note to that section in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston's</inline> book, "The Victorian Customs and Marine Law," at page 39, is this - </para>
                <para>The burden of proof is shifted upon the importer, &amp;c. He would have to prove a negative - always a difficult task. </para>
                <para class="block">It seems to me that it is a very important thing,' and a very strong thing to say that however clearly a man may be able to prove his innocence he is not to be heard. It should be quite sufficient to put the onus of proof upon the owner, and until he proves his innocence to assume him to be guilty. . That itself is a strong thing to do, but I think it is necessary to do it. I think it is certainly sufficient to do that without shutting the door upon him altogether. A man's character may be at stake, and he may have taken every proper precaution, but business cannot be carried on altogether personally; men must trust to agents, and for the mere wilfulness or negligence of an agent, a man may be held irretrievably to have made a false declaration when he is absolutely innocent. I trust the Minister will see the necessity for adding these words, which are to be found in the Victorian Customs Act. I believe they will be found to meet all that is required, and if in time they are not found to be effective, the law can be strengthened. I do not want formally to move the addition of the words, but I ask the Minister to accept the suggested amendment. </para>

                        <para>- They are extracted from different parts of various Acts, and I imagine that there is no one more familiar with customs practice in South Australia, than is the honorable member. If it is to be taken as an excuse that the connexion between master and employeee is not further shewn than by the nature of their employment, it seems to me that in a very large number of cases indeed, although we throw on the master the onus of establishing this, there is a very great probability of the intention of the law being defeated ; and when a false declaration has been made of the master testifying that he did not authorize the clerk to make the statement referred to, and the clerk - looking at the risk he is exposed to if he gave evidence - declining to give evidence in opposition to the statement of the master. We have not declared that there shall be, and it is not the purport of the Act that there shall be necessarily any moral wrong attaching to an infraction of the law. Of course, where we hold the master liable under all circumstances that . could hardly be the case ; but if we are going to let the master go free when his declaration is made by the employeee, because he declares that he did not know anything about it, we are simply accepting ignorance or want of proper supervision as an excuse for that which ought not to be excused. Look at the position in which we put the vigilant master and the careful master. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot provide further. The principle which has been contended for in various parts of the Chamber is that where a mistake is made the man has to suffer, and if mistakes are not to be punishable simply because they are mistakes, if the most perfect disclosure is not to be insisted upon, and punished where it is not given, we are sapping the" foundations of the Customs system, and rendering possible a leakage in connexion with the Customs revenue which it is our duty to do our best to prevent. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not think it is possible for us to be too careful in providing that we get what we are entitled to from the merchants - correct information ; and any system which lands us in the trouble, either in the first instance or afterwards, of an inquiry as to whether the clerk told the master or whether the master told the clerk, seems to be of a most mischievous description, and one against which it is our duty to struggle. We recognise that within the four corners of the Bill we are punishing two classes of cases. One is mistake, error, want of perfect information ; it may be more or less culpable, but not a crime, and certain pecuniary penalties are attached. Then, where fraud is committed heavier punishments are provided for, and it has to be specially clearly proved that that does not apply here. This is simply as regards the making of a declaration which is inaccurate. I ask honorable members to take the two positions. In the first place, the merchant, careful and vigilant, employs a clerk and instructs him fully ; the clerk goes down and makes a declaration and it is untrue. </para>

The merchant, careless and reckless, looks in no way after the business, is utterly reckless how it is conducted, knows nothing. The result is utter carelessness from which the revenue suffers. As regards this question of carelessness we generally find that it is not carelessness which gives us a larger revenue, but carelessness in a different direction. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what has happened in Victoria except during the last six months. Look at the position, and apply our common sense to the question. When it was a question of saddling the master with a liability, what clerk would risk his place by contradicting the statement which we might expect from the master, that he knew nothing about it? Once land ourselves in an inquiry of that sort, once make an excuse which is bound to be accepted, master and man, I venture to say, will think very similarly that it was the clerk's fault, and that the master had nothing to do with it, and the result will be that the master will be freed from liability, and the collector cannot get the money from the clerk. The result is that a coach and four may be driven through the Customs Act. </para>

                        <para>- No, they do not. The clause reads - "shall be liable to the pecuniary punishment." As to imprisonment, it would not be a bad thing if, in some cases, offenders were liable. I mean to say that we might be suspicious in the first case, but the suspicion would pretty well change into certainty, I venture to think, when we found the offence repeated. It seems to me that the State cannot enter into an inquiry between the master and his employe. </para>

The State does not care from whom the information is obtained - from master or clerk, or both - so long as it is true. All the State wants is accuracy, and we venture to consider that the penalty attaching to inaccuracy should, in any circumstances, be enforced against the person who has control of the matter- the master - as a punishment to him and a warning to others who might be similarly animated to negligence to the injury of the Treasury. </para>

I recollect a man who was liable to pay a big income tax telling me that he always allowed the schedule to be drawn up by his clerk, who was much more liberal in matters of conscience than was the employer himself.

                    <para>- The employer signed the schedule ; but, at the same time if a prosecution should eventuate for perjury, the employer could say that he did not know the statements were made in the schedule. We know how such things are done. There is no need for definite instruction for a clerk to do wrong, because if a clerk understands a certain thing is wanted, that certain thing is sometimes forthcoming. Although I feel there is a good deal in what the Minister says when he contends that we must try, -by every possible means, to get at the man who is . responsible, I say that if a master employs a clerk to" do a thing for him, then the master must take the consequences of that clerk's negligence, just as any employer is responsible for his employe's negligence. As regards the pecuniary penalty, if a master does not know anything about the offence, he must pay the money which the conduct of his clerk involves. But the honorable and learned member for Corio asked me to look at clause 228, under which it appears that when a person has been convicted so as to be liable to a pecuniary penalty twice, he is further liable to be imprisoned for a period of not less than six months, nor more than two years, with hard labour. </para>

                        <para>- It ought to be made clear in clause 228 that that clause does not apply to anything referred to in clause 173. That would be a mean between two extremes, and would be fair. It is exceedingly important that no man should be treated as a criminal unless the criminality be proved up to the hilt. It is a most dangerous thing to go on the lines of constructively making a man a criminal. It is our duty to keep the brand of criminality off a man's back as far as possible. Even though the State should lose something occasionally by not being sufficiently alert, I should be strongly in favour of making it clear that the provision in regard to a double conviction ought not to apply to a conviction where a master is made liable for the acts of his agent. </para>

                        <para>- The intention ought to be made clear. The Minister is sufficiently aware, and I need not impress on him, that, as we are making a law, we ought to make it perfectly clear that a man is not to be liable to be put in prison for a crime unless he is guilty in . his own personal mind - unless, in fact, he is cognisant of the offence which his clerk or agent is committing. I would rather have a thousand evasions than one case of an innocent man being put in gaol for a thing of which he was not actually himself guilty. I am with the Minister so far as a pecuniary penalty is concerned, but when it is said that in addition a man shall be liable to imprisonment, I distinctly contend that clause 228 ought not to apply to offences under clause 173. If clause 173 be passed, I hope that in clause 228 the Minister will insert distinct words providing that the latter shall not apply in the case of' a conviction for an agent's default. </para>

                    <para>- Such words as those indicated by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne ought to go in . clause 173, and not, as he suggests, in clause 228. I, of course, attach weight to the legal opinion of the honorable and learned member; but if he is" afraid that clause 228 might mean that imprisonment, for instance, should follow the second offence, I would point out that there may be amending acts introduced at some future time which, without considering this clause 173, may provide that a second offence means imprisonment, and, the clause being read in connexion therewith, imprisonment may possibly follow. That would be a ridiculous position, because any one who knows how the large business of a merchant's establishment is conducted, knows that the principal can have no knowledge of a great number of declarations. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the principal should be held responsible in the matter of the penalty, but he must not be held guilty of a crime and imprisoned unless the crime be proved. Customs clerks pass the entries : and if a principal is to go through every entry and declaration, and see that the facts therein stated are correct, he will himself become a Customs clerk and be able to do nothing else. Errors will arise, trifling errors often, that do not mean any loss to the revenue, such as in a drawback entry where a wrong ship may be stated, or something of that sort. Such cases no doubt, could be met by providing very small penalties. We must not incur the risk that in addition to a pecuniary penalty, imprisonment may be suffered by a man who knows nothing, and can know nothing of those declarations, and who has not been proved to have any guilty intention. Customs clerks in the hurry of entries, and the intricacies of their work, often make mistakes. This will happen even in the case of a careful clerk, and a careless one will make mistakes much more frequently. I say, let us make the principal liable for the mistakes up to a reasonable amount of fine, and let us make that clear in any clause in which the punishment is stated. </para>

I think, too, .that there is a general disposition to sever by a great gulf the two classes of cases - inaccuracy and fraud. That is what the Government have attempted to do as well as they possibly can, by the broad distinction in a great class of cases of simply mentioning the penalty, and in the more severe cases of providing for the allegation and proof of fraud and . the heavier punishment.

I take it, that when we specify one kind of punishment in a clause it is to the exclusion of all other forms of punishment.

                    (Indi).- In the first place I think that some words are absolutely necessary to remove the application of clause 228. This Bill contains clauses which provide that for certain offences a pecuniary penalty should be incurred. It does not matter whether it be a principal or an agent ; wherever that is provided only a pecuniary penalty is incurred. In this instance a principal, innocent it may be, but in law deemed to be guilty, is rendered expressly liable to a pecuniary penalty. Then comes-a subsequent clause, which says that wherever a pecuniary penalty is provided, if the offence is committed a second time, imprisonment may be ordered. How can the Minister exempt any particular case from that provision

Clause 228 is a general provision applying to all other 'clauses in the Bill prescribing a pecuniary penalty. The clause says that' wherever a pecuniary penalty is provided for, in the case of a second offence the court may order imprisonment. I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the early part of clause 173, and I venture to say that he has not removed the difficulties that I have pointed out. The clause says-  </para>

                <para> On the hypothesis that we are putting,' the owner is perfectly innocent. He is not reckless, he is vigilant, he has given specific directions to his agent, and yet the agent, by reason of negligence, or worse, has made a false declaration. Let us forget the second part of the clause for a moment, because that only sets out that the owner is liable to a pecuniary penalty, as though he had made the declaration himself. But the early part of the clause .provides that it is to be an irrebuttable presumption of law that he has consented to the agent making the declaration. The penalty is imposed on the owner as though he had made the declaration himself. Now', if the agent has made, a false declaration, what may happen under clause 222, which provides that any person who counsels or procures, or by act or omission is in any way' directly concerned in the commission of any offence against this Act, shall be deemed to have committed the offence and shall be punishable accordingly. The penalty under the previous clause is imprisonment with hard labour. So that two distinct things are provided for in clause 173. A man is taken without any opportunity of proving his innocence - he is taken by law irrebuttably to have counselled and consented to his agent making a false declaration, and a subsequent clause makes him punishable by imprisonment in addition to having to pay the pecuniary penalty, and I think that no innocent person should be exposed to that punishment. The Victorian law, which throws the onus of proving his innocence on the owner, seems to me to be quite sufficient, and, I think further, that the pecuniary penalty would provide quite sufficient punishment for the employer for an act of his employe or other person which may be malicious and for which he is not morally responsible. It must not be forgotten that the Victorian Act has been so constructed that fraud may be reached, and I do not wish it to be supposed for a moment that I desire any fraud to go unpunished. I have already shown the Minister how that could be prevented, but I do say that I regard with abhorrence the idea that a person who ' is able to prove his innocence should be morally tainted with fraud, with a design to cheat the Customs, and that he should be liable not only to fine but also to imprisonment. 1 am with the Minister fully in his desire to punish fraud, and I would assist him in any way to strengthen his hands in that direction, but if a man can show cause why he should not be punished for a fictional offence - for that is what it is if he is not morally 'a party, to it - I say that he should be given every opportunity of proving his innocence. The department will have the goods and control over them, in addition to the other means of punishing the owner. I do not object to making the owner of the goods liable to a pecuniary punishment, but the earlier part of the section goes a great deal further. It does not say simply that for the purposes of the section the owner shall be deemed to be guilty, but lt contains an absolute statement that he is to be held - to be party to a false declaration, and it goes on, in addition to that, to say that he shall be liable for the pecuniary penalties as if the declaration had been made by himself. I hope the Minister, if he means that the owner of the goods shall be liable only to a pecuniary penalty - and that is stiff enough for an innocent man - will take care to restrict the (Operation of the clause so that it shall not go further than intended. It will not be merely sufficient to say that clause 228 will not apply to such a case, because there . are other clauses which might apply, and place perfectly innocent persons in jeopardy. </para>

                    <para>- The title of manufacturers of misery has often been applied to the framers of protectionist Tariffs, and it seems to me that the title is well deserved by those who, as pointed out in connexion with the provisions in a previous clause, preferred that wholesome food should be destroyed by pouring kerosene over it, rather than allow it to be used, simply because it had not paid duty. The whole of this Bill seems to have been framed with the object of making men stand in the position of criminals. Men who are guilty of no offence whatever beyond, perhaps, merely making statements which they have drawn up and signed with the consent of their employers, are to be treated as criminals, even though they may have acted in a perfectly <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> manner. And the Minister, owing to some peculiar kink of his mind, seems to think that this is a proper course to pursue. I agree with the honorable and learned member for Indi that it is a disgraceful proposition to bring forward, and I ' would like the honorable member to suggest an amendment that would meet the case. </para>

                    <para>- I would like to make a further amendment by inserting after the word " person " in the sixth line, "unless the contrary be proved." I think it would be very unfair to place the full responsibility for the wrongful act on any one who might unwittingly have an agent pass an entry improperly. The owner of the goods in such a case should not be made liable for the pecuniary penalty. The Minister said a short time ago that the penalty only applied to one party under this clause. That is true, but under clause 172 the agent is made responsible, so that the Minister may recover the penalty from the agent under clause 172, and from the principal under clause 173, whilst the principal would have no opportunity whatever to show whether he had any knowledge of the matter or not. </para>

                    (Indi).- I think the proposal of the Minister has cleared away a great many of the difficulties I had before me - that is, as far as I can see at present. Of course the final adjustment of the clause may be a matter for after consideration, but the amendment will certainly remove the most serious objection I had, because it limits the presumption to the mere pecuniary penalty. When we come to consider that we are now going to have Customs regulations operating over an entire continent, some justification is given to the Customs authorities for seeing that they have a fairly strong hand over these matters. I think the honorable member for Melbourne might allow the matter to stand as the Minister has proposed, as there will not be such great danger as existed previously.

                    (Werriwa). - I would like to know if there is anything that would permit of any mitigation of the penalty under any circumstances? Supposing it were brought to the knowledge of the Minister that no real offence had been committed, but that a simple mistake had been made - a mere clerical error - would the Customs authorities still be bound to inflict the full penalty? I can see no clause that allows the Minister, once the law has been put in motion, to suspend the action, even though attention may have' been drawn to the fact that the case is merely one of clerical error or misadvertence. Suppose there is any over zealousness on the part of an officer of the Customs department, and the facts are brought before the Minister himself, has he any power to stop the action ?

                    <para>- Is not the Minister under this clause assuming jurisdiction beyond territorial borders? It provides that the officer of any ship in the service of the Commonwealth " may chase any ship which does not bring to when lawfully signalled." The clause does not seem to give any power to catch the ship, but only to chase her. An earlier clause orders boats and ships to. bring to when, within a league of the coast. Suppose a ship does not bring to when ordered but goes further away, beyond the league from the coast, as would probably be the movement of the ship in the cases contemplated, has the Customs launch then power to fire upon the ship? If so, is not that an act committed beyond territorial waters? </para>

                        <para>- If the Customs boat were ordered to hit the ship I could understand it; but I notice the clause says that the Customs boat may " fire at or into such ship." That allows for misses as well as for hits. Seriously, however, I ask whether this is not an assumption of extra territorial powers which may well cause the Bill to be reserved for the signification of His Majesty's pleasure? </para>

                    <para>- This clause is similar to a provision in the Victorian Act, with the exception that it leaves out the words " liable to seizure or examination." Why does the Minister take to himself the power to chase any vessel, while he eliminates those words which allow him only to chase the vessel when she is liable to seizure? Under this clause we may have men-of-war going out and sinking' vessels. There should be a limitation imposed. </para>

All ships coming within our waters are liable to examination. </para>

                        <para>- The idea of clause 175 is that a Customs officer may require a ship within a league of the coast to depart, and if she fails to depart within twelve hours he may bring her into port and search her, Then clause 214 says - That any ship hovering within one league of the coast, and not departing within twelve hours after being required to depart by an officer, is to be forfeited to His Majesty. If by failing to depart within the twelve hours when ordered, the ship may belong to His Majesty, of course any officer . of His Majesty may search her. Perhaps I am wrong, but I cannot understand how there is any need for a clause allowing search where the very same circumstances make the ship the property of His Majesty. Of course, I understand the second part of the clause ; that is all right. It will be understood that there is a penalty affixed to a breach of the direction to answer questions, but that does not apply to the first part. . It seems to be a work of supererogation to say, if the ship is the property of His Majesty,that, if she fails to depart within twelve hours, any officer is to have power to search her. </para>

                    <para>- Would the Minister tell me - I am not able to understand it myself - why in clause 175 the power to require a master of a hovering ship to depart is confined to "any officer," which I understand is a Customs officer, while under the previous clause power is given to any commander or officer in charge of any ship or boat in His Majesty's service, or in the service of the Commonwealth or Customs, to deal with such a vessel? A clear distinction is drawn. I do not know whether the Minister intends to limit the power in clause 175 to an officer of the Customs department. It might be that an officer of Customs might . not be at hand, while an officer of the Commonwealth naval service might be available. Unless there is some reason to the contrary, I would suggest to the Minister that he should not limit the power in this way. It will be seen on reading the two clauses that there is-a limitation. </para>

                    <para>- I will look into the point. I think that clause 175 has more particularly to do with Customs work than with the firing at a vessel to compel her to bring to - a work that is better intrusted to naval officers - which is dealt with in the preceding clause. </para>

                        <para>- It gives a general power. I think it would be an excellent thing for the security of the revenue to allow the Customs officer to have this power to board and search a ship. Otherwise the whole provision relating to Customs war-' rants is a farce, and the Customs officer will : be armed at all times with a written letter from the Collector of Customs, which will' impose enormous disadvantages in the speedy administration of the law, and afford facilities-' for evasion which ought not to be per-' mitted. A Customs officer has the autho-' rity of the department at his back, and he; is not likely to exercise it arbitrarily. If he did, then he would not continue in the ' service. It might happen in a case of' emergency that the superior officer could not be consulted, so that it would be inadvisable to provide that an officer should be armed : with written authority on boarding a ship, or securing jury goods on board a ship.- </para>

The clause we are now dealing with and the next clause are two clauses made out of clause 200 of the Victorian Act, and that most clearly provides that the officer must show his authority for going on board. I think it is desirable that that should be so. Clause 200 of the Victorian Act reads -

                        <para>- I would ask the honorable member for Melbourne not to press the amendment, and I will bring up a clause imposing penalties on any person passing' himself off as a Customs officer. I am inclined to think at the present time, that probably the existing State law would deal with such cases. sir malcolm mceacharn.- i do not think that proposal would meet the case. The provision is made in the Victorian statute, and it would be no satisfaction to a ship-owner to think that any one could walk aboard his ship and say that he was a Customs officer, and that the Customs department could afterwards punish him for it. The difficulty is met in the section of the Victorian Act I have quoted, and it has worked well. I do not see why the Minister should object to its introduction into this clause. </para>

                        <para>- We have special authority provided for in the form of a Customs warrant Or a writ of assistance. What we are putting into this clause is a general power which is never hedged round with conditions of the character referred to. I call honorable members' attention to the fact that where we are proposing to exercise any special powers, we provide by clause 187 that any Judge of the High Court of Australia, or any Judge of the Supreme Court of any State, may, upon application, grant a writ of assistance ; and " such writ, unless superseded, shall be in force so long as any person named therein remains an officer of Customs." Then there is power given under clause 188 for the comptroller or State collector . to grant a Customs warrant to any officer, and by the next clause any officer having a writ of assistance or Customs warrant may break open things and use force. But the ordinary power of entry and examination, searching, and securing will not be found hedged round by the conditions to which the honorable member refers ; and I could not consent to having his amendment introduced at. the present time: I shall be delighted to look up the matter further for him and see if any precedent can really establish the necessity for it. I do not think it can at present, and I therefore must resist it. </para>

                    McEACHARN (Melbourne). - I am afraid that power will be taken away under this clause, but I am quite willing to accept the Minister's assurance that he will look into the matter. I may say the difficulty has arisen from the fact that sections which have dealt with two different matters are now in this clause dealing with one matter. I think the clause could well be amended either by the insertion of the words " the proper officer," or something that would enable a captain to see that these men boarding his ship are really officers of the Customs.

Of course, should any arrangements be necessary between the States and the Commonwealth in this connexion, they will be a matter for consideration. But I do not think it is at all possible to contend for the necessity for the Commonwealth to establish its own police ; its laws will be enforced by the State police. </para>

To give any officer of Customs or police, upon reasonable suspicion, power to stop and search any carriage strikes me as a very drastic power to give. </para>

                    <para>- I think a period of five years is too long, and that it might well be cut down to three years, especially as the clause is wide enough to embrace not only goods unlawfully imported, undervalued, or illegally dealt with, but all other goods imported. The tendency of modern civilization is to prevent statutes running as long as they do, and any alterations made have ill ways been in the direction of cutting down the period in which actions can be brought. The same rule might very well be followed here, and three years would be quite long' enough, especially in view of the large powers granted to the collector. I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>- I think that what the honorable member for North Sydney has pointed out is a very important feature, and I would point out to the honorable and learned member for Werriwa that the position is this: A particular parcel of goods is claimed by the Customs, and an information is sworn that the goods are undervalued or that they have been unlawfully imported. The Customs authorities may have to go back for a considerable time, through the transactions of the particular individual whom they suspect, or more than suspect, since an information has been sworn, in order to get the information they desire from his own business. They want a considerable time allowed them in order that they may see whether the particular goods are under value or not. It is not to trace back the transactions of the particular individual for five years that this term is prescribed, but it is merely to enable the authorities to inspect his books and documents, if necessary, for that period, so that the Customs may be able to make up their minds in regard to the particular goods in question. </para>

                    <para>- I would point out that clause 236 provides that no objection shall be taken or allowed to any information or summons for any alleged defect therein in substance or in form, or for any variance between such information or summons. That is with regard to the Customs itself, but according to the clause under discussion, where the plaintiff is not a Customs-house officer, it appears that he is to be rather strictly dealt with. </para>

                    <para>- I would like to draw attention to the wording of clause 211, which has evidently been taken from some old section. It says - " The plaintiff shall be entitled to a verdict." It may be a judgment or some other form of recovery. I would just like to direct the attention of the Minister to the wording of the clause. </para>

                    <para>- Let us suppose that the originating cause is the seizure by the Customs officers under certain circumstances of certain goods. Supposing that the goods are detained by the Customs authorities for two or three months, the owner will not be able to find out until the end of that time what is their condition, nor will he be able to say what damage he has suffered. It might be necessary for him, after ascertaining the extent of the damage, to communicate with people at home, and I do not think, therefore, that the six months will be sufficiently long to allow. As officers of the Customs department claim the right to go back in the books for five years, they ought to be content to allow a considerable extension of the term now proposed for taking proceedings. It is not to be supposed that these matters will crop up every day, and it is only fair that we should allow a reasonable time to enable people to arrange what steps shall be taken. I shall propose that the term be extended to twelve months. </para>

                    (Werriwa).- The Minister has not dealt with such a case as I have mentioned, where goods may be detained by the Customs department for three months and it may be necessary, after the goods are released, to communicate with the people in England who are interested, before proceedings are commenced. I think that the period should be further extended, and I would be satisfied if nine months or even eight months were the period fixed.

                        <para>- Yes, they would know ; but the clause says the period shall be calculated from the time the cause of action shall have arisen, and the goods which may be the subject of the action may not be handed over to the owners for three months after the cause of action may have arisen. The extension of the time as I suggest would not be attended with any disadvantage to the Customs authorities, and I think that opportunity should be given for bringing an action within at least twelve months. </para>

                    (Corio).- I wish the Minister would accept the amendment proposed by the honorable and learned member for Werriwa. I speak from experience in this matter, and I think the suggestion is a proper one. I know that in the case ci' the Railway department in Victoria., where a similar provision exists and the period is fixed at six months, although the affairs dealt with are entirely internal and local, six months has proved too short a time. A person who has a cause of grievance against the Customs department should not be deprived of his right of action for at least twelve months, and as no great harm could result from making the suggested concession, the Minister could wisely concede the point.

                        <para>- A Customs officer may commit an offence under this Act as well as any one else, and the use of the word " proceeding" in its present form may lead to results that are not intended. I am sure that the clause is intended to apply only to civil matters, because of the use of the word "defendant" and other terms in connexion with it, and I think the Minister will be going beyond the intention of the clause if he says "proceedings '"' will apply to any offences which are committed under the Bill. An officer may make a false statement, or help some one else to commit a crime, and I do not think there should be any statutory limitation to the liability of the officer for proceedings in such cases where other people are not similarly protected. I no not think the Minister will adhere to that provision when- he comes to consider it, but that he will limit the operation of the clause to civil matters. I do not think that an officer who commits an offence under this Bill should bo favoured simply because he is an officer, as his duty really ought to impose a greater responsibility upon him than upon an outsider. I think the Minister will see that it is wrong to limit the officer's liability to proceedings being taken against him for criminal offences. </para>

It may be very difficult for the ship to depart. The winds, for instance, may be contrary. There should be some definition. The penalties in this Bill are altogether too severe. The provision needs to be compared with clause 175.

It is not of great importance, but the provision is evidently taken from Acts passed at a period when ships were constructed differently from what they are now. Sub-clause (6) provides that ships may be forfeited for having double bottoms. But every steamer that is built nowadays is built with a double bottom.

                    <para>- The omission of the word "double" would give a stronger significance to the clause than it has at present, as I think the honorable member for Melbourne will see if he looks at it carefully. Only ships having "some device adapted for the purpose of running goods " will come within this provision. The word " double," as here used, is a well known expression, and I would ask the honorable member not to press his amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the Minister will accept the amendment, which will evidently strengthen the Bill. Possibly ships may be built with double bottoms without any sort of idea of defrauding the Customs. If, however, a ship is built with false sides or bottoms, evidently for the purpose of carrying smuggled goods, then the clause as it would read, if amended, would apply to them. The word "double" seems to me to weaken the clause from the Minister's point of view. </para>

                    <para>- I think the honorable member for Melbourne knows what he is talking about. He says that ships are now built with double bottoms. When the Act from which this clause is copied was originally framed the word " double '"' was inserted, because ships with double bottoms were used for the purpose of conveying smuggled goods. If the word " double " be struck out, the bottoms will only be regarded as false, if there is an attempt to disguise the nature of the cargo by the construction of the ship. The intention of the department will then be carried out. </para>

                    <para>- Does not the word apply to goods " intended " to be exported. They cannot be exported till they leave our jurisdiction, and as soon as they have left our jurisdiction then they are to be forfeited. Is it not repealing clause 105, which provides that no prohibited exports shall be exported? It means that the goods cannot be exported until they are " exports," and then the Bill prohibits their; export. It looks something like an Irish bull. </para>

                        <para>- I know that was dealt with before; but this is the question of forfeiture. I had not an opportunity of calling attention to clause 50, but this clause deals with the forfeiture of goods, and says that they should be forfeited if they are found in packages of less than the prescribed size. Even if a vessel brings tobacco for the use of its own crew, and though it cannot matter to the Customs officers in what packages the tobacco is kept, it has to be forfeited. </para>

                        <para>- There is a penalty as well as forfeiture, and it is provided that any packages of less than the prescribed size found on or attached to any ship or boat shall be forfeited. I am not sure what is meant by attaching anything to a boat, but I suppose it refers to a case of smuggling. The provision is one, I. think, which could not be enforced. </para>

In all Customs Acts there is a provision that these goods shall be in packages of a certain size and description, so that they may be readily discernible, and there may not be the same possibility of evasion of duty as there would be if they were allowed to be made up in packages of all kinds and descriptions. </para>

                        <para>- I think so; I know I struck out one provision under which a ship might be forfeited where a package was not of the prescribed size. Some of the provisions were very sewere ; but I thought this was reasonable. It is recognised amongst traders that it is their duty to import these goods under these special conditions : and if they neglect to adopt these special precautions and lend themselves to fraud they must suffer. </para>

                        <para>- Well, would not the word " false " be sufficient. I think " false " conveys the idea of wrongful intention better than the other word. A misleading statement is not one that is intentionally misleading, and it might be misleading through a pure accident. An invoice with the ordinary cabalistic letters " E. and 0. E. " on it might turn out to be a misleading statement afterwards. I suggest to the Minister that we might omit the words " or misleading." They might refer to an answer, statement, or representation, which might be a verbal assertion made to a Customs officer in asking questions, and we know the wide sense in which an answer to a question is used in this clause. A false statement does imply some thing deliberate on the part of the person making it, but a misleading statement does not necessarily have the wrongful intent attached to it, and I ask the right honorable gentleman if he does not think he would be sufficiently protected by keeping the word "false" in, and omitting the word "misleading." </para>

There is a lot in what the honorable and learned member for Indi says, that the word "misleading" <inline font-style="italic">may</inline> cover an omission which would not be covered by the word " false " ; but still, at. the same time, from what I know of other clauses of the Bill, 1 think that the declaration will be bound to be full, and that there will be little chance of our suffering by an amendment of the character suggested. However, I would ask the honorable and learned member for Corinella to withdraw his amendment for the present. </para>

The punishment is undoubtedly of such a severe nature that surely it was intended to deal with armed persons and no others. It may be a misprint. </para>

                        <para>- Of course there is a slip in the marginal note. I confess that I do not read the marginal notes very often. This clause is intended to provide for cases where persons are conspiring together actively for the purpose of smuggling or preventing the seizure of goods or rescuing smuggled goods. I venture to think that that is an offence of so serious a character that, independently of any question of arms, it ought to be attended with a penalty of a term not exceeding five years imprisonment. </para>

                    McEACHARN (Melbourne). I wish to ask the Minister why he has departed from the Victorian Act in this case. Section 195 of the Victorian Act is virtually contained in clauses 214 and 219 of the Bill. The Victorian Act provides that a ship shall be forfeited, which is covered by clause 214. but the penalty would come under this clause: and it goes on to say -
                </para>
                <para>If it shall be made to appear to the satisfaction of the commissioner that such spirits, opium, or cigars were on board without the knowledge or privity of the owner or master of such ship or boat, and without any wilful neglect; or want of reasonable care on their part, then and in such case the commissioner shall deliver up such ship or boat to the owner or master of thesame. </para>
                <para>That provision is really contained in clauses 214 and 219 of this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- We have done better than that. We have provided that there shall be no forfeiture of the ship in these petty cases, but that there shall be penalties on people who smuggle, or unlawfully import, export, or have in their possession any goods. And there is a further provision that no master of a ship shall suffer a ship to be used for smuggling or for the unlawful conveyance of goods. In order to sheet home the charge it will, have to be shown that the master practically knew the offence was being committed ; and to provide, under the circumstances, a maximum penalty of £100, with a possible reduction to £5, is not overstating the case. </para>

I fail to see why we should take away from the master of the ship the possibility of proving that he knows nothing about the offence. It is all very well to use the word " suffer," and say that that means the' charge must be proved ; but it is easy to make the statement and give the master a great deal of trouble in connexion with the matter. I grant that the provision in the Victorian Act, under the circumstances, is much more onerous, and I commend the Minister for having allowed us under this clause to escape, at any rate, with our lives. Rut it would be easy enough to put words in here which would give the Minister all he desires, and at the same time let shipowners feel that charges have to proved against them, or, at any rate, that their explanation shall be received. This is a very important matter to ship-owners, who have difficulties enough as it is, and I really beg the Minister to let us have what I now ask.

                    <para>- Does the. word "oath" in- this clause apply to declarations under the Bill. If the word does so apply, I would like the Minister to consider the matter; because, if it is intended that " oath " shall apply to declarations, I think the intention is likely to fail. The Acts Interpretation Act extends the word " oath " to a declaration rather in a judicial sense, as applied to cases in which an oath is prescribed, and a person is allowed to' make a declaration in lieu of an oath. That is not the kind of declaration referred to in the Bill. </para>

If we look at other clauses we shall find some, in respect of which the maximum penalty is very high, and, as a consequence the minimum penalty becomes alarmingly large.

The more I look into the matter the more I am inclined to think that there is a lot in the objection raised by the honorable member for North Sydney, and that probably we shall have to give a larger discretion to our courts, particularly as regards the minimum penalty, when that minimum would be of the character referred to by the honorable and learned member who has just resumed his seat. I think that that matter, however, would be more appropriately dealt in connexion with the clause relating" to the minimum. We need not be afraid of our courts in regard to the imposition of the maximum penalty, so long as they have the necessary power with regard to the minimum. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. But a fine of £1 would be ample for some of the offences under this 'Bill. The Bill contains some very strict provisions which do not take notice of error or inadvertence, or of the fact that there could be no disadvantage . to the Customs revenue by reason of the error which has been committed. But for the purpose of accuracy, and so that no firm shall shield itself behind an error, it has been considered necessary to render- the parties making an error liable at any rate to a penalty. The extent to which they shall be liable must in every case depend upon circumstances. In some cases £1 would be a sufficient fine to impose, but other cases might require the imposition of the full amount of £100. As the range is a very large one - we may go up to £20,000 or £30,000 under the maximum penalty - I do not see that there is any necessity at all to fix the minimum penalty. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see it, because there is no relationship to the value of goods. The maximum penalty is fixed by the value of the goods. Of course there is a reason for that. 'If there was an attempt to smuggle or improperly pass a large quantity of goods, the advantage to be gained might be so great that an offender would require to be discovered ten times, and a fine of £100 imposed each time, before lie lost the entire value of the goods. But three times the value of the goods is a very high maximum. There is an attempt made here to fix the minimum in proportion to the value of the goods, because it is provided that the minimum penalty shall be one twentieth of the maximum penalty. </para>

                        <para>- What the minimum shall be may very well be .left to* the decision of the courts, and in cases where offenders are dealt with by the Minister, he ought to be allowed to inflict a penalty .that shall be a fit punishment for the offence. Where the offence is a mere trivial error which does not affect the Customs revenue in any way, I think that the imposition of a fine of £1 would be ample, and, therefore, in ' that case there would be no need for a minimum at all. If the Minister wishes to fix a minimum he might make it £1. </para>

If an entry is being passed, and the wrong ship is named, it is considered an offence, and I do not think it would injure the Customs to reduce the minimum for such offences as those contemplated, so long as the goods pay duty. </para>

                    <para>- I confess that the clause is open to the objection which has been pointed out, and that in the case of an offence committed in reference to goods of great value, tine punishment would not lit the crime. At the same time, I do not like the idea, when offences are committed against" the Customs laws, of giving the courts power to inflict a merely nominal penalty of a shilling or so and then let the thing go. There is a disposition in some quarters to look upon infractions of the Customs laws with a too lenient eye - to regard them as venial sins. They are looked upon as matters in which if people manage to get off without detection they are to be considered very clever ; while if they are bowled out they are to be sympathized with. We all know that the public think that to get at the Government is one thing and to get at a private individual is another. To get at a private individual is highly improper ; but to get at the Government, and through the Customs especially, is looked upon as a legitimate exercise of acuteness. </para>

                        <para>- We can make that clear if necessary. I would like to meet the" honorable member for North Sydney so far as his objections are well founded, but as for the pecuniary fixed penalties, if we keep to the suggested minimum, we shall not be going far wrong. The pecuniary penalties, are not so high as they have been in many cases. I think the highest here is £100, and the amount varies down to £50, £20, and £10. </para>

                        <para>- They are the maximum with respect to a variety of offences. £100 is the usual thing, and then come £50, £20, and £10, the latter amount being in regard to offences which are not otherwise provided for. That means that there is a minimum of £5, then another of £2 10s., then £1, and the lowest 10s. I do not think that is unfair. The point the honorable member makes is that in regard, to goods where the value is large, and the value regulates the amount of the fine, the minimum of one-twentieth might be a terrific amount. If we can provide that the minimum shall not be inordinately large I think it will meet the case. </para>

                        <para>- Yes '; it is limited, but the court has power to impose a penalty within that maximum. Here we have the possibility of a man being" fined heavily for some trifling offence for which a mere nominal fine of a few shillings would be amply sufficient. Why should that not be left to the discretion of the court ? I hope we shall- not retain in the Bill this clause, providing a minimum penalty, or clause 242 which says that no minimum penalty imposed by this measure shall be liable to reduction under any power of mitigation. I hope the minimum penalty will be struck out altogether. </para>

                    <para>- When the Minister looks at clause 229 he will see that that provision, relating to the minimum being one-twentieth, of the maximum, must refer to imprisonment for indictable offences as well as to pecuniary penalties. Division 2, Part 13, is headed with the word "penalties." If the right honorable gentleman looks at clause 218 he will find indictable offences provided for with imprisonment, not exceeding three years. Under clause 221 the penalty is imprisonment not exceeding four years. This provision is clearly applicable to punishments for indictable offences. In clause 243 a distinction is drawn, and pecuniary penalties are specifically mentioned. Undoubtedly under that clause the court would have no option, if it found a person guilty, but to inflict a penalty amounting to one-twentieth of the maximum penalty provided by the clause. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMSON</inline>
                    (North Sydney).Since hearing the Minister's explanation I am confirmed in my view that it would be better to strike out the clause altogether. I am specially convinced of that after the remarks of the honorable member for Indi. The Minister has argued that there are certain people who have such a low opinion of smuggling that, even when sitting on the Bench, they would be disinclined to impose a penalty at all, unless there was a minimum penalty which they must inflict. If that argument is a good one, it goes against allowing these cases to be tried in. the courts at all. The court has first to find the offence before it can inflict a penalty ; and if the court has such an estimate of its duty and of the non-seriousness of smuggling, will it find the offence ? Surely if we trust the court to find the offence we may trust it to impose the penalty, in which case there is no necessity for the minimum. - Under the circumstances, and considering the trifling nature of some of these offences, and also considering, as the honorable member for Indi has pointed out, that-the clause would refer to other than pecuniary penalties, it would be well to strike it out altogether.

                    <para>- I cannot agree with the honorable member who lias just resumed his seat as to the view of their duties taken by courts of summary jurisdiction. Those who are familiar with such courts will know that as a rule they are careful in properly discharging their duty by finding the offence and coming to a decision of guilty or not guilty, but there are many offences as to which, where they have a discretion as to the penalty, they inflict a mere contemptuous punishment from the point of view of smallness. Every one who has experience of courts of summary jurisdiction knows that they have a tendency to inflict very small penalties in regard to such matters as licensing and factories act offences, considering that they have done their duty in finding the offence proved. I think it would be better to have a minimum. </para>

                    <para>- I think it, would be better to omit the clause. The remarks of the honorable member for Indi make it clear that the clause should come out. It should be left to the discretion of the court to inflict a penalty. Under clause 228, which has been adopted, it will be seen that any one twice convicted would be liable to imprisonm'ent. It would be a very serious matter to permit this clause to pass as it stands. I would ask the Minister to reconsider it. Under clause 224, the minimum would be only 10s. That being . so, surely the minimum under the clause before the committee should not be more than 10s.; and why the Minister should endeavour to fix it at £2 I cannot understand. </para>

I would ask the committee to consider, however, whether it is not wise that there should be some minimum <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> As has been pointed out by the honorable member for Corinella, justices of the peace very often approach a case in a spirit of opposition- to the law, or having sympathy with the nature of the offence. They will not so far forget their duty as to openly flout the law or disregard the evidence in face of the plainest proof, but they will record a verdict against the defendant, and at the same time manage to  defeat the object and scope of the law by inflicting some ridiculous penalty altogether out of proportion to the nature of the offence, but merely expressive of their personal belief that the law should not be as it is, and of their sympathy with the character of the offence. We have heard of cases in which Judges have expressed themselves in the most curious fashion in regard to the nature of a law, forgetting that their duty is to administer it and not to make it. </para>

We have to guard to some extent against the practical expression of judicial' views hostile to the enforcement of the enactments of the Legislature. We do that in a variety of ways. I think it will be found in the various States that in 90 per cent, of the Acts it is a general rule to provide a minimum' in order to prevent abuses of the character to which I have referred. It is notorious that the general public often improperly extend sympathy to offenders against the revenue laws. The provision is, therefore, particularly necessary in this connexion. I ask honorable members to insist upon the provision of a minimum, in order to give effect to a law which, owing to its special nature, and because of public sympathy with breaches of it, will be set aside if we relax any of the precautions ordinarily taken to give effect to other laws. The Government do not want to be stubborn in this matter. </para>

I do not think honorable members will blame ns for sticking to what we believe to be right, until we are satisfied that some better proposition is made. We ask the committee to assist us in getting within the four corners of the Bill something which will prevent its object being frustrated by public sympathy with breaches of the revenue laws. </para>

                    (Corinella). - I think I can suggest a way out of the difficulty. The chief objection is that, under clause 226, an increase of the maximum might mean an increase of the minimum. Could not words be added to clause 229, providing that any increase of' the maximum penalty, under section 226, should not imply an increase in the minimum penalty. That would mean that although the maximum might be increased in clause 226, the minimum would remain as it would be if that clause were not in existence ?

                    (Werriwa).- It must not be forgotten that we have passed clause 228, where it is provided that for a second offence against this Act a person may be imprisoned with hard labour for a period of not less than six. months. Cases may arise in which the court, although the man may be guilty of an offence under this measure, will not wish to convict him. They may not wish to inflict any minimum at all. A man may be imprisoned for not less than six months in -respect of offences which might have been mere errors or misdescriptions.

That, however, would not excuse him at all. When we bear in mind the serious consequences that follow the infliction of even a minimum penalty I think we might decide to leave it to the court to say whether a man has been guilty of an offence or not. I think it would be better to omit the clause. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I thought they were. The honorable member for Indi just now asked why should not the penalties have some relationship to the value of the goods. For this reason : That the offences here specified may be simple errors. For instance, making any entry which is false in any particular is one of the offences which may be made in connexion with goods of very high value. It may be admittedly an error caused through inadvertence, and still the minimum penalty for that in the case of goods worth £10,000 would be £1,500, which would be absurd. There is, therefore, no relationship ; and, as the Minister says, the punishment cannot be made to fit the crime in dealing with a minimum penalty on a' basis of the value of the goods. I am willing that the Minister's proposal should be accepted in the clause, and then when we come to divide upon the clause, as amended, we can strike it out altogether if we think fit to do so. My opinion is that in some of these cases in which a penalty of £1 00 is provided, while that might be a reasonable penalty where there is a deliberate attempt to evade duty, it would not be reasonable where there is simply an ' error made. The error is no worse in a case where £100 penalty is provided for than it would be in connexion with an offence for which only £10 penalty is provided. If the offence is a deliberate one it is worse in cases in which the higher penalty is imposed to make the distinction, but if it is only an error it is no worse in some of the cases in which maximum penalties are provided for than in cases where only a minimum penalty is provided for. I would prefer to see the clause omitted altogether, and next to that I would prefer the Minister's proposal for a minimum of £2. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for North Sydney is not laying so much stress upon the extravagance of the minimum in reference to cases where the amount is specified, but he has pointed out that the minimum in cases where the goods are of very considerable value might be so high as to have a disastrous effect. If we agree to the clause in the way I propose I think the difficulty will be entirely removed, and the question of the value of the goods will not -interfere in the slightest, because although the maximum is raised on account of the value of the goods the minimum will still remain one-twentieth of the penalty as expressed in pounds sterling within the four corners of the Bill.

                <para>Mr.V. L. SOLOMON (South Australia).This clause has been twisted about Until one hardly knows what it is intended to convey. In spite of what the Minister has said about the unreliability of some courts in Australia, and their sympathy with certain classes of offences, I still think that if we are going to give these courts jurisdiction in regard to this Customs Act, it would be better to strike out altogether this clause referring to a minimum penalty. The Minister told us he was quite willing to reduce the minimum to £2, but in the alteration of the clause now under consideration he proposes to provide in the bulk of the cases for a minimum of £5. For instance, take the penalties which may be imposed for offences under clause 220. We have under that clause a penalty of £100 provided for, and what are the offences? </para>
                <para>Any person who shall make any entry which is false in any particular. </para>
                <para class="block">It was suggested when the clause was before the committee that we should put in some word to signify that it must be a wilful making of a false entry, and that there must be some improper intention. That was fought, if I may so describe it, tooth and nail by the Minister, and now if a false entry is made, without any intention to defraud, and as a mere mistake, the minimum penalty that can be inflicted by the courts under this clause 229, as the Minister now proposes to amend it, will be one-twentieth of £100, or £5. That will be the fine for a mere error in an entry which is false in even the smallest particular, some simple error for which probably a fine of £1 would be sufficient in order to make the importer a little more careful in future in his Customs work. Then we come to another offence described as " misleading any officer in any particular likely to affect the discharge of his duty." It is not a wilful misleading of any officer, but if in answering interrogations by a Customs officer, something is said which misleads him, the minimum penalty will be £5. </para>

                        <para>- I am perfectly aware of that, and it has never been questioned ; but I doubt very much whether it has any right in this Customs Bill I merely direct the Minister's attention to that in passing. I think it would be most unjust to limit the power of the .court in such a way that it must inflict a fine of at least £5 for making an entry which is false in the slightest particular, whether it is wilfully done or not. I would suggest to the committee that the easiest, best, and safest way is to strike out the clause, for which there is no necessity. If we can trust the courts to inflict penalties up to £100 - penalties up to three times the value of the goods, which may mean thousands of pounds - we can surely trust them also in their discretion to inflict extremely light fines without fixing the amount of the minimum which they shall be bound to impose. </para>

                    <para>- As the Minister seems desirous that there should be a minimum penalty, and that the clause should not be omitted, I would urge him to fix the penalty at what he offered a little time ago to adopt, namely, £40. There is one case I spoke about privately to him. Under clause 175 a vessel hovering within one league of the coast is bound to depart ; and if the captain, who may not know that he is required to do so, does not get away within twelve hours - and he may not be able to get away in consequence of the wind - he is liable to a penalty of £100. There are the instances which were mentioned by the last speaker, with which I quite agree, and for which clause 220 provides a penalty of £100. I would point out to the Minister that, under clause 224, where any penalties are not provided for in any clauses, the parties offending are liable to a penalty of £10, so that he may find very much more heinous offences committed which are not provided for under this clause, and for which the maximum penalty provided under that is £.10. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister will remember that I drew attention to- very many of these clauses at the time, and pointed out the nature of the penalty. I was under the impression that he was going to do as I have stated. If I had not been under that impression I would have -taken exception to very many of the clauses. I have a lot of the clauses marked where the penalty is £100 ; in fact, I think the Minister got rather annoyed because I brought up the matter so many times. For instance, as regards one clause, it was shown that the penalty was £100, and when I understood that the minimum was to be £100, because the man might wilfully commit the offence, I was willing to allow it to stand, but where it was shown that it was done through some error, although it might only be shown afterwards, then, of course, it would be quite unfair to exact the minimum penalty of £5. Again, under clause 37, which provides that the entry shall be passed by the collector signing the same, we find that the slightest mistake involves a penalty of £100. Now the minimum penalty is to be £5. Again, clauses 47 and 50 provided for a minimum penalty of £100. I certainly understood that it was the intention of the Minister to consider all these penalties. I ask him to consider whether he did not lead honorable members to the supposition that there was no necessity to go on discussing the minimum penalties in that way, from the fact that he intended to deal with clause 229 ? I ask him to consider whether he did not say something which led to the formation of that idea <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> He will remember how often I called attention to them, otherwise I should have debated many of them most strongly. I have marked clauses 67, 69, 105, 107, 112 and 117, where the penalty is £100. For instance, such a thing as the exportation of an article worth 10s. in value would lead to a minimum penalty of £5, and if exported in a ship of less than 50 tons register, under clause 107 the minimum penalty is £5. It was intended- to get at gross cases which might occur, and even in those cases it was thought that a penalty of £100 would be sufficient where it was wilfully done. And in a mere case of omission, where the Minister was first satisfied that there might be something in the charge and started an action, and it was clearly shown in court that was not the case, the clauses have been drawn so strictly that there can be no escape from them. I have similar clauses marked. I have not marked clauses 50 and 60 as ones I have called attention to. I have half-a-dozen clauses marked which I called attention to and which the Minister promised to reconsider ; and it was done in connexion with clauses 224 and 229. I think that the Minister having got all the clauses through on that understanding - certainly but for that a debate would have taken place upon them - ought now to accept the suggestion of the honorable member for North Sydney. I think the honorable member for Melbourne himself drew attention to clause 224. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it is a question of letting the Minister have his way. If the thing is right, he ought to have his way, but if it is not right he ought not to have his way simply because he is the Minister. It may be very well for honorable members on the other side, who may be under subjection, to take that view. I can quite understand them responding to the crack of the whip. When I allowed so many clauses to go through under what I thought was a distinct promise from the Minister, I feel, and he himself knows it, that he is going back on his word. I will put it in another way, and say that the Minister has forgotten what he himself stated. But I have known him to do it so many times that there ought to be no excuse for him. I have over twelve or thirteen clauses marked, to which I drew the attention of the Minister, and if that is not calling attention to the matter often enough, I would like to know what is. The Minister having got all these clauses through, and we not being in a position to reconsider the penalties, he now says - " Very well, I shall stick to this," and puts in a penalty of £5, possibly. But the Minister would not have got those maximum penalties through had he asserted his intention of retaining clause 229. If the Minister is going to treat the committee in this way, it will behove us to be very careful when he again brings measures forward. If what he has done has the concurrence of the Ministry, it will be for us to watch everything carefully, and riot allow a postponement, but discuss every line and every clause of a measure. The Minister knows what that means. I consider that I, at all events, have been distinctly misled in this matter. </para>

Under the circumstances, I shall best consult my own dignity by saying nothing further on the point. I assure the honorable and learned member that he is mistaken. The promise I gave to the honorable member for North Sydney, I have most faithfully performed. The idea was that when we got to this clause, we should fight the matter out on the general question of whether there was to be a minimum. We are now fighting the matter out, and I trust the Government are not doing, and never will do, anything to merit censure of the description suggested by the honorable and learned member for Werriwa. </para>

                    <para>- I really feel quite .touched by the way in which the committee has vindicated the Minister in this matter, but I have some degree of hesitancy in allowing the clause to go without expressing my regret that the Minister in charge of the Bill should have made so many serious charges- against persons engaged in the administration of justice. It is very easy for us to be on our dignity and stand by one another in this Chamber when there is the slightest suspicion of any conduct as affecting the Minister, but I am not one of those who can sit here and listen to imputations on persons sworn to administer justice in the public courts of the country. I look on that as a much more important matter than the delicate interchange we have just witnessed. I consider that th Minister has made statements which will seriously undermine the confidence of the people in our courts. That is, if the people pay the slightest attention to those statements - I wish my right honorable friend to quite understand that. No fashion should be set by Ministers of the Crown in this Chamber in -the way of disparaging the honest discretion of persons acting in a judicial capacity. It is a very easy thing to do, and, at the same time, it is a thing to avoid. My right honorable friend was very much in earnest in the opinion he expressed, and I know his thoroughness too well to believe that he otherwise would have consented to the very large surrender he has made in this matter of penalties.. If the benches who deal with these matters are capable of, or show a disposition to take a side against constitutional authority with a view to looking leniently on offences, some of which amount to fraud, against the Customs, is it not a pity that the Minister should not have taken upon himself the whole of the jurisdiction as the one righteous person who could administer everything from a high standard of justice <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Would it not be much better if the Minister, who has taken nearly everything on himself, had also taken the somewhat unpleasant duty of fixing the amount of the penalties ? We should then have had a satisfactory administration. May I point out that if the tribunals are so unreliable, we place a tremendous power in their hands, when we allow them to reduce to a nominal sum the penalty for an offence which the legislature looks on as so serious as to justify a maximum penalty of £100. If the tribunals are not trustworthy, why give them the extraordinary discretion of being able to reduce, even for a most serious offence, the penalty to one-twentieth ? The fact of the matter is that it would be well to abstain from expressing the views to which I have referred. Whilst Customs officers look on everybody in the community who has any business with them as being engaged in a huge conspiracy to defraud the revenue, we must remember that in the course of these very nice and delicate operations a large number of perfectly honest people fall into all sorts of perfectly innocent errors. I do not allude to regular traders, because they are competent, from their experience, to do business in a straightforward way; but there are a large number of persons who have to transact their own business with the Customs, and who are bound to fall into mistakes. I must say I regret that the minimum penalty was maintained. I should like to see the fullest scope given to the tribunal, whatever it may be, and let it be one in which we have confidence. I believe courts of summary jurisdiction were mentioned, but there, again, was a special qualification in favour of honorary magistrates. I must deprecate drawing distinctions between the paid and unpaid magistrates who administer justice in this country. Of course, unpaid magistrates are a very influential body. They are not public officers, and they often form a very large part of an electoral army in a political engagement. But I do not think that can make them more capable of administering justice purely than are the persons who are sworn and paid to administer justice in a more permanent capacity. I think my right honorable friend has allowed himself, by his close association with Customs officials, to rather take a bias from their point of view- a bias which is somewhat foreign to the open and generous manner in which he generally deals with large public questions. I know there are some who would like to prevent any operations of commerce at all in Australia. There are some fanatics of that sort, but certainly that is not the spirit in which a Bill of this kind ought to be conceived. I merely rose to express my regret that any doubt should have been cast upon judicial tribunals - however humble they may be - by my right honorable friend. </para>

                        <para>- I can assure the right honorable gentleman that I did not intentionally drop any portion of the title which it is our good fortune to mutually enjoy. But still, he lectures me for casting reflections on justices - an important and highly respectable class of the community - of whom I spoke in the highest terms. They have their prejudices, though not such unwarrantable prejudices as the right honorable and learned member indulges. "What does he do for the purpose of giving force to his observations in this connexion? He proceeds himself to disparage a most deserving class of the community - the Customs officers throughout the length and breadth of Australia - by saying that they are incapable of taking a fair view of things, and look upon the rest of the community as conspirators attempting to defraud the public revenue. Let me apply the same lesson to himself that he intends to apply to me. I do not require it ; he does. Let me invite him to extend that fair play which he asks for as regards justices - and which I did extend to them - to the officers of the Customs department. </para>

SOLOMON (South Australia). - Before that is done I would like to point out that the clause says that the minimum penalty for any offence against this Act shall be one-twentieth of the maximum. I understood just now, by interjection from the honorable member for Melbourne, after he had had an interview with the Minister, that it had been decided that the minimum penalty should be £2. That was the suggestion upon which we agreed not to take a division.

                        <para>- That was in regard to the question raised under clause- 226. The honorable and learned member for Indi and the honorable member for North Sydney pointed out that in some cases three times the value of the goods would represent very much more than £100. The difficulty arose as to how that matter was to be got over. Then the debate diverged on that point, and the question of the minimum was left out altogether. Evidently the Minister has forgotten that he did make the promise. </para>

Of course if my honorable friends opposite are satisfied everything is over,.but I must claim some consideration for honorable members on this side, and if the Minister does not deny that he promised to reduce the minimum penalty to £2 I think some explanation is due. </para>

                    MCEACHARN (Melbourne). - 1 have been dragged into this matter in some way. The position was that the Minister did suggest a £2 minimum, but it was a suggestion, and not a promise. Upon that being offered, opposition was raised, and a desire expressed to strike out the clause altogether. Between the time of the offer and the discussion taking place on the question of omitting the clause, the Minister, I suppose, found out something, and thought it advisable to alter what he had originally suggested. I still think the Minister was wrong, but being an easy-going individual, and seeing that the Minister has been very good during the discussion on the Bill, I thought it was not wise to press the matter.

                        <para>- 1 propose that after the word "be," the words "£2 or" should be inserted. I am sure that many members of the committee are of the same opinion as myself that the £5 minimum is very much too high, and what I am proposing is what I think the Minister could justly agree to. The effect of my amendment, together possibly with the insertion of the words, " whichever may be the lesser amount " at the end of the clause, will be that the minimum will be fixed at £2, or one-twentieth of the prescribed amount of the fine, whichever amount may be the lesser. That is to say that, in the case of a £100 fine it will be perfectly competent for the court to reduce the penalty to £2, but, in the case of a £20 maximum it will be quite competent for the court to reduce the penalty to one-twentieth of that amount. I would ask the Minister if he cannot see his way clear to accept this amendment, especially after his having agreed to what I am now practically proposing. </para>

But the Minister having got the clauses through up to this point, I do not think he is entitled to ask us to agree to this clause as it stands.

                        <para>- I imputed no motives. I s aid that the Minister cannot expect me to accept any statement of his if no reduction is made in the minimum. After what the right honorable gentleman said to me when he led me to believe that the minimum would be diminished - he did not say by how much, it is perfectly correct, but that some reduction would be made - he cannot expect-me to believe any future statement of his if he does not reduce it. I should have raised objections to many of the clauses, and should have moved that reductions be made, but I did not discuss them, because of this promise which the Minister made to me. I let the clauses go on this assurance from the Minister, which he gave to me not once, but half-a-dozen times. As the clauses came up I said, "I expect there will be an amendment with regard to this," and the Minister said he would consider them all. I am sure honorable members must- recollect how many times I mentioned the matter. Now the clauses have all gone through, and I cannot get at them. They are to stand as they have been passed. The Minister himself knows how often I appealed to him about them. Now, however, he says that he will not go back upon them. That is what it means. We cannot have that kind of thing done by Ministers of the Crown. Honorable members opposite who laugh apparently believe that no one should accept the word of a Minister of the Crown. Those honorable members have had a great deal more experience of one or two of the Ministers than I have had. It is perfectly clear that the . committee are not with me on this point, and are determined to have a minimum of <inline font-style="italic">£5.</inline> If that is so, there is no more to be said ; but the next time the Minister for Trade and Customs wishes to have the discussion on any clause postponed, I hope that some one else will make the remarks which are necessary. I may then be able to accept them. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to ask the Minister why the words "by the Customs" are inserted? The word " Customs" is defined by clause 4 as " the Department of Customs," which is neither an individual nor corporation, and so far as I know has no legal status. As the Customs prosecutions can only be initiated in given ways, I do not think the words "by the Customs" are necessary. The Minister is anxious to strike out words if he can do so. It seems to me that these words can do no good, and they may do some harm. They should, therefore, be struck out. </para>

                    <para>- I would ask the Minister whether this clause does not give rather large powers to courts of summary jurisdiction? The clause says that where the penalty does not exceed £500 the prosecution may be instituted in any court of summary jurisdiction. Does that mean the maximum or minimum penalty ? </para>

                        <para>- The local courts in South Australia go up to £490. The words "court of summary jurisdiction" undoubtedly include courts of inferior jurisdiction. The definition given in the Acts Interpretation Act is as follows - "Court of summary jurisdiction" shall mean any justice or justices of the peace or other magistrate of the Commonwealth or part of the Commonwealth, or of a State or part of a State, sitting as a court for the making of summary orders or the summary punishment of offences under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State or by virtue of his or their commission or commissions or any Imperial Act. </para>

                <para class="block">This is the general jurisdiction of a justice, but it does not necessarily mean an honorary justice. We know that in large centres where Customs officers, are generally placed, the justices' courts are mostly presided over by special magistrates, who have either legal training or special knowledge. </para>

                    <para>- I think the question as to this power, being given to courts of summary jurisdiction is much more serious than the Minister appears to consider it. It is quite true that clause 230 defines certain proceedings for the recovery of penalties - it does not say whether they are pecuniary penalties or not - as " Customs prosecutions," and -they are the only prosecutions referred to. If the Minister will look at clauses 239 and 240 he will find that "Customs prosecutions " include prosecutions for indictable offences. Surely, it is not intended that courts of summary jurisdiction should, at the will of the Minister, be appealed to for the trial of indictable offences. . The only cases excluded from courts of summary jurisdiction however are those in which the penalty is over £500. </para>

As the honorable and learned member for Corio has said the provision as' to summary jurisdiction in relation to monetary fines applies with greater force to other penalties, and I think that the right honorable and learned gentleman should consider whether it would not be well to insert in clause 230 the word "pecuniary" before "penalty." </para>

                    <para>- Under this clause it is entirely at the option of the Customs authorities in instituting proceedings to reduce their claim if it is larger than £500 in order to bring it within the scope of a court of summary jurisdiction. A court of summary jurisdiction includes a justices' court, such as we were told by the Minister, a little while ago, was in some cases hardly trustworthy in questions affecting the revenue. Thus, these cases in which a penalty of £500 is sought, may be tried by a court consisting of justices who cannot, in some instances, be relied upon to inflict a minimum fine, and provision for a minimum fine has to be set down in the Bill in cold black and white without even stipulating that it shall be a £5-note. The Minister of Customs is to have the power - and as an important point turns on this I would invite the attention of my honorable and learned friends, the member for East Sydney and the member for Indi - to institute proceedings involving a penalty of £500 before justices in courts which under the present State legislation are not in some instances permitted to have a jurisdiction up to. £100. </para>

                        <para>- Iliad the idea that the Supreme Court and the High Court of Federal Australia was going to be a court that would dispense speedy and cheap justice. I had the notion that when this federation was accomplished, that was going to be one of the good points, and one of the improvements which people were looking forward to. Although it may suit the Customs authorities to bring cases of this description, involving a penalty of £500, before one of the very inferior courts we have heard about, the defendant who may be made liable for such a sum should undoubtedly have the discretion of removing his case to a higher court if he pleases. If there is anything in the argument as to cheapness and speediness, and that it is for his protection, the defendant should at least have the right, if he chooses, to elect that his case shall be tried by. a Supreme Court or by the High Court if the amount is £500 or anything like it. T would ask the Minister whether he sees any objection to provide, either as an addition to this clause or in another clause after it, that a defendant may have the right to elect to have his case tried in a higher court if he is not satisfied with the court of summary jurisdiction ? While the Customs department as prosecutors may retain the right provided here to bring the case in a lower court, th defendant should have the absolute right, with as little expense and trouble as possible, to remove the case and have it tried by a court of higher jurisdiction, such as the Supreme Court of a State or the High Court of Australia. </para>

Solomon, and I have carefully weighed his expressions on this matter. He has dealt out a sledge-hammering to the Minister for Trade and Customs for even casting the slightest bit of reflection upon the honorary magistrates. Is it not clear to the committee that the honorable member, who is himself a magistrate, is impliedly .siding with the law-breakers in inviting us here to make this change? I leave it to my honorable friend, and ask how he can explain his own conduct in delaying the committee at such a late hour, when we are all anxious to get home, and in keeping me here when I ought to be in bed. </para>

                    <para>- I point out that under section 245, where the penalty inflicted is over £200, the person fined may, where the penalty is not paid, be imprisoned for one year, and this clause 243, therefore, will practically allow a court of summary jurisdiction to imprison a man for a year. With regard to costs, I point out that in all Customs prosecutions the court may award any costs against any party or claimant, and if people are willing to go to a higher court, I think there is every reason why this liberty should be granted to them. The difficulty with me is that the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. "V.</inline> L. Solomon, has accepted the statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs. I had a statement before from the Minister, and I do not know how far it goes. However, as th honorable member, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. "V.</inline> L. Solomon, is willing to accept the offer of the Minister to draft a clause, I will now let it go. </para>

                    <para>- I hope we shall pass this clause, because it provides for what I think is very proper - a cheap and speedy form of obtaining justice on the part of the Customs department. The procedure as laid down here will enable the Customs department when they think fit, and only when they think fit, to take prosecutions up to £500 in these lower courts. It is not absolutely mandatory, it is permissive, and no doubt the Customs department may be trusted, where there is not a good and sufficient reason to prosecute in the lower court, to go to a higher. </para>

                    L. SOLOMON (South Australia). - I would suggest to the Minister as a mode, perhaps -of meeting some of our objections to any court of summary jurisdiction, that it might be met by inserting after the word "jurisdiction" the words "presided over by a special or stipendiary magistrate." Evidently we are in a bit of a fog as to the different courts. Sub-clause (c) uses the words " any court of summary jurisdiction." To a very great extent it will get over the difficulty as to such an important case being relegated to a court, consisting of perhaps only two unpaid justices of the peace with somewhat limited local knowledge, if we insert the words I have suggested.

The Customs Bill will be further proceeded with and, I hope, there may be an opportunity of moving the second reading of the InterState Commission Bill. With reference to the State Laws and Records Recognition Bill, which is in the hands of the Attorney-General, I do not think he will be able to attend to-morrow's meeting. </para>
