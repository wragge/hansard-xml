            <para>Clause 27- (1. ) The proprietor, printer, or publisher of any newspaper may at such time and in such form and with such particulars as may be prescribed, upon payment of a fee of Five shillings, register it at the General Post-office of any State, and the Deputy Postmaster-General of such State may from time to time revise the register and remove therefrom any publication, a posted copy of which contains seditious, blasphemous, indecent, or obscene matter, or which by reason of the proportion of advertisements to other matter therein, or for any other reason is not within the description aforesaid, and any publication for the time being on the register shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed a registered newspaper. (2.) No publication which after the expiration of one month from the commencement of this Act is tendered for transmission at any post-office in the Commonwealth shall be sent by post as a newspaper unless the provisions of this section have been complied with. (3.) Any Deputy Postmaster-General may refuse to transmit or deliver any publication containing seditious, blasphemous, indecent, or obscene matter. (4.) Any posted newspaper found to contain seditious, blasphemous, indecent, or obscene matter may be destroyed by order of the Postmaster-General.

                    <para>- The Prime Minister indicated last night that he would be prepared to-day to make a statement as to the intentions of the Government with regard to any possible amendment of the clause, and I had hoped that he would have been ready with that statement now. I think that the committee, while agreeing generally that any newspaper or other publication containing obscene or indecent advertisements or other objectionable matter should be prevented from going through the post, will recognise that the Government propose to go further in this regard than the legislation of any of the States goes. </para>

                        <para>- The instances cited last night by the Prime Minister had application only to publications containing obscene and indecent matter, and 1 do not think there will be two opinions as to the procedure which should be adopted in regard to literature of that sort. But the question, what is seditious or blasphemous matter, is capable of such widely different answers that it seems to me improper to leave its determination to the Postmaster-General. A great deal may be urged against allowing a non-political officer to decide that matter, and, whatever may be so urged, applies with tenfold force against allowing an active politician to have the power. We can understand how the interpretation of blasphemy and sedition might be stretched in its application to a newspaper which happened to be obnoxious to persons in power. I think that the question should be remitted for decision to a judicial authority. It is a proper thing to provide that the courts shall have power to prevent the dissemination of blasphemous and seditious literature by means of the Post-office, and to punish those who are guilty of attempting to corrupt the public mind by publishing it. </para>

                        <para>- lam not going to discuss the provisions which the honorable member lias in mind; but when letters are addressed to a well-known sweep promoter, Ave have <inline font-style="italic">prima</inline><inline font-style="italic">fame</inline> evidence of their contents. I quite appreciate the point put forward by the Prime Minister with respect to the necessity of insuring against the removal of newspapers from the register without proper cause being shown. 1 think that is one safeguard, but the amendment of the honorable member for Coolgardie was placed at the end of sub-clause (3) with a view to covering all the proceedings enumerated prior to that in the clause. I do not say that it attains that object, but that is the view with which it was placed so far on in the clause. I am prepared to admit that it might be advisable under some circumstances, especially with regard to obscene or indecent matter, to stop a paper from being sent through the post pending judical inquiry, but there should be a distinction between sedition and blasphemy on the one hand, and indecency and obscenity on the other. The latter class of offences are capable- of clear and ready interpretation, but with regard to sedition and blasphemy that is not the case, and I would like to see distinct sets of regulations or clauses dealing with these two classes of matters. If the Government cannot see their way to alter the clause, so as to at least take out of the hands of a political officer, such as the Postmaster-General, the power to deal with newspapers tl at might be criticising and making themselves offensive to the Ministry of the day, I shall be reluctantly compelled to vote for some amendment that will have that effect. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to see all reference to sedition and blasphemy eliminated from the clause. The Prime Minister said last evening that any man who did not know what sedition was would have to acknowledge himself a fool, but I must admit that I do not know what sedition is. I have looked up the dictionary for the meaning of the word and 1 find that sedition means &#34;an attempt to upset the Government.&#34; According to that I suppose the leader of the Opposition is constantly guilty of seditious conduct. I understand that there is a different meaning from that, and that the word used in another sense means &#34; an attempt to bring about a revolution.&#34; It would be possible here, as it has been in the House of Commons, to bring in a resolution in favour of republicanism, if any one were sufficiently ill-advised to do so. Such a motion was in fact brought before the House of Commons, and it was not regarded as seditious. It was considered to be perfectly constitutional there, and it would be perfectly constitutional here, and if that is not sedition, according to the dictionary meaning, I do not know what sedition is. At no time have the powers with reference to seditious or blasphemous matter been exercised in connexion with the Post-office, and I think it would be a great mistake for us to confer powers which are doubtful or quite obsolete. The Prime Minister was rather doubtful as to what blasphemy consisted of, but I remember reading something which perhaps might throw some light on the matter. In March, 1883, the secretary to the society for the suppression of blasphemous literature, wrote to the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> and other papers, and amongst other things said - </para>

                <para class="block">It seems an outrage that the writings of such men as those named should be labelled as blasphemous, and yet if we were to go back and look up the history of blasphemy laws, we should find that still more outrageous things have been done. I think that, as the Government have always been content to allow these laws to remain a dead letter, we ought not to revive them by inserting any provisions as to blasphemy and sedition iri. this Bill. I am sure that the Government themselves would not have a sufficient amount of bigotry or savagery to attempt to convict any man of blasphemy, considering that they are very doubtful as to what blasphemy consists of, and considering further that what is sometimes regarded as blasphemy is really the expression of a man&#39;s honest convictions against the conventional religion of the&#34; times. </para>

                    <para>- Although I am opposed to clause 55, which deals with letters, I think there is a great difference between newspapers and letters, and I quite agree that any matter that offends the public conscience, such as obscenity and that sort of tiling, should not be carried by the postal authorities. A newspaper is a special package which is sent through the post under favorable circumstances. It is open at both ends, and is conveyed under special conditions as to cost, which, perhaps, do not remunerate the Post-office, but which are intended to promote the spread of decent literature. In making these remarks, I wish to indicate clearly my position in relation to the course T shall take with reference to clause 55, because I consider there is no analogy between newspapers and letters. I quite -agree that there is no use in including in this Bill anything that it would take all the lawyers of Australia to decide, and leave us in the end knowing no more than we do now. Sedition is a thing which it is almost impossible to define - what is sedition to-&#34; &#60;3ay may be gospel to-morrow - and I think that all reference to sedition might very well be omitted from the Bill. As I have said in connexion with previous Bills, we are wot now passing legislation for all time to come, and it will be very easy if some of the evils that are feared become rampant, to deal with them effectively in the future. In the meantime, our legislation ought to be based on common-sense principles, and therefore I think it would be better if we simply provided that the Postmaster-General should have the right to stop anything from passing through the post that would &#34;Obviously offend the public conscience of a Christian people. </para>

                    <para>- I think the powers proposed to be conferred upon the Postmaster-General and Deputy Postmasters-General by this clause are such as it would be very unwise for this committee to intrust them with. I am just as. anxious as any one that our post-office should not be converted into a sewer by which filth may be conveyed to the people, to the demoralization of the subjects of the Commonwealth ; but .at the same time I desire to see our newspapers left free to canvass public questions in the fullest possible way, stopping short only at that point where criticism falls into anything that is likely to offend the public morality. If we look at the English Act, we shall find that there is no power whatever given to the Postmaster-General to stop newspapers or interfere with them in respect to any blasphemous or seditious matter, and that as to those matters in which the Postmaster-General of England can interfere, he has to do it with the sanction of the Government. Under the laws of the different States we have no provision whatever which empowers the Postmaster-General or .any one else to deal with seditious matter, and yet our laws have worked very well. I am not aware that any newspapers have been found guilty of propagating matter which might be regarded as seditious, even by the most hyper-critical. I would like to know who is to pronounce what is sedition - who is qualified to give a decision upon an important point of this sort save the most learned members of the legal profession ? How is the construction of this term, so difficult to define, to be intrusted to a political Minister possibly entirely untrained in the law, and who has within the Commonwealth absolutely no tradition or previous experience to guide him? </para>

                        <para>- But Ministers might be guided by a Supreme Court Judge. However, it would not be difficult for the Ministry, acting as such, on their own initiative, and bearing the full responsibility, to stop seditious matter from passing through the channels of the Post-office without any enactment on &#39;our statute-book, which might be subject to the most gross misuse and applied to improper purposes. As to the question of blasphemy, I would like to ask whether every Deputy Postmaster-General, or the Postmaster-General himself, is to be regarded as qualified to say what is blasphemy ? What is blasphemous to the mind of one man might be quite the other thing in another man&#39;s opinion. It is within my . own experience that <inline font-style="italic">ti</inline> magistrate - a man of some culture - construed the term &#34; bloody &#34; as blasphemous. It is really almost a prayerful expression, derived, as we all know, from &#34; by our lady.&#34; I think that we might very well retain our legislation on the old and well-travelled lines, with which we are familiar, and not hazard a dangerous experiment such as is proposed under this Bill. The purpose of the Government to prevent the Post-office from  becoming a channel  for impure literature can be thoroughly attained without the inclusion of the words &#34; blasphemous &#34; and &#34; seditious.&#34; I propose to move that those words be struck out. </para>

                    <para>- I am going to support the amendment. The history of the past shows that such powers as those in the clause have been used to the detriment of true liberty. I think that the more liberty Ave give to the printing press the better it will be for the advancement of the community. We know very well that what is regarded as seditious to-day may not be considered as such to-morrow. The clause enables the Postmaster-General or Deputy Postmaster-General to exercise autocratic powers in dealing with these matters. He can say whether a paper shall be registered or not, and, so far as I can see, there is no appeal from his decision. Not only would the clause affect the printers and publishers of newspapers, but a great number of our standard classical works could be objected to under it. The Bible itself, the keystone of Christianity, might be brought under this definition of blasphemy and sedition. I believe that these matters should be dealt with by the ordinary criminal process, and that Ave should not establish another censor in our midst in addition to our courts of justice. In the interests of true progress I am going to vote for the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member who has just sat down cannot be charged with disloyalty, but he is strongly against this provision in the clause. The amendment is worthy of our support, not merely because it is in the direction of progress -and liberty, but because it provides a safety valve such as that of a public meeting. Public meetings at Hyde Park, London, the Domain in Sydney, and the Yarra bank, Melbourne, are the safety valves of enlightened democracy, and if certain sections of the community are so weak in their loyalty and religion as to be affected by the passing through the post of what may be considered blasphemous or seditious matter, then we cannot say much for them. </para>

                <para class="block">The very strength of British authority is the right given to the people to freely express their opinions, how ever strong they may be. We do not want to confuse well directed democracy with misunderstood puritanical ideas. When we find that the right to disseminate seditious opinions by means of public speech has no evil effect, why should we fear the dissemination of such views by means of printed matter sent through the post? If we pass the clause as it stands we shall lead to the creation of secret political societies, and sedition will be likely to grow much more rapidly than it would if this restriction were removed. We have had experience of what may happen in the action of the ultra-loyal Premier of this State, who carried things to such an extent that his action did not meet with the approval of even the Imperial authorities. </para>
                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. RONALD</inline>(Southern Melbourne).I support the amendment for the simple reason that the terms &#34; seditious &#34; and &#34; blasphemous &#34; are purely relative, relative to the time and to the place in which they are used. We might in tins House give a definition of what is blasphemy by saying that it is that state of feeling expressed on being aroused by the honorable members for Parramatta and Werriwa. It is purely relevant to the person using it. On the other hand, the terms &#34; indecent &#34; and &#34;obscene&#34; can be understood and decided upon by a jury, as being an offence against the moral sense which is visible and tangible. We can have no sedition unless there be the elements for creating a revolution, and no official should be allowed to decide what is blasphemous and seditious. That should be left entirely to a jury. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that the remarks of the previous speaker are well founded. Whilst I admit that there may be a difficulty in defining &#34; blasphemy &#34; and &#34; sedition,&#34; there is quite as much difficulty in laying down a definition of &#34;indecency&#34; and &#34;obscenity.&#34; History affords numerous instances of the varying constructions which have been placed upon these terms. When I was previously resident in this State, I remember that some individual wrote to the press complaining that the statues in the Fitzroy Gardens were indecent. In several periods of the world&#39;s history other things equally as innocent as those statues have been condemned and smashed because of their alleged indecency. I admit that the Government ought to have power to stop the circulation of literature partaking either of the nature of sedition, blasphemy, indecency, or obscenity, but I do not think that that object would be achieved by the adoption of the amendment proposed by the right honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon. That provision would only have the effect of stopping the circulation of -a newspaper containing such offensive matter after an application had been made to the Supreme Court, and an order had been granted to suppress it. Pending the issue of that order the obnoxious literature would have to be circulated. My own idea is that the best course to follow is to give the Postmaster-General the necessary power to deal with this  matter, but at the same time to hedge round the exercise of that power with conditions that will safeguard popular liberty. In spite of what has been said as to the difficulty of defining the terms already referred to, I hold that there are publications which the whole House would admit to be blasphemous and indecent. The Government ought to have the power of intervention in such flagrant cases. But whilst I would allow the Postmaster-General the power to stop the circulation of any newspaper which he deems to contain seditious, blasphemous, indecent, or obscene matter, I would make him responsible for the exercise of that power. Sub-clause (5) does not provide an adequate remedy in this respect. If the Postmaster-General stopped the circulation of a newspaper upon a groundless charge that it contained sedition, blasphemy, or obscenity, and the proprietor of such publication suffered damage by the action of the Government, the injured individual should&#39; be in a position to recover the full amount of the damage sustained, together with costs. If such a provision were inserted the rights of the individual would be thoroughly safeguarded, and the Postmaster-General would think twice before running the risk of stopping the circulation of a newspaper without a sufficient justification. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to point out that under sub-clause (5) the owner or publisher of a newspaper which has been prevented from passing through the post by the Postmaster-General can appeal to the court to determine whether such publication does contain seditious or blasphemous matter. Upon such an appeal, a decision may be entered in his favour, and yet he will have no redress against the Postal department. In my opinion that is an arbitrary power to place in the hands of any Minister. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, if a remedy be provided for that defect, I may change my opinion, but in its present form I shall certainly vote for the -amendment of the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon. I would also point out that varying decisions may from time to time be given as to what constitutes sedition or blasphemy. The proper course to adopt is to place the Government in a position to take action whenever they have reasonable cause for believing that a newspaper contains seditious or blasphemous matter, and to restrain by an injunction - if that were thought necessary - the circulation of that publication. Then a proper tribunal would define what constituted sedition or blasphemy. Under this clause, however, the onus is thrown upon the publisher to prove that he is not guilty of having published blasphemous or seditious literature, whereas he should be proved guilty of the offence before being penalized. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WATKINS</inline> (Newcastle).- This is the first time in my experience when a proposition has been seriously put forward to punish a man for an offence without giving him a trial. After he has suffered injury he will under this provision be able to appeal to a Judge simply to establish his innocence. I do not think we should proceed in that way at all. A man is entitled to be tried before he is convicted. This clause will give to the Postmaster-General the power to temporarily suspend the circulation of a newspaper, and to throw the onus of proof upon the accused, which is not a proper thing to do. I agree with the amendment proposed by the right honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, because there is a difficulty in defining what constitutes blasphemy and sedition. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BARTON</inline>(Hunter- Minister for External Affairs). - I intimated last night that the early portion of this clause seemed to bo susceptible of an amendment in the direction of reducing the hardship that might appear to be contained in it. Before I can propose all the amendments which I desire, to submit it will be necessary for the right honorable member for&#39; Tasmania, </para>
                <para class="block"><inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline>Braddon, to temporarily withdraw his amendment, which comes in the middle of three which I wish to make. I desire to safeguard the provision in such a way that no harm can be anticipated from an official administering it, whilst paying some regard to the objection that has been voiced against a member of, any Ministry administering it. The power given is to some extent judicial, but yet it cannot be effectively exercised by any officer who is not an officer of the Postoffice. <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> cannot otherwise get that instant decision upon these matters which is necessary to prevent the pollution of a service which, after all, belongs to the Crown and the Government, whom the people control, and which must be effectively exercised, or not exercised at all. It will remain largely a question for this committee to say whether they intend to allow, even fora limited period, the Post-office to be a common sewer. I suggest that after the words &#34; from time to time,&#34; in the first paragraph of the clause, we should insert &#34; subject to appeal as hereinafter mentioned.&#34; In the next line the words &#34; removed therefrom &#34; should be omitted, and the words &#34; may call upon the proprietor, printer, or publisher of&#34; should be inserted in lieu thereof. Then at the end of sub-clause (1) I suggest adding the words &#34; to show cause why such publication should not be removed from the register, and if sufficient cause be not shown  he may  remove  it accordingly.&#34; That will still be subject to  the appeal provided for by sub-clause (5). The idea is to save time in order that if any body in the result be injured by the decision arrived at, the injury may be a&#163; shortlived as possible. Assuming that the clause,, in other respects stands as it is, I should be prepared to move to insert after the word &#34;Judge,&#34; the words &#34;who may award damages and costs to the appellant in his discretion.&#34; I do not mean to say that I adhere precisely to that form of words, because it is obvious that if the appellant be defeated he must be prepared to pay the costs himself. The officer, in dealing with a case, would have to consider two things, first, that there was a tribunal staring him in the face if he were wrong. Next there is, not the certainty, but the possibility that any unadvised or precipitate action on his part may entail serious consequences to himself. If the provision is inserted that the department may have to pay damages for any precipitate action it takes, we may be quite sure that any officer of the department, having a knowledge of that possibility, will be extremely careful how he exercises his powers. I wish, therefore, to surround the matter with the closest safeguards, so that the power may be exercised in a case in which its exercise appears to be absolutely necessary in the public interest, but in no other case. That it should be exercised in some resort is, I think, certain ; but I feel confident that, apart from the controversies which we may have had on other subjects, I can call upon the public spirit, the loyalty, and decency of the committee to deal with this matter without reference to party considerations. It has been suggested that a difficulty is created by the appearance in the clause of the words &#34; seditious &#34; and &#34; blasphemous.&#34; I would ask the right honorable member for Tasmania, if he intends to push his amendment to a division, that it may be put so that honorable members may have the choice of voting for the retention of one word and the rejection of the other. It will be of the greatest advantage to all concerned that the right honorable gentleman shall not embarrass those who are inclined to vote with him for the omission of one word by forcing them to vote for the omission of both or of neither. </para>

The definition contains the opinion of perhaps as high an authority on the subject as 1 could quote, and it is supported by a number of leading authorities who are cited. I am reading these extracts, not because I thought at the outset that it would be necessary to do so, but because part of the discussion has turned upon the alleged difficulty of determining what is &#34;seditious&#34; and what is &#34;blasphemous.&#34; </para>

                <para>Publications intended in good faith to propagate opinions on religious subjects which the person who publishes them regards as true, are not blasphemous (within the meaning of this definition), merely because their publication is likely to wound the feelings of those who believe such opinions to be false, or because their general adoption might tend by lawful means to alterations in the constitution of the Church by law established. </para>
                <para class="block">So that we find, with regard to both sedition and blasphemy, that if the matter complained of is a decent expression of lawful means of altering the Constitution of the State or of the Church, the complaint cannot be upheld. A large amount of latitude on the score of good faith must always be allowed to those whose actions are called into question. Any one who reads the paragraphs which I have quoted will see that, if the actions of those whose publications are called into question appear on the face of them to have been dictated by good faith, and an honest belief in what is written - not by mere ribaldry or the desire to unconstitutionally and unlawfully create unrest - they must be held to be exempt. The whole question turns upon the good faith of the person responsible for the publication, and that is to be determined in a large measure by the manner in which he expresses himself. </para>

                        <para>- I am leaving the matter in the hands of the Deputy Postmaster-General, who has his own official position to consider, and who must remember that he has to regard, not the opinions of his official superior, the Postmaster-General, but the probable judgment of the court. There is an expressed provision for an appeal to a court which is not to be found in the Acts which have been cited, and that provision makes all the difference, because it will cause the official whose duty it will be to give a tentative decision in regard to these matters to take care to give a decision which will not be upset, not by his superior officer, but by the court, and damages awarded against the department. The matter is not left to the Postmaster-General, who might act according to individual caprice, or in fear of, or deference to, what he thinks the breath of popular opinion. The regulating breath in this case is the breath of a court, which we are all accustomed to regard as impartial, and which will therefore be a guiding factor, because any official must act in view of the probable judgment of the court. I think that the amendment which I have outlined may be accepted by honorable members on both sides as sufficiently safeguarding the clause. The suggestion that it is difficult to define what is &#34;seditious&#34; or what is &#34;blasphemous,&#34; is, in a very large measure, met by the honorable member for South Sydney, who said that if we were to stick at difficulties of that kind, we might as well let the -whole matter alone, because in the minds of some men there would be difficulties in the way of defining what is &#34; obscene &#34; and what is &#34; indecent.&#34; But men of good judgment and fair sense have as little difficulty in finding out what is seditious as they have in finding out what is indecent, and it is men of that good judgment and good sense who are to regulate this matter under appeal, and it is in fear - and proper fear - of his judgment being appealed from that any official will have to act. Now let me put another difficulty before honorable members ; I wish to do it quite fairly. Supposing we do not do something of this kind, what will happen in the meantime? If we are going to have qualms as to whether a post-office official might always be right to the letter, acting under great responsibility, and we say that there shall be no restriction at all, let us paint the picture on the other side. What defence will any of us have against the accusation that must then be brought against us that, because we were afraid of doing justice in a case in which there was, <inline font-style="italic">prima facie,</inline> a misdoing ; we were prepared to convert one of the Crown departments in this country, over which we have the power of legislation, into an open channel for the conveyance of profanity and filth ? I do not use too strong terms there, because that which is blasphemous is undoubtedly profane, and that which is indecent or obscene is undoubtedly filthy. We may take one of two courses. AVe may say that, because we are very careful to avoid an}&#39; mistakes that might be made by a postal official, we are going to allow time to elapse within which a case may be heard in court. In the interval the objectionable matter may be allowed to run its course, and the Post-office, which ought to be pure, may be used for -the purpose of conveying this matter broadcast among the people. It may be that the matter in question may aim at upsetting the form of government which we, the majority of the people, may think right, or at spreading such literature as no man in this House would for an instant allow to be in the hands of his child. These things are to be carried and spread broadcast if restrictive measures of this kind - which are mildly restrictive in every sense of the word as I now propose to amend this Bill - are not passed. If these provisions are not to be adopted by this committee it will mean that honorable members who are sitting all round me, who would not for the world leave in the hands of their daughter, their sister, their wife, or &#39;their child, any of this stuff, are to order  His  Majesty&#39;s Government to convey it through the post. Honorable members can judge of the position by the probable results, and the probable results are these : that until these matters are determined by the court fatal damage may be done to many a hearth and many a home. There is no use attempting to blind my eyes in this matter. 1 am dealing with it free from any feeling or prejudice. I am one of those men so happily constituted that when I know that a newspaper is attacking me with all sorts of filth I never allow it to go into my house or take any notice of it whatever. It has been the lot of all of us to be attacked, but it is not attacks upon public men that are dealt with in this clause. It is not any party action which may affect a Ministry, because actions designed to oust one Ministry and put in another cannot for a moment be assumed to come within the definition of sedition. To remove a Ministry is within the Constitution, and to take all lawful means to remove it is also within the Constitution ; therefore, this matter does not hang in the least degree on party considerations, but rests upon those considerations that appeal to us all as reasonable and honest citizens, and it is only in that light that I desire to put it before the House, speaking without passion, and yet with that warmth which any honest man. may be forgiven in connexion with such a subject. I think that this committee is to a very large extent put to the test in this matter, not through any fault of ours, but by the conditions that are existing in this society of Australia. God forbid that I should say anything against the freedom of the press. I have suffered enough at the hands of the press, and have been quite as sparing as any honorable member of this House in the way of answering or replying to their criticisms. I do not conduct such controversies, and, therefore, I have nothing to say against the complete liberty of the press. It is not liberty, however, but licence,  which is the question before us. We are not seeking to restrict the adoption of all lawful means to carry out controversies on great public questions with that freedom without which a healthy public spirit could not exist. I recognise that the conditions under which public questions may be discussed must be amply liberalized, so that matters may be discussed freely on both sides, and so as to permit of the fullest expression of public feeling, and of public feeling being influenced in every legitimate way. But we are dealing with cases where means are adopted outside of the ordinary honest expression of opinion, means which those great journals that have been spoken of would never adopt, means which may be adopted in many cases by it may be little journals, the repression of which does not imply any animosity to that weak or little journal, but purely a proper spirit of justice exercised against breaches of the law. Let us bear this in mind : there is no prejudgment - the offence if it exists can be tried in the courts. This Act does not touch that question. The question is whether a great department of State is to carry such matter as has been described, and whether, if we are to empower - to compel - it to carry such matter, we are ready to take the responsibility. I for one am not. I am ready to be responsible to the people in most matters, but not to the people or my own conscience for the carriage of any matter of this kind. This is too important a matter to be treated from any light stand-point. It is one of the most important matters which we can consider - whether matter which the law holds to be in itself the commission of a criminal offence is to be carried by the very Government which is itself the chief guardian of the law. The Postmaster-General has only to decide whether a publication that goes through the Post-office contains certain matter. The question whether the printer or publisher or proprietor of that journal comes within the scope of the criminal law is a matter that the court only can determine, and there is not a syllable in the Bill which gives the Postmaster-General any power in that regard. All he has the power to determine is whether the Post-office, of which he is the custodian, is to continue to carry matter of a certain character, and the question is not whether a man who may be ultimately responsible is guilty of an offence, but whether the objectionable matter should be willingly carried by the Government into the homes of the people. With reference to the early part of the clause, I would ask honorable members to look at what is provided. It would be a mistake to suppose that the Postmaster-General, or the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, is asked to, or could by any possibility, decide questions of this kind every day. There is a. register of newspapers which is kept under other statutes, and is to be kept in the same way in this case. There will be hundreds if not thousands of names of newspapers on that register, and it would be impossible for the Postmaster - General to go through that every day for the purpose of saying whether a certain paper should continue to be delivered. All that would be possible for a man with the multifarious duties of a  Deputy  Postmaster - General would be to revise the register periodically, and that is what is provided for in the clause. </para>

                <para class="block">There is to be- a periodical revision, and if it has been noticed during the period under revision that any paper has been sending out matter of the character objected to - it may be for only one issue - the Deputy Postmaster - General can call upon the proprietor, printer, or publisher of that paper, subject to an appeal to a Judge, to show cause why the paper should not be removed from the register. If cause can be shown why it should not be removed, or if the owner of the newspaper can convince the officer - it seems impracticable to get anybody else than an official of the Post-office to act in the first instance - that the proposed removal of the paper from the register is premature or precipitate, the officer looking to his very clear responsibility to a court will, certain! y not condemn him - he cannot condemn him - unheard without great consideration. There ought to be some such reserve power. The sum and substance of the amendments will be to make it clear that the action of the Deputy Postmaster-General is subject to the appeal mentioned under sub-clause (5). The Postmaster-General can call upon the proprietor, printer, or publisher to show cause why his publication should not be removed from the register, and if sufficient cause be not shown, he may remove it accordingly - that is, subject to the right of appeal in sub-clause (5). After exercising the best of his judgment, the Deputy Postmaster-General may, if he is not satisfied with what the owner or proprietor says, remove the paper from the register, and if a Judge finds that he has done wrong, of course, the newspaper will have to be again registered. If anyone suffers in the meantime it will doubtless be the newspaper proprietor. That is quite clear. On the other hand, it is for honorable members to choose whether in that time which must elapse the injury shall be to the newspaper, which is <inline font-style="italic">prima&#34; facie</inline> guilty, or to the whole of the public, who are more than <inline font-style="italic">prima</inline><inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> innocent. </para>

It is only in the event of cause not being shown that a newspaper can be removed, and the removal is then to be subject to the right of appeal. </para>

                    <para>- I was very much inclined, as the -clause originally stood, to support the amendment, because of the difficulty which the Postmaster-General must experience in deciding what is obscene, indecent, blasphemous, or seditious. I was further inclined to accept the amendment, because if the Postmaster-General was mistaken in his decision - i-if he acted without sufficient discretion or from improper motives - there was no sufficient remedy for the newspaper proprietor. Now that the Prime Minister has foreshadowed certain alterations, however, I think that - the committee might very well accept the compromise. There are cases of indecency, obscenity, blasphemy, and sedition about which there can be no question and so intensely bad that the feelings of the great majority of the people would revolt against them. In such cases no action which had to wait the slow procedure of Jaw would be sufficient, and I am .quite sure the people would sustain the executive in taking prompt measures. The danger of speedy action is that it may proceed on improper grounds, but if it is provided, as proposed by the Prime Minister, that the very tribunal which has to decide whether the offence has been committed can award damages to the newspaper proprietor if the Postmaster-General is wrong, then I think we shall meet the best interests of the community, while we secure, at the same time, the rights of the newspaper proprietor. Another advantage of this provision is that it will deter the Postmaster-General from . acting unless he is absolutely certain that the court will sustain him in his decision. Newspaper proprietors will also exercise greater &#163;are, and see that mo &#39;matter that may bring them within this clause gets into their publications. I am perfectly sure that no journal, whether it disputes the propriety of an existing -religion, or whether it desires to change our form of government in any lawful way, need ever fear this clause. It is only those journals which would undoubtedly publish seditious and blasphemous matter, about which there can be no question, that have cause to fear - and even &#39;those journals&#39; have their remedy in the courts - so that I think we may safely adopt the course suggested by the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- Some honorable members appeal- to argue as if the right of free speech and free printing were the same as the right of a man to distribute anything he likes through the Post-office. That is not what we intend. A man may say what he likes, and print what he likes, and circulate it in his own way, but- we impose certain restrictions, and say that his liberty of speech, and liberty of printing, shall not be extended to the distribution of anything that he pleases through the agency of the Post-office. We&#93;&#93;ave a right to- say that the Post-office shall not be used to the harm of the community. We must put the administration of this power in the hands of some official. </para>

                        <para>- If the leader of the Opposition can give us any better method of dealing with this question than that hitherto found in every Postal Act, no doubt the committee will be pleased to adopt it. We are now dealing with the whole subject of whether we ought to control the delivery and circulation of certain publications. We have an officer who is intrusted with the administration of the Postal department, and to him, it seems to me, must be left the duty of deciding whether or not any particular publication is unfitted by reason of the matter which it contains to be transmitted through the post. If we provide that a person who suffers injury through any unwarrantable action on the part of the Postmaster-General can obtain compensation for such injury, I think we shall have done all that can be reasonably expected of us. </para>

                        <para>- The heat of the right honorable and learned gentleman was such that one might pardonably have thought that he was rebutting something of an opposite character, which was uttered from this side of the House. I acknowledge at once that a newspaper is different from a letter. The former is carried under certain specific conditions of cheapness. It is not closed like a letter, and there is no analogy between the two. The Prime Minister&#39;s arguments as to what really constituted a seditious article proved strongly to me the great difficulty of deciding upon such matters. We do not desire to see the Postal department made a sewer, neither do we wish - if I may make use of the expression - to make fools of ourselves as legislators by attempting to prevent the transmission through the post of things which we cannot define. I am inclined to think that the amendment suggested by the Prime Minister will offer a solution of the difficulty: Honorable members upon this side of the House were just as strong as he was against the circulation of seditious or blasphemous documents, &#39;but we wished to preserve the rights and liberties of the people at the same time. We were anxious not to put into the hands of the Postmaster-General the right practically to ransack all the newspapers which went through the Postal department. The whole difficulty with us was that, whilst the Postmaster-General should have some restraining power, there should not be relegated to him the judicial functions of a Judge. To a large extent, the dangers which we foresaw have been nipped by the suggested amendment of the Prime Minister. I understand that the process is to stop the issue at once and then ask the publisher to show cause. </para>

That is, as regards the removal from the register, but not as regards the transmission of&#39; the publication through the Post-office. But we propose to amend subclause (3) by making it apply only to the particular issue in which the objectionable matter appears, so that any other issue may be transmitted through the post. </para>

                        <para>- Obviously if it were to occur in the case of a daily newspaper the issue could not be stopped. I hold very strongly that the exercise of the very slightly mitigated authority which the Prime Minister proposes to confer might be a very grievous wrong to the proprietors of some journals. Pending a decision by the court upon the question of whether a newspaper contained blasphemous or indecent matter the issue of that newspaper would be stopped. In such a case the journal in question would be materially injured, if not absolutely ruined by this interference with its circulation. </para>

                    <para>- -I must again express my regret that Bills of this character have in many important respects been so ill-considered. In the performance of my public duty I must call attention to the delays which have occurred in dealing with these Bills, owing to the excessive assumption of arbitrary power which is placed in the hands of the persons administering the departments. In every case the department is put in a position of almost impregnable authority, whilst the public are placed in a very different position. We have a right to expect the benefit of Cabinet deliberations over the more important clauses of a BUI, which are likely to raise a very considerable difference of opinion. When I look at this particular clause, I am astonished at the power which it confers upon the Postmaster-General. What does the removal of a newspaper from the registered list in the Post-office mean <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It means practically the destruction of that paper. What does the stoppage of one issue mean ? It means the infliction of an injury which, to its proprietors, can scarcely be calculated. Do we not all know of the heroic efforts which newspaper proprietors make when a fire occurs upon their premises to issue their paper as usual, because it is considered that irreparable  in jury  would be done to the publication if it missed one issue. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. If a daily newspaper misses one issue, all its advertising contracts are broken. This is one of the most serious ways of interfering with a newspaper. Moreover, a newspaper is a kind of property which very frequently becomes obnoxious to the powers that rule. Therefore, it is a property which we must take under our protection to some extent. I am with those who wish to suppress the circulation of blasphemous or seditious literature. But just as in trying to suppress murder and burglary, so in regard to obscenity and blasphemy, we must exercise our powers in a perfectly fair and cautious way. We must not under the influence of any feeling, apply to one kind of offence a different treatment from that applied to another. The less we interfere the better, and the more we leave the determination of these matters to the authority of the executive the better. If a certain thing is an offence against the criminal law, why do not the Government take the responsibility of bringing the criminal to justice through the ordinary machinery of Courts of Justice, where a man can be tried by a jury of his countrymen. Very often juries give dissatisfaction by their verdicts, but as long as a man is to be tried by jury, the jury system must be upheld. So far as the individual is concerned, he should be punished not through a civil department such as a post-office, but&#39; by the proper means provided under the administration of criminal justice. I quite agree, however, that that does not settle this matter, because there are public interests involved quite apart from any punishment that may be inflicted upon the offender, and I wish to go as far as I can in assisting the Government to carry out the object they have in view. I would point out, however, that whilst, at first sight, the proposal which the Prime Minister lias just made seems a reasonable one and such as we might all accept, if it is closely examined we shall see that it still leaves the matter in an unsatisfactory state. Let us first consider who is to be the authority who is in the first instance to consider that a particular newspaper is an obscene or an indecent publication - it is the Deputy Postmaster-General. The wording of the amendment, to the effect that&#39; the proprietor of a newspaper is to be called upon to show cause why his newspaper should not be removed from the register, suggests a proper judicial method of bringing the matter to a decision, but we find that he has to show cause to the very man who has already found him guilty. When a man is called upon to show cause why a certain stigma should not be attached to his character - because it is a stigma upon his character as well as upon the newspaper - he is to be called upon to show cause to a person who has already made up his mind that he has been guilty of sedition. Unless the Deputy Postmaster-General has so made up <inline font-weight="bold">Ms mind,</inline> why should he call upon the proprietor of a newspaper to show cause, and why should he interfere with the transmission of the paper upon specific grounds unless he has made up his mind as to the guilt of the proprietor <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Surely we are not going to allow such, a loose condition of things that if a post-office official is merely suspicious and smells an offence he is to be allowed to drag a man up to show cause why his newspaper should not be struck off the register. I could understand it if cause bad to be shown to some independent authority, but the Deputy Postmaster-General must have prejudged the case if he thought it necessary to call upon the proprietor of the newspaper to show cause. The amendment proposed by the Prime Minister is an improvement, because it involves a certain interval for consideration ; but, if it is to become effective, cause should be shown to an independent authority, and not to the Deputy Postmaster-General. </para>

                <para>Mr.REID. - I am not here to suggest anything, but to scrutinize measures submitted by the Government and to point out their defects, if any. I am quite sensible of the abuses we have in our minds and which ought not to be encouraged, but, in dealing with these delicate matters, the House must be guided by broad sound principles, or else we may discredit the very object we have in view. I think it revolts natural justice to put in any measure a provision that the official authority, who is the first person to stop a paper, and who has to reach such a state of opinion with reference to it that he considers it necessary to call upon the proprietor to show cause, should be the sole judge as to whether his action in calling upon the proprietor to show cause was right or wrong. If the Deputy Postmaster-General decided that the paper was not indecent or obscene, he would be passing a vote of censure upon his own judgment - he would be practically called upon to eat his own words. No judicial authority should be placed in that position if we can avoid it. Then the official of the Post-office becomes a judge who has power to attach a very serious stigma to a paper and to its proprietor, and that should not be. If the Government can suggest some method of procedure by which the opinion of a Judge can be obtained in a speedy way, I think it will be a distinct improvement. Under certain circumstances, persons can go before a Judge and obtain his decision without submitting to any of those long delays which are a scandal in connexion with the administration of justice, and I would suggest that the Government should endeavour to find some method of requiring cause to be shown before some independent authority. This would remove the main objection to the clause. Now, with reference to damages, I think that what is provided is a perfectly fair thing, but I would like to point out that it heightens the importance of the objection to which I have just referred. It is all very well to say that there is the right of appeal against the refusal of the Postmaster-General to transmit a newspaper through the post or against his action in striking a newspaper off the registered list. Now, the removal of a newspaper from the registered list would be a very serious thing for the owner of a newspaper, and it becomes all the more important that some judicial authority should decide these matters, because if a judicial authority had the decision of them I do not see where the damages would come in. If, however, an official of the. Post-office should decide them on his own judgment, the country might be exposed to enormous claims for damages upon the reversal of the original decision on appeal. Instead of the round-about course that is proposed by the Prime Minister, which involves the risk of a possible mistake on the part of an official, the matter might be taken before a Judge in the first instance, and finally decided, and then there would be no claim for damages, because a decision would be given for which the public would not be responsible, in the same way as if it were given by mistake on the part of a post-office official. If the Government would make this change they would protect themselves against claims for damages, and would give greater confidence to the public. However anxious the public may be to suppress indecency, they are very jealous of official interference with the freedom of the press, and under these circumstances, we have to be doubly careful that the steps we propose to take are within the broad lines of judicial decision. Judicial decisions silence all clamour, whereas official decisions may be the subject of strong prejudice in the minds of certain persons, lt might be Said that an official was acting against a certain paper, because it bitterly attacked certain public men, but all criticisms of that kind are silenced when we proceed to the seat of justice. If decisions were given <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> an authority apart from the department concerned, the great body of the community would be perfectly satisfied that there had been no official meddling owing to some feeling or influence, and the more we keep these things free from suspicion, the better it is for the community generally, and for the Government of the day. The time taken up in laying the matter before a Judge in the first instance, would not be greater than that occupied in the case of an appeal to a Judge, and therefore, it is better to start with a Judge in the first instance, than to submit the matter to an official&#39;s decision, which might be reviewed before a Judge. The appeal would involve going into the whole matter over again, with the possibility of a reversal of the original decision, which might seriously prejudice the department. Then again, however excellent a post-office official might be, it would be unfair to put upon him the responsibility of deciding these matters.  His  competency does not rest upon his judgment regarding matters of obscenity or blasphemy - he is not there for that purpose - and it is unfair to make him a judge in such matters. The definitions read by the Prime Minister only show how difficult it would be to define blasphemy, and so far from simplifying the matter, the definitions he gave render the matter immensely more difficult. With reference to sedition and blasphemy I have very great difficulty as to the insertion of those words in the Bill. I think that we might regard the postal authorities in England, with the enormous experience they have had, as a very good guide for us in framing our new laws. I see that the words in the British Act are &#34; indecent, obscene, libellous, or grossly offensive.&#34; I would rather have those words than the words seditious or blasphemous, although &#34;grossly offensive&#34; is pretty wide. I do not think our Bill is an improvement on that. My experience of these attempts to deal with what are called sedition and blasphemy is that they are the best ways that could possibly be devised of spreading sedition and blasphemy. The experience of the world has always shown that the worst cause only needs to be persecuted to become a living cause and a powerful cause, and the aim of modern legislation is, whilst administering justice, to avoid anything which seems to fetter the absolute freedom of human expression. I would suggest in regard to the clause- which gives rise to these points- </para>

                    <para>--! think that a great deal of the debate on,, this question has taken place under a misapprehension. It has been suggested that, this clause is more stringent than anything; of the kind in the laws of other countries. So far as I have been able to ascertain,, however, similar, powers are contained in. nearly every Postal Act. </para>

                        <para>- No. At the-. Postal Convention, which governs the postal rules of the whole of the civilized world, there was an agreement to make provision of this sort. The English Act is much more arbitrary than the Bill. The Post-office in England may absolutely stop the postage of a newspaper containing indecent, obscene, libellous, or grossly offensive matter, and there is no such right of. appeal as we propose to give. The English Act goes on to say that the decision of the Postmaster-General in these matters shall he final. The proposal made by the Prime Minister will be to the advantage of the public. If a newspaper is stopped by a political authority there should be some redress for the proprietor who feels aggrieved. </para>

                        <para>- I do not object to that. This is not a question of interfering with a man&#39;s liberty of speech, but it is a question whether we are going to subsidize publications of the kind aimed at by the clause by carrying them through the post at a tithe of the rates charged for the transmission of books. That is the whole point of this debate. In all post-offices the Postmaster-General has absolute control over his department. With the safeguards suggested by the Prime Minister we need have no fear of hardship being inflicted on individuals from political or other motives. I think, however, that the words relating to &#34; seditious and blasphemous &#34; writing should come out. They are extremely difficult to interpret. The Post-office in America cannot carry any articles of an obscene or immoral character ; and I think it is right that this power should rest with the Postmaster-General. I do not consider that, as in England, the Postmaster-G general should be able to despoil a man of his business, and, perhaps, for the time being, of his character, without incurring any responsibility. There should -be some right of appeal on the part of the person who feels aggrieved, and the Government should take the fullest responsibility for its action. There should be the fullest right of compensation, to be determined by the ordinary legal process. If that be provided for, the safeguard is only a reasonable one. </para>

I naturally assumed that under the Prime Minister&#39;s proposed amendment the publisher of a newspaper would have the right to show cause to a Supreme Court Judge, and if he will amend his proposal in that direction, and also provide that a Supreme Court Judge shall decide the question whether or not an offending newspaper shall be removed from the register the committee should accept the amendment. Our desire is that in the event of the court refusing to indorse the action of the Postmaster-General, or of the Deputy Postmaster-General, then the proprietor of the newspaper in question should be entitled to recover damages and costs in respect to any interim damages accruing between the stoppage and the award of the court. The Prime Minister&#39;s amendment, however, comes after sub-clause (5), and it has been taken to refer only to damages accruing under the powers exercised by virtue of sub-clauses (3) and (4). </para>

                    <para>- I think that the amendment of the right honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, ought to be accepted. Under the operation of this clause the Deputy Postmasters-General are the only persons who can really decide the question of what is seditious or blasphemous. The interpretation clauses do not say whether the Deputy Postmasters-General include the Postmaster-General. Therefore, although the former could exercise this authority the latter could not. In England there was only one Star Chamber, but under this provision we are to have six, because we are to have a Deputy Postmaster-General in each State, and the whole of whom are to be vested with power to determine what is seditious, blasphemous, indecent, or obscene. They are not subject to any controlling head, and can deal with the matter absolutely. An anomaly which might arise under this provision is that a publication might be refused transmission through the post in one State, but not in other States. I think that the further amendment proposed by the leader of the Opposition, in which he lays it down that the court should be the final arbiter, ought to be adopted. It has been said that similar clauses to these are to be found in the Victorian Postal Act. Upon looking up that statute I find that such is not the case, because if the Postmaster-General of the State of Victoria unwarrantably  interfered with the free circulation of a newspaper, the person aggrieved would have the right of action against him. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. REID</inline>(East Sydney). - I would point out the danger contained in the proposal with reference to taking a newspaper off the list of registered newspapers. On the assumption that a newspaper is removed by the Deputy Postmaster-General from the list of registered newspapers, the person aggrieved may appeal to a Judge, and there must be an investigation. The result of that investigation may be the reversal of the act, and the giving of damages to the aggrieved person. It would be infinitely better, in the interests of the department, not to put the official in the position of an authority who can call upon the proprietor of a newspaper to show cause before a Judge in Chambers,, why his newspaper should not be taken off. Then the question of damages would not arise, because a Judge would &#34;decide, and the official would be removed from a very invidious position. I feel so satisfied that the Government will adopt my suggestion that I am willing to allow the clause to pass in its present form, and to trust to them to reconsider it when it is recommitted. </para>

If such a provision had been operating in Tasmania last year, this House would have been deprived of my services. Are these bigoted Chinese Deputy Postmasters-General to be the interpreters of what is grossly offensive&#39;? I have had to fight my way everywhere that I have. been. I have been charged with all sorts of crimes. Every man who has risen out of the ordinary ruck of social respectability and moral degeneration is offensive. It seems to me that nowadays everybody is trying to get a certificate of character from the ordinary intellect-decaying nonentities of the ranks of so-called respectability. I want to oppose that. I am opposed to the retention of the words &#34; grossly offensive.&#34; </para>
                <para>Mr.RE ID (East Sydney).- It is really a conundrum what the words &#34; grossly offensive,&#34; can mean in such a connexion. &#34; Indecent and obscene &#34; matter must be &#34; grossly offensive &#34; to any well-regulated mind. I ask if it is wise to give this power to take a newspaper off the list of registered newspapers at the Post-office, if it is not an indecent or obscene publication, but simply an offensive one <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The association in which the words &#34; grossly offensive &#34; occur, suggests that they must mean something very nearly within the category of indecency. </para>
                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BARTON</inline>(Hunter- Minister for External Affairs). - One of the reasons why we should adhere to this form is that the form used in the English Act - with the exception of the word &#34;libellous,&#34; which I have omitted - was asked to be inserted in place of the words &#34; blasphemous and seditious,&#34; which were originally in the Bill. It was in consequence of remarks which were made by the right honorable and learned member for East Sydney, in which he expressed a preference for the words of the English Act, that I said I would be equally content to adopt those words. That course having been followed, I think that what amounts to an implied arrangement ought to be carried out. The course which has been pursued virtually amounts to an understanding, &#39;and it would be only fair to insert these words which it was claimed would effect everything that the Government desired that the clause should effect. It was expressly said that what the Government aimed at in the clause could substantially be reached by adopting the form of the English Act. I am not going to discuss the enormous amount of latitude which exists in the interpretation of what is indecent, obscene, or grossly offensive. That is a matter which common sense can and does settle, and if it is to be subject to an appeal - whether with damages or not, but with damages if this form of the clause is retained - I feel perfectly sure that the provision will warrant the approval of the committee. </para>

There was no compact, but I simply threw out the suggestion that I would rather have the words in the English Act than the others. I am acting up to the spirit of that view by not pressing any amendment, but I think it my duty to point out that I did not approve directly of the words now proposed. </para>

                    <para>- I think that these words are likely to lead to a good deal of trouble. I remember a case which occurred in Queensland at a time when feeling was running pretty high in connexion with a leading financial institution there. One paper published a cartoon, and as a gentleman connected with the institution referred to regarded it as grossly offensive, he brought the matter before the Supreme Court. Although he was not successful in getting a verdict or suppressing the issue of the paper containing the cartoon, it cost the proprietors of the journal about &#163;120 or &#163;130 to defend themselves. The question is who is to decide what is grossly offensive. If a statement which was grossly offensive to any one man might be taken as bringing a paper within the reach of the law, I think that this clause would be very objectionable. It is all very well to say that we must trust to a little common sense being exercised, but we know that good old common sense often runs mad. I think the words ought to be left out. </para>

                    <para>- I presume from the statement made by the Minister in charge of the Bill that honorable members will have an opportunity of reviewing the clause when it is amended, so that we may see what its full effect will be and make any alterations or additions that seem to us to be required. I think it is important that we should have this opportunity, because the amendments may be more far-reaching in their effect than the words for which they are being substituted. Whilst we are laying so much stress upon the desirableness of stopping newspapers containing obscene or indecent matter from passing through the post, we have overlooked the fact that the mere stoppage of a few hundreds or thousands of newspapers from passing through the Post-office will not in any way affect the distribution of similar newspapers all over the States by other means. This seems to point to the conclusion that a Postal Bill is not the right place in which to deal with a question of this kind. If we desired to suppress the distribution of obscene or indecent literature there should be a means of doing it by process of common law. We are attaching altogether too much importance to the mere prevention of this matter from passing through the post. A great deal of our time might have been saved if this particular matter had not been introduced in this Bill at all, but had been dealt with separately under a law which would not only stop circulation through the post, but absolutely prohibit the publication of such papers. </para>

                        <para>- I am inclined to think that the States themselves have full power to deal with such questions, and, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the powers given under section 51 of the Constitution Act to legislate for the peace and good order of the Commonwealth, might be held to include the suppression of indecent publications in the same way as they have been held to include the suppression of gambling through the Post-office. I do not suggest that that is the proper way of dealing with the matter, but it seems to me that one course would be just as justifiable as the other. </para>

                    <para>- I trust that the committee will fully consider the meaning of the words &#34;grossly offensive.&#34; They might be made to include almost anything in the way of adverse criticism. I know of a case within the Commonwealth in which a Deputy Postmaster-General is the subject of very severe criticism by the press. He is continually described as incapable, and he is often spoken of as stupid, and he would no doubt regard such criticism, which perhaps is very rude, as grossly offensive to him, at any rate. It has been pointed out to the Prime Minister that any one who had a cause of grievance against the Postmaster-General might appeal to the Law Courts, but there is no certainty as to the interpretation the Law Courts might place upon the words &#34; grossly offensive,&#34; and as the insertion of the words in the clause might tend to restrict the right of free criticism, I think they should be omitted. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the amendment would make the clause very much worse than it is. I have known a number of things published in newspapers which would have come under the definition of &#34; grossly offensive.&#34; There is no end to such things, as articles appear in the papers every day that are grossly offensive to some individual. Where we see one case of obscene or blasphemous or seditious matter being published, there are hundreds of cases in which language which might be termed grossly offensive is used, and I shall vote against the insertion of these words. </para>

                    <para>- But I would point out that all over the world it is the political head who exercises this power. Is it not worth considering whether the right of the Postmaster-General to control the transmission of these publications should be taken from him? I do not think that a Deputy Postmaster-General will be as wise in the exercise of his discretion - at any rate, I doubt if he will be as wide. If this power is put absolutely into the hands of Deputy Postmasters-General, it is more likely to be exercised than if it is allowed to belong exclusively to the Postmaster-General. Although honorable members may wish to remove the exercise of the power from political influence, I would rather trust its exercise to the Postmaster-General than to the various Deputy Postmasters-General. All over the world it is the Postmasters-General who &#91;have the power to interdict the transmission of objectionable literature. But, according to my reading of the clause, we are vesting the power exclusively in the Deputy Postmasters-General. </para>

                    <para>- These sub-clauses must be read in conjunction. We must all realize that the size of the Commonwealth renders it impossible for the Postmaster-General to have complete knowledge of everything that is transpiring in his department in each of the States. This discretionary power to refuse to transmit or deliver certain publications may well be left in the hands of the Deputy Postmasters-General. A Deputy Postmaster-General has something to lose, and is not likely to be swayed by any religious or political feeling. He will know perfectly well that his retention of office depends on the manner in which he administers his department. It would be impossible to have it otherwise. </para>

                    <para>- I think the words proposed to be introduced will defeat the object of the clause. The clause, if amended as proposed, will mean that a Deputy Postmaster-General may refuse to transmit any &#34; issue &#34; of a publication if that issue contains objectionable matter. It is not the practice of a Deputy Postmaster-General or his staff to read every issue of a newspaper going through his office. It is not till after an objectionable publication has been transmitted that the public begin to realize that it is indecent or obscene; then it comes to the Postmaster-General&#39;s knowledge, and he takes action. If the provision is that he may refuse to distribute a. particular issue no good will be done. We might as well tell a boy to lock the door of a stable after he finds the horse has been stolen. I would suggest that the clause may be left as passed by the other House. I understand the Prime Minister does not approve of striking out the words &#34; seditious &#34; or &#34; blasphemous.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I quite well understand the feeling of the Prime Minister in the circumstances ; still I think these words &#34;seditious&#34; and &#34;blasphemous&#34; are not necessary from the public stand-point. Experience has shown that the word &#34; seditious &#34; is oftentimes misunderstood. Within the last month the Victorian Government have treated as seditious an article which, however lamentable in tone and taste, had no more of sedition in it than this Bill contains. That shows that there is a complete misapprehension, even in the mind of responsible Ministers, as to the meaning of the word. These words have already been omitted from subclause (1), and to be consistent they should be left out of sub-clause (3). I think that the words &#34;indecent&#34; and &#34;obscene&#34; are quite sufficient to cover anything that is unreasonably blasphemous. The proposed amendment should not be pressed, and I would also suggest that we adhere consistently to what we have already done in committee, by omitting the words &#34;seditious&#34; and &#34;blasphemous.&#34; </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BARTON</inline>(Hunter- Minister for External Affairs). - I cannot consent to the suggestion&#39; made by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. To my mind it is quite plain that there ought to be some greater safeguard, and there ought to have been in the first subclause some words more comprehensive than those referring to obscenity or indecency. To stop the passage of obscene and indecent matter, through the post, or to stop the registration of newspapers containing such matter, and not to take similar action in regard to matter posted by those who, against all good faith and for perfectly injurious and wicked motives, attempt to overturn the form of government in existence, or to insult the religious convictions of their neighbours, which after all do them no harm, is a serious omission. As to the words &#34;grossly offensive,&#34; we were repeatedly appealed to last night to use the words in the English Act. This afternoon the leader of the Opposition practically appealed -to me in the same way. Whatever he may have had in reserve in his mind, he created in my mind the belief that he would support the addition of these words. I was so careful that I should not take any word from the English Act, which was subject to too much question, that I did not move the insertion of the word &#34; libellous,&#34; because I have been of opinion that it is not well to trust a political authority to determine- what is libellous and what is not. That is an objection which does not apply to matters which are not the subject of politics. The understanding on which I relied, rightly or wrongly, has led to the Bill losing, in my opinion, a certain portion of its effectiveness, and without making too much of a complaint about it, it will certainly cause me - and justly, I think honorable members will see - to be a little more thoughtful and cautious in the future, lt may be that 1 have been precipitate. If so it is my own fault, but I do not mean to be precipitate again. As the words in the English Act were not adopted, I think the right course to pursue will be to adhere to the words in the clause originally. To stop one issue of a newspaper from going through the post is not so severe as to remove the newspaper altogether from the register. It may possibly be thought that a definition which is a little more drastic would be a little more applicable to this clause than it is to one which contains so severe a penalty as the removal of a newspaper from the register, subject, of course, to the approval of a Judge. The provisions of sub-clause (2) are subject to appeal, and when the appeal provision is arrived at, honorable members will see that I am proposing an amendment - partly because of the very thoughtful suggestion of the honorable member for Indi - even wider than I originally intended, so that a Judge on appeal may be able to do complete justice between the parties. As things stand, I feel that we ought to adhere to the words as they appear in the clause. I think seriously, and very seriously, about this question. I was almost going to say that it matters very little to me whether there is a majority one way or the other. It is a matter, however, of large extent to me in that I consider the good fame of the Commonwealth is largely involved in a decision of this kind. I am quite ready to make every allowance for the views of those who differ from me ; but, holding that view myself, I do think that this matter ought to be put to the vote. If these words were negatived without a division I should feel myself placed, as the leader of the House, in a very extreme position, because I should consider that for want of publication of a list of that division, I was implicated in a decision which I could in no circumstances approve. I ask the support of the committee in retaining these words, and that without for an instant impugning the equal patriotism of those who take a different view. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Prime Minister&#39;s recollection of this matter is twisted. It will not do for the right honorable and learned gentleman to make imputations, and then expect honorable members upon whom they are made to remain silent. I propose to show that this imputation is an utterly undeserved one. We were discussing in a broad way these words when, of the two sets, I expressed my preference for the English words. But I was expressing my objection to the words &#34; seditious and blasphemous &#34; altogether. I wish the Prime Minister to remember that those words were absolutely disapproved of by many honorable members on this side of the House. I directed my remarks to showing that I thought it most ill-advised to insert those words. Under these circumstances the English words were mentioned, and I at once said that I preferred them to the words &#34; seditious and blasphemous.&#34; But as to there being an agreement that honorable members would tie up their political consciences and vote against their convictions, that is a ridiculous position to assume. The Prime Minister will recollect that I pointed out the strange position which these words occupied in reference to those which went before. I think that a &#34; blasphemous &#34; publication might fairly be held to come within the category of an &#34; indecent &#34; publication, because if any publication is one which, shocks the moral sense of the community its circulation ought to be prohibited. As to words &#34;or grossly offensive character,&#34; they could only include &#34; sedition and blasphemy &#34; if the word &#34; in- decent &#34; had a similar relation to them, because it is a well-known rule of construction that words of a general character which follow precise words are always to be construed with reference to those precise words. There is scarcely a word in our language with a wider meaning than the word &#34; in decent.&#34; What the Prime Minister really wants to get in the Bill, it seems to me, is contained in that word. But if he has a fondness for the words &#34; seditious &#34; and &#34;blasphemous,&#34; of course, after the appeal which he has made to his supporters, they are bound to rally round him. It is, therefore, highly probable that his view will be adopted. There will not &#34;be the slightest consistency, however, in the Bill if this amendment be made. It will then wear the extraordinary aspect that the Federal Parliament has laid it down that if a newspaper is merely &#34;blasphemous or &#34; seditious,&#34; it cannot be taken off the file of registered newspapers, but if it is &#34;indecent&#34; or &#34; grossly offensive,&#34; it can. I think that the words which we already have cover those which the Prime Minister desires. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that the Prime Minister has taken up an altogether unjustifiable position in asking the committee to agree to retain in the clause words which he previously admitted were not at all necessary. He has stated that the good fame of the Commonwealth is at stake in this matter, but, really, I think he is making too much of this matter. No State postal law has ever contained the words which the Prime Minister says are necessary in this Bill, and, presumably, if they are necessary to prevent the fair fame of the Commonwealth from being besmirched, the fair fame of the States must have been besmirched right up to the present time. One definition of sedition that has been given by the Prime Minister is the promulgation of doctrines which are directed at overturning our present form of Government, but I would point out that we hear such doctrines preached in our parks and from, our platforms, and no one ever thinks of taking action, because it is recognised that free speech affords the very best safety valve for the feelings of the people. There is practically no difference so far as this matter is concerned between the promulgation of such doctrines by a newspaper and their advocacy from the platform, and I do not see that there is any necessity for any drastic legislation. According to the Prime Minister a paper that advocated republicanism would be a seditious paper, and that seems to me to be a very extraordinary position to take up, although personally opposed to the republican system of government. Our monarchical system of government ought to be strong enough to withstand any republican journals, and I do not for a moment suppose that any one would dream of stopping the circulation, either through the post or otherwise, of such a newspaper. In regard to blasphemy the position is very much the same. The religious convictions of the people ought to be proof against injury from any blasphemous publication. It has been suggested that now that the Prime Minister has used his whip, we may expect some honorable members who voted on this side in the last division to reverse their votes, but I shall have entirely mistaken the quality of the honorable members sitting on the Government side who voted against the amendment which has just been negatived if they yield to any such influence. I believe that those honorable members voted from conviction, which the mere expression of opinion from the Prime Minister &#39;will not make them reverse. With regard to seditious matter, it may be argued that a fit of hysteria may come over the Postal department in the same way that it came over the Premier of Victoria recently when he took action regarding certain so-called seditious&#39; matter that was published in a Melbourne paper. We know now that the right honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> advised the Premier of Victoria not to take the matter too seriously. With regard to all this so-called seditious literature, more injury will be done by any attempts to prevent its free transmission through the post than would be done by abstaining from interference with it. I would point out that the probability is that the attention of the Postmaster-General will not be called to the fact of a newspaper &#34;containing objectionable matter until long after the paper has been transmitted through the post and has become public property. Therefore, any action that he may take will be absolutely futile to prevent the circulation of the objectionable matter. I do not see any reason for reversing the decision that the committee has already come to. The&#34; vote which was given on the former division was a thoroughly representative one, and honorable members cannot reverse their votes now without completely stultifying themselves. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that the Prime Minister has taken so much exception to the action of- the committee in striking out the words &#34;seditious&#34; and &#34; blasphemous.&#34; I voted for the amendment, because I think it is well for us not to take wider powers under the Bill than the experience of the States has proved to be necessary. We have not had &#39; these words in our State Acts, and why then should we put them into this Bill ? If it could be shown that they were necessary, I should be in favour of retaining them, and I feel sure that if it is necessary at any future time to make more stringent provision, the Parliament will support the Government in making it. I take it, however, that the people of Australia are not more likely to send seditious or blasphemous literature through the Post-office in the future than they have been hitherto, and therefore &#91;shall vote for the retention of existing conditions. But I have a right to act in that way without being accused, either directly or by imputation, of doing something which is likely to cause the fair fame of Australia to be besmirched. After all, the matter is not highly important, and the whole trouble has been caused by the endeavour of the Government to take greater powers than have hitherto been found necessary. </para>

As the dissemination of such literature cannot be prevented if we wait until an issue has gone through the Post-office, we must give the Deputy Postmasters-General power to stop it at once. </para>

We can punish, under the provisions of another measure, persons who publish obscene, or indecent, or blasphemous matter, but I object to such provisions overloading this Bill. We are giving certain postal privileges to newspapers, and we say to newspaper proprietors that, in order to have these privileges, they must keep their columns free from matter offensive to the general public or destructive to our system of government. I am strongly in favour of preventing the transmission of seditious matter through the Post-office. </para>

I shall vote for the retention of the words &#34; seditious&#34; and &#34;blasphemous,&#34; and I very much regret that the committee decided on a previous occasion to alter the provision in any particular. I hope that the words will be retained in sub-clause (3), and that subsequently the clause will be recommitted to bring it in harmony with it. I deeply regret, however, that the matter has not been discussed without the introduction of party feeling, and I am sorry that honorable members, who have occupied high and distinguished positions in the other States, should bring into this Federal Parliament their old differences and disputes. I was one of those who looked for a higher and purer atmosphere in the Federal Legislature, and I am confident the community will regret the perpetuation of these old quarrels. I admit that the blame cannot be confined to one side of the House only; but I do hope we may not see a continuance of this practice. </para>

The fact that a newspaper contains in one issue something which might come under the heading of sedition or blasphemy should not debar the issue of subsequent publications in accordance with law. I think, however, that we should place this power in the hands of the Postmaster-General instead of the Deputy Postmaster-General, and if the honorable gentleman in charge of the Bill will withdraw his amendment <inline font-style="italic">proforma</inline> I will move to that effect. </para>

For the benefit of. some honorable members I would say that this matter was fully discussed before dinner, and there was a consensus of opinion, led by the. leader of the Opposition, that it would be very unwise indeed to cast this duty upon the Postmaster-General, who might be permanently resident in Sydney, Melbourne, or Bombala. In deference to their own leader, honorable members of the Opposition gave up the objection which the honorable and learned member for Werriwa has resumed. I hope the honorable and learned member will not consider that there is any want of courtesy on my part. I would remind &#34;him that the clause is . to be recommitted, and that it will then be in a form different from that which it now presents. </para>

The point now raised was never considered. It was simply a question whether the Postmaster-General or the court should deal with these matters. The question raised by the honorable and learned member for Werriwa is a very important one. A Postmaster-General might bring pressure to bear in a secret way upon a weak deputy, and after that officer had taken action, wash his hands of the whole affair. He could say that he had nothing to do with it, and point out that he had no power to take action, inasmuch as that power was vested by the Act in the Deputy Postmaster-General. I believe that the Postmaster-General should be responsible for any action on the part of his deputies, whereas under the provisions of this clause lie may come down to the House and disclaim all responsibility. </para>

The position is that as a matter of courtesy in debate, an amendment is always withdrawn, to enable an honorable member who desires to move a prior amendment to test the feeling of the committee upon it. It would save time, I think, if the Minister, as an act of grace, allowed the honorable member to do what he desires at this stage of the discussion. </para>

                    <para>- I would suggest to the Minister the wisdom of adopting the course suggested. We all recognise the difficulty in which the Government may be placed if any honorable member on this side of the House objected to an amendment being withdrawn. By resorting to such tactics, Bill after Bill could be absolutely blocked. We do not wish to bring about any such condition of things. We merely desire to have fair debate. I understand from the honorable member for Parramatta that he wishes to move an amendment in order to place this power beyond the Deputy Postmasters-General. </para>

He told honorable members, out of the mouth of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Fitz-James Stephen, that the question is whether matter written with the object of upsetting a Government - which is sedition - is written in good faith or not. If this criticism of a Government, intended to subvert that Government, be written in good faith, then it is not to be deemed sedition. Therefore, it becomes a question not only of determining what is sedition, but whether the author is guilty of a dishonest intention in what he writes. There are no such words as sedition or blasphemy in the English Post-office Act, and to make a departure by inserting these words would have a very dangerous effect, in imposing on the Post-office authorities a responsibility which they should not be asked to bear, and which in all probability they would not be qualified to discharge. </para>

                    <para>- I rise to speak chiefly on account of a little misunderstanding which occurred this afternoon. I voted against the proposal to insert the words &#34; grossly offensive &#34; instead of the words &#34;seditious and blasphemous &#34; on what I conceived to be the good ground that the term &#34;grossly offensive&#34; was a most ridiculous one, and much more dangerous than those already in the Bill. I could understand how we might have a misdemeanour coming under the head of blasphemy or sedition, notwithstanding the difficult}&#39; of defining those terms, but I conceived that still greater difficulty would occur in defining such a vague term as &#34;grossly offensive.&#34; Prior to the clause being considered in detail I stated that I had not the slightest objection to the retention of the words &#34;blasphemous or seditious,&#34; but that I had a grave objection to putting such power as was proposed into the hands of the Post-office officials without safeguarding the rights of the people of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister has now met my objection on that point to a certain extent by undertaking to safeguard the rights . of the public, and to give those who may consider themselves aggrieved by the action of the Postmaster-General a right of appeal, and also the light to recover damages. As I hold that there are such misdemeanours as blasphemy and sedition, I think the Commonwealth should be guarded against carrying blasphemous or seditious documents through its Post-office.. I could mention expressions which would be distinctly blasphemous, but which would&#39; not be necessarily obscene or indecent, and I think we should have the power to deal with such blasphemous expressions, always on the understanding that the Bill contains provisions which would safeguard the rights of people who may be falsely accused.. I intend to support the Government in retaining the words. The honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, pointed out that the words sedition and blasphemy were not in the English Act, but I think we must not be too closely guided by the English legislation, particularly when we find such a ridiculous expression as &#34; grossly offensive &#34; occurring in the Imperial Postal Act. Moreover we have to remember that England is a country self-governed, and that she can take action in some other form if she chooses to deal with cases, of blasphemy. The Commonwealth, however,, has not unlimited power in this respect,, and I do not know that we could take&#39; action to prohibit the printing and publication of blasphemous or seditious documents.. AVe are now, however, dealing with the Post-office, and we are fully justified in taking action to prevent the Commonwealth Post-office from conveying, either free or at a low rate of postage, indecent, obscene,, blasphemous, or seditious writings. Although I cannot, without fouling my mouth,, give an illustration of what might be considered a blasphemous statement, which at the same time could not be construed as indecent or obscene, it would be easy to give an illustration of sedition that would be plain to us all. Imagine a strike, such as frequently occurs in coal mines or in connexion with other large industrial enterprises, and some man publishing a paper and telling the strikers that the only way they could obtain redress was by taking up arms:. That would be sedition. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that I cannot take the advice of the Minister in charge of the Bill. With me this is a matter of faith. We can look at the history of Ireland and read of the thousands of her peoples whose hones are sleeping in the silent bivouac of the dead, as the result of the laws enforced against sedition. Some of my ancestors in Ireland are now in graves which are not marked by tombstones, in consequence of the improper interpretation of these words &#34;seditious and blasphemous.&#34; They had died fighting against a tyrannical Government that usurped the rights of the people. The British Empire has abolished the old antiquated ideas of blasphemy and sedition, and yet it is proposed that this enlightened Federal Parliament should put them into this clause, so that we may have a taste of tyranny in this Southern Hemisphere. Did any one ever hear of a man thinking with a sword over his head, or with a gun at his ear. If we want thinkers we do not want to shut people up, and we must not tyrannise over them. Blasphemy is what the dying call the growing. Sedition -is the expression of something which is opposed to generally accepted ideas. I hope the committee will stand firm on this question, and that they will not permit the freedom of the people to be taken from them, but that they will send blasphemy and sedition where memory forgets and oblivion remembers. </para>

                    <para>- I shall vote for the excision of these words, because they are words of very wide significance, and capable of very diverse interpretation by those who may happen to be in charge of the various State branches of the Postal department. It seems to me that the matter with which we are trying to deal is one which should be dealt with in a measure- &#39; relating to newspapers rather than in a. Postal Bill. As the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Malley,</inline> has said, it is nobthe <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning: Herald,</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline><inline font-style="italic">Courier,</inline> that will be stopped under the clause ; it is the little papers which are fighting for the rights of the masses. When I was running a little newspaper which was fighting against the opinions of the powers that were, they raked, up an obsolete statute of George III.-, or George IV., and compelled all newspaper proprietors to register, and to enter into a bond with Her Majesty, in the sum of .&#163;300, and to find two sureties for a. like amount, against the publication of blasphemy or seditious libel. It was only when the labour papers began to spring up that this musty statute was taken from the. shelves, because it was thought that the proprietors of small papers would not be able to find the sureties. </para>

                    <para>- I had not intended to say anything upon the clause, but, after the definitions of sedition which, have been given by the honorable members for Laanecoorie and South Sydney, I rise to say that I shall have no hesitation in voting against the retention of the words &#34;bias-: phemous  &#34; and &#34; seditious.&#34; We were told by the honorable member for Laanecoorie that sedition was simply attempting to subvert the form of government of which he was in favour. Personally I am not a republican, but if a man conscientiously believes in republicanism, I think he should have a right to express his views. According to the honorable member for South Sydney, if there were a strike, and a person advised the strikers to arm themselves with revolvers, that would be seditious. I would, however, direct the attention of the honorable member for South Sydney to an incident which occurred some years ago in the House of Commons, when, after a member of the Irish party had been arrested in Ireland for a speech he made there, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coneybeare</inline> rose and told the Attorney - General or the Solicitor - General of the day that he intended to repeat the same speech in London on the following evening. The reply given to him was that, if the effect of his speech was the same as that of the speech of the Irish member, he would be arrested. He re-delivered the speech practically word for word, but I suppose the people whom he addressed took it as a joke, because he was not arrested. The decision of the Attorney-General was that it is not the words one uses, but their effect which constitutes sedition. I am not prepared to hand over the interpretation of the word sedition to the  Deputy  Postmasters-General. The definitions which have been given of the words to-night show that honorable members are hot agreed as to what is sedition. What is sedition to one man is gospel to some one else. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BROWN</inline>(Canobolas). - Earlier in the evening, when this matter was discussed at some length, the Prime Minister agreed to the elimination of the. words &#34;seditious&#34; and &#34; blasphemous &#34; from the previous sub-clause so that the words &#34;grossly offensive &#34; might be substituted ; but the committee, seeing how ridiculous the proposal was, decided in favour of the omission of the words, but against the proposal to substitute something else for them. I consider that those words were very properly omitted. The Prime Minister quoted a lot of legal jargon, with a view to defining the meaning of the terms, and left us even more confused than we were before; and other honorable members have similarly failed to satisfactorily define them. As the honorable member for Moreton has shown, when liberal labour newspapers were started in Queensland, a statute of George III. or George IV., which in the old country was buried long ago, was dug up to harass them. If the law of the day had been cast in the same mould as the retrogressive piece of legislation which we are now considering, there would have been no necessity for the resuscitation of that Act. I regret that in this twentieth century, in the newest democracy that the world has seen, Ministers are disposed to go back to the Dark Ages, and to revive the anti-democratic legislation of the past. I hope that the committee will strike out the words, and bring the sub-clause into harmony with the earlier sub-clause that we have passed. </para>
                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CONROY</inline>(Werriwa).- It ought not to be forgotten that these newspapers are not to be transmitted through the post in an open way. If there is anything seditious or blasphemous on the outside, clause 38 will deal with them, and I thoroughly approve of leaving that power to the Postmaster-General. I think, however, that the determination of what is seditious or blasphemous should be left solely to the Court. As the name of the publisher is on the newspaper there need be no fear of his escaping punishment. If he publishes anything that is seditious or blasphemous he ought to be punished by the Court in the usual way. </para>

                        <para>-One of the great advantages of federal union promised by its advocates was that we were to have a uniform stamp. Such a stamp would certainly be a great convenience to those who live in our border towns. Now that the Commonwealth Government have assumed control of the Post-office, surely it is time that we had a federal stamp. I venture to say that it has come as a very great surprise to the community generally to find that the Government are hesitating about adopting the course which I now suggest. &#34;We have been told that the bookkeeping clauses will prevent the adoption of a uniform stamp for the Commonwealth, but I fail to see any substantial grounds for that objection. I am not asking that the postage should be uniform, because I recognise that a difficulty presents itself on account of Victoria having adopted the penny postage system. An interchangeable stamp would satisfy me. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that every State could have credited to it the stamps sold within its borders. There will be very few stamps purchased in one State and used outside of that State. But if a person travelled from Sydney to Adelaide it would be a matter of convenience to him to be able to post a letter in Adelaide with a Sydney stamp, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa,</inline> the difference which would be made to the revenue being very trivial indeed. It seems, indeed, from a controversy which has recently taken place, that the bookkeeping clauses are not the real difficulty in the way of the adoption of the course which I now suggest. The great difficulty is &#34; Tattersall &#34; of Tasmania. The <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> on Monday last, points out that the Postmaster-General in referring to some documents which he had received from Tasmania, says that the figures quoted by him in the Senate in this connexion had been exceeded by &#163;4,000. He stated in the other Chamber that the result of introducing an interchangeable stamp would mean a difference of &#163;10,000 to Tasmania. Owing to communications between himself and the Deputy Postmaster-General of Tasmania, he found that these figures were exceeded by &#163;4,000. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> goes on to state that but for &#34; Tattersall&#39;s &#34; it would be possible to introduce interchangeable stamps much sooner than there now seems any prospect of doing. I cannot say whether that is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake&#39;s</inline> opinion or the opinion of his interviewer ; but it reads as if it were <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake&#39;s</inline> opinion. To me it seems playing pretty low down to suggest that the Commonwealth Government have to depend on &#34; Tattersall &#34; to the extent of saying whether they will introduce an interchangeable stamp or not. It is rather an added argument why we should destroy &#34; Tattersall&#39;s &#34; sweeps. One of the telegrams stated that &#34;Tattersall&#34; was to be consulted. It is rather humiliating that he should be consulted before an answer can be given in such a matter. I am not at this particular stage asking for the adoption of a uniform telegraphic rate; but that is a thing which most certainly ought to follow. 1 understand it is possible for the bookkeeping period provided for in the Constitution to be renewed at the end of five years. If that be so we may have to wait ten, fifteen, or twenty years before we can get this very necessary reform. I venture to say that the people generally expected that as soon as the Federal Government took charge of the Postal department, we should have the advantage of a uniform or interchangeable stamp. </para>

                    <para>- If we look at this matter with a microscope, there may seem to be some technical difficulty about having a uniform stamp, hut when we come to consider the operations of business, there would be a very slight variation in the results, as compared with what they are under the present system. There are very few people who trouble themselves about postage stamps when they are moving from one State to another, and certainly great inconvenience is experienced, now that the Commonwealth is united, in having six different kinds of stamps. It is an unnatural state of affairs, and it should not be allowed to prevail longer than necessary. I do not wish to see anything put into the Bill to bind the Government, but 1 would rather make my observations in the form of an appeal to the Prime Minister, that the difficulties about bookkeeping, should not be allowed to stand in the way of making this change. </para>

                        <para>- Then I do not see the necessity for mentioning it; We do not intend to keep our Commonwealth accounts as a grocer would keep his books. Our accounts ought to be kept on a &#34; give and take &#34; principle, and a few pounds one way or the other should not be worthy of the consideration of the Commonwealth Government or of a Commonwealth State. I hope, therefore, that the Government will give themselves the pleasure and satisfaction of making this change. I would look upon it as a great distinction if&#39; I had an opportunity of initiating a Commonwealth stamp. I do not think that a Bill is the proper place to deal with a matter for Executive action, but I strongly support the object that the honorable member for the Barrier has in view, and I hope the Government will speedily bring this change about. </para>

                    <para>. - I would ask the honorable member for the Barrier not to press his amendment to the vote. He may rely perfectly upon the desire - more than that, the determination - of this Government to issue Commonwealth stamps as soon as we can get over any preliminary difficulties that may stand in the way. There is one difficulty, as has been pointed out, in connexion with the bookkeeping clauses of the Constitution Act. For my own part, although that matter has been referred to a good deal in conversation and in press paragraphs I do not think that it forms such an insuperable obstacle as some people suppose. But, dealing quite fairly with the matter, I do admit that it rests . considerably upon the &#34;Tattersall&#39;s&#34; clauses in the Bill. Investigation has shown that the stamps which are forwarded in letters and which are placed on letters sent from Tasmania in connexion with &#34;Tattersall&#39;s&#34; sweeps, amount in value to &#163;14,000 a year. If the &#34;Tattersall&#34; sweep clauses of the Bill are not carried in their present form the revenue will be ear-marked, and will, therefore, have to be put to the credit of the revenue of Tasmania. If, however, the clauses are carried, we may be able to do something in the direction indicated by the honorable member at a very early date. I would ask my honorable friend not to put his proposal to the vote, because I do not think it is a kind of provision that ought to be in a Bill of this character, which should be composed of enactments of law, and not mere directions to the Executive. If the honorable member will take my assurance that - assuming the difficulty which now arises in connexion with &#34;Tattersall&#39;s&#34; sweep to be got rid of - as soon as departmental action can be taken it will be taken, for the issue of Commonwealth stamps, I think the general sense of the committee will be with me in asking him to refrain from pressing his proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad to hear it, because there was an impression that it was the bookkeeping clauses that created the difficulty. The Federal Government ought to be able to deal with this matter irrespective of &#34;Tattersall&#39;s,&#34; and an important change of this kind ought not to depend upon whether the Post-office is to be used for conducting racing sweeps. I will withdraw my amendment as it seems to be the general wish of the committee, but I am rather glad that the question has been raised, because we know now the full importance of the clauses dealing with &#34; Tattersall&#39;s &#34; sweeps. If it comes to a question as to whether we are to allow sweeps to be conducted through the Post-office, or to have interchangeable stamps, I will vote in favour of having interchangeable stamps. I think the committee will take it that the Prime Minister has assured us that if the &#34;Tattersall&#34; clauses are passed, there is a strong probability that before the year is out we shall have an interchangeable stamp. I am not asking for a uniform stamp, because there might be a difficulty about that owing to the large loss that might be incurred under a penny postage system. </para>

                    <para>- Power is taken under clause 93 to prescribe the form and mode of issuing licences for the sale of stamps, and the commission to be allowed. In remote towns where there are no post-offices, or in1 cases where the post offices are some miles away, it is a great convenience to the settlers that the local storekeepers should be licensed to sell stamps. In Western Australia licensed vendors are not permitted to buy stamps from the local postmaster, but are obliged to send to the General Post-office in Perth, pay the postage each way and the cost of registration, and take all the risks of the stamps being consumed by fire or lost in transit, all for the mere pittance of 6d. in the &#163;1. Why should local postmasters not be allowed to keep sufficient stamps in hand to supply licensed vendors as well as the public? There is no reason for the idiotic practice which prevails in Western Australia, and I ask the Prime Minister to see that is is not continued under the Commonwealth. Owing to losses sustained under the practice in Western Australia, storekeepers, who do not go into the business for the purpose of making money by it, but solely for the convenience of their customers, have given up selling stamps- </para>

I do not wish to move an amendment, but l submit that the clause should be modified. If it is necessary, as I think it is, to give the Postmaster-General power to stop anything which is manifestly obscene or indecent from going through the post, let the power be given in such a way that it will not include matter that may be held by the court to be innocent, and not used to punish any one not deserving of punishment. </para>

                    <para>- Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> provides that any postal article which has on the outside of it these offensive matters shall be deemed to be posted in contravention of the Act, and clause 39 provides that every postal article which is posted in contravention, of the Act, is to be transmitted without delay, by the postmaster receiving it, to the General Post-office. Then clause 41 goes on to say that blasphemous or obscene letters may be destroyed. There is considerable room in this paragraph for amendment. Unlike a newspaper, a letter, such as is referred to here, will convey libellous matter to the one person to whom it is addressed, and will affect that one person only. The difficulty of interpretation is aggravated by the fact that we have more new terms here. &#34;Blasphemous&#34; has added to it here the word &#34; profane,&#34; which means really very much the same thing, and we have also the word &#34; libellous.&#34; I maintain that a letter, even although it is said to contain libellous matter, ought to be transmitted without hesitation on the part of the postal authorities. Possibly it would not come within the ken of the authorities permitted to judge under the Bill. It would be dealt with hurriedly by some person unqualified to form an opinion, and who would be incompetent to give definitions of terms so difficult to define. I do not wish to assist in any way in making the Post-office a channel for anything which is infamous. I am quite prepared to accept in this paragraph anything which is capable of definition by&#39; the meanest, capacity. I think that anything obscene or indecent, but not anything that is libellous or profane, is capable of such definition. The Minister in charge of the Bill ought to pursue the course which the majority of the committee have already adopted, and strike out the words &#34;profane&#34; and &#34;blasphemous&#34; and &#34; libellous.&#34; If we do that, we shall have done very well in safeguarding the public generally from demoralization through the Post-office. &#176; </para>

                    <para>- I hope the Government will let the clause stand as it is. A man sends a letter or a newspaper, or a post-card through the Post-office; but instead of writing only the address on the cover he writes on it something insulting or libellous. He thus deliberately misuses the Post-office for some purpose of his own. </para>

If I write a letter and put on the envelope, in addition to the address, something obscene, libellous, profane, or blasphemous, I think I should be prepared to take the chance of having the clause interpreted liberally against myself. I do not think this refers to cartoons. It does not include printed matter. It means something drawn by the hand, and a printed cartoon is not a drawing. </para>

Now, a newspaper is a &#34; postal article.&#34; If the various post-offices throughout the Commonwealth are to send to the General Post-office all the newspapers that remain undelivered, their return mail-bags will undoubtedly be fairly full. At election time, for instance, in some of the States the various electors are inundated with newspapers containing the addresses of candidates. I have seen as many as 300 or 400 of these undelivered newspapers at a post-office. This provision would, therefore, thrust an unnecessary amount of work upon the local officers. </para>

                    <para>- I am not in a position, on the spur of the moment, to say what Bankruptcy Acts in the various States contain such a provision, but I am aware that this proceeding can only be taken by the assignee obtaining an order from the court, and that the court prescribes the period within which the bankrupt&#39;s letters shall be handed over to the official assignee. Remittances may be coming to a bankrupt, and these naturally are the property of the court. I believe that we have a similar provision in Tasmania. If so, it is the transcript of English legislation. Surely when a man&#39;s property is within the purview of the court, and there is reason to fear that it is being misapplied, every opportunity should be given to the official assignee to protect the creditors in the estate. If it is found that letters, which are delivered up in accordance with an order of the court, do not contain property, it is to be assumed that they will be returned. Section 104 of the Insolvency Act of Victoria provides that letters may be readdressed and sent to the Judge, and I think that we should have some similar provision in this Act, because the sole object is to protect the creditors, and see that an insolvent does not escape from the just directions of the court, but there is no intention to inquire into his purely private affairs. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Sir EDWARD</inline>BRADDON (Tasmania). - The clause makes no distinction between letters which may contain property and purely private correspondence, and one would naturally object to the receiver opening private letters, on the ground that he thinks they may possibly contain money. Under the clause&#39; the letters have to be delivered up irrespective of their character, and something ought to be devised to protect private correspondence. Every one of us must necessarily resent the idea of having private correspondence opened, even if it i$ for the protection of creditors. </para>
                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline>E. McLEAN (Lang).- There is provision in the Victorian Insolvency Act for cases such as those dealt with in the clause, under a procedure which safeguards the bankrupt. I think with the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, that the clause is somewhat harsh, because no direction is given to the Postmaster-General as to returning correspondence. He is simply ordered to hand, up certain letters, and no provision is made, either in the insolvency law or in the Bill, to protect an insolvent&#39;s private correspondence from confiscation. 1 think the Post-office should regard the correspondence of private citizens as sacred, and that we have no right to insert a provision of this kind without knowing what is to be the ultimate fate of the letters. </para>

                    <para>- No State has any power to order the Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth to do anything in his official capacity ; but this clause assumes to give that power, and the Postmaster-General would have to act under the direction of this Parliament, and of this clause, which imposes an obligation upon him. If it were not for the clause I doubt if a bankruptcy court would have the power to direct him to forward letters. But the clause will require considerable modification. In the first place I would like to know if the Minister has considered whether the word &#34;adjudged,&#34; in the first line of the clause, includes cases of voluntary sequestration as well as compulsory sequestrations. Again, further on, two different &#34;orders&#34; are referred to. There is the order of the court, and then the order of the Postmaster-General, and which order is referred to in the following line it is difficult to say. </para>

                    <para>- This clause might be amended slightly to meet cases that frequently arise. It provides at present that postal articles addressed to a deceased person may be delivered only to the executors or administrators on the production of the probate or letters of administraction, and in other cases the articles have to be opened. It frequently happens that letters addressed to- a deceased person arrive between the time of death and the actual granting of probate or letters of administraction. There is a very proper practice in the Victorian Post-office to deliver these letters to near relatives sometimes on official information or verba&#93; statement, or on the making of a statutory declaration by the persons to whom the articles are delivered. In the case of many estates it is not worth while j to take out probate or letters of adminis-&#39; tration, and why should letters in these cases have to be opened ? I suggest that the words &#34; as may be prescribed &#34; should be added, in order that the sensible practice of delivering these articles where it is perfectly clear who is entitled to them may be carried out on the making of the statutory declaration, or as may be prescribed. </para>

                    <para>. - What the honorable and learned member for Corinella wants to cover is the period between the death and the grant of probate or administration. That period ought to be covered, and I suggest that we should leave out the words &#34; in the event of there being no legal representative,&#34; and use the words &#34; if there be no legal representative.&#34; The clause would then cover both periods, that between death and the grant, and also the ulterior period when no legal representative could be found. </para>

                    <para>- I presume it is not intended to proceed with the consideration of this clause to-night. Such a large number of petitions relating to it have been presented to the House from all parts of the Commonwealth that I think a direction should be given for the preparation of a list for the consideration of the committee, showing the places from which these petitions come, and the number of subscribers to them. </para>

The difficulty about it is that the information to be of any use would have to be circulated amongst honorable members. That means that it would have to be-printed, or in other words prepared some hours before our sitting tomorrow. Those who are conversant with the duties of the clerks at the table know that to-night they must be some hours at work after we part, and how they are to do the necessary work devolving upon them, find out all the signatures to these petitions, and count them up before to-morrow afternoon, I cannot conceive. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly ; and that would make the counting of noses quite fallacious. Another ground upon which I . would request my honorable friend not to press his recommendation is that I do not think we ought to be guided by any test so fallacious as the mere number of names attached to petitions. The number of signatures that can be got to petitions depends upon the circumstances, the energy, and the motives with which they are got up. That being so, I am sure that honorable members can attach due weight to all these petitions without having the noses counted. I am going to ask my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> Fysh, to report progress now, for the reason that we have made a good deal of progress to - night, although within the last four nights we have not made progress of which we ought to be proud. But -the respect which I bear to the right honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ed</inline> ward Braddon, the extent to which 1 know he is interested in this question, the period which he has represented his own State, and the position which he holds in it, all induce me, when he makes a request of this kind, to agree to it. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask the Prime Minister to give attention to a matter which seems to me of considerable importance. A great many people are enjoying provisional protection under the patents laws of the various States, and in view of the very great expenses attached to perfecting their patents and getting letters patent throughout the whole of the States, I would ask the Prime Minister to consider whether it is not possible, before a general patent law is passed, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> pass <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> short <inline font-style="italic">Act</inline> giving these people full protection until Parliament can deal with the whole question. It may be impossible to do so, but I should like the Prime Minister to give his very earnest attention to the matter. The people interested would be put to very great expense to perfect their patents, and in view of the fact that uniform legislation must take place shortly, I think that we should, as far as we possibly can, protect and help them. </para>
