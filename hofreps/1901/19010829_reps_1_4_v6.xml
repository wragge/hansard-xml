                        <para>Following up the questions which have been, asked in regard to the construction of a., telegraph line to Tarcoola, I wish to bring"; certain facts under the notice of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, and will, in conclusion, ask a question. I find that a battery has been in operation on the field for something like a month, and that  the stone crushed amounts to 566 tons, fora yield of 1,164 ounces of gold. I understand,, further, , that it is expected that somethinglike - 1 10dwts.  of gold per ton will be' extracted from, the tailings by the cyanide process. I might'  also .inform the Minister that there,  tire  something like 2,000 telegraph poles at Oodnadatta, and that these would go a long way towards the construction of the telegraph line to that field, which is very much re-  -quired. I would ask the Minister whether the .Government, will hurry on the erection of this telegraph line as much as .possible. </para>

I think the information which has just been conveyed is very much like that previously  communicated to the House, but if it is fuller it will go further in supporting the purpose of the Government, which is to review the circumstances at the earliest possible moment ; and if they find that the work is warranted, to at once proceed with its construction. </para>

                        <para>- In view of what passed in the Legislative Council of the State  of Victoria last evening, I would ask the Prime Minister when it may  j  be expected that the matter of the occupation of these buildings by tho Federal Parliament will bc finally settled <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Something like three months have passed without any definite agreement having been arrived at, and it -is quite intelligible, in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case, that the Victorian Parliament should feel aggrieved if any reasonable requirements of theirs are not met. This is a matter which I do not think should be allowed to drag on longer than is absolutely necessary. It is stated that the agreement between the Premier of Victoria and the Prime Minister has not yet been ratified, and I hope that some arrangement will be made at the earliest possible moment, and that as far as practicable the requirements of the members of the Victorian Parliament -will be met- </para>

' There was a primary agreement between the Government of Victoria and -the Government of the Commonwealth, that was constituted by an offer placing the quarters here and the quarters at the Exhibition-building equally at the disposal of .the Commonwealth, and it became, as I take it, a fair agreement when -this Government notified to the Victorian Government that it accepted the generous offer of this building, which was placed at its disposal - those are the words. </para>

                            <para>- Under that correspondence - whatever may have happened since by way of any variation or desire of variation - this Parliament occupies this build- | ing. When it became a question of the vacation of these premises, certain difficulties arose which I fully explained to honorable members, and which, of course, resulted in some cases, in reluctance to vacate places which had been occupied for a series of years. As I explained to honorable members, that reluctance was only natural. As an outcome of that, some conversation took place between the Premier of Victoria and myself, at which the  Speaker  of the Victorian Assembly was present, and some other officer - I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins,</inline> who for some time occupied the position of Chief  Clerk  in this House. During that conversation, for the sake of avoiding friction, and for the sa,ke of doing what I knew this  j  Parliament would approve, so as to make the transition as light as passible to our <inline font-style="italic">confreres</inline> of the Victorian Parliament, there were certain matters which were tentatively agreed to by me. About the end of April, or towards the end of April, executive resolutions were passed by the Government of the Commonwealth asking to' be permitted to .borrow from the Government of Victoria certain staffs attached to the Houses. These matters were assented to by executive minute on the part of the Government of Victoria a month or two afterwards - I think it was more like two months than one. I am trying to make- as succinct a statement of these facts as I can from memory. .There were other matters of detail that -were also arranged, and the agreement -was approved of, I think, hy the Executive Council of the State of Victoria, and tendered to me for the acceptance of the Commonwealth. In it I found what seemed to me to be matters, introduced by way of modification, which took the affair quite outside anything upon which there had been any personal agreement, and these were the subject of some consideration by the Federal. Cabinet.  There was -much intervening correspondence,  and before that consideration had resulted in any agreement with the Government of Victoria certain further terms were asked for by the Government of Victoria, including the entire control of the Library. It seemed to me that this created a situation that called for a conference between the Premier of Victoria and myself, and I accordingly asked him to meet me, which he did. He with very great gladness assented to the proposition that the Speakers and Presidents of the Federal and State Parliaments should meet in conference and endeavour to settle the matter, the understanding being that they should report to the Premier of Victoria and myself. At the same time I had considerable confidence that the deliberations of these high officers would enable us all to arrive at a satisfactory agreement. I was under the impression that that was to be carried out, but on asking again whether it was to be carried out or not, I received a letter - I will speak again from memory, as I have not the correspondence in front of me - in which the Premier of Victoria suggested that in lieu of that conference between the Speakers and Presidents, there should be a conference between the two Atorneys-General. My honorable friend, the Premier of Victoria, pointed out that the word "settled" had been used in reference to the proposed conference of Speakers and Presidents as if their deliberations were to settle the matter. My reply to that was that although I had expressed entire confidence that they would settle the matter, I had not proposed that the Governments should be absolutely bound by their recommendations, but that there should be a report from them, and that I was still willing that the matter should be submitted to their consideration. I made this statement to the honorable gentleman : That before I could agree to entertain any proposal that the two Attorneys-General should consider the matter between them, I wished to know definitely whether he withdrew from his acceptance of my former proposal, that the Presidents ; and the Speakers of the two Houses in each case should meet to consider the matter, adding that I was perfectly willing, as always, that that meeting should be for consideration and report to the respective . Governments. Within the last few days I have received a letter from the Premier of Victoria telling me that he does withdraw his adoption of that proposed arrangement, so that the matter now remains in this position - That whilst the points of difference are still outstanding there is a proposal from the Government of Victoria that the Attorneys-General of the respective Governments shall consider the matter. That is a question upon which I intend to take the opinion of Cabinet on the very first opportunity that the present press of business allows. But whatever has delayed the settlement of this matter, it is certainly not any action on the part of the Commonwealth, which has sedulously exhibited its desire all through that there should be an amicable arrangement. Notwithstanding the fact that the whole building was placed at its disposal and accepted with all that it contained, it has been ready to consent to modifications rather than that there should be friction between the two Parliaments and Governments. It is with reluctance that I make this statement, but the time has come for me to make it, and the time has come for the public of Victoria to appreciate the position under which the Commonwealth is labouring. </para>

What was resolved was—"Tha t it is expedient for the Parliament of the Commonwealth to accept the right to legislate on the subjects named if the States see fit to grant i t . "</para>
                    <para>2. Replies have been received from the Premiers of Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia. The Government of Western Australia has promised to consult Parliament as to the expediency of granting the Parliament of the Commonwealth the right to legislate on the subjects mentioned. The Government of Tasmania consider it undesirable for the Parliament of that State to surrender its rights to make its own laws upon the important subjects named in the resolution. The other replies mentioned are merely acknowledgments of my letter.</para>

                            <para>I understood that. When the address i n reply was being discussed I mentioned this matter, but, apparently, my remarks did not meet with general approval. So far, the Presidents and Speakers of the two Parliaments have not been able to come 'to any satisfactory determination in regard' to this matter. That constitutes an additional reason why we should come to a speedy decision w i th regard to the federal capital site. I think that question must be taken into early consideration.</para>

                            <para>Yes . If the honorable member for Melbourne Ports had been present to hear the explanation of the Prime Minister he would admit its urgency. Friction apparently exists between the State Parliament and the Commonwealth Parliament with regard to our occupancy of these buildings. I noticed to-day that the Government whip is about to organize a pilgrimage to the various capital sites which have been suggested. I wish to know whether that pilgrimage is being undertaken with the assent of the Ministry, or whether it is merely the outcome of the whip's own personal activity 1 I am glad to see that the State Premier of New South Wales has provided every facility to enable this Parliament to come to an early decision i n regard to the site of the capital.</para>

                            <para>I am glad to hear that. I t shows that the communications which have passed between the New South AVales Government and the Government of the Commonwealth have been of a most amicable character, and justifies the hope of a speedy settlement of this difficulty. There is one other matter to which I would like to refer, 'and that is the establishment of a federal library. I am not cavilling at tine officers here. The librarian is most attentive, obliging, and skilled in the work which he has to perforin. The same remark applies to the other officials. But i t is of immense importance that the Prime Minister should have some scheme before him with regard to the establishment of a federal library. I regret that the result of the process of questioning has not been in the direction of giving to honorable members the ful l information which they have a right to demand.</para>

                        <para>A little while ago the Prime Minister laid on the table of the House the report of Dr. Maxwell. Nearly a fortnight has elapsed since then, but up to the present no honorable member of this House has received a copy of it. I understood when this Parliament was established that its requirements were to be met promptly, and that its members would not occupy an inferior position in regard to obtaining information to that, occupied by members of State Parliaments., In Queensland the report of Dr. Maxwell, , which was addressed to the Prime Minister,  has been laid upon the table of the State Parliament. Honorable members of that Parliament have already received copies of it, and I had one forwarded to me from that, State. I do not think that this House is being treated in the way that it should be. The report was addressed to the Prime, Minister of the Commonwealth, and under. such circumstances before the press or anyone else received it, this House should have been placed in possession of its contents. The members of the Queensland Parliament' have had an opportunity of discussing the report before honorable members here have, even seen it. When an individual has been instructed to prepare a report which is paid for by this Parliament, I want to know whether it is not right that we should have that document submitted to us before it is tabled in any of the State Parliaments 1</para>

                        <para>About a fortnight ago I directed the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that some 80 Afghans had been landed from a French boat in Melbourne. I obtained from the right honorable gentleman a distinct promise that the Customs officers were to be instructed to notify him before any other undesirable immigrants were permitted to land. I was, therefore, somewhat surprised when I read in this morning's paper of what occurred after I left the House last evening upon tbe question raised by the honorable member for Bland, when it was stated that some 51 Afghans landed in Melbourne yesterday. From the reply made by the Prime Minister, i t is apparent that the right honorable gentleman had no knowledge of their landing. I now want to know whether the Prime Minister did not receive a report from the Customs officers that a number of Afglians were to be. landed yesterday ? On the previous occasion I pointed out the danger of our being inundated with undesirable immigrants prior to the passing of the Immigration Restriction Act. It is a wellknown fact that a great majority in this House is in favour of a white Australia. I t is also well known that the passing of the Immigration Restriction Bill cannot take place until after the Tariff has been dealt with. I n the meantime there is a possibility of more undesirable immigrants landing in the different States than have landed for many years past. I have some knowledge of the class of aliens who have recently landed. I trust tliat i f tlie Prime Minister has given instructions to the Customs officers they will be carried out. I f such instructions were given i t is a most singular thing that tbe Prime Minister received no intimation of the landing of these Afghans. On the other hand, i f he did receive an intimation from the Customs officers, this House ought to know why definite action was not taken. I t is too late to close the stable door when the horse is-gone; and I am convinced that before we can pass the Immigration Restriction Bill advantage will be taken of the absence of it, and numbers of these aliens will be dumped down upon our shores. It is desirable that the Prime Minister should take every step that is possible to prevent this evil arising. He has the power. It has been done in other States. It has been done in tlie State from which I come on several occasions. ' I t has also been done in New South Wales. The Government have power by an Executive act to prevent undesirable aliens from landing. I trust the House will get a fuller explanation than has hitherto been given in connexion with the question.</para>

                        <para>In regard to the question which I had on the notice paper to-day in reference to ticks, of course I have to besatisfiedwith the replyof the Prime Minister, that until the department of quarantine has been taken over by the Commonwealtli Parliament, this is really a matter for the State Governments to deal with. At the same time I should like to impress upon the Prime Minister the importance of this question in connexion with one of our great national industries. In Murwillurnbah tick has been found upon stock. That place is in the northern district of New South Wales, where the dairying industry has of late years become of great importance. We have i t on the authority of some of the leading men in Victoria that the dairying industry has been the saving of this State. The industry has extended in the last few years to tlie north coast districts of New South AVales, and in the south coast district, Camdeh, and other parts of the State i t is flourishing. We know the ravages that ticks have made in connexion- with herds in Queensland. I , as the representative of one of the great dairying districts of this country, recognise the fact that dairying is going to be one of the greatest national industries of Australia, in the future, and would impress upon the Prime Minister the necessity of communicating with the various State Governments on the question, in order to see if something cannot be done, more than has been done up to the present time, in order to prevent the tick plague working its way down the coastal districts of New South Wales, and possibly affecting the dairy herds of Victoria as well. I suggest that, for this purpose, the Prime Minister should not only communicate with the Government of New South Wales, but also that he should see whether something cannot be done with the object of engaging an expert to inquire intp this most important matter.</para>

                        <para>I do not know whether the Prime Minister intends to refer to the question raised by a previous speaker, but at any rate I hope that too much will not be made in this House of a question which is at present unsettled. I refer to tlie matter of the occupation of Parliament- buildings. I , as a member coining from another State, and having practically no interest in. the question of where we sit, recognise that we are under some obligation to those who have so gladly made us welcome to this House.</para>

                            <para>AATie n a question is raised such as we have read about in the papers to-day, I hope it will be settled, as a similar question has been settled in regard to tlie House of Representatives side of the building. It is well known that provision has been made on bhis side for members' of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria to have the use of a room, and 1 have no doubt that a similar arrangement can be made on tbe other side of the building for tbe accommodation of members of the Legislative Council of Victoria. I should have thought tliat such a matter would be in the hands of the President of the Senate, and would be dealt with by him; But as to the whole subject, I trust that we shall not make a grievance of a very little question in connexion with settling the terms when we have substantially got all we require under' present arrangements.</para>

                        <para>I have to make a complaint in regard to the management of the Post and Telegraph department. There are a large number of men employed in the various States, particularly iu two, who rank as temporary hands. I refer to the telegraph construction branch. The Home Secretary, who had charge of the Public Service Bill in this House, promised that these men would not be dealt with as a temporary class. But only so recently as yesterday I received an official reply from the Postmaster-General's department saying that i t was not intended to place the men on the permanent staff. I may explain that in Sew South Wales, and, I understand, in South Australia also, they are ranked as temporary hands. Some of them have been twenty years in the service ; others' have been in the service for a shorter time, ranging down to a couple of years. They have become experts in the doing of what is admittedly work that requires experienced men. I understood the Home Secretary to give a distinct pledge to the House when tlie Public Service Bill was under discussion. I now bring the matter under the notice of the Premier. Tlie work done by these men is of growing importance, and it is desirable to retain those who have experience of it. This should be done by placing them on the permanent staff; They should be in the same position as men doing the same work in other States. I cannot understand why any difference should be made at all. Men who use the pen only, and are merely clerks, are classed as permanent, whilst skilled workmen,, engaged in highly important workx are set down as temporary hands, "[.protest against distinctions of this-kind. I protest against the action that has been taken by the Postal department; and I trust that, now attention has been drawn to it, the Prime Minister will make a note of the point.</para>

                            <para>Tha t does not matter. It just shows the spirit existing. There is no use in members saying we are welcome here. We are not, and the sooner we get out of it the better. They asked us to take the place, and because the Executive took i t they are now sorry they made the offer. We are here on sufferance, and, though there have been agreements drawn up, none of them have yet been ratified. I , for one, would give my vote to-morrow, if possible, to shift to Sydney, and I am not afraid to say so. I hope the federal site will be selected as quickly as possible, and that a temporary building will be run up that we can say is our own. If we are to be a Commonwealth Parliament, let us not be subservient to any State.</para>

                        <para>I t is a great pity tbat a discussion should have arisen over a matter like this. Nearly everybody will agree that when the offer was made by the Victorian Government they intended that i t should be accepted, and so far as one can judge from the feeling expressed in the papers at the time, no mistake, was made by the Ministry in accepting the place. I do not think that the State members have cast any slurs, but if one were a member of that body one might feel a little sense of dissatisfaction at seeing a nice place like this occupied by some one else. I am quite sure that, apart from a few petulant expressions which might fall from men in a bad. humour, there has been no such dissatisfaction expressed as has been suggested. If I had been a -State member I might have hoped that the Pederal Government would have accepted the other building. They did not do so, and I believe, if i t came to a vote in the State Parliament, the members of that Parliament would stand by their offer. This appears to 'be the day for the airing of grievances, and though there would not be time for me to explain all my grievances against tlie Ministry, I desire to mention one shortly. Every one i n the House sees now what a terrible mistake was made by the Government in taking over the Postal department before we were ready for it. There was quite enough work to be done in this session iu the carrying of machinery Bills, and the settlement of the Tariff. The mistake made, so far as the Postal department is concerned, has had the effect that in every oue of the States they are in such a position that no improvements of any kind can go on, and all development work is at a standstill. The Ministry have made a mistake -which i t will take them some time to get over, but instead of throwing themselves upon our mercy, and asking for consideration because they made this blunder, they try and face it out boldly. That might have been expected from a warlike character like the Minister for Defence, but we might have looked to other members of the Ministry to have seen the error of their .ways. One thing seems absolutely necessary to be done, and that is that instructions should at once be issued to the Deputy 'Postmasters-General in the various States that, so far as possible, everything ought to go on exactly as i t would havegone on if these services had not been taken over. That would allow many little works which ought to be carried out to be. done. The Ministry seem to have overlooked, when taking over this Post and Telegraph department, that it would be absolutely necessary to establish a Works department, and if i t had not been taken over that would not have been necessary at all for two or three or four years to come. I f the Ministry could retrace their stepsin any way, it would be far better for the various Statesconcerned, as well as. for the Federal Government. It would do away -with a lot of bookkeeping with regard to this service, and would tend to advance everything. I do not suppose we can expect that they will retrace their steps, and the best thing they can do now is to see i f they cannot mend their ways, and allow these departments in the various States to continue the work which is absolutely necessary for the development of the country.</para>

                        <para>M y grievance, like that, of the last speaker, is confined mostly to tbe Postal department. I do not care very much where the Federal Parliament sits. It appears to me that the whole machinery of the Post and Telegraph department has come to a standstill. I asked Ministers, when Parliament first met, i f provision would be made for the obligations of the State Governments, and if promises made by the State Parliaments previous to the passing of the Commonwealth Bill woidd be carried out. Thereply I received was that the Government would carry out all the obligations that had been entered into. We now find that in tlie different States telephones have been applied for, guarantees have been signed, and everything necessary under the State Government has been done to secure the construction and completion of those telephones. But we are informed by the Pederal Government that there is no obligation where no contract has been signed, and that promises made by the State Governments, the signing of guarantees, and approval of the borrowing of money by the State Parliaments, does not commit the Pederal Government to anything.</para>

                            <para>I suppose i t will be carried on like all responsibilities. I should like to know what is to be done in such cases as I have referred to. I feel that the whole wheel of progress in our Postal department has come to a stand-still. We cannot get as much as a weather station. In New South Wales, and in other States, we have had rainfalls recently, and business transactions are greatly affected in the case of stock-owners, and intending purchasers, by information obtained through the Post and Telegraph department. I have complaints from almost every important centre where applications for the establishment of weather stations have been promised favorable consideration, that though anticipations were formed that these centres would have weather stations granted, nothing is being done to meet the applications. Purchasers of stock require to get information with regard to rainfall, and the state of the weather, and people owning steamers trading along the coast wish to get similar information. People in the interior who have stock travelling in the outlying districts, where the stock routes ha,ve been impassable, wish to know how they have been affected b}' the rain where i t has fallen. But in every instance where I visited a department I have been told that these weather registers are entirely unnecessary, aud that the Government have no funds to*increase Government expenditure. I t appears to me that the Government have no funds at all, and if that is so I would like to know when they are. likely to have funds, and when they have funds what share of the expenditure we may anticipate. This is a matter to which I should like the Government to give some consideration. Tliere is another matter affecting the Postal department, and that is that we appear now to have no Public Service Board, and where grievances arise in the department the inquiries are made entirely by the officials of the department. I n New South Wales, and I suppose i t is the same in the other States, these grievances used to come before the Public Service Board, and I know of instances where officials wish to have their grievances inquired into under the same conditions as formerly obtained. They feel that their, interests may be prejudiced to a certain extent i f they are left entirely at the mercy of departmental officers, and they desire to feel the same independence and freedom as they had when they could lay their grievances before the Public Service Board. I therefore ask the Government whether, until the Public Service Bill comes into operation, they will make arrangements by which any officer who may feel aggrieved by the decision of a departmental head may have an inquiry made by an independent board. With regard to temporary officers, I take i t that they have been educated to a certain extent at the expense of the Government, in order to fit them for the duties which tliey are ow discharging, and I hope that in selecting officers for permanent positions these temporary hands will be chosen before persons are selected from outside.</para>

                        <para>Th e honorable member for South Australia very properly called attention to the question of coloured immigration, but as he suggested that there had been something in the shape of negligence on the part of the Government in regard to their promise to do whatever was necessary to exclude undesirable immigrants, I think a few words from me might serve to dispel any wrong impression. I speak for the reason that.the Customs department is chiefly concerned. The facts are these : On the 16th of this month thehonorable member called the attention of the Prime Minister to the matter, and the Prime Minister promised that he would do his best to inquire into the wh61e question, so tliat in case of any anticipated landing, of aliens he might be in a position to know tlie powers we had, and ser: that tliey were reasonably exercised. The Prime Minister mentioned the matter to me, and desired that steps should be taken, and as a result, ou tlie Saturday morning—the-morn ing following, the day or which the matter was mentioned in tbe House—th e following intructions were given to the head of my department:—</para>

                    <para>Of course the desire in that connexion was that Ave might be able to ascertain whether the circumstances were such as the State would have thepowertodealwith, or whether the Executive powers of the Commonwealth should preferably be brought into operation. No doubt while the powers of the Commonwealth with reference to the .exclusion of aliens are very great, and supplement the. powers conferred by statute, legislation in tt matter of this land is urgently needed in order that full power may be taken to deal with British subjects. We may deal with aliens by Executive acts, but we can only deal with British subjects to the extent to which the Statute law enables us to go. Honorable members will notice that the instructions were issued at the earliest possible moment, and I was indeed much surprised to learn yesterday that a number of Afghans had entered the port. I t looked very much as if their landing was effected with the tacit consent of the Pederal Government. I consequently drafted a memo, to the Comptroller- General of Customs this morning, as follows</para>

                        <para>I have some sympathy with the honorable member for Gwydir, whose constituency adjoins mine, with reference to "the expenditure upon post-offices. No doubt the honorable member feels that a good deal that has been promised with regard to his constituency may not be carried out at this critical time, but I think the honorable member might very well have waited until the postfil estimates were submitted before passing the criticisms he did. I drawavery broad distinction between promises made by ' a State Minister and the actual obligations entered into by a, State department. If . there is an obligation with a positive pledge, i and estimates have been prepared for cer- [ tain postal work, I think the obligation : might very well be carried out by the I Commonwealth Government; but I make a broad distinction between such a case as that and those in which promises have been made by State Ministers. Unfortunately i t has been the custom in New South Wales for honorable members to induce the State Postmaster-General to visit their districts and to entertain him 'in the most lavish manner, and as one of 1 the results of this sort of thing promises have been made which the Commonwealth Government are in no sense bound by. I desire to take this opportunity of drawing your attention, Mr. Speaker, to tbe habit— i t has almost become a habit—i n which honorable members are indulging of bringing before this House matters which are distinctly beyond the functions of the Commonwealth, and clearly within those of the States. As.a clear example of what I mean I would refer to the question which appears on the riotice-paper for' to-day, in the name of the honorable member for Illawarra, who asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether his attention had been called to the report that ticks had been found on stock at Murwillurnbah, in New South Wales, and whether he would have an inquiry made with a view to a strict quarantine of the infected area in the event of the report proving correct. I venture to say that that is a question which should never bave appeared on the business-paper of this House, because I challenge any honorable member to show that, we have any power to deal with a matter of that kind, which is entirely within the functions of the State authorities. It may be urged that the Commonwealth has the right to deal with matters of quarantine; but if the interpretation of the Constitution Act is to be strained to the extent that the question implies, I think we shall be very seriously trenching on the State domain, and that there will be small occasion for surprise if our action meets with very strong resentment.</para>

                        <para>I regret that the Minister for Home Affairs was not in his place when the honorable member for Darling raised the question as to the position of temporary hands in the public service. I remember the Minister for Home Affairs being asked whether tlie men who were temporarily employed by the States would have their rights respected by the Commonwealth, and he replied that they would be taken over in the same way as the permanent men, adding that tliey would not have to undergo any examination. I think that the reply which has been received by tbe honorable member for Darling from the Postal department is entirely inconsistent with that statement, and i t seems to imply that the ordinary labourer, who has just as much right to be treated with consideration as those who are engaged i n clerical employment, is to be dealt with on a different footing. I hope the Prime Minister will inquire into this matter, and that steps will be taken to secure tlie fairest possible treatment for the large number of men who have been temporarily employed in tlie different States in connexion with the various departments which have been transferred to the Commonwealth.</para>

                        <para>I desire to mention one or two matters which appear to me to be important. I was struck by the remarks made by the honorable member for G-wydir, who propounded the theory that the Commonwealtli Government were under an obligation to fulfil all the wild promises that had been made by a certain Minister in the State from which he comes. I hope that the Commonwealtli Government I will look at the practice—whic h has existed, for at least a quarter of a century in nearly  all the States, of building elaborate postal I accommodation in all the chief towns of the | States—fro m a totally different stand-point I from that in which i t has been regarded by the States. I t has been- the custom in the State Parliaments to consider that i t added to the political reputation of members to I secure the erection of large buildings in . small townships in their particular con- | stituencies. Consequently, huge sums have  been spent for postal accommodation which has not only never been required, but will not be required for at least half-a-century. Speaking as an ex-Minister of Public Works, I know that plans have been prepared for post-offices which would cost three or four times the amount necessary to provide accommodation for the particular township for which those plans were designed. I have always set my face against- this expenditure, which is quite peculiar to the Australian colonies. In some of the large provincial towns in England the whole of the postal arrangements are carried on in a small grocer's shop. I t is so done in many of the suburbs of London, and, until a few years ago, it was done in the city of Bristol. I know that in many other large towns postal accommodation is juovided in a building for which a very small sub-rental is paid to the occupant, who has a grocer's or a chemist's shop. The suggestion _ of the honorable member for Gwydir is that where a number of promises have been made by the Ministers for Wqrks of the various States, those promises should be observed by the Postmaster-General.</para>

                            <para>I hope we are on the eve of a new state of things, and that even such towns as Invereli will only be afforded that accommodation which is really necessary in the interests of the public. Some time ago I tabled two questions with regard to the establishment of a statistical department in the Commonwealth. I pointed out that in my opinion i t was very important that some statistical authority should be employed, whilst the information was most easily obtainable, to collect data of the condition of all the States of the Commonwealth at the time of its inception. The Prime Minister, in reply, said—"O n behalf of my colleague, I have to say that the matter has not been lost sight of, and as soon as the state of public business will allow, some action will be. taken to deal with this important question." That was in July last. I should like the Prime Minister, when replying, to say whether anything has been done in the direction indicated. I t cannot be doubted that sooner or later there must be a Commonwealth statistician, and the usual small staff of assistants which such an officer generally gathers round him for the purposes of his department. The expenditure on such a department is so small, but the work performed so important that, saving, for the fact that the Prime Minister has a multitude of tilings to attend to, i t ought to command at all events his best attention. Another question which 1 think i t is convenient to raise at the present time has reference to the establishment of a Commonwealth Meteorological department. Meteorology has become an important science from ' a purely utilitarian stand-point. It is important to the shipping, pastoral, and agricultural communities. In the past, where the meteorologist employed by any State bas been able to foretell the weather to be expected within a week or a fortnight, he has to some extent not only regulated the shipping of the ports, but the harvesting of the agriculturists. It is a well-known fact amongst meteorologists tbat tbe opportunity for predicting weather would be very much improved by the establishment of observatories in some cases as far south as Tasmania and in other distant parts of the continent, in order that the data which comes to the meteorologist should be of a much wider and more general character. I should like the Prime Minister to say whether the Government have considered the advisability of establishing a central department, so that the question of the desirability of establishing these distant observatories may be considered with the idea of supplying the public of the Commonwealth with more reliable information in regard to the future. The honorable member for Gwydir touched upon this matter when he pointed out that, whereas i t had been the custom under the State Governments to afford information with regard to meteorological facts at the post-offices ; since the Commonwealth had taken over the control of the Postal department that information had not been forthcoming. I think that that information is of great importance. I t is certainly of more immediate importance than are some of the measures on the business-paper. I hope that the Prime Minister will inform the House whether any steps have been taken, or are likely to be taken in the near future, with regard to the establishment of such a meteorological department.</para>

                        <para>I am very sorry that the Minister of Home Affairs is not present, because he is thoroughly acquainted with the details of the grievance ventilated by the honorable member for Darling. I feel somewhat concerned about this matter. I t is not a case of wild promises made by State Ministers. I t has reference to promises made on the floor of this House during the progress of a Bill. On the occasion in question, a promise was made that every man who is really in the permanent employ of the Government, although he may only be classed as a temporary hand, should continue in the service. Upon that promise, 1 voted for the Government on one occasion and against my colleagues for South Australia. Now, I find' that the Minister of Home Affairs has signed a document informing certain men who have been employed for a number of years in line-repairing in connexion with the Post-oflice that their services will not be continued under the Commonwealth. Such an occurrence seems to be -quite extraordinary, in face of the distinct promise which was made in this House. Action of this sort is not an inducement to honorable members to rely on the promises of Ministers. It is a very serious matter to a great many public servants who have been employed by some of the State departments for twelve and thirteen years, and even longer. It is a distinct reversal of the statement made by tlie Minister of Home Affairs during the progress of the Public Service Bill through this House.</para>

In connexion with the remarks which I made upon the prevalence of tick in New South Wales, I understand that during my absence from the chamber tlie honorable member for New England made what was almost a personal attack upon me for having introduced State politics into the Pederal Parliament. The answer of the Prime Minister to the question entirely exonerated me from such an imputation. The Prime Minister assured me that as soon as the quarantine laws were taken over by the Federal Government this matter would receive consideration.</para>

                            <para>Th e honorable member for Illawarra says that I made an attack upon him, and charges me with having made my remarks when he was out of the chamber. I wish to explain that I rose two or three times, but on each occasion I was not called upon by the Speaker. I then noticed tliat the honorable member for Illawarra was not in the chamber. Later on i t appeared to me that he was in the chamber. I must speak when I have the opportunity, and if i t is to, be regarded as a rule tbat a member caixuot speak about; another honorable member when the latter is not iu the chamber i t will be an easy way of getting out of difficulties. I thought tlie honorable member was in the chamber when I spoke, but it is unfortunate that I am shortsighted, and I had not my glasses with me. Even if I had known that the honorable member was not present I should have been obliged to speak when called upon.</para>

                            <para>I do not know that. I do not think the honorable member is threatening me with motions for adjournment. I do not believe he is "built that way," and I shall not think him capable of it. I have already given, a very full answer with regard to the occupancy of Parliament House. At the same time i t must be remembered that my observations could not cover all the ground, because I was speaking from memory ; and I want to state, " right here," as the Americans say, tliat I must not be taken to have stated the case completely and fully in the answer I gave to the honorable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon. Tliere may be facts which I have left out'that would tell in favour of the Commonwealth Government, and there may be other facts which I have left out that would tell in favour of tbe State Government. I endeavoured faithfully to tell the. House all I could remember of the transactions that have taken place, so far as time would allow, but as for the rest of it, I say again that I have very great confidence in the complete straightforwardness of ^he Premier of Victoria, and I do believe that we shall be able to come to an amicable and. satisfactory arrangement of this matter, notwithstanding the delays which have taken place. More than tliat, in a matter of such importance I do not think i t is right that we sitting here should unnecessarily complain of these delays. Some of the delay may be attributable to myself, and some to the Victorian Government. But that such a matter should be proceeded with without any hurry is perfectly rational and right. I n the meantime, there is no cause of complaint in regard to the -convenience of honorable members, because they are here enjoying the conveniences of this splendid building, Therefore I think honorable members might take my advice, and possess their souls in patience, knowing, that tliey are not suffering anything. As to the establishment of a federal library; to which the honorable member for Dalley referred, the subject is one upon which he might well have asked .me a question. It has been occupying the attention of the Government for some time. I have been in. communication with gentlemen well-known in connexion with the .establishment and maintenance of libraries, whether as officials or otherwise, from whom a mass of valuable information has been obtained. I t is my intention, as soon as possible, to appoint a board of experts to report upon the question of tbe methods and principles upon which a federal library should be established and maintained. As soon as I have obtained all the information I require, I intend to lay i t before the Library Committee of this Parliament, and to ask the committee for their views, and for a report upon it. I n all the steps that I take with reference to the establishment of a federal library,' I wish to be quite in touch. and harmony with the Library CommitteeoftheFederal Parliament. Honorable members will recognise tliat of course there are various important matters to be considered in connexion with the subject. It would not be out of place for me to mention, for instance, that there are such questions as to whether' there shall be a Federal Parliamentary Library and also a Federal, National, or Public Library, and whether the two should be distinct. We have an instance in the library .which is, I believe, amongst the five greatest libraries in the world, namely, that established at the capitol at Washington. There they have a parliamentary section, a general section, and a law library. The Parliamentary Library, is open to members of Congress, the general section,is open to the public at" large, and the law library is open to those who have occasion to use i t in connexion with the law courts, which form a part of the same scheme of buildings. There is a great deal to be said in favour of tbe establishment of such an institution, but the question is one that requires consideration. It is only necessary to mention this in order to show how extensive are the considerations that are involved. We shall have to determine whether we shall proceed on that plan, or on other plans which prevail in other places. These are all important matters. Honorable members opposite will agree with me in saying that inasmuch as we cannot, for some years to come, be in the federal capital, i t is well that we should take these steps deliberately, and that we should invoke the assistance of the Federal Parliamentary Library Committee before anything is done. With regard to Dr. Maxwell's report, there has been, I must admit, some delay in connexion with its production. But the matter is now in hand, and honorable members may expect the report to be ready for distribution some time to-morrow.</para>

                            <para>No ; but tliere were some corrections to be made in the typewritten copy. I formally laid the report on the table some time ago, because there was some curiosity on the part of honorable members in regard to it. But i t will be readily understood tbat there were some inadvertencies and errors in the typescript, and i t was a natural thing that Dr. Maxwell should desire to have i t corrected in that respect. I regret the delay that has occurred. As to the landing of Afghans, to which the Minister of Customs has referred, I have to say tbat, immediately tlie complaint was made by the honorable member for South Australia, Mr. Poynton, I sent a note to my right honorable friend to have this information conveyed to me from the Customs department on all occasions when arrivals were.expected. That was not a matter that waited for some days. The direction was given on the night the honorable member for South Australia asked the question. There has evidently been some lapse in the department. I suppose that all tbe officers are not as clever as some of them are; though with regard to that I want i t to be understood that, i f there has been any fault, i t is the duty of the Government to take tlie responsibility for all their officers, arid the matter is between the officials and the Government. The binding was not of 80 Afghans, nor of 51 as subsequently stated. I find it was of 31. I t is just as well that I should mention these figures, because i t is quite common for exaggerated reports to reach our ears, and we are apt to be led astray by them. Reverting again to the parliamentary agreement, the honorable member for Tasmania, Mr.' Piesse, has made reference to the matter of providing a room for the accommodation of members of the Legislative Gouncil of Victoria.- Complaints have been made about a room not having been set apart for them. I understand that one room has always been available for members of the Legislative Council, but has been very little used indeed. A request has been made for another room— a much more commodious one—an d I understand that the President of the Senate is perfectly willing to take his part in providing the accommodation required, presuming tliat an agreement can be arrived at, so that the matter may be made definite. As to the postal matter mentioned by the honorable member for Darling I will have an immediate inquiry made to find out under what circumstances, if at all, statements that appear at first sight to conflict were made. If, as the honorable member said, a pledge was given by tlie Home Secretary, the House may rely upon i t that whatever has been promised on the authority of the Government will have to be carried out. Whatever faults may be laid at our doors, it will be admitted that if a definite promise is made it has always been carried out, except that i f i t has been ' made inconsiderately, the matter may have to be laid before the House again in order to show why i t cannot be carried out. I do not think that the honorable member for . erriwa is quite correct in saying that the Postal department was taken over by the ' Pederal Government before we were ready for it. Tlie fault is not in the Postal department itself. Honorable members will understand that it would not be possible to conceive, in any spirit of wisdom, the provision of machinery for the amalgamation of large departments like the Defence department and the Postal department in a satisfactory manner unless they were in the hands of Ministers before the amalgamation was actually made. Unless the departments were in the hands of Ministers so that they could know in what respects the practices of the different States differed, and to what degree tbose practices should be reduced to uniformity, whilst at the same time leaving some amount of elasticity, it would be impossible to produce satisfactory Bills to deal with them. Therefore it was right to take them over when they were taken over. If any hitches have occurred—and undoubtedly they must have occurred under any Federation, and will occur under every Federation that may be established in the future—it must be understood that such dislocations must necessarily arise until matters settle down finally into a uniform course of administration, which can only take place after the Federal Parliament has legislated upon the subject. I am certainly not going to advise the Commonwealth Government to retrace its steps in this respect. Indeed, instead of doiug that it is necessary for the Government toputits footdown more firmly in some cases, and that will be done, as occasion arises, with every spirit of courtesy to every Stateconcerned. As regards the financial difficulties that have been complained of, it is easy to understand how they have occurred. All the Commonwealth Parliament has been able to do is to pass two Supply Bills, which have been of a temporary character. The Government has been unable to lay out funds on the extension and repair of its offices. Those difficulties will be overcome in time. In the meantime there must lie instances of the kind mentioned. But as far as it is possible to make arrangements with the States, they will be avoided in that way. It must be always recognised, however, that the mere fact of the establishment of this Federation cannot, in view of a State having made a series of promises, be held to bind the Commonwealth in respect to every promise which has been so made. Take the cases in which such promises have been made with the knowledge that before they could be performed the Commonwealth would be constituted. That would enormously increase the financial obligations of Australia as a whole. Whatever be the way in which we look at this matter, the more economy we can reasonably exercise in these transferred departments the better for each State concerned. We have, therefore, to scrutinize these promises. I t would never do that we should say to the States— " You, in virtue of federation, and knowing i t was coming, and that you would not have to do the work yourselves, have promised these things, and we, therefore, must carry them out." That those having no responsibility should promise, and those having tlie responsibility are bound to perform, would be a situation we cannot allow. It is, therefore, necessary to scrutinize all these cases, and that has been and is being done with every regard to good faith. I do npt know that auy other statements made demand any more than general treatment. We have no loan money in the Commonwealth at present; we have had no opportunity to pass a Loan Act, and until we pass a Loan Act, we' can have no loan money. In the meantime, works requiring to be carried out by loan money are to a certain extent suspended subject to any arrangement we may be able to make with the States. As to what has been said, I think by the honorable member for Parkes, upon the necessity of establishing a statistical department and a meteorological department, 1 think both are most important, but they are not of that first order of importance that would justify our interrupting the business of the first session to pass Acts for those purposes. They might well occupy some place in the business of the second session, but we have too much on our shoulders during this session to pass them. I f my honorable friend will refresh his memory in regard to the Constitutipn Act he will see that until we pass legislation on the subject we can accept no part in the administration of those matters. I do not think there is anything else I can refer to with advantage, except to say generally that I have taken a note of the complaints which have been made, with the intention of giving them further consideration, to see. whether what has been complained of may not be rectified.</para>

                        <para>In addressing myself to this question last night I expressed a hope that the House would not consider the measure as a mere technical and machinery Bill, but that as it deals with enormous interests, they would look beyond the mere mechanical clauses and endeavour to foster the great industries affected. I have said tliat there are three aspects in which the Bill does not come up to my expectations or in which I think it is faulty. The first is that there is no provision in the Bill to supply people with pure and wholesome liquor. The next is that i t plays very much into the hands of the larger men and has a tendency to crush out the smaller distillers and the smaller growers of wine in the various States. The next defect in i t is that i t does not regulate. or encourage local production to the extent I think a measure such as this should do. I intended to give some figures with regard to the amount of distillation carried on in each State, and I have now before me correct figures as to the number of distilleries and the amount of liquor distilled in the various States. In Queensland there are six distilleries which distilled, last year, 150,763 gallons ; the whole of that distillation was from cane skinnings or molasses. I n South Australia there are eight distilleries, which pay a licence-fee of £50 each, and last year they distilled 108,068 gallons. While tlie main produce of these distilleries was brandy, they also distilled whisky, rum, and gin. With regard to wine manufacturers, licences "are issued at £5. There are ten of these in South Austraha, and they produced last year 14,146 gallons of spirit and 17,296 gallons of rectified spirit.; In Victoria tliere are at present seven distilleries, the proprietors of one of which have allowed the licence to lapse because they were overstocked and desired to take a rest. Last year they paid a licencefee of £10, and this Bill proposes to raise the fee at once to £50. The Victorian distilleries last year produced 431,042 gallons. In Victoria there are 56 vineyard licences issued. Of these, only four are £10 licences, under which the holders have the right not only to distil the produce of their own vineyards, but also any wine made which they choose to purchase. They produced last year 8,073 gallons. The other 52 licences are what are termed £5 licences, issued under conditions by which the holder is only allowed to distil the product of his own vineyard, and only so much spirit as is required for the fortification of his own wine. Thesupervision over the holders of these licences has been extremely lax, and a number of them, instead of confining themselves to the legitimate object for which their licences were issued, have become traffickers in grapes and in wine. They have bought from tlieir poorer neighbours who could sell nowhere else, and have become really wine and spirit merchants without paying the licence-fee that wirfe and spirit merchants have to pay. I may say that i n Victoria last year 439,117 gallons of spirits were produced, but there was a large stock on hand of 680,691 gallons, so that altogether in the colony there .is a stock of 1,119,950 gallons. I find from close investigation that the products used in producing this spirit have been all of a ~ good quality. I find tbat tliere has been no potatoes used, and no beet-root refuse used, or anything like that wliich would cause the production of a fiery spirit. This information comes direct from tlie distillation branch, and I have seen the officers. there and have been informed tliat i t is correct. The materials which have been used have been barley malt, barley, wheat, maize and rye, wine and molasses. No one can object to spirits made from these materials, while the use of other materials; such as sulphuric acid, required to convert the starch into sugar, will, I hope, be resisted by this House. There is a form B in the Bill which deals with the use of these products.</para>

                            <para>I prefer not to be drawn into a conversation at the present time. I t has been said that these wine-growers' licences are the cause of a great deal of illicit distillation, and that there is therefore a considerable leakage of revenue. I do not know that tliat is the case, but I am inclined somewhat to doubt the statement. ' I f i t is the case to any great extent it is not creditable .to the Excise department, because the pains and penalties upon these people, for breaches of the law are as severe as upon the larger people, and as no cases have been brought, I take i t that the report is not as credible as i t is made to appear. I mentioned last night that the Bill favours the large people, and that the wine industry throughout the States is not as satisfactory as i t ought to be. The Governments of various States by bonuses and in other ways have endeavoured to foster this industry, which i f properly looked after may become a great one. We have here millions of acres that are not fit for cultivation or dairying, and are scarcely fit for the grazing o£ sheep, but which if properly used for the growing of the vine could be utilized, and from which people could make a good living if this industry were properly cared for. Where we have encouraged people to plant grapes and produce wine, we ought to give them the fullest possible chance of making a living out of their productions. I f a man finds himself in the position that he has a bad season, that his grapes are not very good f©r wine-making, or having converted them into wine or must, a thunderstorm has occurred which has made it likely that the wine would .turn, every facility should be given to that man to put his product to some use in order that his season's labour may not be lost. He may put i t to use if he is enabled to distil the product. . I f he converts i t into spirit i t is as good as sovereigns to him, and the longer he keeps i t the more valuable i t becomes. I t seems to me that with reasonable encouragement enormous planting would go on. At present there are some 60,000 acres planted in Australia, and of these there are some 28,000 acres in Victoria. We ought to give those engaged in the industry every facility to turn their products to the very best possible advantage. Of course in all this we want to protect the revenue also. I would be the last to say that we should introduce a lax system allowing indiscriminate distillation, under which there would be a chance of the Commonwealth being robbed of the proper revenue which this industry should return. But having regard to the proper protection of the revenue, we want to encourage every manufacturer as much as we can. I propose, in committee, to move certain new clauses to gain this end. Of course, the subject is technical, and i t is difficult for the outsider to grasp tbe whole of the conditions and know exactly the amendment'or new clause that will fit the varied conditions attaching to the industry. I therefore submit the suggested amendments to the Minister in charge of the Bill, not in an arbitrary way, but merely as suggestions, which he may take into careful consideration, and which he may modify in any way necessary to protect the revenue, and, at the same time, to safeguard our growers as much as possible. A further new clause which I intend to propose is one which will give .vignerons the right to procure, free of duty, from any bond, such spirits as they may require for the fortification of their own wines, or to go to a vineyard where a still is in operation, or to any person having a still, and obtain the spirit necessary for fortification purposes. Of course, all this will have to be done under supervision by a proper officer, so that the revenue may be properly protected. In order that the inspection may be facilitated, and with a view to obviating delay, I propose that, in addition to the officers of Customs, certain persons" in the various districts should be allowed to act as Customs officers for the purpose of this supervision only. Perhaps a justice of the peace or a police officer might take charge of this particular work, and i t would be a reasonable thing to ask the vignerons to pay a small fee, either in the form of a charge for the services of the inspectors at .so much per hour, or so much per gallon upon the liquor used. However, that will be a matter of detail. With a view to enabling a vigneron to secure the ful l benefit of his orop of grapes, I propose that, in 'the event of his not being able to turn his grapes into wine, he should have the. righb to convert them into spirits. We should not only allow our vignerons to do this, but wc should give them the same facilities as are afforded in America for converting-all fruits into spirits. The various fruits that are grown in orchards, such as apples, pears, cherries, and plums, may be used for the manufacture of pure spirit', and the wine grower and orchardist should have every facility extended to them in this direction. These arematters with which I will deal more elaborately in committee, but they all have the object of not only protecting the revenue, but of extending to our producers every chance to make the most of their labour. Another point that has been entirely overlooked in this Bill is as to when spirits should be placed on the market.  his is a matter of considerable moment in its relation to the health of the people, because i t is well known that the older the spirits are the more healthful they become, because the deleterious essential oils can only be worked off by age, which also develops those pleasant flavours so delightful to connoisseurs. Under our present law,, liquor is put on the market at six months old, but in America and Canada i t is not allowed to go into consumption for two years after i t is made, and i t seems to me that six months is far too short a time to allow for liquor to mature.</para>

                            <para>I recognise that in this matter it would be useless to impose restrictions upon- our own producers unless we bring those who import spirits into the Commonwealth under similar conditions. I t is well known that liquor can be made of the most inferior materials, and that potato spirit, in which sulphuric acid has to be used, and that spirit made from the refuse' of the bounty-fed beet sugar factories of Germany—spirit s which are not allowed to go into consumption in the country in' which they are made—ar e allowed to come into the Commonwealth without let or hindrance. I n England all liquor introduced from abroad has to be branded in such a way as to indicate what i t is made of, and, I think, also the age of it. In many of our States there is no supervision at all, and these inferior spirits come in and are mixed with our own productions, and go through the country as so much liquid damnation. Therefore, we must impose restrictions on imported spirits in the same way as upon those locally produced. I am aware that this Bill has nothing to do with tliat matter, but when the Tariff comes under consideration I shall endeavour to bring about such restrictions upon the imported liquor as will insure that, when our people take their spirits, they may rely on getting a pure and wholesome article. I am told that in Hamburg people can obtain spirits 65 degrees over proof at Is. 9d. per gallon, and that they can buy so-called brandy at 6s. per dozen bottles. This stuff is prohibited from going into consumption in Germany, and is only allowed into Great Britain under certain restrictions as to the description of the contents on the packages in which i t is sent; whilst in these States no control whatever is exercised. We should compel men who send out spirits to furnish certificates as to the materials of which the spirit is manufactured, and its age. In connexion with the distillery at Bendigo, not a drop of liquor goes out without a certificate being attached to the case or cask to the effecfthat it. is made solely of the juice of the grape, and that i t ' is of a certain age. All the liquor that goes into consumption should be similarly accompanied by a certificate as to its age and character, and this should apply equally to imported as to locally produced spirits. In Germany the law is so strict that patent' medicines, have to be accompanied by a declaration on tbe outside of the packets in which they areenclosed, stating the ingredients of which they are composed, and some similar legislation should be passed here dealing with spirits. The Bill seems to me to favour the larger distillers, and I think that this would be a very great mistake. I do not wish to go into technicalities, but I might mention that there are two kinds of stills in use, namely, tbe patent still, and the pot still. The patent still is a comparatively modern invention, which is so constructed that i t rushes the stuff through at a very great rate, and under such conditions that no further distillation is required. By this process many of the deleterious ingredients are distilled out of the liquor, but witb these are taken away those other elements which go so far towards pleasing the public palate. In the evidence given before the select committee of the British House of Commons, i t was shown tliat people would give three or four times as much for pot-still liquor as for that which was produced by means of the patent still. Tlie spirit produced by the patent still is what is called silent spirit, in that i t is destitute of taste and smell; but i t is made up into the various spirits used in commerce, such as whisky or brandy, or rum, by means of colouring and flavouring essences, whereas the public should have whisky made of malt, brandy made of wine, and rum made of molasses. I n the pot-still spirit is retained those flavours that are so much relished by tlie public, but the spirit cannot be used so i quickly as the patent still spirit, because i t takes longer to mature. I find that in England there are ten distilleries, all of which use patent stills. In Scotland there are 126 distilleries, 113 of which use pot stills, and thirteen patent stills, -while in Ireland there are 30 distilleries, of which 22 are pot stills, and eight are patent ;stil.ls. This probably accounts for the greater popularity of Scotch and Irish as compared with the English whisky. This Bill has atendeucy to play into the hands of l i ie patent still owners, because, for one 'thing, the pot stills cannot put through tlie quantity of stuff" that is required. I took tlie trouble to find out of what British liquors are made, and I got the following information from a standard work with regard to •what is termed English brandy—</para>

                        <para>That is the way in which spirits are made, and yet this stuff comes into our country, whilst in our own land we have every opportunity for giving the people a pure, wholesome spirit that will do them no harm. I also wish to draw attention to the wineries. There are four of them, I think, but only one has fulfilled all the conditions imposed by the State Government. Some few years ago, for the purpose of helping the grape growers, regulations were framed by which an amount up to £3,000 could be given to wineries that fulfilled the conditions which were laid down. The object was to set up, in the vine - growing centres, an establishmentthat would take the grapes or the wine from the glowers and treat it, giving the grower a ready market for his produce.. The only winery that has fulfilled all tlie conditions laid down is the one at Maroopna. The proprietors of that winery desire to be allowed to distil just so much spirit as will fortify the wine produced in their own establishment. They do not wish to be brandy merchants. They receive their grapes from 40 growers who cultivate 600 acres of vines in the district. Their object is to produce wine of an even quality year after year, and thus obtain a market for i t in the old country. But they find that i t is absolutely necessary, in order to do this, that the wine shall be fortified. The grapes which they handle will only produce 24 per cent, of spirit, whereas they require-26 or 28 per cent, in order to place their wines upon the English market. I t is for the purpose of making up this difference in the strength of the wine that they desire the privilege of having a still and of using their own material. Surely if we allow a man with ten acres of vines to have a still, we ought to give a similar concession to an establishment where the produce of 600 acres is treated. At the present time this winery has 150,000 gallons in stock, 35,000 gallons of which needs fortifying at&gt; once. In addition to that, tliey are not able, under present conditions, to use their by-products. They have bought 129,000 gallons, and altogether they have made 217,000 gallons since 1898. These figures evidence the benefit which this institution has been to the district concerned. I should like the Minister in administering this Bill to feel that he is not merely the Minister for iiVSCustoms, but also tbe Minister for Trade. From that point of view, be ought to try, not merely to protect the revenue, but also to help all our producers. Personally I am not in favour of multiplying small stills. The multiplication of these, stills has proceeded further than it should have done. "Where there is such a large number we are almost bound to have a leakage. I intend to propose the amendments of which I have given notice in order that all shall have equal facilities for getting spirit for fortifying tlieir wines. The Minister in charge of this Bill asked ine if I would give this privilege to the wine merchants. I am aware that they are making this demand. While I do not know the whole of the details of the wine merchant's business, and am not acquainted with tlie objections which the Customs department may urge, it seems to me a fair proposition that these people should have tlie same facilities under proper supervision. If tliey were granted the same facilities for getting fortified wines, they would be enabled to go to the country, deal witb the wine - growers, and take their grapes, which they cannot do now. The individual wine grower would then find tbat there would be greater competition for his products, better prices for tbe articles, and that he would not be at the mercy of the still owners in the country so much as he is now. I think that the Minister might carefully consider the matter and see whether he cannot meet these wine merchants, who are mostly Australian wine merchants. Out of 'six or seven of them, five deal only with Australian wines. I hope that the Minister will give attention to the views which honorable members from the wine-growing districts have expressed. We do not wish to spoil his Bill, to which he has devoted a good deal of care and labour. It is a very workable measure. We know how great the wine industry can be made to the people of Australia if it is fostered and cared for as it ought to be. This is the opportunity to foster and care for it. I thank the House for the patient hearing which it has given me, and I would ask the Minister once more to carefully consider the amendments which have been outlined by various honorable members, and endeavour if he possibly can to adopt them, whilst at the same time adequately protecting the revenue of the country </para>

                            <para>That is the impression conveyed to my mind. The honorable member spoke as one who is very desirious of seeing that tlie liquor distilled throughout the States of the Commonwealth shall bereallygoodliquorsuch as a connoisseur might take. I do not propose to speak as a connoisseur myself. I shall speak as an ex- Commissioner of Excise, with fifteen years' experience of the control of excise. I speak for the protection of the revenue, which is, after all, the main object we have to effect by this machinery Bill. The amount of revenue to be dealt with by this measure is something enormous: I hope tha.t its effect will be to ensure, at any rate, perfect certainty as to the collection of tlie full amount of excise revenue throughout the Commonwealth. I trust that the Minister, in his position as ' Minister for Trade as well as Minister for Customs, will meet the views of the honorable member for Echiica, and see that matter much more deleterious in its way to those who consume liquor is not introduced-- from outside, as i t is now, to tlie destruction of the stomachs of the people and of the finances of the various State Treasuries. Even those who are not connoisseurs in the matter of liquors know that there is imported from abroad boxes of essences which, with, the assistance of a little spirits of wine,, can be converted into all sorts of spirits, such as brandy, gin, whisky, and the like. These are so far calculated to impose on the ordinary consumer as to be passed in largo quantities down his throat to consume him i n ternally to a very considerable extent. I t has been said that this Bill plays into the hands of the larger distillers. I t is inevitable to my mind that that must be so for the reason, which is patent to everybody, namely, thatunless we restrict the number of distillerswe cannot have that thoroughly effective protection which we desire. The honorablemember for South Australia (Mr. Solomon) spoke of the charge for the superintending officer, who has to be in attendance at a distillery, as being very burdensome for a distiller to cope with. But i t is absolutely essential in the safeguarding of the excise revenue that the process of distillation should all be carefully guarded by some .superinintending officer. I only know of one way in which this condition might be relaxed, and that is by the employment of locked stills. The Minister seems to think that tliere is some provision made for that in the Bill, but I think he will find that there is none whatever. A locked still, of which the superintending officer held the master key, would be such as could not be opened by the distiller without tbe presence of the superintending officer. Liquor could not be removed from it without the presence of the Customs official, and in that way the constant attendance of the superintending officer might be avoided.</para>

                        <para>I happen to have had some experience in charge of a distillery in this State in the past, during which time I obtained some information with regard to the matters dealt with iu the Bill before the House. I desire first of all to compliment the Minister .upon the very clear and precise manner in .which the measure has been drawn. The subject is a highly technical, one, surrounded with considerable difficulties in the way of presenting i t clearly to the lay mind ; but 1 think those difficulties have been successfully grappled with, and that we have a Bill before us which achieves its purposes very definitely and distinctly. So far as concerns the clauses relating to the'larger distilleries, the Bill is everything that could be expected. I n a measure of the kind, every precaution must be taken to safeguard the revenue, and no doubt distillers will always consider that such precautions are unnecessarily harsh; butinview of the necessity that exists for that purpose, the clauses are only what we have a righttoexpect, with the exception probably of clause 49, which calls upon the distiller to pay duty on any shortage that may appear when stock is taken at the end of the month. I know from my own experience that shortages have occurred through accidental ai rcumstances. In fact, the Bill itself in succeeding clauses recognises that possibility. The practice in this State was that if a shortage was reported to the excise officer in the result as finally produced, the Commissioner of Customs called upon the distiller for an explanation. I think the clause should take that form. If tlie explanation is not satisfactory the commissioner should demand payment of the duty. These accidents will happen, not only through the causes referred to in a succeeding clause— the breakage of a pipe, or* something of that sort;—bu t through the low quality and character of the material used for distillation. I t sometimes happens that distillers will buy a notoriously low quality of grain. I am. informed that it matters very little what the quality of the particular substance may be which goes into the still, as nothing but spirit comes out. But the quantity of spirit that comes out may be reduced by the nature of the material distilled; and I do not see any necessity for these drastic provisions calling upon the distiller to pay duty on the shortage, i f he. can give to the commissioner a satisfactory explanation as to how the shortage occurred. Last night the honorable member for South Australia, Mr. V. L . Solomon, referred to the manufacture of vinegar. In some distilleries in America, and also in this State, distilleries have existed for the. purpose of manufacturing spirits to be turned into vinegar. There are some clauses in the Bill which seem to prohibit the carrying on of any other trade in the same building as a distillery. If i t is desired to make vinegar out of spirits, apparently these clauses would prevent that.</para>

                            <para>Th e work can only be carried on economically in the same building where other distillation is going on. The German method of vinegar making, which is very largely practised in the United States of America, and is certaiif to be adopted here, is one for which facilities should be given, and what the honorable member for South Australia, Mr V. L. Solomon, referred to is a matter that will require to be considered when the Bill gets into committee. He also pointed out that under clause 41 of the Bill there are apparently only three ways of removing spirits—tha t is, for home consumption, to a warehouse, and for exportation. I know, however, that there are several related manufacturers who deal with spirits for purposes of manufacture, and i t is a necessity for tbem to be able to remove spirits for such purposes.</para>

                            <para>I f that be so, probably it will meet the case entirely. Methylating is allowed under this Bill, under the supervision of officers, and, I should suppose, without payment of duty. A l l these clauses do not play into the hands of the large distillers, but are only such as are absolutely necessary for carrying on work under the measure. But when we come to the question of the vignerons' licences, the honorable member for Echuca has made out a very strong case why the Minister should reconsider that part of the Bill. I do not know that the honorable member is justified in saying that we should regaid this Bill as something more than a machinery Bill, and should provide for securing a pure spirit at its source, and so forth ; but we can do something with the object of protecting—i f I as a free-trader may be allowed to use the word—th e manufacturei'S of ourown Australian wines, whichl hope will ultimately become thenational drink of the Commonwealth. The curse of the drink traffic is the consumption of spirits. I f we can make the wines which we now so successfully produce in Australia the national drink of Australians, we shall do more in the cause of temperance than anything else I. can think of. We should, therefore, give facilities to vignerons for the production of wines. Although I object to introducing such matters into machinery Bills generally, yet I think we might in this Bill give facilities for carrying on the work I refer to. There are many men in my own State who have vineyards of less than ten acres, but who do a successf u l and really praiseworthy trade in wine-making. They are able to dispose of their wines year after year to regular customers. But I believe tliat many of them would be shut out of a legitimate and profitable trade i f they were prevented from using the still, by reason of the fact that their vineyards were less than 10 acres in extent. On the other hand, if, as has been tlie case in the past, we give facilities for the indiscriminate establishment of stills, much mischief will be done. A great abuse in this respect goes on already. Perhaps the difficulty will be met by giving facilities for obtaining the spirit from larger growers or larger distilleries under certain precautions. I am not in favour of the suggestion of the honorable members for Echuca for allowing wine merchants to have, stills. That would be a very dangerous practice indeed. I n fact I am against granting facilities to wine merchants to have anything to do with this matter</para>

                            <para>lea n understand giving facilities to a winery, but to give them to merchants would be very dangerous. I have my suspicions as to what the wine merchant does already. But I am certainly in favour of giving wineries facilities for distilling spirits for tlie. fortification of wines. We might go further, and, seeing that the wine trade is likely to increase, might give them the further facilities, powers, and privileges, which we give to any other distiller ; because the production of wine will certainly tend towards the end which I have indicated as being desirable to achieve, namely, the production of wine and making i t the national drink of Australia. I do not know anything about the difference between pot stills and French Stills so far as the quality of spirit is concerned, but if the idea of the honorable member for Echuca is adopted we should interfere with certain trades. Spirits are not always distilled for purposes of drinking. They are used for manufacturing purposes—fo r making varnishes and other things in a variety of trades. If people can make a cheaper spirit out of potatoes than Out of malt or barley they should be allowed to do it for purposes of manufacturing. But I heartily concur in the suggestion that this Bill should contain some provision prohibiting the use of spirit before it is matured. I have seen lamentable results from tlie use of immature wines, but the drinking of immature spirit is a most frightful tiling. Precautions ought to be taken in the Bill to prevent the abuse which goes on in many distilleries by the working men and visitors drinking immature spirits there. I n the interests of the,generalpublicweshould increase the length of time—si x months— if not to two years, certainly to eighteen montlis. No spirit is fit for drinking until i t is at least eighteen months old. Spirit six months old, if distilled in this country, must be worse even than the dreadful stuff which has been referred to as being imported from abroad; because the spirit which comes to Australia from England or any other place abroad lias first to be prepared for export from the country where i t is made, then a certain time is taken in bringing i t here, and a certain further time elapses'before it is distributed. It may be to some extent matured during that time. Our own spirits, produced in the Commonwealth, are likely to increase as time progresses, and they ought not, to be issued to tlie public for drinking purposes until they are at least two years old. That would, to some extent, prevent brains and stomachs being wasted away by wretched impure spirits.</para>

                        <para>I do not propose to address myself to this question from the stand-point of what may be called the connoisseur in liquor, or the expert in stills, or even from the revenue standpoint. All these various departments have been excellently represented and dealt with in a manner beyond anything tliat I could hope to reach. Nor do I intend to regard this as a purely machinery Bill. It is to a large extent a machinery Bill, and to tbat extent the observations of the Minister in charge of i t were no doubt perfectly correct; but I desire to draw attention particularly to one or two clauses, which, I think, deserve our earnest consideration outside the provinces to which I have referred. In the first place, i t seems to me that the intention of the Minister cannot have been that men who have embarked on a legitimate enterprise, sanctioned by law, and who have committed as hostages to fortune their money, their land, and experience, should, without rhyme or reason, be deprived of a large portion of their livelihood and future prospects. That is no doubt what the effect of this Bill would be. More than that., unless it is materially altered, it would tend to throw into the hands of the monopolist a large proportion of the future enterprise of spirit making in this country. The particular portions of the Bill to which my remarks apply are clauses 12, 52, and 53, and regulation 103. The result of these various provisions would, I think, be disastrous to a number of. wine-growers, certainly in Victoria, and, I believe, throughout Australia. I had an opportunity yesterday of addressing tlie Minister in company with a deputation representative of a very large proportion of' tlie wine - growers of Victoria, and I should like to hear from the right honorable gentleman before this debate closes what his intentions-are with regard to the matters I pressed upon his attention. The matters to which I particularly refer are these: Under this Bill, which will supersede the State laws to the extent to which i t makes provisions, there will be only two kinds of licences—apar t from the test still licence, which I leave out of consideration for this purpose. The first is the spirit-maker's licence, which is a licence to individuals who provide large capital and very large stills, giving them power to make-spirit from any material for any purpose whether us.ed iu the fortification of wines or for sale. The other licence possible under the Bill will be a vigneron's licence, and that can only be granted to and held by persons who are actually vignerons in occupation of at least ten acres of vineyard in bearing, and who make their own spirit purely for the fortification of their own wines. If they find the possibility of a market for the product of their wines, they must n6t embrace that opportunity, but must leave i t for the large man who can give £2,000 security as a distiller, and they must refrain from making any of the spirit or using their product for that purpose, or must place themselves in the power of the large distiller, and sell their wine to him at any price i t may fetch for the purpose. I do not believe that is the intention of the Minister, but i t will undoubtedly be the result of tbe Bill. I need hardly say that would be going in a direction in which i t is not intend d to go.</para>

                            <para>I do not think that matters one iota. I think men ought not to be prevented from doing what they have done in the past. The statistics show that, so far as Victoria is concerned, there has been a strong endeavour to make a pure spirit, and, after all, i t is the best spirit, out of the grape, and the total amount i^roduced for 1900 was about 16,000 gallons, while of spirits made from other sources the amount was about 307,000 gallons. There is no reason why we should not encourage the small growers as far as we can. If spirits are to be drunk at all, let us have the best available. I think we should not discourage the making of spirits from grapes. We should be going in a direction unexpected, I think, on the part of the Government if we were to discourage the small growers from utilizing their products in the way they have done in the past. I was glad to hear the qualified observations of the honorable member for South Sydney with regard to tho desirability of encouraging these vignerons even to the extent of some protection. I was wondering whether, in those observations we were able to discern a faint glimmer of a dawning belief that sooner or later, and sooner I trust, may burst forth into the noon-day splendour of acknowledged consciousness. However that may be, I trust the Minister will see his way to adopt a modification in this Bill which, while leaving the spirit-maker in the position in which he is placed b3r the Bill, and possibly also confining the pure vigneron's licence to the limited scope afforded by this measure, will also permit of a new kind of license to be called, say, a " wine distiller's licence," as suggested by the practical men I introduced to the Minister's notice yesterday, who desire to make from wine of their own production or of their own purchase a pure spirit for the purpose of sale or for the fortification of wine. The fee for this licence could be an intermediate fee between the distiller's licence and the vigneron's licence, and those holding i t could be superintended as they have been in the past by the officers of fche Government. They could in this way utilize in the local districts of Australia, the products there grown, without being forced to have them brought to Melbourne or Sydney or the large centres, where practically they will be solely in the hands of the large manufacturers.</para>

In connexion with the same idea, i t seems to me- from what I can learn, that the size and capacity of the still required under tlie provisions of the Bill are too great for the small grower. The complaint has beeu made to me, and addressed also td the Minister, that a still with the capacity of 200 gallons, and capable of dealing with 50 gallons of wine per hour, is too great for the smaller man to deal with.</para>

                            <para>I do not ask for anything of tlie kind. But this is the time for dealing with this Bill, and I can understand tliat in cases where tbe spirit is made for fortifying wine, and made by the vigneron himself out of his own product for fortifying his own wind*, and not for the purpose of sale, the only duty imposed—i f any—shoul d be such as would barely cover the cost of supervision. I do not think tliere is any duty charged at all in Victoria upon such spirits, and I think i t is only a shilling a gallon in South Australia. Unless that is done we shall be practically preventing men from manufacturing spirit from their own wine.</para>

                            <para>I drew the attention of tlie Minister to that clause, but i t does not deal  with vignerons. I t deals with d i i -' tillers, and the corresponding clause affecting vignerons is clause 55. I drew the attention of the Minister to that yesterday, and it was suggested tliat thedistance of two miles, referred to in the 'clause, should be increased to five miles. This is one of those matters tliat may be dealt with in committee. I do not think there is very much more that I desire to say except tliat it is provided in this Bill that a vigneron may use the same still as any other vigneron; that is to say that a still may be conveyed from one vineyard to another, and that a fresh vigneron maymse it. I do not see why an arrangement should not be made under the Bill or under the regulations, if regulations&gt; are to be made at all in these matters, by which a vigneron may use a still where i t exists on another vigneron's premises. Precisely the same kind of supervision as is now exercised might be adopted, and the same care might be taken to see tliat proper, guardianship is exercised with regard to the revenue, and I am sure i t would relieve the situation in many instances if such permission were given. I have specially refrained from addressing myself to the minutia? of tlie Bill, but I say that in the matters to which I have referred, unless they are corrected, there will be great danger of men who have carried on their occupations 'previously in a lawful manner and under the protection of the State law being placed at a great disadvantage. I would like, therefore, to have the assurance of the Ministei; that he will recognise the desirability of not insisting upon clauses in this measure which will practically ruin many vignerons whose means are not very extensive, but who are following an occupation which I trust will in the future prove to be one of the most lucrative that Australia will be able to boast of.</para>

                        <para>I n reply. The Government have every reason to be thankful to honorable members for the spirit in which they have approached this Bill, and although there has been some reference to Parliament and phylloxera being equally the enemies of the vigneron, I understand that i t was not this Parliament that was referred to, but some other Parliament that existed in the dim and distant past. Not only in Victoria, but in all the States, a very considerable amount of trouble has been taken by the Legislatures to give every reasonable encouragement to viticulturists, and to those engaged in other pursuits which are happily congenial to the soil and climate of Australia. Now, the chief point that has been made in favour of an alteration of this measure is that, i f we do not amend it, some persons will be injured in their present avocations, and i t has been put somewhat generally that the law now permits of such and such things being done. The remarks which have been made bear chiefly upon the law in the State of Victoria, and although, i f that law has been found to be satisfactoiy in its working, i t might bo a very good thing to copy it, we must recollect that we are not legislating for Victoria or for any other individual State, but for the interests of Australia generally, and that uniformity is absolutely essential. The law iu.,Victoria on tlie subject of distilleries is perhaps of a more liberal character than will be found in any other State, for this reason, that whilst in the other States general provision is made for two classes of distillation—on e being the case of the general distiller who can distil from anything he pleases, and sell where he likes, subject of course to such excise as may be provided, and the other being the vigneron, who is permitted to distil only wine, the produce of his own vineyard, for the fortification, by tlie spirit produced, of his own wine—ther e exists a somewhat different state of affairs in Victoria, for a third form of distillation is provided for by which on the payment of a small fee of £ 1 0 a vigneron may obtain a licence which will permit him to produce practically as much spirit as he pleases, and sell i t practically as he pleases. There are three licences in Victoria, tlie general licence, the vigneron's licence under which vignerons may distil their own wines and make spirits for the fortification only of their own products, and a vineyard still licence under which vignerons .may make brandy from wine only, for sale or export. Under this third form of licence vignerons can obtain practically, as far as they are concerned, all the privileges which are granted to a general distiller in respect of his business. I do not wish to say anything which i t would be impossible to justify, but I am forced to the conclusion that it is highly desirable that these vineyard still licences, which are now used for the production of spirits for sale or export, should be dealt with in the interests of the public, in the interests of the revenue, and from all points of view.</para>

                            <para>I mean that they should be dealt with for the purpose of preventing the abuses that go on at the present time, owing to the absence of supervision— th e necessaiy absence of supervision— o n account of the number and smalluess of the stills, and the variety of the localities in which the stills are to be found. Returns of the spirit manufactured are depended upon for the protection of the revenue, because in the very nature of tilings the Customs officers cannot be always on the spot, and there are such reasons and opportunities for leakage that, knowing human nature to be what it is, it is impossible to do other than believe that abuses occur. It is impossible to do otherwise, with all these small stills spread over the country, than multiply the opportunities for carrying on illicit practices and robbing the revenue.</para>

                            <para>1 do not know if there is much of i t exported, but i t disappears somewhere. The Government believe that all reasonable opportunities should be granted to the vigneron. The system of granting still licences to vignerons was introduced for the purpose of enabling them to fortify their own wine, and the facilities granted in the first instance have been increased to some extent by legislation, and to a further degree by straining tbe law, and I believe that whatever we do in this connexion, we should make the provisions of the Act so clear that tliey cannot be- evaded, and at the same time so effective that we may hold responsible those who ought to comply with them, but do not. With regard to the spirits required for fortifying wines, I imagine the particular flavour does not matter so much, but, in reference to spirit which has to be put on the market, and which enters into our national consumption, I think we ought to be at some pains to secure an article of good, uniform quality, so that the name of Australian spirit may be respected. To license tbese small stills, and to give them tlie power to sell their productions can only result in placing on the market a very inferior spirit, and in competition not so much as regards quality as regards price.</para>

                            <para>her e should be some limitation with regard to the Victorian still licenses which are so much abused, and the fact that these stills exist in Victoria does not afford a sufficient reason for extending the mischief to all the States. Honorable members must know what is happening. I hear of what goes on from men who are well acquainted with what is passing around them, and they know that some of the spirits manufactured at these small stills are retailed to publicans and ftml their way into tlie publican's casks. I do not mind that so much, but when the results of the operations of these small stillowners are put forward as something which they are not, I think that we are called upon to deal with this matter in a firm and decided way. I t is not as if we were not conferring extra powers on vignerons with regard to the fortification of their wine. What we should like to see built up in our midst— I am not discussing the matter now from a revenue point of view—i s distilleries of such size and standing, that due attention would be paid to the spirits made by them, so that they might acquire a name and reputation which would add to the value of their product.</para>

                            <para>Th e size of a distillery enables i t to acquire a certain public reputation for its product, and we know that if the reputation is not a good one the demand for the spirit must decrease. I n the case of a vigneron's licence the State Government allows a vigneron to distil spirits fiom wines produced on his own vineyard for the purpose of fortifying wine which is also the product of his own vine3'ard. I t seemed to us that that was an unnecessary limitation.</para>

                            <para>I am inclined to think that the regulation does not agree with the body of the Bill. That, however, can be altered in committee. The intention of the Government is that wine to be distilled into spirits for tbe purpose of fortifying wine need not be altogether the product of the particular vigneron. Our idea is to enable a number of vignerons to club together and send their wine to one still for the purpose of being distilled—th e produce beiug utilized in the way I have mentioned. In that connexion I contrast the provisions of this measure with those relating to wine-growers' licences under the Victorian Distillation Act. I f honorable members refer to that Act they will find that the words of limitation there used, which confine the distillation to wines the product of the particular vineyard, have been specially left out. There are a variety of other' points which i t seems to me can be better discussed in committee, and therefore I do not propose to deal with them. There is another matter in which the provision is not made so clear in the Bill as in the regulation contained in the schedule. I t was put by the honorable aud learned member for Indi that there ought to be an allowance in clause 49 for matters which had induced a loss of spirit, but which might be satisfactorily explained to the collector.</para>

I feel that they ought to have an opportunity of knowing the provisions which i t contains, of seeing the amendments which are proposed, and of reading the speeches which have been made upon this matter. Business will not be facilitated by pressing the measure forward now, aud I think that the debate should be adjourned.</para>

                        <para>I join with the honorable member for Echuca in suggesting that the consideration of this Bill in committee should be adjourned. In many respects the measure involves a certain amount of technical knowledge which cannot be acquired with the same facility that tlie Minister for Trade and Customs has acquired it. People in the countiy districts interested in the question of distillation should, I think, have an opportunity of considering the arguments which have been submitted. I saw a communication to-day from a' countiy distiller, in which he complains that this Bill has been submitted to Parliament without the manufacturers, who are vitally interested in it, having been consulted, or having had an opportunity of making themselves acquainted with many of its provisions. I f the Minister could see his way to meet the wishes of honorable members it would be only just. The Bill is not merely a revenue and machinery Bill, because other interests are mixed up with i t and are inseparable from it. I should like to obtain some information from my constituents in regard to i t before i t is proceeded with.</para>

                        <para>I hope the Government will go on with the Bill. I f we are to postpone every Bill as soon as i t gets into committee we shall be here till " kingdom come" and then our work will not be done. The Bill was read a first time on the 9th August, three weeks ago, and if people who are interested in i t have not had time to go through i t since then, i t is their own fault. I have seen numbers of deputations waiting upon Ministers and members in reference to this Bill. One deputation has come all the way from South Australia to Melbourne. There is no reason why the Bill should be postponed.</para>

I have purposely refrained from speaking on the motion for the second reading, in order to facilitate dealing with the Bill in committee, but many amendments have been circulated and we need to have, an opportunity of seeing how they will dovetail into the measure. We also want to see how the interests at issue can be reconciled. I t is desirable that there should be a postponement in order that the Bill may be dealt with in a satisfactory manner.</para>

                        <para>I t strikes me that while honorable members demand the consideration which we are only too ready to give them, the Government also may make a reciprocal demand for consideration from honorable members. I t was intimated last night that either the Post and Telegraph Bill or the Distillation Bill would be proceeded with to-day. Certain drafting in relation to the postponed and new clauses of the former Bill has had to be done, and could not possibly be ready in time for the measure to be gone on with to-day. I expressly stated last night that unless we went on with that measure we should proceed with the Bill now before the committee. The Bill has been in the hands of honorable members for three weeks. Is i t not fair, therefore, that we should go on with it, as long as we are careful to do justice to honorable members 1 That justice I promise to do. If there are clauses which involve very strong and prolonged debate on matters which seem to be vital in the estimation of honorable members, and if they can show us that they have not had sufficient time to deal with those matters, we will meet them more than half way by postponing those clauses until tlie rest have been considered. I think that is a fair proposition. , We do not want to drive honorable members into any improper or hasty consideration; but there is a great deal in tlie 83 clauses of this Bill as to which we can make very substantial progress to-night. If we can do that without impairing the rights of honorable members, we might go "on with the Bill, and meet claims of that kind as they arise.</para>

                            <para>ha t is not intended as a limitation. I may say, however, that that form, under clause 37, will need alteration. But I do not want the sense of the committee to be taken upon the interpretation clause as to whether, within the four corners of the Bill, it shall be prescribed that certain materials only shall be used, when the real question at issue is as to what the prescription shall be, if any. We can deal with that better in a new clause.</para>

                        <para>I would suggest that the honorable member for Echuca should accept the suggestion of the Minister, because it is not convenient in an interpretation clause to make what is substantially a new enactment. If the clause as proposed be carried we have the statement of the Minister that the clause shall be recommitted. There are a few definitions which honorable members and the public may find it hard to understand the advantage of. For instance, the word "feints" is- "Feints" means - spirits received into the feints receiver. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am not sure that that definition gives us very much more light on the subject, and it reminds me that when on one occasion there was a discussion in the House of Commons as to what were the duties of an archdeacon, the expert in ecclesiastical law replied to those who required information that an archdeacon was one who fulfilled archidiaconal functions. No doubt this definition of " feints " may convey light to some persons, but I should like to have some better explanation of it. </para>

                        <para>I trust the Minister will also consider the question as to whether a spirit maker's licence should authorize him to sell his spirits to small wine-growers for fortification. That is a point raised by some of the wine-growers and distillers of South Australia, who think tliat as they have to pay a licence-fee of £50, they should have the right not only to distil spirits, but to sell them to wine-growers.</para>

                        <para>A s this clause is to be postponed, I should like the Minister to seriously consider his decision to abolish the right of vignerons to sell certain spirits which they have produced from their own wine. This involves a very serious alteration in the "Victorian law, as already- pointed out by the honorable member for Indi. The clause, as proposed, limits the production of spirits by vignerons to a sufficient amount for the purpose of fortifying their own wine. That is a veiy limited privilege indeed. There are those in this country who are of opinion that i t is not altogether desirable that, in future, the right to -fortify wines should be given. I have received a letter from a wine-grower in my own district, in which he- directs attention to what he calls the painful practice of allowing vignerons' and merchants to fortify their wines. He says that there is scarcely any necessity for fortification for the purpose of increasing the strength of Victorian wines. In Mr. Wilkinson's report for 188S-9 i t is stated that in Victoria, out of 421 samples, the alcoholic strength was found to be 25 per cent., while in France, out of 823 samples, i t was found to be*17 per cent., and in Ger- ( uiany, out of 7S0 samples, i t was found to be 16 per cent.; and this gentleman considered tbat a great deal of the unpopularity of wines in Victoria and other parts of Australia was due to the custom which had grown up of adding to the natural strength of those wines by fortification. I t is clear, therefore, that the right of producing spirit for the purpose of fortification of wine is comparatively insignificant to vignerons, when compared with the right to sell spirits, the produce of their • own wine. And the gentleman who has drawn my attention to the practice of fortifying Australian wine says that the winegrowing industry of Victoria, and of Australia generally, could be largely benefited and . extended i f the growers of wine had greater facilities for turning their wine into spirit, and had also tlie right of selling spirit under proper Government supervision. He is of opinion that the industry, which is now drooping to a large extent, would, under such a provision, be largely increased in extent and usefulness. The Minister has said that under the existing law in Victoria there has been a large amount of illicit spirit distillation. That is a most serious allegation against a number of manufacturers of spirits from wine in Victoria, and I have not, up to the present, heard any evidence produced in support of it. If the Customs authorities have any evidence upon the subject, i t will be desirable for the Minister to produce that evidence upon the resumption of this debate. If there is any danger of the illicit production of spirits under vignerons' licences, I should not feel disposed to support it, but if the production of spirits from Australian wines can be prosecuted under conditions which will secure the protection of the revenue, as well as the health and safetyof the people, i t is worthy of consideration whether facilities for such production ought not to be provided i n this-Bill.</para>

                        <para>With reference to the remarks of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo as to the necessity for fortification, and his references to the alcoholic strength of wines in Prance as being from 17 to 18 per cent., I would point out that the alcoholic strength depends upon the particular kind of grape, and the place where i t is grown. Some grapes have a much higher alcoholic strength than others, and i f they are grown in a hot district the alcoholic strength is increased. The vineyards in Victoria south of the Yarra produce grapes which, I believe, have only an alcoholic strength of 17 to 18 per cent. ; but there they make only the lighter wines, such as Chablis, which do not require any fortification at all. Much of the objecrtion to fortification arises from a feeling of jealousy, and a desire to damage the trade of the northern district, on the part of those who grow wines in the south. I am told that this is a fact by those who understand the subject thoroughly, In north and south a different administration of the business is required. The object of fortifying wines is to insure that they will carry. We want to develop the export trade in wine, and unless we export wines fortified to a certain alcoholic strength they will not stand the journey to Europe and through the Red Sea. With regard to the point mentioned by the honorable member for Bendigo, as to whether growers of grapes should confine their attention to converting the produce of their vineyards into wine, or whether they should also be allowed to convert i t into brandy, we know that the wine industry, in spite of the efforts made to push i t on, is now in a very languishing condition. Many of the growers are getting next to nothing for their produce, and I ask why we should prevent the grower of grapes, who has been encouraged by bonuses and in other ways to plant vines, from getting the fullest returns possible for his labour? This is a most important point, and I should be glad to hear how far the Minister is prepared to go in this matter. If the vigneron is permitted to convert his grapes into brandy instead of into wine, i t will very often mean tlie difference to him between making something out of a poor crop and allowing his grapes to go absolutely to waste. Under certain circumstances good wine cannot be made, but-very good brandy may be distilled.</para>

                        <para>I ask the Minister to postpone this clause. He has spoken very strongly and determinedly in the direction of suggesting that the wine-growers of Victoria have been so dishonest in the past with regard to their vineyard stills that under no regulations that he can devise can they be trusted to make spirit for sale. Now, I desire that, before the Minister goes so far as to take away from these men their avocations, and bring disaster to them, he should' afford the House some ' evidence that such a drastic step is necessary. I should like to know why i t should not be possible to either increase the license fee, i f he thinks that proper, or to improve the system of supervision, and surround the operations with such safeguards as may be necessary to protect the revenue, instead of proposing to deprive these men of their avocation altogether. I do not ask that these vignerons should be allowed to do as they please, but the Minister might reconsider this matter, because I think that he must have been wrongly informed. Prom the Victorian official statistics, compiled up to July 1901, I find that, roughly speaking, a very fair proportion is maintained between the " wine brandy " manufactured in Victoria and other spirits. The total amount of wine brandy manufactured here is 16,000 gallons, and the total quantity of other spirits is 307,000 gallons, and I want to know where the deluge that the Minister has referred to comes from. Where is all the wine brandy that is going about without paying duty 1 I think the Minister' must see that he has made a most serious charge against these vignerons, but some very strong evidence will be required to justify the Minister in taking away from them the rights that they have hitherto enjoyed.</para>

The honorable and learned member for Indi talks about the importance of this question, and forgetful of what he had been saying to the effect that the facilities now offered are not being abused he has directed us to the statistics with reference to the spirits produced here. Does the honorable and learned member think that in regard to the illict distillation that I have suggested, he will find tlie results in these statistics. The honorable and learned member's reference to these statistics shows that he is inclined to the belief that this magnificent industry does not produce so much as he thought, but so far as the figures are concerned they do not show the true results, because the spirits have gone where they ought not to go.</para>

There are practically only four vineyard stills in the colony, and as for their being tin-pot stills it is sufficient to say that they have manufactured 16,000 gallons of brandy from wine that would otherwise have gone to waste. As to the conditions under which these licences have been granted in the past, and as to the supervision exercised over the operations at these stills, I would refer the Minister to the Victorian Customs and Excise Duties Act of 1890, which provides in section 29—</para>

                        <para>Distillation has been carried on in the past in Victoria under these conditions; and i t seems to me that if any abuses have been committed, such as tbe Minister suggests, the Customs officials have been equally as responsible as those who are alleged to have evaded the law. It is only fair to this committee and to those who have licences that the Minister should get information which will show beyond all doubt that the law has been broken in tlie way he indicates. I f the Act has been evaded, there surely must have been means of bringing the offence home to some one, because i t is provided that these still owners cannot use their stills without the locks of the Crown being broken, and they cannot open their stores except by a similar breach. If the facilities now granted to vignerons for making brandy are taken away from them, i t will frequently occur that wine that would make brandy of good quality will actually go to waste, and I think the remedy lies in exercising a closer supervision, and seeing that the revenue is .properly protected in every way, instead of reducing the facilities that are now given.</para>

Honorable members must know that, i f we afford extraordinary facilities for spirit-making, we shall increase the danger appertaining to this particular traffic. Whilst I recognise that justice must be done to those who are engaged in the wine-making and distillery business, and that we are treating with an enterprise which has been subsidized and is established, I think i t should also be recollected that the large distilleries are subject to restrictions and supervision that stills in remote country places cannot possibly be subjected to.</para>

                            <para>I n my opinion a distiller should have the right to sell any quantity of spirits from at least a gallon upwards, either for fortifying or for other purposes. There is, however, no definition of the meaning of the word " retail." I t might include a storekeeper's licence, which in some States authorizes the sale of a gallon. I think i t should be definitely shown that this clause is not intended to restrict the distiller who may desire to sell any quantity from a gallon upwards.</para>

                        <para>I take i t that the clause is a limitation of tbe right of the retailer to have a licence for a distillery of any description. It is on the principle by which in the Beer Excise Bill we provided that the retailer of beer should not also hold a licence as brewer. The distiller of spirits corresponds to the brewer of beer. We drew the line of demarcation between the retailer and the wholesale dealer in a clause of this description in tlio Beer Excise Bill. The clause will have tlie effect of preventing a man who is a retailer from also having a licence of the character referred to. Objection was taken by the honorable member for South Australia, Mr. V. L. Solomon, to the fact that we did not define' what a retailer is.</para>

A distiller may not have a wine and spirit licence and also a distiller's licence under a State law. The clause, witb the amendment in it, will mean that a man may have a distiller's licence under the Commonwealth, and a licence to sell spirits, under the State, provided that he is limited to sell not less than two gallons.</para>

                        <para>I regret that I did not hear the honorable member for South Australia, Mr. "V. L. Solomon, move'his amendment upon this clause. It increases the amount which a retailer may sell to two gallons. I t is a bad proceeding altogether to permit any distiller to conduct a retail business. I know, from practical experience, of a case that occurred in the State of Victoria, where a distiller who retailed spirits was able i n this way, within a very short period, to defraud the revenue of the amount of £3,000. Goodness knows how much more the revenue lost, but that amount is certain.</para>

                            <para>Rathe r than go intocourt, the distiller paid the amount into the department in Victoria. This instance should be some guide to the committee. The Minister would have been well advised to retain the clause as originally drafted, debarring any retailer of spirits from having a licence under this measure. I feel so strongly on the point that I shall not agree to the clause being carried in its amended form, and shall adopt every means in my power to prevent this method of allowing a man to have all tlie benefits of this Bill, and at the same time engage in retail trade. Everyone knows tliat i t is impossible to check the output of spirits from distilleries which have in connection with them retail warehouses or ordinary public-houses, or wine and spirit stores. The dangers of the revenue being defrauded ate increased by fche amendment, and wrong doins,' will be encouraged.</para>

                        <para>I hope the Minister will pay heed to the views of the honorable member who has just resumed his seat. The clause as i t originally stood, was perfect, but the amendment will authorize fche distillatiou of liquor by retail vendors. Tlie amendment weakens the Bill and tends to defeat the purposes of it. It tends towards a leakage of revenue.</para>

Tlie same point as to what is retailing has been raised upon this Bill. Some one suggested one gallon; we thought two ,would be better. Two gallons was the quantity fixed in the Beer Excise Bill, and the Government have accepted two gallons as the limit under this Bill.</para>

All we have done by the specification of a certain quantity is to remove the possibility of uncertainty as to what retailing means.</para>

                        <para>I quite agree with the Minister fchat there must be some definition. Under storekeepers' licences in South Australia the limit for a wholesale seller is one gallon of spirits and two of beer. We are exceeding that limitation when we allow a distiller to sell two gallons. What is the use of allowing a man to distil spirits unless he is permitted fco dispose of them ? The accepted definition of " licensed to sell retail," under the legislation of every State in the Commonwealth at present, refers, I think, to the licensed victualler, who is permitted to sell in small quantities or by the bottle. Under this Bill all I sought to do was fco describe what the word" retail " meant. In a later portion of the Bill honorable members will see thafc ifc is provided that distillers may bottle spirits either in Imperial or reputed quarts or pint bottles, and they must be packed in cases containing one or more dozen of Imperial. or reputed quarts. Ifc is also provided thafc every case that goes out of a distillery must have certain brands or marks put upon it by the Customs officer. Every possible protection is given as to the retailing or disposal of the spirits by the fact that not one single gallon or bottle. of spirits can leave the distillery unless i t is cleared for home consumption and has paid duty. A distillery is as safe as any bonded store. Indeed, i t is practically a bonded store under the control of Customs officers, who can only allow the spirits to be removed from the distillery for home consumption, or for the fortification of wines or for exportation. So that there is an absolute limit which would stop such a condition of things as has been alluded to by the honorable member for Laanecoorie. That condition of things points to a very lax sujiervision in the State of Victoria, aiid shows that the control is nofc as strict in regard to small stills as i t might be. That could not be done under tlie State laws of South Australia. There is an officer continually in charge watching everything that is being done, and with a power to charge the distiller with any deficiency in the quantity of spirit as compared with what the material used ought to produce. I t appears to me that the Minister who framed this Act has really provided for every possible contingency, and it only remains for the committee to consider whether i t will be sufficient to stipulate for a minimum quantity of two gallons. I think that as two gallons of spirits can be sold by any ordinary merchant without any licence at all, in most of the States, that minimum might very well be adopted in this case.</para>

                        <para>My only object in drawing attention to this clause was to secure proper protection for the revenue and for the fair and honorable trader who adheres to the law. The honorable member for South Australia seems to think that the revenue would be sufficiently protected if a two-gallon limit were fixed, but it is the fact of the distiller being also a retailer that will give the opportunity for fraud. The distiller who simply manufactures spirits could not handle small quantities of liquor without a reasonable excuse, but the distiller, who is also a retailer, would be able to dispose of it in small quantities, and one of the most useful checks that we have at the present time would be done away with. I t is impossible for the excise officer to know everything that goes on in a distillery, and consequently the distiller would be able to take away small quantities from tlie worm of the still whilst the officer was engaged in some other part of the building. I object altogether to the distiller having a retail licence, and so far as I am aware there are no twogallon spirit licences issued in tlie Commonwealth. The retailing of spirits does not altogether depend upon the quantity that is sold, but the manner in which the goods are disposed of, and in any case i t would be a mistake to permit of the sale by the distiller of small quantities of his product.</para>

                        <para>I would point out that in many States there tire what is known as " gallon licences," and surely i t might be provided that a distiller could supply those who require spirits in small quantities. The distiller must dispose of what he manufactures, and even though the word " retail" be eliminated from the clause, some limit must be placed upon the quantity that the distiller is to sell.</para>

                        <para>I think the Minister would be acting wisely if he adhered to the clause in its original form. I would rather have the word " retail" defined by regulations. The clause will open the way to distillers to sell their own liquor as retailers, and there will be no efficient check upon them. This is a matter in which the Minister would do well to hold some power in his own hands so that he may deal with cases as they arise,, and as experience may tell him to be necessary, and it would not do to allow anyweak point in the Bill to place him at a disadvantage, possibly for all time. I am speaking solely in the interests of the protection of the revenue and of the Minister in charge of the Excise department.</para>

                        <para>W e had some discussion upon the subject of fraud before the dinner-hour, and I then mentioned that I - thought the force of my observations ought to be directed, not to the few distillers who carried on operations--under licences of the character mentioned by the honorable and learned member for Indi, but to a larger class. After the discussion I made i t my duty to call upon the proper authorities for information, and I find that my latter conclusion was the correct one. With regard to the four or five distilleries that were referred to by the honorable member for.Moira, I am informed that there is excellent supervision over them, and that i t is practically impossible for leakages of the character referred to totake place. 1 am very much obliged to the honorable member for having called my attention .to the matter, and .1" am only too delighted to put things right, .but, at the sametime, I "am appalled to find that the observations which' I used apply, as to the possibilities of fraud, to vignerons' licences generally. They can distil when they please, . they can fortify their wines when they please, and their operations are not under any supervision at all. I f their spirit is put into store they retain the key of the store, and unless I had received the positive assurances which I have received within the last hour or two, I could not have believed that these things were as tliey are now represented.</para>

                        <para>Wit h regard to the objections taken to this clause, I do not see that the observations of tbe honorable member for Laanecoocie have any bearing on the subject at all. If i t is possible for vignerons to obtain tbe spirit the)' require for wine-fortification purposes in small quantities direct from the distilleries the necessity for many of these smaller stills will not exist. I would further point out that ample provision is made in the Bill as to fche method of removing spirits from a distillery, and i t will be the duty of the officer in charge to see that spirits are removed, only in accordance - with these conditions. The honorable member for Luonecoorie has apparently spoken in fche light of his- experience while Minister for, Trade and Customs in Victoria, in connexion with certain very extensive frauds that were committed in a very large distillery : but with tlie supervision provided for under this Bill I think that the fullest safeguards will, be afforded against frauds upon bhe revenue.</para>

                        <para>1 see bhab in the schedule the license fee for distillers is fixed at £50. So far as the State of Victoria is- concerned that means, an increase from £3.0 to £.50, which I think is far too large a sum. Not only so; bub the distiller who produces over 300,000 gallons of spirib is- to be treated in tbe same manner as bhe man who produces only 4,000 or 5,000 gallons a year. I think this clause ought bo be modified very considerably. If bhe licence-fee were fixed at £20 or £2.5 there would be no trouble about i t</para>

                        <para>I would suggest to the honorable member for Echuca tliat bhe question as to the amount of license fee to be paid by distillers should be held over until we have arrived at a decision as to whether vignerons are to have the right to sell spirits, or whether a special class of vignerons' licences might be created giving the righb bo sell spirits. If fche right to sell spirits is given, there may be some justification for increasing the licence-fee. The honorable member tov Ecliuca said that a large increase is proposed in the amount of the licence fee. That is so, and if tlie vignerons are to have the right only fco distil spirits for the purpose of fortifying wines, we may reasonably say that the licence fee fixed is- too high. If, on the other hand, they are to have the right to sell spirits under certain guarantees, then undoubtedly a larger fee than is imposed aifc present should be charged.</para>

                        <para>I think that the committees ought to strike out this clause and the next. This clause provides that where any premises or plant now used  or distilling purposes are nob iu accordance wibh bhe conditions prescribed under this Bill the persons holding such premises shall be given at least three months in which to put tbem in order. The next clause provides that i f the prescribed, conditions are nofc complied with within bhe period men- j tioned bhe licence may be cancelled by Gazelle notice. I bhink there are several distilleries in this State, and probably there are some in the other States, which are not being conducted under these 'prescribed conditions, because a large increase is proposed in tbe capacity of the vats, and in the amount of work to be clone per hour. Why should we disturb people who have been carrying on their businesses for 25 years 'by fche introduction of such a provision as j this 1 I t amounts to nothing more nor less than, absolute confiscation of their property. As a matter of fact, the smaller distilleries are turning out better spirit than are the larger ones.</para>

                        <para>I hope that the committee will not consent to the striking out of the clause. If i t were Omitted, I am inclined to think that the honorable member would find himself in a worse position than he does now. In a matter of this sort we must have uniformity as nearly as possible. At the same time fair regard bas been paid to existing conditions. To allow one set of conditions fco operate in the case of one class, and a different seb of condibions in the case of another class, would be a gross abuse, which could not be tolerated for a single instant. We must deal wifch all alike, favouring neither one nor the other. This clause gives to fche commissioner, where distilleries do not comply wibh the prescribed conditions, power to fix a period of not less than three montlis within which tbose conditions must be observed. Having given notice—whic h he will not do unreasonably—tha t he requires compliance with the conditions within the specified time, he has bhe power, in case of default, to enforce compliance by cancelling fche licence if necessary. Thab is a very healthy and proper provision, and. will by no means have the effect suggested by bhe honorable member. I brusb bhat he will recognise not only the intentions, but bhe true meaning and spirit of the clause, and let us have i t in bhe form proposed.</para>

                        <para>I should lik to hear from, the Minister the reason which has prompted the distinction made between persons who are within two miles of an hotel, and those who are beyond that distance. It appears to me that distillers, if they are within two miles of an hotel, have not to pay anything towards the officer's board, but if they are outside of that limit, they have to pay the whole of the cost. Why is this distinction made? The clause does not appear to be at all equitable.</para>

It would not be a good practice to have an officer on too friendly terms with the distiller. We should not place him at the mercy of the distiller, or in a position where he would simply have to depend on the distiller for the preservation of his digestive organs.</para>

                        <para>I do not see that there is anything in the clause which compels the distiller to board and lodge the officer without receiving payment. I presume that he will receive payment. Unless a distillery is to be established in a place where there is no hotel there is hardly any need for compelling the distiller to find accommodation for the officer; and in any case he should be paid for it.</para>

                        <para>I do nofc think that provisions of this kind are unknown. In the Customs Act we impose an obligation upon the masters of ships to provide accommodation for officers who have to go on board. This plan is adopted in the interests of efficiency and economy. If a failproportion of the cost of administration is not borne by the parties interested ifc will have to be borne by the general public and to be paid out of revenue. The question is—Wha t is a fair thing to provide under the circumstances ? This clause only deals with a distiller pure and simple, and i t is not very likely that distilleries will be established in out of the way-places. At tlie same time, tliere is just a possibility of their being established in remote districts. I n fact, this provision has been inserted on account of a suggestion that it will be needed in Queensland. There is a distillery in that Sfcate which I am informed is</para>

                        <para>Th e Minister has answered everything except the exact point raised. No one says for an instant that the distiller should not in the exceptional circumstances mentioned be called upon to provide food and accommodation for the officer. The question is whether the Sfcate is to demand that of the distiller without an equivalent return. In this case, as in every other, the State gets the licence-fee. I t gets the fee alike from the distiller in a remote place and from every other distiller. Because i t is convenient that the officer should be at the distillery all the time, that is no reason for saying to the citizen who is carrying on his avocation uiider a licence that he shall be bound to keep a servant of the State.- I cannot see any justice in it, and if no one else moves an amendment I shall, to provide that reasonable remuneration shall be paid.</para>

I t seems fco incorporate a very dangerous principle, because i t recognises the obligation of a person who is having his work inspected to feed an officer whom he may regard as inimical to him. That is a very dangerous principle. There is no reason why a person who is compelled to give accomodation for the benefit of the general public in order to see that a distillery is being carried on properly should not be paid by the State for whatever the officer receives in fchat respect. I shall piopose an amendment to the following effect:—</para>

                        <para>As I raised this point originally, I should like to say fchat I do not agree with either the honorable member for Indi or tlie honorable member for Parkes. They would cast a duty on tbe distiller that, I think, should not be cast upon him at all. The licencefee which a distiller will have to pay is £50 per annum, which is much higher than that charged in many of tlie States to-day. 1 am sorry the Minister thinks of postponing the clause, because i t would lie better to settle the point now thafc i t has been raised as to whether we have any right at all, having stipulated that the distiller should provide office accommodation for the officer and pay a licence-fee, to further penalize him by putting upon him the duty of providing . board and lodging, whether i t be paid for or not. In very few instances do distillers live on the premises. They usually have only a watchman there. The difficulty of providing accommodation for an officer may therefore be very great. Adistiller may have to provide a cook for the officer. I hope the Minister will be in a position when we next deal with the question to answer tbe honorable and learned member for Indi as to whether such a provision is imposed in any State of the Commonwealth.</para>

But such a distillery may be more get-at-able through there being a railway or tramway in the vicinity, than one which is less than two miles from the nearest public-house. If the Minister finds ifc necessary to impose such a condition as this i t might be in the following form :—</para>

I t is reasonable enough that the distiller should be asked to provide office accommodation and lodging for the officer. I t is necessary that the officer shall be in attendance at the distillery. But he should not. be billeted upon fche distiller, nor should he in any way be placed under an obligation to him. The officer should pay for his own keep, and not be dependent in any way upon the distiller. We shall thus insure the proper discharge of duties by the officer.

                        <para>—Th e Minister might as well give way with a good grace upon this clause. The illustration quoted from tbe Customs Act is no parallel at all. Although a distillery may be two miles from a public-house, or even 50 miles, there may be 50 houses in the immediate neighbourhood at which the officer could find accommodation. We should leave the officer to find his accommodation where he can. Distilleries cannot be conducted, even in remote places, without hands, and a distillery is not likely to be established in such a wilderness that i t will be impossible for the officer to get a lodging, close at hand.</para>

                        <para>I fail to see in this clause any provision- which compels the distiller to keep books and to furnish returns of the materials used in the distilling operations. Distillers are constantly tempted to use materials -which happen to be cheap and easily procurable, and I think we should provide some safeguards, against potato spirits and other objectionable liquors being produced at our distilleries for human consumption. We have cases occurring frequently in which cheap spirit of- a very injurious character is permitted to masquerade in the guise of a high-class article, and I think we ought to have some check upon the materials used in the production of the spirits turned out by our distilleries. I should like to see a provision made in this clause which would compel the distiller to keep books giving all the necessary particulars, which would be open for inspection by the accredited officers of the excise department at any time. I would not insist, as is done in regard to patent mediicines in Germany, that a certificate should accompany each parcel of spirits, stating the articles used in their preparation, but a careful record should ,be kept so that tlie officers of the Excise department might know what was going on. Unless the Minister thinks that there is sufficient provision made in the Bill already to meet the cases I have referred to, I shall move an amendment in the direction I have indicated.</para>

                        <para>Th e suggestion, of the honorable member for Laanecoorie would not have the effect of protecting tlie- public at all. The mere recording of the materials from which the spirit was manufactured would, not be of any use to tbe public unless the provision in that regard was followed up by a stipulation that spirits made from, certain materials should not be used for human consumption. I would also point out that these distilleries are carried on for the manufacture not only of spirit intended for human consumption, hut of spirit designed for use for commercial purposes. If our distillers can, by using cheap material, produce a spirit for manufacturing purposes ab low cost, i t would be very unwise for the Commonwealth bo restrict their operations to the distillabion of spirits from malt. I quite agree that we ought to do something, if we possibly can, to protect the public against the consumption of spirit produced. from potatoes and other similar materials, and I would like the Minister, if possible, to introduce a provision in this clause that would prevent the consumption, of immature spirit in the distillery itself. I know thafc people who visit these distilleries, and the workmen engaged there, consume large quantities of spirits which are taken direct from the still, and which are very injurious to those who drink them, and I hope fche Minister will kindly note my suggestion.</para>

I am very anxious to devise some means by which the purity of the spirits made in our distilleries for human consumption, shall be assured, and I. shall be very glad when blie opportunity occurs at another stage, to propose that only certain articles : shall be used in the manufacture of spirits for human consumption. I recognise the j force of what the honorable member for j South Sydney has stabed as bo bhe manu- , facbure of spiribs for trade purposes ; but ] i t is not customary in "Victoria to | manufacture spirits for human consumption and for trade purposes at tbe same distillery; distillation of fche lower class spirit being generally confined bo special distilleries. Moreover-, 1 bhink bhab tlie practice of allowing the two classes of distillation bo be carried on in bhe same building is very objectionable. In tbe meantime I move—</para>

It is pointed out by the distillers that sweetened gin is lower than 25 per cent, under proof. The sweetening itself to some extent lowers the proof and prevents i t from being tested by the ordinary hydrometer test. The amendment, of which I have given notice, and which is already in print, is exactly on a line with the Distillation Act of South Australia, where sweetened gin is exempt from the operation of similar provision. move—</para>

I think that both should be placed on the same level. I take i t thafc this provision means that spirits of a lower strength than 25 per cent, under proof shall not be allowed to leave the distillery and to go into consumption. Would i t be right, then, to let spirits under fchat strength leave a ship for a bonded warehouse? If the Minister knows of any good reason why imported spirits under that strength should leave a ship, I do not see why we should apply this provision to a distillery. Wo ought to do justice both to the local manufacturer and to the importer.</para>

                        <para>Th e fact is that we propose to reserve consideration of the question until a more convenient season when we are dealing wifch imports. I do not wish to add anything to the remarks which I have previously made wifch regard to the question of reduced strength. Twentyfive per cent, under proof, ifc seems fco me, is low enough. Indeed, there is a great deal to be said in favour of an increase. But due consideration of the-wishes and interests ot! distillers have induced tlie Government to come to the conclusion at which we have arrived. If, liowever, we see any reason for altering our decision later on we shall not fail to advise tlie committee.</para>

I suggest that the Minister, during the interval between now and the period when this clause is again considered, should, through his officers, make himself acquainted with the' necessity for the new sub-clause of which 1 have given notice.</para>

                        <para>I presume that this clause means that the duty on spirits is fco be charged at the rate of proof. That is to say, i f a spirit is 25 per cent, below proof, one-fourth of the duty is to be remitted. Probably the Minister is aware fchat in some States at present there is a law that a margin of 16-5 under proof is allowed. I f these provisions wifch regard to the margin are to be maintained, ifc will place distillers on a different footing to importers if fche distillers have to pay on spirits 25 per cent, below proof, and imported spirits have to pay either at proof, although they are below proof, or at 16-5, although they are below 16-5. Whilst any difference there may be in the excise duty and the import duty is a matter to be fixed in the Tariff —an d of course i t will be fixed according as our views are free-trade or protectionist— that consideration does not come in here at all. The whole question here is one of deal ing with the strength of proof in each case under the same conditions. This Bill allows duty to be paid down to 25 per cent, under proof. In the Sfcate of Victoria at fche present time duty has to be paid on proof, although the spirit may be less than proof. I n New South Wales one is allowed down fco 16.5 underproof, and below that there is no concession. I do hot think i t is desirable that we should create different systems in thafc connexion, although it may be desirable in the opinion of the Minister, or those who think with him, that the excise duty' shall be less than the import duty. The Minister may take that view from the protectionist's stand-point, but, as I said before, that does not come in here. As to tlie system of charging, I think there should be no difference.</para>

                        <para>Thi s clause apparently provides that once a month the distillery must stop work. I know very little about the process of distillation, but I am informed by those who do know that it will break the. continuity of fermentation, that tlie revenue will be in no way benefited by omitting the clause, and that it is in fact peifectly impossible to work it. It may be for the convenience of Customs . officers to disorg:mize entirely the operations of a distillery, but I do not see why the whole staff of an establishment should be turned on to make up accounts for the information of the Customs department.</para>

All we want to do is to have monthly accounts prepared for the purpose of examination. I f necessary, I shall be able to produce precedents to show that something of tlie kind is necessary. Fermentation will go on, but tlie process of converting the wash into spirit will be suspended; and I understand that no inconvenience will result from that. I propose to make certain alterations, and if on further inquiry i t is found that further amendments are necessary, I shall not hesitate to recommend them to tlie committee. I move—</para>

                        <para>I t is hardly desirable to insert a provision of that sort in the case of an officer demanding admission to a distillery. In the first place, the question would arise as to whom this authority is to be shown, and, in tbe next place, i f the case were one of emergency, the whole object of the officer's visit might be defeated by his inability to produce his authority. The powers of excise officers will not be exercised Ughtly, and I do not think that they should be laid open to the risk of being baulked in their object by being asked to produce tlieir authority.</para>

                            <para>No ; in that case we were dealing with the breaking open of a private house, and we provided that there should be a writ of assistance or a Customs warrant ; but with regard to ships there was no provision made as to the production of an authority. An officer of Customs would have a right to go on board a ship, and similarly, in the case of a distillery, which has to be open to inspection at all times, there should be no necessity to produce any authority. We are proposing to work on exactly the same lilies here as under the Customs Act.</para>

                        <para>I do not think the intention of the honorable member for South Australia (Mr. Batchelor) has been properly appreciated. There is no desire on his part to prevent the proper authority of the Excise officer from being exercised, or that any means of checking what is done in the distilleries should be done away with. I see nothing to prevent an excise officer from producing a general authority such as lie might always carry with him. In this case i t is not so much the excise officer against 'whom the distiller ought to be protected as the man who might get into a distillery by representing himself as an excise officer.</para>

                            <para>Yes , but why should we give such a man free permission to go into a distillery? Supposing tliat a man wanted to go into a distillery for the purpose of obtaining information regarding trade secrets or other matters, he might easily represent himself as an excise officer, and secure all he required without the distiller being any the wiser, and i t seems to me that with the very wide powers given under this clause, the officer should be called upon to produce some authority before he proceeds to break open any door or window, or through any wall, to obtain admission to a distillery. I t would be easy for the officer to carry a general authority from tlie Collector of Customs.</para>

                        <para>I see no reason whatever for fearing that any unauthorized person will venture under this clause to enter a distillery. As the honorable and learned member for Indi pointed out, i f he was disposed to do that he would make no difficulty about providing his own authority. But think of the peril in which any man .would stand who did this kind of thing without being in the service of the Customs department! This clause, which I admit is a drastic one, practically allows a Custom-house officer to commit what in the case of any other citizen who attempted i t would amount to a burglary. Is anybody going to be so foolish as to get himself run into gaol for the sake of breaking into a distillery—an d for what? 1 think a man who might bedisposed to misrepresent himself as a Customs officer would hesitate very long before he operated in tliat way, and .having hesitated, he would refrain from doing ifc. Such a man, instead of attempting to break into a distillery, ought to break into a lunatic asylum, because that would be the proper place for him.</para>

                        <para>I do not believe there is any danger attaching to this clause. Eirst of all, a person who demands entrance must be an officer, and he must declare his name and business and demand admission. I f we are to suppose that he must go through the formality of presenting a document which is to be scrutinized, valuable time may be lost, and the essence of the matter is that there may be an instant admission. I t is in the highest degree improbable that any person is going to personatea Customs officer in the way suggested, but I agree with the observation made that there is no provision in the Bill for the punishment of a person who does personate a Customs officer.</para>

                        <para>I feel sure that the honorable member for South Australia, Mr. Batchelor, is not serious in this amendment, which puts me in mind of the speech made on the Defence Bill by the honorable member for Tasmania, Mr. O'Malley. The honorable member told us that, if an enemy was proposing to invade Australia, wires would be sent to us fco say fchat they were coming to invade us. In the same way here, the honorable member might as well propose that the Customs officer should wire to tlie distillery to tell the people there that he was coming to invade the distillery. When a detective goes to a house to arrest anybody, he does not first call out from tlie outside, " I am a detective, and here is my authority." When he puts his hand on a person to arrest him he says, " I am a policeman," and that is sufficient.</para>

One is a ship and the other is a distillery, and while there is a certain provision in this Distillation Bill with regard to a distillery there is a similar provision in the Customs Bill with regard to a ship. With respect to a ship, under the Customs Bill any officer may board any ship, search any ship, and secure any goods on any ship, and walk them off to the King's warehouse.</para>

                        <para>Ther e seem to be two objections urged against the amendment. The first is the alleged - waste of time which would be involved. Let us see how the clause proposes to save time. Instead of the officer producing a written warrant he is to laboriously gain admission through a wall. That is the way in which the Minister proposes to save time. The second objection is that constables are sometimes allowed to act without a warrant. But I know of no constable who can chip away at the side of one's brick house without a warrant. The clause will allow an officer to appear at any time, and simply by giving his name and intimating that he wishes to look through the premises to gain access without authority. I think the fact that distillers are required to find a guarantee for £2,000 shows that they are men of repute. Though they may sometimes come into conflict with the Customs department, they are presumably honest, and ought therefore to be protected.</para>

                        <para>I hope that the Minister will stand by the clause. The very fact that a £2,000 guarantee is required shows that this is an extraordinary trade, and needs to be dealt wifch in an extraordinary way. It seems fco me that if a man is not doing anything contraiy to the law he has no need to fear the provisions of this clause.</para>

                    <para>I wish to say that the Government will ask honorable members to proceed with the consideration Of the Distillation Bill to-morrow to the extent to which my right honorable colleague has referred. After that I propose to go on with the Post and Telegraph Bill and the Service and Execution of Process Bill. I should go on with the Immigration Restriction Bill to-morrow, but I think that the Post and Telegraph Bill being well on its way, and the Service and Execution of Process Bill being a short measure which. may well engage attention at the end of the week, i t would be wise to dispose of these matters. As soon as they are out of the way I intend to proceed with the. second reading of, and to get into committee upon, the Immigration Restriction Bill. Having already moved the second reading of the Service and Execution of Process Bill, I may possibly take that measure' to-morrow before the Post and Telegraph Sill, because of the drafting of certain amendments. It is a purely legal Bill, and I do not think i t will very largely engage the attention of honorable members.</para>

                        <para>Some time ago we were promised that Hansard would be forwarded to all the members of the State Parliaments. In a recent discussion in tlie South Australian Pariiamen't great complaints were made that no copies of Hansard had been sent. I should like to ask if you, Mr. Speaker, can explain the reason why Hansard has not been forwarded in accordance with the promise mode in this House </para>

I learn that Nos. 1 to 7 of Hansard were sent in accordance with the understanding arrived at. In some way which is not accounted for the supply then ceased. On Friday lost i t was renewed and i t is now proceeding. The numbers missing will be sent on.</para>
