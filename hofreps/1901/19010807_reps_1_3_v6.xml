                        <para>- I cannot say that any definite steps have yet been taken, but the matter has
              been the subject of communication with the Government of Queensland, and of
              consideration amongst Ministers. The position is this - if honorable members . &#39;
              think it interesting to hear a few of the facts bearing on the question : Under an
              agreement, the result of the Imperial Conference of 1887, the administration of
              British New Guinea was intrusted to the Government of Queensland, with the condition
              that, in matters beyond ordinary matters of administration, the States of Victoria and
              New South Wales, which also were contributories towards the cost, should be consulted.
              An administration fund of &#163;15,000 a year was established, to which the three
              States contributed in equal parts. There was a further contribution towards the
              up-keep of a steam-ship, and, I think, of a couple of steam launches, which was
              maintained for a time by the Imperial Government ; but when it ceased, the
              &#163;15,000 a year contributed by New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria was
              increased to something over &#163;20,000 a year- say &#163;22,000 a year. In 1898 the
              original agreement expired, but there had been collected in New Guinea, from its
              ordinary revenue, a fund called &#34; The Accumulated Revenue Fund,&#34; which, when
              the contributions from the States ceased, was applied towards the cost of the
              administration of the Government there. Unfortunately, however, in the absence of
              contributions from the States, that fund became more than exhausted, and provision was
              made, either at the beginning or in the middle of this year, by the three States which
              had formerly contributed towards the cost of administration, for finding a sum of
              &#163;7,000 for the purpose. Another sum of &#163;3,000 has yet to be . provided, and
              must be provided in some way or other by the 30th September. I had the opportunity of
              a short and friendly, but not a formal conversation, with the Administrator of New
              Guinea, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Le</inline> Hunt, when I was last in Sydney,
              and from the facts I gathered then, and the papers which have been transmitted to me,
              I am of opinion that there will be considerable difficulty with regard to the
              administration of British New Guinea, unless the Commonwealth shortly takes the matter
              in hand. The total sum which the Commonwealth will have to find for the administration
              of New Guinea will not be larger than the amount formerly contributed by the three
              States I have named, and it is my intention, when communicating with the Imperial
              Government, to suggest that part of the amount should be found by them - at least
              during the bookkeeping period of five years, which is the period of difficulty with
              regard to the Commonwealth finance. That is as far as the matter has gone. Ministers
              are at one with me in the attitude which we have taken on the subject, and I, am now
              on the point of opening up communications with the Imperial Government, the Government
              of Queensland, and the Governments of the two other States which in. the past have
              contributed, so that we may arrive at some reasonable proposal in regard to the
              administration of New Guinea. I am not, however, disposed to act in this matter - even
              if it were right to do so, and it is not - without the authorization of Parliament,
              and any proposition which the Government have to make on the subject will be duly laid
              before both Houses of this Parliament. The financial burden does not seem to be likely
              to be a large one. In the first instance &#163;15,000, and afterwards &#163;20,000 a
              year, was found by New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, and if that amount were
              found by the whole Commonwealth, the expenditure per head would be less than the
              expenditure per head on the population of the three States named. The main question of
              policy for this Parliament to decide will be, whether it is right to cause to be
              handed over to us, if- possible, the administration of British territory in New
              Guinea. I would add one more word about a group of islands which are a continuation of
              the Pacific chain from New Guinea - the Solomon Islands. I have nothing like as much
              information with regard to them as I have with regard to New Guinea ; but it seems to
              us that if preliminaries can be reasonably arranged, and the burden of the
              Commonwealth not unduly increased, it might be a desirable thing that we should
              acquire . the control of the Solomon Islands so far as they are in British hands,
              either as an adjunct to New Guinea and part of the same territory, or as another
              territory &#39; of the Commonwealth. That, however, is a matter to be decided by
              circumstances. Honorable members will see without my addressing any argument to them,
              that the matter presents very grave grounds for consideration in relation to the many
              questions which press upon the Commonwealth with regard to, not only the Pacific
              Islands, but also&#39; the conditions of its own industry, and that it is eminently a
              matter which cannot be settled by&#39; the administration- alone, but must await their
              proper consultation of this Parliament. </para>

                    <para class="block">It gives me pleasure to make a departure from the track that we have
            been in, so far, of considering Bills mainly connected with machinery, and to place
            before this House a measure of definite and high policy such as this. Honorable members
            will know that the principles upon which this Bill stands have been approved in several
            places, notably in Natal, in New South Wales, in West Australia, and I think in
            Tasmania. A Bill of a very similar character to this has been introduced in South
            Australia, but has not yet become law, and similar legislation has been attempted in
            Victoria, but has not yet been consummated by -the passage of an Act. Now, I need make
            no apology for calling this one of the most important matters with regard to the future
            of Australia that can engage the attention of this House, nor can I emphasize too
            strongly the necessity that those who desire legislation in this direction should
            endeavour to put aside their minor differences, in order to secure the acceptance and
            passage of a law which will be in the main effective for its purposes. Honorable members
            are familiar with the questions and discussions which have alternately assisted and
            obstructed the passage of measures of this kind, and they know, of course, as well as I
            do, the action which conferences have, taken on this subject up to the present times            There have been intercolonial conferences of Premiers, and these matters have been also
            considered in conferences in the mother country, at which the States have been
            represented. Legislation on the Chinese question has taken place in most of the States            and legislation on this broader question has in some of them not yet arrived, but yet I
            believe that an immense majority of the people of Australia, not only taking the
            Commonwealth as one, but in each State separately, are in favour of dealing with this
            question in such a way that a uniform law may reap its natural and legitimate advantage
            of prevailing universally throughout the Commonwealth, so that leakages, which can now
            take, place in one quarter notwithstanding strong legislation in another, may no longer
            be permitted to take place. To indicate what has taken place in the various States, I
            will give a few particulars ; but I will preface these by stating what has been done in
            Natal. At the present moment I am going to confine myself to the main features of the
            Bill which are contained in clause 4 which, in reference to prohibited immigrants really
            concentrates the main purposes of the Bill in the first sub-clause. The first part of
            the clause provides : - </para>

                    <para>There are further provisions dealing with persons likely to become a charge upon the
            public or charitable institutions, idiots and insane persons, persons suffering from
            diseases of a certain character, persons who have been convicted of crimes involving a
            certain punishment, and prostitutes or persons living on the prostitution of others. As
            Isa id before - not, however, to the extent of wishing to sacrifice any of the other
            provisions - I think the main provision of this Bill as concentrated in the first
            sub-clause of clause 4, is the one about which any battle we may have amongst us - if
            there should be any - is likely to be waged. Now, legislation of this kind, as far as
            the British colonies are concerned, began, as honorable members are well aware, in
            Natal, and if honorable members will compare the provisions of the Natal Act, as I read
            them, with the provisions in the first sub-clause of clause 4, they will see the extent
            of the difference between that Act and the Bill now before them. The provision in the
            Natal Act, corresponding to that in subclause (a) of clause 4, reads as follows : - </para>

                wish to deal with this matter in a perfectly reasonable spirit. I only desire to
                point out the legislative scope of the provision in the Natal Act, not for the
                purpose of making any comparison in favour of the present Bill, but with a view to
                enlighten honorable members as to what has been the course of legislation elsewhere.

                            <para>- No ; I do not propose to do that. The administration in this respect of the
                Bill will be within the discretion of the Minister. He will have it within his
                discretion to change the passage to be submitted in such a way as to prevent the
                possibility of any collusion or of any attempt to learn off a passage when the
                applicant knows no more of English than is contained in that passage. The chief
                difference between this Bill and the provisions of the Acts to which I have referred
                is that the English language is indispensable, and the words must be dictated by the
                officer. I have had no hesitation in regard to making the English language
                indispensable. I do not see what claim there is on the part of any one seeking                admission, who may be undesirable, to choose the language in which his test shall be
                taken. Subject to any objection which may arise on the ground of international
                comity, it is firmly established by the well-known case of Mus grove and Chun Tonga                Toy - if it needed to be established - that there is a right on the part of
                governments and powers as between each other - and the whole of the British Empire
                is looked upon by foreign nations as one power - to exclude such persons from their
                territory as seem to them undesirable. </para>

                deal conclusively with questions of that kind. That right exists , on the part of
                civilized powers <inline font-style="italic">inter se.</inline> We propose, however                not to rest on that mere right, because discrimination in the application of it is
                likely to lead to trouble. We propose, therefore, to add to the sanction of
                international law the sanction of what is called municipal law - that is our own
                internal law to an- extent which will enable us to meet any objection &#39;of this
                kind, and at the same time to satisfy conditions laid down by the Empire in its
                dealings with other powers. In other words, having seen that there are difficulties
                in the application of this doctrine from time to time - that its&#39; application                as a matter of international right has led to objections on the ground of a
                -violation . of international comity or courtesy - we see no reason why we should                not convert this into an equal law, applying, so far as the power given to us is
                concerned, equally to all persons, without distinction of race, colour, or original                in order that in our dealing with the law ourselves, subject to our own
                responsibilities to each other, we shall not be subject to interference by any power
                whatever. </para>

                            <para>- It is the whole point of all Bills of this kind ; honorable members will see
                that such Bills on the subject as have been passed, crystallizing into law powers of
                this kind, have not been subject to any objection on the part of the Imperial
                authorities, nor have they been made the subject of any protest by powers outside                It is because the Bills have been based on the educational test that objections have
                been avoided. The moment we begin to. define - the moment we begin to say that every
                one of a certain nationality or colour shall be restricted, while other persons are
                not, then as between civilized powers, amongst whom must now be counted Japan, we
                are liable to trouble and objection, which go to postpone the making of outlaws and
                which lead to difficulty in the application of them. These things should therefore
                be avoided. I am fain to confess that I see no other way except to give a large
                discretionary power to the authorities in charge of the administration of such a
                measure. If we once begin to particularizedd we have to meet the objections already
                urged, some of which no doubt have been considered effectual. It places a Bill                produced under such circumstances, necessarily between two fires. It is between the
                fire of those who wish to make its provisions more drastic and more specific; and
                the fire of those who consider the provisions a piece of organized hypocrisy, and
                altogether too severe for a civilized power to adopt. I quite admit that we are
                placed between these two fires : but we can rely on the common sense of the House to
                find a way through these fires, so as to produce a measure that will be
                internationally- effective and practical amongst ourselves. </para>

                            <para>- It was not in defiance of the Imperial authorities, because I am credibly
                informed that the Royal assent to that Bill was asked for by telegraph and given                There was never any intention on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir
                  Henry</inline> Parkes to practically defy the Imperial authorities, although on
                one occasion he delivered himself under circumstances of provocation of heated
                words, which I am sure were- no part of his political character. We are in this
                position : As to the undesirableness of certain, classes of immigrants, I suppose we
                are all practically agreed. I suppose we are all agreed that this is an evil in
                itself even more carefully to be watched than that other serious question of the
                importation of South Sea Islanders into Queensland. Unless- this importation be
                watched with the utmost care, I am convinced that it will become even a greater
                evil. Without desiring to go to any unnecessary extreme in this matter, I think it
                is right we should crystallize into this law the powers which internationally we
                absolutely have - powers which any other nation can exercise against us if- they
                choose - in order that in the wise exercise of administration, without leading to
                any breach of international comity or to any. complications, we may lay down
                conditions which do not discriminate between country and country, between race and
                race, or between origin and origin, but which, at the same time, gives us power to
                exercise a wise discretion in admitting or refusing to admit immigrants whom all
                Australia has practically agreed shall not enter within her bounds. That is the .
                position of this main provision of the Bill might quote from a despatch from the
                Secretary of State which puts the position of the Imperial Government beyond all
                doubt. Honorable members will recollect that a Bill to amend the Sugar Works
                Guarantee Acts of Queensland was presented in the early part of this year for the
                Royal assent, having been reserved by the Governor of Queensland. </para>

              wrote a despatch to the Governor of Queensland,.and a copy of that despatch was sent
              to the Governor-General of the Commonwealth. I want honorable members to understand
              that I am not entering into a controversy whether the position taken up here is
              rightly or wrongly taken up. I only draw attention to the fact that the questions
              raised by the Secretary of State need not, and I think cannot, be raised in regard to
              the Bill I am introducing. In this despatch <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                Chamberlain</inline> says - </para>
                        <para>It (the Sugar Works Guarantee Bill) embodied a disqualification based on place of
              origin, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> practically a distinction of race
              and colour. Any attempt to impose disqualifications on the basis of such distinctions              besides being offensive to a friendly power, is contrary to the general conceptions of
              equality which have been the guiding principle of British rule throughout the Empire              Disqualification by educational tests Such as are embodied in the immigration laws of
              various colonies, is not a measure to which the Government of Japan or any other
              Government can take exception in behalf of its subjects ; and if the particular tests
              are not regarded as sufficiently stringent, there is no reason why more stringent and
              effective ones of a similar character should not be adopted. But disqualification for
              certain employments on the sole ground of place of origin is a measure to which any
              Government concerned may reasonably object, and in the present Bill the aboriginal
              natives of two continents and of the Pacific Islands are disqualified solely on that
              ground. </para>

                            <para>- It seems to me to bear a remarkable similarity to it ; our memories are
                different. The passage I have quoted will show honorable members that a certain
                stand-point may be taken with reference to legislation of this kind if precautions
                are not observed,- and yet it will show how easy, it is to avoid difficulties of the
                kind by adopting the care which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline>
                himself appears to have indicated as proper in his despatch. That is the course we
                have adopted, although not claiming any originality in the provisions of this Bill                We have had plenty of other Bills to guide us. We do not pretend to say that we have
                evolved something extraordinary or something particularly novel. I wish to lay it
                before honorable members, however, that there is a direction which has. proved
                futile ; that there is another which has proved successful, and that it is the
                successful direction which we are pursuing, not claiming any merit for it, but
                simply adopting it because it is the only road to similar success for ourselves.

                            <para>- I am obliged to the honorable member for the interjection, for it enables me
                to quote from an interesting conversation which I had with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moor,</inline> who represented Natal at the celebrations in
                connexion with the inauguration of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                  Moor</inline> told me that the Natal Act had been successful, but he said it had
                been adopted too late. He remarked : &#34; My strong advice to you is to . legislate
                on this subject early. We have, locked the stable door after the horse has gone
                out.&#34; I suppose that the wrong horse had really come in before the stable door
                was locked. Honorable members will know that before legislation in Natal was passed                imported alien and coloured alien labour, quite apart from Kaffir labour, had
                in flowed to such an extent that it was in an enormous majority in that country. It
                practically remains so to-day, notwithstanding that further influx is stopped to all
                intents and purposes. That is a lesson to us, and it is for that reason that I
                welcome the interjection which reminded me to put it before the House. It is a
                reason for us not to wait until dangers become almost insuperable, but to legislate
                against the thing, not because it is a pressing killing danger at the moment, but
                because, even if it is not, it may in a moment become so. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that it will, u as it has stopped it elsewhere. If we find that it
                does not, then we shall come to the Legislature for further power. Honorable members
                need not have any doubt in this connexion. If a measure of this kind proves
                ineffective in preventing the influx of that class and race of persons who ought to
                be kept without the limits of a white- Australia or a civilized Commonwealth, then
                we are not going to rest upon failure, but march forward to success. Honorable
                members, in whatever part of the House they sit, may take it as being one certainty
                that, if we remain in office and find a measure of this kind effective, we shall
                bring down legislation which will make it thoroughly effective. We shall do so, not
                only for the reason* generally urged, because while there may be sympathy with the
                labour aspect of the question, I have yet to say there are grounds even more
                conclusive than those of labour for the prevention of this kind of immigration.

            instinct of self-preservation, quickened by experience. We know that coloured and white
            labour cannot exist side by side ; we are well aware that China can swamp us with tip            single year&#39;s surplus of population; and we know that if national existence is
            sacrificed to the working of a few mines and sugar plantations, it is not the Englishman
            in Australia alone, but the whole civilized world that will be the losers. Transform the
            northern half of our continent into a Natal, with thirteen out of fourteen belonging to
            an inferior race, and the southern half will speedily approximate to the condition of
            the Cape Colony, where the whites are indeed a masterful minority) but still only as one

            same point. These are the fears which Professor Pearson expresses. They are not
            justified by the facts of to-day, but they may be justified by the tendency of the facts
            of to-day. If we see the facts of to-day exhibiting a tendency which, unless checked            are likely to result in what Professor Pearson foresees and foretells, then it is not in
            the distant future, but to-day, that action should be taken. Professor Pearson writes            on page 83 : - </para>

              international conferences, and welcomed as allies in quarrels of the civilized world              The citizens of these countries will then be taken up into the social relations of the
              white races, will throng the English turf or the salons of Paris, and will be admitted
              to inter-marriage. It is idle to say that if all this should come to pass our pride of
              place will not be humiliated. We were struggling among ourselves for supremacy in a
              world which we thought of as destined to belong to the Aryan races and to the
              Christian faith ; to the letters and arts and charm of social manners which we have
              inherited from the best times of the past. We shall wake to find ourselves elbowed and
              hustled, and perhaps even thrust aside by peoples whom we looked down upon as servile              and thought of as bound always to minister to our needs. The solitary consolation will
              be that the changes have been inevitable. </para>

                    <para class="block">Is that not something to guard against ? I do not pretend to say that
            there is any immediate danger of that kind, but unless we are careful dangers of that
            kind are inevitable as time goes on. I do not want to exaggerate them in any way. I do
            not want to pretend that unless we pass this Bill today we shall have these people
            coming in in such volume as to overflow and throng our marts, our fields, and all places
            of our industry. But it is enough that if we do not take action and take it speedily            both the commercial and industrial difficulties of this kind of labour will be growing
            tendencies which we shall one day repent our not having checked. These are not new
            opinions of mine ; I have expressed them over and over again, and hold them as strongly            and I think even more strongly, with reference to the prevention of certain Asiatic
            influxes, as I did when a youth. There is one more thing to be said on this part of the
            question. It is not a desirable thing in our legislation to make discriminations which
            will complicate the foreign relations of the Empire. It would be of untold evil and harm
            to us - and likely to lead to troubles even rivalling those which the future may bring
            forth to us from these causes - if we were to take such action as would not practically
            make our legislation much more effective, and yet at the same time would diminish the
            ease with which the Empire could assist us in these matters, and be with us in others. I
            take it that is&#39; not the desire of this House or of this Parliament. Whatever views
            of the future may be entertained in any quarter, there is the practical realization of
            to-day that the Empire to which we belong is one that is worth belonging, to. It is one
            which has held within it most that we are proud of, and one which when compared with
            other Powers certainly does not lose in the comparison as to its humanity and justice            It is, therefore, better to belong to it, unless somebody can give me reasons which we
            have never heard yet for being, independent. While that relation is maintained - and
            long, may it last I say- while it remains, let us take the full advantage of the help
            and assistance which the Empire may give us in matters like this. On the lines it has
            laid down, it can be a sturdy and trusty Mend; Let us follow those lines, knowing that
            in our belief the following .of them will be effective, and knowing that the Empire
              <inline font-style="italic">i%</inline> ready to assist us even further if we find that
            any evils, whether ethnic al or national, of war olaf industry, threaten us in the
            future. It is for us to deal with the question to-day as we find it, and we shall make a
            mistake <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> saying that we will deal only with
            facts, when tendencies as strong as facts have to be checked in the same way. There are
            tendencies here which, to my mind, are sufficiently dangerous for us to take action. We
            are not doing very much more than the States have done. Our legislation will, in aye            large measure, only replace that in force in three or four of the States. It does not
            carry tilings very much further, but it tends to prevent what I described a little while
            ago as leakages - the difficulties which arise when we have legislation of this kind
            operating in three or four of the States, but the States after all exposed to
            transferences of population- of this kind arising from the fact that they do not protect
            themselves in each of the States in the same way. </para>

            this clause are these. In the&#39; clause we propose the dictation of the words is made
            essential, and I have already given a reason for that. The next difference is that the
            word &#34; English &#34; is substituted for the word &#34; European &#34; in &#39;the
            New South Wales Act. The reason for that is that if a man wants to come into an

            that country are concerned in his knowing, is the language which will enable them to- do

            that every man must know our language. That is a matter for him, and lie can learn any
            language he likes from his birth or from any other time ; but if he is going to do
            business with people who speak English, and wants to come into their country - the terms

                            <para>- I quite saw the purpose of my honorable friend, when he put his first
                question. I quite saw what was passing in the honorable member&#39;s mind, and what
                he wanted information upon. I do propose to say that we do not want a man who can
                speak only Austrian, . Italian, or any other language that is not the English
                language. But I do say this also, that we shall not work an Act of this kind without
                national complications, unless we are able to lay something down which in the outset
                distinguishes nothing between race and colour ; but as to language there is not the
                same complication at all. We are entitled to impose a test of that kind. The English
                language is our language, and the man who wants us to impose a test of any other
                language should show some reason for his preference. Ours is the right language to
                use. I know that the re may be difficulties, and that there have been difficulties
                in the past, when people who have been asked to write down sentences in some
                language or other have shown that they can easily surmount that obstacle, with all
                the quick witted ness of some of the Eastern races. I believe that this provision
                with respect to the English language will help to overcome that difficult}1, and
                that is another reason for the clause in its present form. I do not propose - and no
                doubt the honorable member had this in recollection when putting his question - that
                the test should be subject to proclamation from time to time by the Governor-general                in Council, because I do not propose to give any opportunity&#39; for anybody to
                find out the words which are to be used, by having them notified by proclamation. I
                think it is far more effective and useful that the proper officer, to prevent any
                collusion or trickery, may be able to change from day to day and from time to time
                the passage in English so long as it is a fair passage in that language. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I &#39;have considered that, and the difference is one which 1 am sure my
                honorable and learned friend perfectly well understands. It is not for us to say
                that we do not aim this Bill in every direction. On the face of it, as my honorable
                and learned friend knows, the Bill is not aimed at any specified nations. He also
                knows that Governments must be credited with common sense, or it is no use
                committing to them the administration of such measures at all. This amount of common
                sense and discretion must be credited to the present Government and its successors :
                that they will discriminate between those cases in which desirable civilized
                immigrants are seeking admission, and cases in which those seek admission whose
                presence is baneful to us in the present, and may be much more so in the future                That is the reason why I have asked for the power to be given to the Government in
                these broad terms. I ask the House to give the powers to the Government in the
                belief that they will be administered in that spirit of just broad international
                humanity which characterizes the people of the various civilized powers - powers
                which it cannot be doubted for a moment contain within them safeguards of
                administration which will enable the Governments to meet a common evil. That is what
                is intended, and that is what the Bill contains. That is why I ask for larger powers
                than perhaps my honorable and learned friend is willing to give. If my honorable and
                learned friend can convince this House that we are asking for powers which it is
                undesirable for Parliament to give, I wish him joy of his task. Now let us go a
                little further. I have told honorable members why we think it necessary to take
                large powers - namely, because large powers are necessary to deal with the cases we
                have to meet, and also because it is necessary to give a large discretion to the
                Government in the belief that they will not act harshly in those cases which are not
                within the evil we wish to meet. That is the common-sense view of the matter, and in
                that acceptation I throw myself on the common sense of the House. With reference to
                the other provisions of the Bill, some of them exist in other measures of the same
                kind, but others do not. In New South Wales the Legislative Council cut out some of
                these provisions from the existing Act, the application of which is confined to such
                matters as come within paragraph (a). But I take it that it is a fair thing that the
                remaining powers should be given, nor can I see what hardship is involved in the
                granting of them, always presupposing that common-sense is exercised, and always
                presupposing also that the difficulties which may beset men of business on rare
                occasions are not to be allowed to overcome the national policy of excluding not
                only those who are undesirable by wa3&#62;- of race, but also those who are
                undesirable by way of condition and conduct, or by reason of the danger to the
                public health which they carry with them. Such are the remaining paragraphs ; and as
                to those I ask for similar powers to be given by the House and under similar
                conditions. That is, that of course the existence of the Ministry depends upon the
                administration of an Act of this kind. If the Government falsify the trust committed
                to them, of course they will be in the hands of the House. But if, on the other
                hand, it is animated by common interest, being a Ministry, although I do not claim
                any particular advantage from the fact, belonging to the soil, it is inconceivable
                that in a matter of this kind they are likely to frustrate or belie national
                interests in the exercise of the discretion vested in them. But unless the Bill is
                so safeguarded as to give that discretion, the particular complications which are
                likely to frustrate legislation of the kind are likely, to be effectuated in facts                I am not going to delay honorable members with any long description of the remaining
                clauses. It is provided that persons possessed of certificates of exemption, which
                wherever they are granted will be given for such reasons as I have laid down, will
                be excepted from the prohibitory provisions of clause 4. It is recognised that it
                would be unwise in some extreme cases to prevent the admission of certain persons                If, for instance, as we are told over and over again, a prince in his own country
                desired to visit our shores he would be exempted. We have seen such princes visiting
                Australia in the past. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, we have even seen princes coming here as cricketers, as my honorable friend
              reminds me. There are some things which it would be high-handed and arbitrary to do              This is not a distinction between rich and poor ; but a distinction belonging to
              humanity and civilization, and that alone should be intrusted to the Government in
              administering such a measure. Members of the King&#39;s land or sea forces are exempt              as are also the master and crew of any public vessel of any Government. The master and
              crew of any other vessel landing during the stay of the vessel at any port in the
              Commonwealth are also exempted ; but this exemption is subject to a most stringent
              provision, partly taken from a proposal which was in the Victorian Bill some time ago
              - perhaps not quite so stringent - to the effect that a master of a vessel may be
              required by the officer under the measure, before being permitted to clear out from or
              leave the port, to muster his crew in the presence of the officer. Then if it is found
              that any person who according to the vessel&#39;s articles was one of the crew when
              she arrived at the port, and who but for that would be a prohibited immigrant, is not
              present, the person in question is not to be excepted by the measure, but is to be
              considered a prohibited immigrant. Otherwise he would have been present at the muster.

                            <para>- It is, I admit, a very large order, but self-preservation is the highest law ;
                and I have no doubt whatever that, in accordance with that principle, this is a
                desirable provision, for the Commonwealth to enforce. Then &#39;it is provided that
                any person duly accredited to the Government of the Commonwealth by the Imperial 05
                any other Government is to be excepted ; and there are provisions excepting a wife
                accompanying her husband, and excepting children apparently under the age of
                eighteen years. These are exceptions which will go far to satisfy honorable members
                that it is not intended to create any undue hardship under the Bill. It is also
                provided that a certificate of exemption may be granted to a person who can satisfy
                an officer that he has formerly been domiciled in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- If a person satisfies the authorities that the Commonwealth has been his home                it is presumptive evidence that he is of a &#39;class tolerated in the Commonwealth                Certificates of exemption are to be in force for a specified period only, and there
                are provisions against the evasion of the measure. There are also provisions for the
                temporary landing under a bond of persons who wish to satisfy the officers of the
                Commonwealth that they are entitled to land, but this is to be done under the
                condition of the forfeiture of the deposit in case of the person not making that
                proof, and being then obliged to leave. A prohibited immigrant who contravenesor
                evades the provisions of the measure is guilty of an offence for which he will be
                liable, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for not more than six months, and
                to deportation. I admit that there are difficulties in regard to the matter of
                deportation, but I think that they are difficulties which the House is inclined to
                face. In my opinion deportation, where a person has merely entered our territory                and has been guilty of an evasion of the provisions of this measure, can be carried
                out without any particular liability either of litigation at the suit of the person
                deported, or of complications arising out of international lav. Then masters                owners, and charterers&#34;! of vessels are liable to a penalty of &#163;100 for
                each prohibited immigrant who is brought into the Commonwealth by them. 1 know that
                objection will be taken to the clause, and I admit that it is a very stringent
                provision, but it will be for the House to consider whether the due administration
                of the law does not demand such a provision. A question for the consideration of the
                House will be whether the administration of the measure can be properly conducted if
                the masters, owners, and charterers of vessels carrying prohibited immigrants are
                exempted from any proceedings against them if such prohibited immigrants are allowed
                to land, seeing that the persons coming within that definition are persons whose
                class will subject them to the suspicion that they are prohibited immigrants. It
                will be said that the kind of persons who are likely to be a charge upon the people
                of the Commonwealth - persons who are idiots or lunatics, who have loathsome or
                infectious diseases, or are prostitutes, or persons living upon prostitution, will
                be very difficult to detect ; but on shore it does not seem very difficult to detect
                them ; and if it is not very difficult to detect them on shore, it ought to be
                possible to detect them at sea. </para>

              be explicit and frank in its discussion, and to put, to the best of my ability, all
              the considerations affecting the minds of the Ministry in regard to it. It has been
              found desirable to make a distinction between this and the companion measure dealing
              with the importation of South Sea Island labourers, which is shortly to be introduced              Honorable members have known from the beginning that I proposed to bring in two Bills
              on the subject of immigration restriction, and there is already on the notice paper a
              motion dealing with the other Bill to which I refer. The reason why the whole matter
              has not been dealt . with in the one measure has been explained over and over again by
              me in this House. The questions dealt with by the two measures stand on quite
              different footings. It is scarcely in order for me to go into the question with which
              the other Bill will deal,&#39; but I may point out to honorable members that in
              discussing that measure we must take into consideration the conditions under which the
              employment of South Sea Island labourers within the Commonwealth has grown up,, and
              the conditions under which it may best be abolished. That it must be abolished I think
              I shall be able to show when I bring forward the other Bill. I am acting now in
              accordance with a promise which I made to the country before Parliament assembled, and
              which I have since made to this House, that I would deal with the whole subject in two
              separate measures, to both of which I hope to obtain the assent of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I assure the honorable and learned member that the point he refers to does not
              arise here. This is only a definition of quarts and pints. It says that quarts and
              pints shall include also reputed quarts and pints. In clause 40 we provide for the
              mode in which beer may be removed from the brewery, it says &#34; in vessels or in
              quarts or pints.&#34; If we had not this definition in clause 5, it could only be
              removed in true quarts and pints, and not in reputed quarts or pints, which I am sure
              the honorable and learned member would not desire. The difficulty which he wishes to
              discuss arises under clause 26, in which it is provided that, subject to the
              provisions of the Tariff, the duty on the bottles shall be computed according to their
              reputed contents, but it does not arise at the present moment. </para>

                        <para>- At the instance of the honorable member for Coolgardie, I consented to the
              insertion of a provision that brewers, so long as they do not sell less than one
              gallon, should not be prohibited from selling greater quantities At the moment I had
              not the various Acts in front of me, but honorable members know that it is highly
              undesirable that the brewer should combine in the one person the almost rival
              positions of brewer and retailer - there is, of course, a good deal of not unnatural
              jealousy in matters of this sort. I have altered the clause to meet the Western
              Australian case, but I do not think that that should be allowed to govern the
              situation. Brewers should not be allowed to sell so small a quantity as one gallon              because not only would they be brought more into competition with the retailers, but              no doubt, from the revenue point of view, it would be a mischievous thing if ribs and
              drabs were to be dealt out from the breweries. In New South Wales the minimum is two
              gallons, and in Victoria and Queensland the same, whilst in South Australia and
              Tasmania it is five gallons, and in Western Australia one gallon. I think that on fair
              consideration of existing conditions - with which it is not desirable to unnecessarily
              interfere, although we must have uniformity - the proper place to draw the line will
              be at two gallons, and I propose to alter the clause accordingly. I move - </para>

                    <para>- I think the Minister will find that the licence-fee of &#163;25 fixed by this
            clause will work very harshly against some of the smaller brewers in Western Australia            The fee is a heavy one to start with, and will be specially felt by the brewers
            employing in some cases only three to four men in Western Australia where no fee is
            payable at the present time. In the north in the Coolgardie country the breweries are 60
            miles apart in some cases,&#34; and it will be impossible to have an officer to watch
            each one of them. The brewers can only be harassed by the imposition of such a heavy
            fee, as their output cannot be regulated, nor csm they be watched in the way that the
            Minister proposes. Some arrangement might be made by which the smaller breweries should
            have to pay a smaller licence-fee than the larger breweries, because it seems ridiculous
            that a brewery employing only two to five hands should be taxed to the same extent as
            the large breweries in Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, employing, in some instances            thousands of men. The Minister might devise some means by which graduated fees might be
            imposed, because these small breweries have many disabilities to contend with, in the
            way of heavy carriage rates, which place them under a considerable handicap            notwithstanding the high prices they get for their beer. </para>

                        <para>- This licence-fee is not intended as <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> tax,
              but rather in order to secure some contribution towards the expense connected with
              keeping an eye on the breweries, and after what the honorable member for Coolgardie
              has said, it seems to me there is very little doubt that the Western Australian
              brewery, however small, will require as much looking after as a large one. In
              introducing federal legislation we must deal uniformly with the various States, and I
              find that while no fees have been charged in Western Australia or South Australia, in
              New South Wales the licence-fee for a city brewery is &#163;30, and for a country
              brewery &#163;20, and in Victoria and Queensland a &#163;25 licence fee is charged. We
              have, therefore, provided for what has been generally imposed, and the difference
              between the case of the large and small brewer is met by the excise duty on the
              output. I think that wherever a brewery may be situated, whether it be in Western
              Australia or Queensland, the proprietor ought not to object to pay 10s. a week for the
              privileges .he enjoys. </para>

                    <para>- This clause is a departure from our Victorian Act, inasmuch as it provides for a
            cash deposit. It is in the option of the collector to demand a cash deposit, instead of
            the bond as provided for in the Victorian Act, and in the case of a large brewery the
            deposit would amount to as much as &#163;6,000. The hardship inflicted on the smaller
            breweries would be relatively as great, and I would like to see provision made for the
            acceptance of an approved&#39; bond. </para>

              insist upon a cash deposit, as such a thing would be monstrous. This clause was taken
              from the Customs Act, which provides for a bond to be approved by the collector; but
              it was pointed out that in some cases this would be rather inconvenient, and that the
              option might be given to merchants to give cash security. </para>

                    <para>- Under this clause it is provided that no brewer shall sell spirits in any place
            within 50 yards of his brewery. I understand many brewers sell wines and spirits, and
            that, as a matter of convenience, their wine and spirit stores are situated within the
            same block as their brewery premises. It has been pointed out to me that this provisions            which is supposed to be directed against distillation on the brewery premises, is
            absolutely useless, because the brewery is so open to the public and to the employes
            that it would be impossible to have any illicit distillation going on there. This
            provision is in the New South Wales Act, but it has been practically a dead letter, and
            I would suggest that it should be excised from the Bill, because, while it would involve
            many brewers in great expense, it can be of no practical use. </para>

          much in Victoria, but in other States such a provision will prove a very great hardship to
          those who are already carrying on businesses by selling in a brewery. Considering that the
          penalty for a breach of this clause is &#163;100, I think the Minister should so amend it

          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir MALCOLM</inline>McEACHARN (Melbourne). - In connexion with
          this clause a point has been raised by the honorable member for Bendigo, which he has
          asked me to deal with. Under clause 5, a question was raised as to the definition of
          quarts and pints, and the Minister gave an explanation which was satisfactory. But the
          latter portion of this clause provides that the actual contents shall be taken to be the
          dutiable contents, unless a contrary intention clearly appears in the Act imposing the
          excise. I think that it would be better to deal with this question of quarts and pints          and of reputed quarts and pints in this Bill.. It would be satisfactory if the Minister
          gave us an assurance that when we come to deal with the Excise Bill, he will provide for
          the anomaly that would be created if we allowed quarts and pints, and reputed quarts and
          pints to be considered the same thing. The brewer at the present time pays 12s. 6d. on a
          hogshead of beer, whereas under the provisions of this clause he would have to pay
          something like 17s. 6d. per hogshead. The matter is too serious to allow of this clause
          being passed without some . assurance from the Minister that it will be dealt with when
          the Excise Bill is under consideration. </para>

                        <para>- This clause merely provides that in the absence of a provision to the contrary
              in the Excise Bill, honest measure - I use the word in its nicest sense - shall be
              insisted upon, and that the reputed quart or pint shall be in reality a quart or pint
              so far as duty is concerned. I prefer to deal in this Bill with the general question
              that bottles which are represented as holding a certain quantity, shall be considered
              to hold that quantity for the purposes of duty, unless some different provision is
              made on the subject. We know that there is practice, which is recognized to some
              extent, that six quarts, twelve pints, and 24 half-pints go to the gallon, instead of
              four quarts, eight pints, and twelve half-pints. Honorable members will notice that
              this provision will only apply if the Act imposing the Tariff does not make a
              different provision. No doubt there will be some provision made on the subject, but I
              cannot say whether it will be of the character desired by the honorable member for
              Melbourne. I think, however, that we ought to lay down the rule which I have
              indicated. </para>

                        <para>- The two provisions ought to be made uniform. Why should a man in importing
              liquor have to pay not on the actual but on the reputed contents, whilst the local
              brewer is allowed to do otherwise ? In Victoria the excise and the import duties are
              the same. The State Parliament has adopted the same scale for both, which is a correct
              principle to follow. Here, however, we are acting differently. Having passed a
              provision that imported goods shall pay according to their reputed contents, we have
              no right to allow the local brewer to evade the payment of revenue by paying on the
              actual contents. I presume that we are adopting these provisions on the assumption
              that they will be put into force. If it is all a farce, if we intend that this
              provision shall be altered by subsequent acts, we should leave it out of the Bill
              altogether. The clause in its present form gives greater opportunities to the colonial
              manufacturer than to the importer. </para>

              that the clause should be altered in one. way, while the honorable member for North
              Sydney desires to have it amended in a precisely different direction. In all the
              circumstances, I think the committee will come to the conclusion that it would not be
              a bad thing to let it alone. It will be absolutely necessary to deal with the matter
              under the Tariff. </para>

          here and imported bottled beer. I should like to see the Minister, in a moment of
          weakness, yield a little more. He has done some good in adding the last lines to the
          clause, and as this matter affects a large industry, I hope he will give us some idea of

              circumstances I think it is well that the committee should divide on this question. I
              do not think that we ought to allow the clause to go through without some protest.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir MALCOLM</inline>McEACHARN (Melbourne). - I have to raise
          two points in connexion with this clause. Paragraph (b) provides as to beer in loose
          bottles, or in bottles in baskets, that the duty stamps shall be affixed on the face of
          the cart-note. That means that in cases like the Cascade Brewery, in Tasmania, whose store
          is 2&#189; miles away from the brewery itself, duty will have to be paid at the brewery          although really all the work is done at the store. I recognise that there are
          some difficulties in connexion with the matter, but I would ask the Minister to consider
          whether nothing can be done to meet cases of the kind. Paragraph (c) makes provision for
          placing the duty stamp on the outside of the case where bottled beer is packed in cases          These cases are often old, and the stamp might very easily be rubbed off. I think it would
          be well to provide in this case, as in paragraph (b) that the stamp shall be affixed to
          the face of the cart-note. </para>

                        <para>- I would point out that there are few instances of the description first referred
              to by the honorable member for Melbourne. We cannot possibly lay down a general rules              The mode of collecting the duty is on removal of the beer from the brewery. That is
              the only safe way of doing it. If we are going to allow the beer to be carted 2&#189;
              miles before we collect the duty, we shall, perhaps, be asked to allow it to be carted
              50 miles, and we shall never be able to draw a line. I do not hesitate to say that, if
              any attempt is made to meet cases of this description, the result will be disastrous
              so far as expense is concerned, and it will lead to loss of revenue. As to the matter
              of fixing stamps to cases, as provided in paragraph (c), the responsible officers tell
              me that it is much better to have the stamps on the case when beer has to be sent any
              considerable distance. It is safer from the point of view of revenue ; and it also
              enables any officer to see, by a glance at the &#39; cart-note, that the duty has been
              paid. No further investigation is required. </para>

                    <para>- This clause provides that beer may be returned when it becomes unfit for human use
            before more than one-twentieth of it has been drawn, and that a refund of the duty shall
            be made if it is returned to the brewery- within 30 days after removal. I understand
            that this is rather a grievance, especially in a- State like New South Wales, where beer
            travels very long distances by rail and by river, and sometimes takes 30 days to reach
            its destination. In such cases the brewer would be unable to obtain a refund of the
            duty. Then, again, I understand there is a feeling that some injustice is inflicted in
            making a hard-and-fast rule as to the withdrawal of one-twentieth of the contents of a
            vessel containing beer. Very often it is not until one. comes to the latter half of a
            cask that it is found to be unsound. I do not know whether the Minister would agree to
            any modification. </para>

              subject. I know that he does not indulge in beer, and probably does not know anything
              about the. excise on it. Doubtless, however, he has been capable of reading his brief
              sufficiently for the purpose. Evidently this, like many other proposals which have
              emanated from the Government, is founded upon Victorian conditions. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for Wentworth was wrong in stating that this clause was
            evidently founded upon Victorian legislation. So far as I have been able to ascertain
            there is no legislation in existence that provides for anything less than the refund of
            the duty on the whole of the beer that is returned, provided the officer is satisfied as
            to the genuineness of the claim. I should like very much to see the Bill kept in line
            with existing legislation on this matter. Instead of stipulating that one twentieth shall
            be the minimum quantity taken out, we should provide for a refund of duty on any beer
            sent back. I also think that the30 days&#39; limit is too short. This means that the
            brewer in many cases will have to pay duty on valueless beer.. In New South Wales and
            South Australia beer has to be sent very long distances by rail and river, and very
            often it takes two or three months to reach its destination. I think the time limit
            should be extended, and that the provision in regard to the percentage should at least
            be modified. In my opinion it ought to be taken out altogether. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member sells stock to a man and it is found to be
              unsatisfactory, it is not the custom for the seller to take the stock back. But in
              this case, if a brewer sells beer to a customer and some of it goes bad, he credits
              the customer with the bad beer which, he takes back from him. In the one case the
              seller does not take the goods back, and in the other case he does. I do not profess
              to know much about brewing and the sale of beer, but the case having been represented
              to me, I felt it to be my duty to bring it under the Minister&#39;s notice. This Bill
              proposes a departure from the existing practice, at any rate so far as concerns the
              legislation of Victoria. If the beer is actually returned and credit is given for it
              to the buyer, surely that beer is not fairly liable toduty. </para>

                    <para>- I think the proportion one - twentieth mentioned in this clause is rather too
            small, and that the time allowed for the return of the beer is . too short. Curiously
            enough I remember appearing in a case at the end of last year, in which the charge
            against a carter was that he had tapped certain barrels of beer. When the beer was
            delivered at its destination in the country, it was found to be something less than 100
            gallons short of the proper quantity. The explanation was that the beer had to be
            delivered a long way back in the country, and it took something like 30 days to get
            there. That was the excuse of the carter for consuming 100 gallons of beer. If the
            Minister is going to make any allowance as to quantity, I think it should be a tenth.

            is used, not on beer that is not consumed. The provision &#39; as to one-twentieth of
            the beer having been consumed should be altered, and the time for the return should be
            extended ; because there are certain parts of Australia where the distances are great
            and from whence it is impossible to send back the beer within 30 days. </para>

                    <para>- I am willing to meet the committee to the extent of making the one-twentieth an
            eighth and the 30 days 60 days. Although this provision is not founded on any existing
            legislation, it is justified by the defects of existing legislation. It is wonderful how
            lenient we are in regard to brewers. First their hogsheads of beer only pay duty on 50
            gallons, and we also make an allowance on half-hogsheads and kilderkins. We extend a
            greater tenderness to them&#39; under existing legislation than to any other
            manufacturers or importers. Suppose a manufacturer pays customs duty on an article which
            he imports, and afterwards finds that his customers do not like it ; he is not able to
            get a refund. If a man pays duty on spirits and does not find them to his taste he
            cannot get a refund. The importer in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred, although he
            may have a&#39; house in London from which he exports, is not responsible for the
            quality ; but the brewer is the manufacturer and can make good beer if he likes, and can
            take care of it. What has been the result of existing provisions in this respect ? We
            have had in the shape of returns some of the most shocking agglomerations of ullages, of
            which it is impossible to conceive. A clause of this kind is needed for the protection
            of the revenue, and if I had acted on the suggestions which have been made to me I
            should have gone even further. If beer legitimately goes bad and more than a reasonable
            quantity has not been taken out of the cask, a reasonable return will be made if it is
            sent back ; but if the ullages of 50 casks are collected and put into one, and a refund
            is claimed on that, it is not fair. The matter is not one on which the Government feel
            warmly, but we think an alteration is necessary, and what we propose is not
            unreasonable. </para>

              know is the quantity of material - sugar, malt, hops, and other things used every
              month, and the value of the stamps used. The brewer is required to keep an account of
              all material received into the brewery every month, but without a return of the stock
              in hand the Customs officer would have too complicated a task in ascertaining what
              quantity of material was used in any one month. Once a brewer has ascertained what
              material he has in hand, if he keeps an account of all material received into the
              brewery, and of all material sold and used, he will not have much difficulty in
              striking a balance each month, and that is all the schedule requires. The same
              condition has to be complied with in Queensland. </para>

                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">I should like to say a few words upon it. In my opinion the control of
            the defences of the States by a central authority is one of the greatest justifications
            for federation. The divided authority and administration of the past was becoming almost
            a public nuisance. That can well be illustrated by a reference to what occurred in a
            neighbouring State about a year ago, when certain disturbances broke out in China. The
            Ministry of New South Wales on that occasion came down to the Legislative Assembly of
            that State, of which I was then a member, and asked their approval of the despatch of
            some 200 men, known as the Naval Brigade, to China. Although I and others protested
            against the men being sent, as involving a useless and foolish expenditure, inasmuch as
            all the military powers of Europe, together with America and Japan, were interesting
            themselves in restoring order in China, we were met by the answer - &#34;All you say may
            be very true, but that jealous little State of Victoria, which is always trying to
            euchre New South Wales,&#34; and to pose before the world as the leader of the
            Australian States, has arranged to send a- small number of men to China, and we must
            follow suit.&#34; As a result the people of New South Wales were committed to an
            extravagant and useless expenditure. While it appears to me that there is no provision
            in the Bill now before us which would allow of the despatch of an expedition of that
            character without the approval of this Parliament, I trust that the honorable and
            learned member for Northern Melbourne, whose capable speech on the subject I have read            will take care, when, in committee, he devotes himself to the improvement of the Bill            that it is made plain that no Ministry shall have power to arrange for any expenditure
            of the Kind without first receiving the sanction of Parliament. It would be no answer to
            say that Parliament is not in session, because I can conceive of no crisis so sudden or
            so urgent that it would be necessary to take action before Parliament could meet - it
            could be summoned in a very short time indeed. We had another illustration a few years
            ago when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dalley</inline> - a very eloquent and
            accomplished gentleman, but in whom, as a politician, I lost any confidence I ever had -
            set the example of sending to the Soudan a still more useless expedition of New South
            Welshmen than the China one. In my opinion it was one of the most wild-cat and silly
            expeditions possible, and yet it was sent behind the back of Parliament. Parliament was
            never asked to sanction its despatch, and it is useless for a Ministry to come down
            afterwards and ask to be whitewashed. I merely instance these cases to emphasize this
            great point - that there should be no case of emergency which would justify a Ministry
            in sending an Australian force out of the country without first having obtained the
            sanction of the National Parliament. I trust that the honorable and learned member for
            Northern Melbourne, who is very capable in these matters, will take up this questions            and if he does I shall be very happy to support him. The Bill has been spoken of as a
            skeleton Bill. I hardly know what is meant by the term, except honorable members imagine
            that it should contain full and definite particulars as to the number of foot and horse            and how the forces are to be raised. I do not think that is necessary in a Bill. It is
            enough for Parliament to indicate its temper to the Government, and give them a free
            hand in raising the forces which are considered necessary after getting expert military
            advice. Our power will come in after the Estimates are submitted, because I trust that
            the House will never approve of any lavish expenditure on military matters. All the
            Government require to know is the temper of Parliament to guide them when forming the
            forces and considering the expenditure. I perfectly agree with much that has been said
            in this debate. It was not my good fortune to hear most of the speeches, as I was absent
            from the State, but I gather that much was said on the necessity of establishing a
            factory for the making of arms and ammunition. I am sure the House entirely agrees that
            we should not constantly depend on getting arms from Europe. In New South Wales the
            other day they were very deficient of arms, and when an order was suddenly sent to
            Europe, arms could not be supplied. There is a similar deficiency, no doubt, in all the
            States. What we ought to have is; not only an ample supply of arms, but the means of
            producing arms and ammunition within the territory. In regard to this question a very
            important phase of -railway construction comes in. &#34;For example, it is highly
            necessary that we should have a railway system connecting the various capitals of the
            States beyond the reach of an enemy, to meet the contingency of a successful effort to
            break or destroy a portion of line. From Melbourne to Sydney the railway is almost
            perfectly safe from interference by a foreign force, but it is not so with the northern
            extension from Sydney. For the first 90 miles from Sydney to Newcastle the railway runs
            along the coast, and it would not be very difficult for a portion to be destroyed. I
            would direct the attention of the Government to the necessity of making a continuous
            system through the interior, and beyond all chance of being interfered with by an enemy            They should open negotiations with the Government of New South Wales with the object of
            having a branch extended from Werris Creek, on the northern line, to the western line            so as to make a continuous extension from Brisbane to Melbourne. This defence question
            will largely justify a railway extension to Western Australia. If the Government can
            show, as I hope they will be able to show, that it can be made without any great annual
            loss, the- military aspects of the question will go far to justify its construction. I
            should scarcely have troubled to speak at all at this late stage of the debate if it had
            not been for the honorable and learned member for Bendigo referring to the necessity of
            establishing an Australian navy, and the honorable and learned member for Northern
            Melbourne speaking of our naval defence as not only the first- line of defence, but as
            the second line and the third line, indicating that he regarded naval defence as the one
            essential thing, and a military force as almost unnecessary. I believe many other
            honorable members have spoken much on the naval aspects of the case. I am entirely
            opposed to the establishment of an Australian navy. I heard the honorable and learned
            member for Bendigo contrast Australia with England, and say that a navy should be our
            first line of defence. But the position of Australia is entirely different from that of
            Great Britain. Australia is an island it is true, but it is a continent as well, and to
            imagine that we can establish a navy to defend 8,000 miles of coast line is to imagine a
            thing which is far beyond our financial capacity. England is in a very different
            position from Australia, for she has not only a world-wide commerce and various
            possessions throughout the world to defend but her own existence depends on free
            intercourse to and from her shores. If the </para>
                    <para class="block">British fleet met with a serious reverse - and I suppose that is not
            beyond the bounds of possibility - and her ports became blockaded, Great Britain would
            be brought in a very few weeks to her knees to sue for peace, for the simple reason that
            she could not support her own people. But the ports of Australia might be blockaded for
            years, and we should suffer no serious inconvenience because we are capable of. feeding
            and clothing our own people. Once we start to create an Australian navy we must go on
            and keep pace with every modern improvement. A ship built to-day will be practically
            useless ten years hence. Once we begin this sort of thing let us do it with our eyes
            open, and know that it is to be done at an enormous expenditure. The English fleet looks
            very well on paper, but after all said and done its true strength depends on its more
            modern vessels, and the mad race for naval supremacy is going on now more ferociously
            than ever. In England, I believe, 1901 is a year of extreme activity. The British
            Parliament has voted over &#163;16,000,000 for the construction of ships and armaments
            alone, quite apart from other naval expenditure. She is adding fifteen battle-ships and
            twenty-two armoured cruisers to her fleet. Other countries are doing exactly the same
            thing, although not to that extent, because it is not necessary. Prance is adding six
            battle-ships and five armoured cruisers to her fleet. Germany is adding nine
            battle-ships, and Russia nine battle-ships and nine cruisers. Even Japan, during the
            first six months of this year, has added two battle-ships and three cruisers to her
            fleet. And so it goes on year after year. Once Australia started this game I guarantee
            that it would cost more than the taxpayers could stand. Honorable members should take
            seriously into consideration the fact that this Bill, in clause 37, gives the Government
            power to build ships without asking Parliament for authority. If we are to establish a
            navy, then it should not be a toy one. It must be one up to date, else it would be
            useless. If we were to start with six battleships it would cost eight millions or nine
            millions, and practically every year we should be adding a million to the expenditure on
            our fleet. The position of Tasmania presents the only difficulty in the matter            Australia could not be successfully invaded, nor do I think that any hostile power could
            successfully blockade our ports. Our risk is- very slight if we except the position of
            Tasmania, which might be made a depot for a foe. But I think we would always be able            without the necessity of having expensive battleships, to send sufficient men to
            Tasmania to eject any force. Our tine policy is to abandon all idea of having a naval
            force. I hope&#39; that honorable members will realize what a naval force would mean. We
            might have a dozen warships and yet one substantial battleship could riddle the whole
            lot with a few shots. We must have ships up to date, and if we once started we must go
            on year after year meeting every modern improvement to keep our navy up to a proper
            standard, and that would &#39;involve an expenditure which this Federation could not
            undertake. We are part of the British Empire, and if old England became involved in some
            great crisis and found herself confronted with perhaps two or three first-class European            powers, it is perfectly true that she could not spare great battleships out here. Some
            authorities have gone so far as to say that she would even abandon any idea of keeping a
            great fleet in the Mediterranean, and would concentrate her whole strength in the
            Channel to defend her shores, once she had met with any slight reverse. But still there
            would always be a class of vessels which would be useless for modern warfare, and yet
            would be quite good enough to face an}&#39; ships which any foe would be likely to send
            here, or vessels that would at all events be useful as quick cruisers for conveying
            troops to Tasmania for the defence of that State. We should fortify our capitals, and            what is of equal importance, our coal depots ; and we should entirely - I use the word
            &#34; entirely &#34; advisedly - rely upon the land forces for the defence of Australia            Furthermore, these land forces should be established as nearly as possible on a purely
            voluntary basis. I am in entire accord with the honorable and learned member for
            Northern Melbourne in his denunciation of what is called militarism, and I should
            deplore it if this military spirit were to be greatly fostered in Australia. We have
            been going through a period of excitement in Australia, and we shall pass through1 the
            inevitable reaction, and, perhaps, the danger is that the reaction may go too far. I
            consider it will be necessary to have a body of thoroughly trained military men to work
            our forts and for the purposes of instructing the other branches of our defence forces ;
            but I hope this House will always put its foot down against any undue fostering of pure
            militarism. We should strive to encourage rifle clubs in every possible way ; but To            think it is absurd to provide that any forces or corps now in existence shall remain in
            existence under the Bill. Surely we must change our conditions in the light of modern
            experience. I do not profess to know much about these matters, but I know enough to
            quite realize that such a picturesque force as the lancers may be useless- I say
            &#34;may be&#34; - in modern warfare. Why, therefore, should it be provided that any
            such force now in existence shall be retained <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We
            must reform our defence forces in the light of the best experience we can get, and as
            mounted rifles seem to be much more effective than lancers, I trust that that particular
            arm of the service1 will be encouraged throughout Australia. While I am opposed to the
            construction of a purely Australian Navy, I trust that the Ministry will ask this
            National Parliament to rise to something like a true conception of its responsibility as
            representing a portion of the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- The idea is abroad that we should construct a navy, and if we are to construct
                it, we should certainly control it. However, what I wish to say is that, whilst I am
                opposed to the construction of a purely Australian Navy, at Australian expense and
                to be under Australian control, I trust the Government will ask the Parliament to
                rise to a proper conception of its responsibility and vote an adequate sum towards
                the support of the British Navy. With all our talk about patriotism, we are now
                giving an insignificant vote of &#163;126,000 per annum as a contribution from
                United Australia to the British Navy. I almost wonder that the British Government
                accepted it. Whilst the people of Great Britain have for years past contributed not
                less than 1 2s. per head towards the- support of the navy - -and it will cost
                something like 15s. per head this year for the same purpose - we, the people of
                Australia, are paying towards the support of the navy of the Empire, of our loyalty
                to which we so greatly boast, a paltry &#163;126,000, which works out at something
                like 8d. or 9d. per head. Surely this is not worthy of a great Commonwealth like
                this, which boasts so freely of its loyalty. Loyalty and patriotism have not much
                respect from me when they are exhibited only in time of excitement and hysteria. I
                want this Parliament, in a time of peace, when there is no hysteria, to rise to a
                sense of its responsibility, and vote a far greater sum than the miserable amount we
                are now paying towards the Imperial Navy. I do not desire to go into the details of
                the Bill, but I wish to refer to the danger pointed out by the honorable and learned
                member for Northern Melbourne of giving the Ministry of the day too much power under
                the emergency clauses of the Bill. I am entirely opposed to any idea of enforced
                service. We have required no enforced service in England, and neither are we likely
                to require it in Australia. When it comes to a question of forcing our citizens to
                fight our glory will have departed, indeed. I shall be in favour of excising from
                the Bill anything that bears the slightest resemblance to a provision for
                conscription. I am glad to see the Minister for Home Affairs in his place, because I
                wish to refer to a matter . upon which he has expressed himself. I remember hearing
                or reading of some Member of Parliament in New South Wales having asked the Minister
                for Home Affairs, while he was Premier of that State, if he was going to allow New
                South Wales to be made a recruiting ground for enlisting Imperial soldiers, and my
                right honorable friend said &#34;No,&#34; and that he would take care nothing of the
                kind was done. I noticed that a question was asked of the Prime Minister here the
                other night in reference to the same matter, and that the Prime Minister, without
                giving a definite answer, said he would have something to say about the matter later
                on. I do not understand quite what was meant by these questions and answers ; but                if they mean that the Imperial Government are desirous of enlisting men in Australia
                for service in the British Army or Navy, and that our Government will attempt to
                prevent them from exercising that liberty, then I, for one, will be entirely at
                variance with the Government. The Prime Minister said he would have something togo                say later on, and I hope that he will express himself to the effect that this
                National Government will not prevent, or attempt to prevent, the enlisting of
                citizens in Australia for service in the British Army or Navy, if such citizens
                think fit to enlist. I cannot understand what is meant by such an objection. If we
                are part of the Empire, and profess to be proud of our connexion with it, why should
                we wish to prevent some of our free-born citizens from enlisting . in the British
                army or navy <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Great Britain has given up to us
                this magnificent territory, perfectly free from any conditions whatever ; she has
                laid upon us no Imperial obligations, but has trusted to our patriotism. I think                therefore, that it will be a sorry day when our Government dare to say that they
                will prevent by law I doubt if they have the power - any of our citizens, who may
                wish to do so, from joining the Imperial forces in maintaining the honour of the
                Empire, of which we are a part, in any quarter of the globe. </para>

                        <para>- I do not speak as an expert with regard to the provisions of this Bill, and, in
              fact, I do not look with a kindly eye on the expert in matters of this kind. - He is
              generally too much concerned with matters of detail, and is prepared to throw matters
              of general principle on one side. I recognise with other honorable members that it
              is necessary to have some system of national defence for the Commonwealth ; but beyond
              discussing general principles, I am not in a position to say what form such a system
              should take. I hope, however, that the time will never come when Australia will have a
              standing army, or when the civil rights of the Commonwealth will be practically
              overawed by a military despotism, for that is what generally happens when a people
              finds a huge standing army in its midst. We were told the other night that all
              democracies were short lived, and that if we proceeded to analyze the cause of . their
              downfall, it was to be found in the effects of militarism. But in all cases there was
              something behind this spirit of militarism, and that was the greater power of wealth
              and capital. Wherever great empires have gone down, we find that the heart of the
              people and the vitals of the people were eaten out by the growth of capitalism and
              wealth, and it is unfortunate that wherever a huge standing army exists the power of
              wealth is exercised so as to secure the command of the army in order that it may be
              used to overawe the. rest of the people. Some honorable members may say that in order
              to prevent the growth of militarism it is wise to have some form of conscription which
              will make a soldier of every male inhabitant between the ages of 18 and 60. It might be
              thought that with such a system it would be much more difficult for the wealthy ,
              classes of the country to place themselves in a position of control. I do not              however, agree with that view, and I hope that no such system will ever be introduced
              here. I hope that the day will never come when we shall have conscription in full
              force in the same way as in some of the Continental countries, but that our defence
              forces will be organized upon a purely volunteer system. I think there is a sufficient
              amount of patriotism amongst Australians to induce them to voluntarily come to the
              defence of their country in time of need. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly ; and it requires all the energies of our citizens to develop our
                magnificent natural resources. There is no justification for sending men abroad to
                assist in looting other&#39; people&#39;s country. Too much has been said from time
                to time upon the question of sending Australian troops abroad. I agree that it is
                necessary for the defence of this country that we should take early steps to build
                arsenals and ammunition factories, and to provide ourselves with our own armament
                and ammunition. As was pointed out by the last speaker, should a crisis arise
                Australia could not depend upon getting her necessary armaments and ammunition from
                England. In Queensland, when the war in South Africa was at its highest, it was a
                very difficult matter indeed for the Government to obtain rifles, ammunition, and
                armaments generally. In&#39; point of fact, it was almost an impossibility to get
                them. The Government could not even supply the rifle clubs with rifles. That was the
                unfortunate position which Queensland occupied, and it only serves to emphasize the
                danger to which we are likely to be exposed in the event of any international crisis
                occurring in which England may be involved, if we are not able to rely upon
                ourselves. We should cultivate the quality of self-reliance. I hope that in any
                scheme which we may adopt the necessary steps will be taken to establish our own
                arsenals and ammunition factories. We were told by the honorable member for West
                Sydney that we had contributed during the last decade, in connexion with the
                maintenance of the Australian auxiliary squadron, something like &#163;1,250,000
                sterling, whilst- the actual cost of the vessels, exclusive of the flagship <inline font-style="italic">RoyalArthur</inline> was between &#163;700,000 or
                &#163;800,000. The total cost of the vessels was about &#163;900,000. A moment&#39;s
                reflection can induce only one conclusion, namely, that the vessels comprised in the
                Australian squadron are practically obsolete. </para>

                            <para>- If it is necessary to take up this first line of defence it is far better for
                us to make a start immediately. Let us bo honest to the people who sent us here and
                tell them openly that it is necessary, for the efficient defence of the
                Commonwealth, &#39; to incur an enormous expenditure for the creation of a navy. It
                is idle to assert that we must depend upon the navy as our first line of defence if
                we are not prepared to bear the burden involved in the formation of an efficient
                navy. I am not altogether of opinion that the navy is really our first line of
                defence at the present time. We can defend our shores without a navy; but if we are
                going - as has been hinted by the Prime Minister this afternoon - to take charge of
                a number of islands in the South Pacific and also of British New Guinea, the result
                must ultimately be that- - whether we like it or not - we shall have to go in for
                the creation of a navy. Whatever the cost may be, I would rather that we owned two
                or three vessels than that we paid any subsidy to the British Government for the use
                of vessels over which we have no control. As has been pointed out, if a crisis
                occurred in Great Britain it is very questionable whether England could render us
                any assistance at all. The only assistance which we could render to the Empire would
                be that we could defend ourselves. When I hear honorable members talking glibly
                about rendering assistance to the Empire generally, and of the supremacy of the
                British navy, I am led to speculate whether they have ever really considered the
                question at all. 1 I would further point out that practically every ten years these
                war vessels become obsolete. Hence, if we intend to go in for this first line of
                defence, it is obvious that the Commonwealth must incur an enormous expenditure                Only the other day we read a cable in the newspapers which stated that, owing to the
                improvements made in their submarine boats, the French nation claimed to be the
                strongest naval power in the world. We all know that for some years past France has
                been devoting considerable attention to the construction of submarine boats. Only
                about a week ago we saw that the successful experiment had been attempted of running
                one of these submarine vessels 140 miles under water. </para>

                quite reasonable to suppose that these vessels will be successful, and- if they are                it behoves us to consider what, is the value of the British navy. The British navy
                in such circumstances would become practically valueless. -The result must be that
                attention will have to be directed to devising some means for counteracting the
                power of these submarine boats. We do not know what the results of this invention

                            <para>- Yes ; but the submarine boats at present in the British navy are a mere
                nothing compared with those invented by the French nation. From time to time it has
                been urged that Australia requires this naval defence, and also a large standing
                army. 1 think too much has been made of what Australia requires in the way of
                defence. It has been repeatedly stated that Australia is likely to be invaded. A few
                years ago the cry was that the Chinese were going to invade our shores. Now that
                nation has been thrust aside, and it is urged with much persistency that there is a
                danger of Japan swooping down upon us either for loot or to divide up the country                From the tone of some of the speeches which have been made, one might be pardoned
                for thinking that we were almost on the verge of an invasion. I believe that
                Australia&#39;s isolation is her strongest means of defence. We have been repeatedly
                told by very eminent men that the 21 miles of sea between England and the Continent
                is worth 1,000,000 of men to her. If there be any truth in that statement, then
                Australia is in a very much more secure, position. In any case, Australia&#39;s
                position is very secure at&#39; the present time. If we improved our various
                fortifications, I think that our power of resistance could be made such that no army
                in existence could successfully invade our territory, lt has been said that the
                Continental powers have a dozen schemes by which they could invade Great Britain                but the difficulty is in getting the men there and in keeping them supplied. That is
                exactly the position which Australia occupies at the present time. It is quite true
                that a hostile nation might be able to land troops at Port Darwin, but what would be
                the use of them when landed? The whole of their supplies would have to be conveyed
                to them, so that I do not share :some of the fears which other honorable members
                entertain. Again, there is no </para>

                    <para class="block">European power which is likely to attempt an invasion of Australia            for the simple reason that they could .not afford it. Quite apart from the financial
            aspect of the question, no nation could afford to send the&#39; men. The whole of Europe
            is so armed at the present time that no nation could allow 50,000 or 60,000 of her
            trained men to be deported to Australia. Present conditions, therefore, are such as to
            make Australia very safe from invasion. We are told that Japan is the nation which is
            likely to come down upon us and to loot our large cities, or to invade Australia. But it
            appears to me that Japan has her hands fairly full at the present time with Russia            Moreover, her financial position is such that I do not think she could attempt such a
            task. I repeat that our isolation, together with the volunteer forces throughout
            Australia) is sufficient to enable us to defend ourselves. I disagree with those who
            urge that we should take our share in the defence of the Empire. I ask them if they
            really know what the defence of the Empire means. The Empire has now probably a hundred
            troubles upon hand that may result in war at any moment. After all, our risk of invasion
            and of trouble either from a European power or even from Eastern nations practically
            results from our connexion with the Empire. This matter has not been touched upon at
            all. We know that the task which Great Britain has set herself means an enormous amount            of taxation, and sooner or later she must break down under its weight. She cannot stand
            it. If she is working on the theory that she is going to remain equal to two of the
            greatest naval powers - remembering that Germany as well as France and Russia and other
            European powers are making every effort to secure enormous navies - then she has set
            herself a task that is going to press very heavily on the masses of the people. </para>

                            <para>- That does not alter the case. Any other power that is trying to do the same
                thing must likewise groan under the weight of taxation. Are we, as a democratic
                community, prepared to contribute large sums to the defence of the Empire without
                having any legislative representation <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Is any
                honorable member prepared to vote large sums for that purpose without representation
                for the Commonwealth ? The very basis upon which, not only the Commonwealth, but
                England itself is carried on, is that wherever there is taxation there shall be
                representation? Here it is proposed to contribute to the defence of the Empire by
                land as well as by sea. If England is going to continue her policy of keeping up an
                enormous navy, and we are going to pay in proportion to our numbers, then we must be
                prepared to take an equal share in the weight and burden of it. I, for one, am
                opposed to it. I do not think it would be wise for us to try in any shape or form to
                levy heavy taxation simply for the sake of keeping up an enormous navy, or to enable
                us to contribute generally to the defence of the Empire. We know that in all cases
                of Empire those parts which are&#39; farthest from the centre are generally in the
                most danger-. The centre of an Empire is the point at which capital accumulates. It
                is never found in the very extremes, and I for one will always raise my voice
                against any attempt to tax the people of the Commonwealth in order that we may
                assist in the defence of the Empire. What, after all, is England doing at the
                present time ? She is merely sending armies abroad in order to open up markets from
                which we get very little benefit. The opening up of these markets is generally to
                assist a class of individuals, which certainly is not conducive to the best welfare
                of the Empire as a whole. In such circumstances I will always be opposed to any
                attempt to increase our contribution towards the cost of the navy, which is supposed
                to assist in the defence of Australia. I shall be opposed not merely to any increase
                in that contribution but also to its continuance. If we recognise as a Parliament
                that it is necessary to have this first line of defence we should be honest enough
                to the people of Australia to come down and say so, and to be prepared to pay for
                it. If we are not prepared to pay for it, then we ought not to talk of it.. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly, I would be prepared to allow them to go away. If it is necessary to
                have any warships at all, I would say let us pay for them ourselves and control
                them. In Australia the great mass of the . people are even worse off than they are
                in Great Britain. We find out here that wealth only contributes from 17 to 20 per
                cent, of the taxation, which means that the great mass of the wealth producers of
                this country bear the -biggest burden. Whether it is in the maintenance of a
                standing army or otherwise, it is the great mass of the wealth producers who have                to pay the piper. It is all very well, therefore, for some of our honorable friends
                to tell us that it is necessary for us to contribute to the defence of the Empire                They know very well when they say so that it is not going to interfere with the
                particular class which they represent. If it is ever proposed, I hope that those
                honorable members will be sincere enough to come forward with a proposition for a
                big income tax or a direct land tax to meet the extra cost. So far as the Bill
                itself is concerned, it has had a most extraordinary career. Up to the present time
                not one honorable member has spoken in favour of it, and in such circumstances I
                would like to suggest to the Government that it would be a very wise thing to
                withdraw the measure, and to endeavour to model it upon the general sentiments
                expressed by the House. </para>

                            <para>- I understand the honorable member. In every Parliament there are always a
                number of members who are prepared to speak against a Bill, but have a &#34; but
                &#34; to their objections, and in the i end they vote for the measure. I certainly
                think that this Bill does not meet the desires of the House, and I predict that when
                it comes out of committee, its own mother will not know it, if it has a mother                There are many features of the Bill with which I do not agree. There are certain
                clauses which practically mean a conscription, although they do not say so in so
                many words. I am opposed to all forms of conscription. The Bill also enables the
                Minister at any time to send troops away from Australia to fight in the defence of
                the Empire. I think that the clauses relating to that matter ought to be
                eli mini a ted. I do not consider that we should send a solitary man away from
                Australia. All that Australia can reasonably be expected to do is to defend herself                Even from the stand-point of Empire, I think that if Australia does that, she does
                all that can be asked of her. We have an enormous territory to develop, and if our
                desire is to develop that territory, then we should keep every man here who is
                willing and able to work. We know that when we send troops away we send the pick of
                the men. They are men who are useful for pioneering work. They are able-bodied                healthy, strong, young men, who are fitted to endure hardship of every description                We want that class of men here to develop our magnificent resources. If we are going
                in for an expensive system of militarism such as some of our honorable friends would
                have us believe we ought &#39; to adopt, then the resources of this country are
                going to suffer to a very large extent. If we are going to make Australia a national                we want these young men. Hardly a day passes without some talk of making Australia a
                great nation, but people who talk in this fashion always forget that we can never
                build up a nation while we are -a dependency. What is the .use of talking of
                building up a nation while we are dependent. Before you can do so you must be
                independent. </para>

                    <para>Now, I should like to ask the Federation people whether the colonies of this country
            - Canada and the many colonies, the great colonies, the cluster in the South Pacific            the Australian colonies - whether they think that these colonies will be willing to bind
            themselves to the stupid foreign policy of the Governments of this country ? Will they
            be willing to undertake the responsibility of entering into war, the seat of which is
            10,000 miles away, and in which they cannot have the slightest influence or interest            and when the}&#39; may not have been in the least consulted as to the cause of the
            quarrel for which this country was rushing into war ? In my opinion, the colonies will
            never stand a policy of that kind. If I was a Canadian, or Victorian, or New South Wales
            man, or Queenslander, or New Zealander, I would take good care, as far as I was
            concerned, that my voice should never go in favour of any connexion whatever with those
            complications in the foreign policy of the Government of the mother country. It would be
            much better for humanity, and for them, and for us, that those colonies should be under
            governments of their own, and independent, and should not meddle with quarrels in which
            the}&#39; were not concerned. Let them endeavour to maintain their own honour, and not
            take part in the miserable quarrels, contests, and wars which for a long time past have
            disfigured the history of the kingdom in which we live. </para>

                            <para>- Even &#34;peace at any price&#34; is better than being butchers and creating
                an army of professional butchers. Personally, I am opposed to all forms of war. War
                in all its aspects is barbarous and brutal, and I cannot understand any Christian or
                civilized man believing in it, whether for the purposes of loot or acquisition of
                territory. We should be more humane in these times! Whether the country making war
                is in the right or not the crime is just the same, as it means taking the lives of
                others, and it is cruel, brutal, and savage to do that, no matter on what side a
                country may be. Unfortunately, there are times when we are compelled to take one
                side or the other ; but I hope that the time will never come when Australia will
                willingly take part in war. I hope Australia will have no other desire than to live
                at peace with the world, so that she may be in a position to build up &#39;the
                industries that should be created within our shores in order to make a happy and
                prosperous people. </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend to detain the House long upon the Defence Bill, but there are a
              few points in connexion with it to which I wish to draw attention. In the first place              coming from the State of which the Minister of Defence is the representative, I should
              like to say that I believe the feeling of the people there regarding the subject of
              defence is very much akin to the .feeling .prevailing elsewhere throughout the
              Commonwealth. The people of Western Australia, like the people of the rest of
              Australia, are not in any sense extremists. There may be a few individual cases of
              people who are open to be called jingoists, and. there may be some coming under the
              designation of Little Eng landers; but the great mass of the people view the whole
              question in a thoroughly sensible way, and while they are all opposed to war, and
              regard it as a very horrible thing which they would like to see abolished, they
              recognise that they have to look at it from a matter of fact point of view, and that
              while all the nations of the world are armed, it is necessary for the people of this
              country to defend themselves against any possible foe by which the Commonwealth may be
              assailed. The views of a majority of the people of Australia are crystallized in the
              motto &#34; Defence not defiance.&#34; They merely want to &#39; be able to hold what
              they have got, without extending their possessions, and without indulging in any
              jingoism or extreme views of that nature. They -equally well recognise that that
              preparedness for war which is so necessary, is the very best guarantee for peace. One
              of the lessons which has been taught - or which ought to have been taught - by the
              recent war in South Africa is that in one respect at any rate the scope of warfare has
              been changed, and that the men who are now valued in the field are not those who
              merely fight with their rifles or other weapons of war, but with their brains. That
              was the real secret of the success of the Australians in South Africa. Each man fought
              as a unit, but each exercised common sense ; and yet, at the same time, they all
              fought as an organized body. The Boer war has shown us that, in order to be successful
              in warfare, armies should be treated as composed of intelligent individuals, rather
              than as soldiers in the past have been regarded. Another lesson of the war is that it
              was not the professional soldiers who distinguished themselves most, but rather the
              untrained men who went from these States ; and that is the class of men on whom we
              shall have to rely if ever Australia is in need of soldiers to defend her shores. The
              position . of the Commonwealth is such as will necessitate a larger defence force .
              than is necessary for most other countries. We comprise an area extending over
              3,000,000 square miles, and our population amounts to about 3,700,000. That is a very
              small&#39; population for such a huge area. We should never&#39; forget that we hold
              that area not merely for ourselves, but as . a heritage for the civilized people of
              the future. Another matter we ought to consider in connexion with this subject is the
              position of Japan as regards* Australia. It is well-known that Japan for many years
              has been very ambitious to establish colonies for her surplus population. Not so very
              many years ago, the United States only just forestalled Japan in the annexation of the
              Sandwich Islands, and it is an open secret that Japan is very desirous of emulating
              Great Britain by establishing in Asia a nation somewhat akin to Great Britain in
              Europe. Japan wants colonies, and is very eager to extend her possessions. If at any
              time Great Britain were involve&#39;d in a foreign war, and Japan happened to be
              engaged in the same conflict on the opposite side, I do not think there is the least
              doubt but that the first direction in which Japan would look with a view to attacking
              the Empire, would be towards Australia. She would probably endeavour to secure some of
              the huge uninhabited areas of the north, or the west, with a view to developing the
              energies of her surplus population. &#39; For this reason the question of Commonwealth
              defence is of almost primary importance. The honorable member for East Sydney, in his
              speech on this Bill, referred to the military system of Switzerland. I was much
              impressed by what he said. His description of the citizen soldiers of Switzerland
              fascinated me, and led me to believe that perhaps some such system might be
              applicable to the Commonwealth. I was, however, somewhat disillusion i zed when I looked
              up a book on the subject in the library The <inline font-style="italic">Swiss
                Confederation,</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir F.</inline> O. Adams and
              C. <inline font-style="italic">D.</inline> Cunningham. From that book I came to the
              conclusion that such a system would be absolutely impossible so far as the
              Commonwealth is concerned. The inference I drew was that it would be too costly a
              system to adopt here, although it is true that the system in Switzerland is very much
              cheaper and more efficient for the money expended than the&#39; military system of any
              other country in Europe. On looking up the cost per man in the principal European              armies I found a number of figures which showed me that, although the cost in
              Switzerland is low, yet it is considerably too high for application to the
              Commonwealth. The annual cost per man in the army of Great Britain - namely &#163;64
              10s. 4d. - is higher than in any other army in Europe. Spain comes next with a cost
              per man of &#163;56 2s. 4d. ; next comes Austria-Hungary with a cost Of &#163;52 12s.
              In France the cost per man is &#163;46 13s. 6d., and in Germany it is &#163;46. In
              Russia it is comparatively low, &#163;22 16s.; whilst in Switzerland the cost per man
              is down as low as &#163;7. But though Switzerland compares very favorably in respect
              of cost with the armies of Europe, yet &#163;7 per man would be too much to pay in
              Australia. According to the Minister for &#34;Defence in introducing the Bill, the
              number of adults in the Commonwealth capable of bearing arms is about 954,000. That
              seems to me to be very much overestimating the figures, considering the population of
              the Commonwealth ; but if the number were only half that stated by the Minister, it
              would be far more than the financial possibilities of the Commonwealth would permit              if we had an army composed of all those men capable of bearing arms such as was
              proposed by the honorable member for East Sydney. The cost would run into about five
              or six million pounds per annum, which is considerably more than we could possibly
              spend in military affairs. The system adopted in Switzerland is one, however, that
              must commend itself to us, inasmuch as every individual citizen there is required to
              bear arms. The danger with which the standing army usually threatens constitutional
              government is not to be feared in the case of Switzerland, because there every citizen
              is a soldier ; and where that is so a country has nothing to fear from military
              dominance. The Swiss system is so efficient that it has been admired by military men
              throughout Europe, and the simplicity of their military organization is such that it
              might be followed with considerable advantage by the Commonwealth. In this connexion I
              should like to refer to a subject which has been touched upon by many honorable
              members, and which I might term the gold lace question. I know two or three companies
              the efficiency of which is impaired by the very high cost of the officers&#39;
              uniforms, inasmuch as men hesitate to join them because they see no prospect of
              advancement, the high. price of the gorgeous uniforms required by officers debarring              them from accepting promotion. In a democratic community such as this, we should have
              no tailor-made officers, and no man should be debarred from advancement by reason of
              his poverty. We cannot separate the question of defence from the question of railway
              communication between the States ; and in this connexion the advisability of adopting
              a uniform gauge, and the question of connecting the various parts .of the Commonwealth
              by railway, must be considered. The Commonwealth cannot build a navy, and it isa              absurd to talk of such a thing at the present time, in view of our financial position
              and the many calls made upon our finances ; but, in the absence of a navy, it seems to
              me that to defend Western Australia from the attacks of an enemy that State must be
              connected with, the others by railway. When the people of Western Australia were
              considering the advisability of entering into the Union, the Constitution Bill
              contained a clause which provided that the Commonwealth should protect every State of
              the Union against invasion, and we interpreted that provision as an absolute mandate
              upon the Parliament of the Commonwealth to sanction its construction. In the absence
              of such a railway, we, in Western Australia, are in no better position, so far as
              defence is concerned, now than we were . in before the accomplishment of federation. I
              agree with those who object to that clause of the Bill which makes military service in
              the event of emergency compulsory. It seems to me that the clause is almost an insult
              to Australians. I am sure that if an emergency arose there would be no need to force
              men to join -the service, because they would gladly volunteer, and it would be much
              better for Australia to be defended by willing volunteers than by men who had been
              pressed into -the service, because it is well known that volunteers fight better than
              pressed, men. A well-known military authority, Major-General Edwards, in a report
              which. he made on the subject of Australian defence some years ago, put forward
              several recommendations which it might be advisable for this Parliament to carry into
              effect. He recommended that the defence force corps should be amalgamated into a
              fortress corps, which, I think, would be a much better name for the permanent arm of
              our service. He also advocated the establishment of a military college for the
              education of officers, and the extension of the rifle corps system - a recommendation
              which, I am sure, will be well received by honorable members, and which meets with the
              approval of the people generally. No arm of the service could be so useful in time of
              emergency as rifle corps, provided that the practice of the members is kept up, and a
              certain amount of drill is given to them. I am in accord with those who have spoken
              against the establishment of a standing army. We want no standing army in Australia              as standing armies are known in Europe. I also approve of the idea that no citizen
              soldier should be required, without his own consent, to serve beyond the limits of the
              Commonwealth. I am sorry that the Minister for Defence is not here to-night. If he had
              been present, I might have had a great deal more to say about the matters&#39; which I
              have mentioned, and other matters. I wish, however, to refer, in conclusion, to some
              statements which have appeared in the Perth press, and which I hope&#39; will either
              be contradicted or will be accepted as true. Honorable members have referred to guards
              of honour and the ceremonial parading of troops - functions which, to my mind, are
              utterly useless. But I find from the <inline font-style="italic">Western
                Australian,</inline> an eminently respectable journal, that when the Minister for
              Defence recently arrived at Fremantle, a company of the Fremantle infantry, in full
              uniform, was drawn up on the South Quay as a guard of honour, and that at Perth there
              was another guard of honour, composed of a detachment of 100 of the rank and file from
              the Public Service Corps, under Captain Hunt. In a subsequent issue of the same
              newspaper, I read that - </para>

                    <para class="block">Forrest, Federal Minister for Defence, was met at Fremantle by one
            guard of honour, and at Perth Station by another. Every man present received five
            shillings payment for his services, and the paltry compliment has therefore cost the
            Finance department <inline font-style="italic">&#163; 50</inline> and upwards. The
            calculation of cost was made on the assumption that both guards of honour were composed            as the Perth guard was, of a 100 men. I do not know whether the statement is &#39;true,
            but I have seen no contradiction of it, and I mention it so that the Minister may have
            an opportunity of dealing with it. A number of honorable members talk about economy, but
            vote the other way, and I commend the statement to their consideration. I should like
            the facts of the case to be known, and I think that we should have full information
            regarding the cost of these guards of honour. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JOSEPH</inline>COOK (Parramatta).Although I am somewhat
            unready to take part in this debate, as I was under the impression that the Government
            would proceed with the consideration of the Post and Telegraph Bill to-night, 1 should
            like to say one or two words upon the measure, because I consider it one of the most
            important that will occupy our attention. We have to defend ourselves whether we like it
            or not. It is an obligation of our citizenship which none of us can shirk, and I take it
            none of us wishes to shirk ; at any rate, I for one do not. I recognise that we must
            respond to the obligations of a twofold citizenship - we being citizens of Australia            and as such, citizens of the Empire at large. That being so, the obligation is laid upon
            us to pay regard not only to the defence of our own country, but also to the larger
            question of defending the Empire of which we are proud to be a part. At the same time I
            do not think that we should do well to parade our military strength before the world to
            any greater extent than we are obliged to do, and I could not help but feel that the
            Minister for Defence made rather a show of himself when he stated with so much unction
            that we had 970,000 men capable of bearing arms, and between 20 and 60 years of age. I
            believe that he included in that number all the men in Australia who are between 20 and
            60 years of age, not leaving out of account the halt, the lame, the blind, and the many
            who are disqualified in other ways from the performance of active military duties. I do
            not think that we shall do any good -by this silly parade of our fighting strength to
            the world, when we know in our hearts that we cannot put so many men into the field, and
            that even if we could we have not the means to equip them. It contributes neither to our
            own welfare nor to the strength of the Empire, nor can it affect the minds of those in
            other parts of the world who may, perhaps, look upon us with envious eyes, to make a
            false statement of our strength, because they know as well as we do what our military
            strength really is, and what the efficiency of our defences would be in time of war. At
            the same time I feel that the obligation is laid upon us not only to do our duty to our
            continent, and to defend our race, our homes, and our commerce, but to have some respect
            for the exigencies of the&#39; Empire at large. I should like to say a few words on a
            matter which was referred to by the leader of the labour party. I take it that this
            statement is typical of many others emanating from men who believe that our defence
            should be confined to our continent - that we should on no account go beyond the
            confines of the continent in defence of the Empire, no matter what the urgency may be. I
            do not subscribe to that doctrine. I believe it would be better to meet the foe away
            from our shores than to wait for him to come here and get a footing on our coasts. </para>

                        <para>- After the teachings of the Boer war I do not think it would be a good tiling for
              us to sit idly by in case of a combined attack on the Empire and to let an enemy land
              on our shores, and then drive him off. That is not my way of defending ourselves. I
              can conceive, and any honorable member need not stretch his imagination very much to
              conceive, of a combination of European powers against England, provoked by the very
              jealousy arising from her success, owing to the possession of these successful
              outlying colonies and dependencies. I should imagine if such an attack were ever made
              it would be our obligation and our duty, as we have seen it to be in South Africa, to
              defend our . Empire even though it should be away from these shores. In going to South
              Africa to fight there, we were just as much defending our hearths and homes in
              Australia as if the enemy had been fighting on this continent. I believe that if any
              serious menace were to come to South Africa, which I regard, and many other honorable
              members and authorities regard, as the key of our Empire, it would result very
              injuriously to our safety and our commerce here. I am not one of those who believe we
              should stay here until the enemy gets a footing on our shores, but wherever &#34; the
              need is seen for our defence force to demonstrate themselves, that is the point to
              which we should betake ourselves in defence of the integrity of the Empire as a whole              I do not want it to be inferred from this - as it might very, well be - that I am in
              favour of the raising of a standing army in Australia, with intent to deport it on the
              slightest possible provocation. I do not know what the future may involve for us in
              this regard, but I think that in the near future, and so far as we may see immediately
              ahead, there is no need to put the whole defence of this continent on any other than
              an absolutely voluntary footing. Whatever is done in defence of the Empire away from
              our shores should be done, as has been done in South Africa, spontaneously, and from
              the feeling of loyalty inherent in the people, which, after all, is our best and
              surest safeguard. I do not believe either - and this has been made clear by the
              honorable member for Kalgoorlie - that we can follow slavishly the Swiss model. We
              cannot make all our people soldiers. It seems to be inconsistent with the very genius
              of our race to put this compulsion on citizens, to make soldiers of them whether they
              choose to be so or not. Our traditions, our prejudices, our preferences, our national
              leanings have more to do with the determination of this great question so far as
              Englishmen are concerned, and so far as Australians are concerned, than anything else              Perhaps our insular position has led us to have a horror of these conscription
              clauses. Whether it is our insular position, or something arising from our inherent
              love of independence and liberty - whatever may be the predisposing cause - we are not
              with those who take readily to this idea of compulsory service, compulsory
              mobilization, but we adhere to the principle of voluntarism. I hope we shall not
              depart from the voluntary principle in building up the defence force of Australia              There is no . parallel between ourselves and other countries which have adopted
              conscription. For instance, there is no parallel between this country and Switzerland              The Swiss are a small community hedged in by warlike powers. Here we are a part - a
              distant part, it is true - of a mighty but scattered Empire. What may be an ideal
              condition of affairs so far as the defence of Switzerland is concerned, is not
              necessarily ideal in its relation to ourselves on this continent. I believe we have a
              right to share the responsibilities of the Empire as well as its privileges. But I am
              against the latent conscription in the Bill, and in committee I hope to be with those
              who seek to eliminate that very idea. It has been said to us that what is embodied in
              the Bill exists, as a latent power in the Constitution, and in our form of social
              organization. That is very true ; but there is an essential difference between a
              latent power which may be a power ready to be called forth from a sense of our moral
              obligation, and a latent power ready to be called forth by reason of a legal
              obligation which we have imposed on ourselves. I believe there is a latent power to
              defend the country inherent in all States who set themselves up as organized
              communities. But I want to see this done from a sense of moral obligation and loyalty
              rather than as the result of the exercise of a power which we choose to put into the
              hands of the Executive, to work their own sweet will with regard to the fighting that
              has to be done in defence of the Empire. In other words, this is the difference ;
              whereas now this latent power can only be called forth by the Governor-General, with
              the advice of his Executive Council, and with the consent of Parliament, if we pass
              .the Bill on its present lines we shall give that latent power into the hands of the
              Executive Council, to be disposed of as they may deem fit, without resort to
              Parliament in the last extremity. I want the right to send these forces away from our
              shores to be subject to the control of Parliament, and, if possible, to be in its
              absolute direction. </para>

                            <para>- If there is an offer made to send troops away without consulting Parliament                we want the Executive to feel that they can only do that kind of thing when the will
                of the people has manifested itself unmistakably. I do not want the Executive to be
                able to commit the Commonwealth- behind the back ,of the people in connexion with
                any secret negotiations as to the defence of the Empire at any point. I want
                Parliament to have the right to control our military operations, no matter where
                they may be undertaken. Therefore, I may be . found in committee with those who seek
                to eliminate the emergency clauses, and to define the term &#34; emergency &#34; in
                a very different way. The reason why I am so anxious that Parliament should not give
                over this power to the Executive is because war is not like any other undertaking. A
                blunder in the shape of a declaration of war, and in the commitment of ourselves to
                warlike obligations, cannot be remedied like any ordinary legislative blunder we may
                commit. A blunder of that kind can never be recalled, and may result in very serious
                consequences to the Empire. Isolated as we are, and away from the warlike
                obligations of the world at large, we have time to consult Parliament, and the
                Government should only take these extreme and stringent steps after parliamentary
                sanction has been deliberately obtained. Before the Executive can be given these
                plenary powers in regard&#39; to the defence force of the Empire, I believe Ave
                shall have to go further, and give the Executive a voice in the determination of
                peace&#39; or war, as it affects the Empire as a whole. The time will not be yet, I
                know. Imperial federation is a matter which may grow - we can not make it by any
                machinery; but I believe the time will come when these States will have to be
                consulted at the seat of Empire, and we shall require to have some say in the
                determination of all those larger matters of policy which affect the destiny of the
                Empire. Before we allow the Executive the same plenary powers as exist on the
                Continent of Europe, particularly as exist in London, there must be consultation
                with our Executive on the part of the Home authorities before entering into or
                embarking on a condition of affairs which may land us in very serious consequences                What has led to the conscription on the Continent ? It has very often been a
                fighting emperor, or it has been the contiguity of warlike nations. In other words                geography and national character have had a very large influence in determining
                these methods of conscription in older countries than ours. Our position seems to
                naturally exempt us from the obligations arising out of the idea of conscription                For instance, we have no warlike nations in contiguity to us. -We are isolated, girt
                by the great broad sea which rolls between , us and the warlike nations of Europe                and I hope we shall not set up to be a fighting people, to seek to enlarge our
                territory across the seas. I hope we shall develop peaceful ideals - commercial
                ideals if you like, social ideals - that we may make social experiments, as I
                believe we are doing in a way and to an extent which they dare not even dream of in
                some of the older countries where their conditions are very much more complicated                In a word, our methods are to be those of peace, not those of war for the sake pfc                dominion, and for the sake of conquering other nations. We have no motive urging us
                to the methods of conscription. We have no motive which should lead us to adopt this
                method of compulsory mobilization, which. finds so much favour on the Continent, and
                which is always without exception resorted to. Before our eyes we have standing out
                as a beacon light the great Continent of America. In this respect I am prepared to
                go to America to see what we ought to do in the immediate future. We have been told
                by various thinkers, writers, and authorities that we can never hope to be a great
                nation unless we become a warlike people. The contrary of that is seen to be the
                case on the great Continent of America. They have shown to the world unmistakably
                that they may be great without necessarily being warlike. In looking to the
                requirements of the moment, we should look to the Continent of America as a beacon
                light to guide us in what .we are to do immediately ahead. There, as we know, they
                have built up the finest commerce perhaps in the world ; they certainly have
                developed their resources in a way which soon bids fair to become without parallel                They have built up a great nation in every respect, and they have -done it with just
                sufficient soldiers to police their shores and territory. Our danger of invasion is
                a very remote one. We are awa)&#39; from Europe, and the balance of power is so even
                amongst the nations that no one of them could afford to send a marauding army here
                to despoil us. Therefore we may feel ourselves to be absolutely secure from attack
                by a European power at present. With regard to the East, I have no such fear as some
                others entertain that we are likely to be attacked by Japan. I think that great
                nation has its hands full in grappling with the powers that are contiguous to it ;
                and that it will continue to have its hands too full, diplomatically and in every
                other way, in maintaining its position amongst the great nations, to permit of its
                casting longing glances towards Australia. Moreover, I am vain enough to believe
                that if the Japanese should contemplate a descent in armed force upon Australia we
                could make it very uncomfortable for them, even though we have not their
                overwhelming numbers. At any rate, I have no fear of these invasions, and to my mind
                there is nothing to urge us to follow the military methods of Europe or to adopt any
                system of general mobilization. tat the same time we ought not to forget that we
                are a commercial people. We are sending away from these shores &#163;140,000,000
                worth of commerce every year. Of every &#163;7 worth of our produce we send &#163;5
                worth to foreign, markets, and therefore an obligation is laid upon us to see that
                our commerce is properly policed. That leads me to the idea that we should always be
                in favour of keeping a navy upon our coast, of at least the same strength as the one
                we have to-day. I would not, on any consideration, advocate the sending away of
                that, navy from our shores, but I believe we get that navy at a very cheap rate, and
                that we should always keep it, as far as possible, for the protection of our
                commerce. Yet, strange to say, the question of naval defence is one that is left
                entirely out of the Bill, except for a plenary clause which practically gives the
                executive power to do what they like in this matter hereafter. We may take it that
                the Bill does not contemplate the immediate establishment of a naval force of any
                description, and I do not go with those honorable members who think that we ought not
                to have any navy at all, unless we can set up one of our own. It seems ridiculous to
                argue that because we cannot run ships of our own, we should not have any at all. I
                believe that the ships provided for us by the Home Government are furnished at a
                ridiculously cheap rate, and that we ought to be grateful for them. Reference has
                been made in the course of the debate to the fact that we have already contributed
                &#163;700,000 towards the maintenance of the Australian auxiliary squadron, but
                supposing that we have spent such a sum, we have had in return for it the guarantee
                that the protection of the navy of the Empire would be at our disposal. We have had
                this assurance for a sum of money that would have been barely sufficient to buy a
                very second rate battle-ship - a sum representing only half the cost of a first
                class battle-ship ; and I think we should look at the matter in a common-sense way                Our commerce is protected fully and completely now, as we have all the .strength of
                the British navy at our command in the time of emergency, and the amount we pay is a
                very small contribution indeed. I am not quite clear that we ought not to take some
                immediate steps to form the nucleus of a naval defence force. I speak with bated                breath on these matters, because there are honorable members who know so much more
                about them from practical experience than I do, but it seems to me that we might
                very well try to form the nucleus of a defence force. I am not quite sure that I
                would not sooner see some step taken in the direction of forming a naval, rather
                than a military college, because I think that we should endeavour to train men
                accustomed to the use of ships, for warlike purposes if necessary. We should defend
                our forts and protect our coaling stations, of course, but what is the position of
                our naval brigade at present? We all know that our naval brigade is more properly a
                land force dressed up in naval uniform than anything else. We have no ships for them
                to practise with, and they can get no training on the water, and we might make a
                commencement in this matter by endeavouring to bring about a better attitude on the
                part of the Home Government on the question of the naval training of our men here                For instance, why should not our men be allowed to go on board some of the warships
                in our harbors in order that they might be put through the minutiae of naval drill                I do not see why England should not send out some of her warships that are not quite
                up to sailing away to give the enemy battle, in order to afford our men the
                opportunity of having instilled into their minds the rudiments of training in naval
                warfare. All these matters might be arranged at very little cost indeed, and we
                might make a beginning in the training of our men in &#171; the arts of naval
                warfare in a manner that is not possible at present. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has only to name the ships in order to show at once that
                he is joking. The Bill before us seems to contemplate the continuance of military
                caste, and the continuance also of unbusiness-like methods as applied to military
                matters. What we want to do, perhaps, more than anything else is to exercise a
                better and more acute business-like control over defence matters. I believe that we
                could get more efficiency than we have hitherto attained without exceeding our
                present expenditure. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Giffen the other
                day wrote an article in one of the magazines on the question of a business war
                office, and I think we have need to betake ourselves to the learning of a similar
                lesson here. I remember sitting on a military commission in Sydney recently, and the
                one thing that was borne in upon our minds more than anything else was that in the
                defence affairs of our own State - and I dare say it is much the same in other
                States - there seemed -to be an utter lack of the application of those business
                principles that we follow in all our other affairs in life ; and if we could
                organize our Defence department on more business-like lines, we could not fail to
                achieve a higher degree of efficiency, even though we incurred no more expense. I
                believe that our militia should not be abolished, but that on the contrary they
                should be encouraged, and should exist side by side with the volunteers. The
                difference between the two forces at present seems to be largely a matter of
                temperament. There are many men who would not join the partially paid forces, but who
                would gladly become members of a volunteer corps, and, on the other hand, there are
                men who would prefer to be paid for their services. It seems to me that the two
                forces can very well go on, side by side, in friendly rivalry, or harmony, or
                whatever it may be termed, under our present conditions, at any rate. In this way                we should, as individuals, discharge our moral -and legal obligations in regard to
                the defence of the Empire - I mean by the payment of our partially-paid men. If we
                have no conscription, our liability and responsibility as individuals are as great
                as if we had, and surely the men who give up their time and attention and leisure
                hours to the cultivation of the arts of defence, are entitled to some return if they
                care to take it. Therefore, I would not abolish the partially -paid forces, but
                would rather encourage them side by side with the volunteer forces. The Bill appears
                to me to provide for an administration that would be too much &#39; centralized. For
                instance, I find that a sergeant cannot be appointed without reference to the
                district commandant. Surely the commander of a company ought to have the power to
                single out a man and appoint him as a sergeant, and, consistently with a unified
                control of the whole army, we should do well to .allow the responsibility for
                details of administration to rest upon the subordinate officers as far as possible                I think clause 15 of the Bill might be altered in a way that would be very
                beneficial to the service as a whole. It is provided at present that a man may enter
                the service in an official capacity, that is to say he may become an officer                without undergoing any examination beforehand. It is at this initial point that so
                many men, who turn out to be other than good officers, are at fault, because they do
                not possess the qualifications they ought to have before entering upon the discharge
                of their duties. I think that before a man takes control of a company or a regiment                or occupies any official position whatever, he should be proved and tested by
                examination. I hope to see an effort made in committee to break down some of the
                frivolous and foolish distinctions that are maintained under our present system. For
                instance, at present a permanent colonel has forage allowed for two horses, while a
                volunteer colonel has forage for only one. I suppose the horse of the volunteer
                colonel eats quite as much fodder as a horse belonging to a permanent colonel, and I
                fail to understand why there should be any difference in the allowances. Then I find
                that a permanent colonel receives twice as much pay per day as a volunteer colonel
                does. I think that when a volunteer colonel is out with his company or his regiment                and is engaged in his military duties, he ought to receive just as much pay per day
                as a permanent colonel, for the time he is on duty. Why the permanent colonel should
                get twice as much I do not know. </para>

                            <para>- I do not admit that; because I believe that some of our volunteer colonels are
                just as good as many of the permanent colonels.- If any one of them is only half as
                good a man, it seems to me that we cannot do better than give him half-pay, as we
                are doing at present. It is a distinction which ought to be abolished. We should pay
                them both alike when they are performing the same kind of duty. Social influence
                exercises an ill effect upon our forces at the present time. We were told at the
                military inquiry which we conducted in New South Wales, by a man high in the command
                of our forces, that the reason why many of the officers were selected for the
                command of the men who went to South Africa was because they belonged to good
                families. Youngsters of twenty years of age, who lacked all previous training, were
                sent away as officers, whilst old, seasoned, trained men, who were anxious to go                were set aside. The only reason which could be assigned for this indefensible action
                when it was inquired into, was that some of the youngsters belonged to good families
                ? </para>

                            <para>- I believe that ; nevertheless, the statement which I have mentioned was
                deliberately made before the committee. In my judgment no man ought to gain a
                military command simply because he has social relations in the State services. The
                only test should be that of merit. Whether a man comes from the ranks or is of high
                birth matters not. So long as he has the qualifications to lead, he is the man who
                ought to conduct operations in warfare. That is the class of man upon whom we must
                rely if we are to have an efficient force. This Bill, ought to make it clear that a
                man may begin at the bottom rung of the ladder and by sheer force of merit climb
                steadily and persistently upward till he has attained the highest command within the
                gift of the Commonwealth. I have very little more to say at present. Matters of
                detail will properly come up for consideration in committee. But it occurs to me
                that we cannot do better than take lessons from those who have already seen&#39;
                actual warfare. Only the other day Colonel Kelly came back to tell us that one
                lesson which the war had taught him was the absolute necessity of being equipped
                with modern arms. Second class weapons, he says, are of no use at all. Not only
                should we have good weapons, but we should be able to use them. To shoot straight is
                the first prerequisite for a good defence of our country. If we lay ourselves out to
                cultivate the art of good shooting, we shall by consequence lay ourselves out for
                the steady and persistent encouragement of our. rifle clubs. We shall do for them
                immensely more than we have ever tried to accomplish in the history of these States                If we encourage our men to the fullest possible extent to become good shots, we
                shall be laying broad and deep the &#39;first&#39; foundation for a good sound
                national defence. I believe we should begin early in this matter. I believe that we
                should begin with the cadets, and train them up to the use of the rifle in such a
                way as to make them proficient marksmen by the time they have reached manhood                Without the necessity for conscription and simply by relying upon- the encouragement
                given to to the voluntary spirit which is within us all - the spirit to defend our
                hearths and homes - we can build up a defence which will make us impregnable to all
                outside powers, and give us a defence which shall be adequate to all immediate
                purposes. In addition to cultivating accurate marksmanship, we should absolutely lay
                it down in this measure that all positions in our defence force shall be open to
                whoever cares to aspire to them. When we have done that, and brought to bear a
                business-like aptitude in the administration of our defence office, we shall have
                done all that our immediate requirements seem to demand. The ideal to be kept in
                view can be stated in a very few words. While steadily pursuing our ideal of peace                we should at the same time be prepared to defend our Empire, if needed. </para>

                        <para>- After listening for the past couple of months to some of the great military
              speeches which have been delivered, I feel to-night that I am a military man. The fact
              of the matter is that I think I am upon horseback. Indeed, it has seemed to me as I
              have sat here from day to day listening to these splendid military orations, that we
              were almost in an eternal struggle for our own national existence. Yes : I can hear

                negligible quantity its barking has no more effect upon me than has the bite of the
                Australian flea upon the tail of the American eagle. However, it seems tome that we
                can almost hear the music of the boisterous drums ; yes, the silver voices of heroic
                bugles calling our military men from the hills, the mountains, the dales, and the
                valleys. Yes, I can see vast multitudes gathered together listening to the
                impassioned orations of heroic orators calling upon the people to defend their
                country against the invasion of rabbits and band i coots. Really I must confess that
                for 30 years I heard the same cry in the United States, &#34; We are going to have
                an invasion.&#34; When I lived in Mexico, I heard the same cry that I hear now in
                Australia, &#34; Somebody is going to invade us. We cannot tell which nation it isa                but surely some nation is coming.&#34; Ever since I have been in Australia, a period
                of thirteen years - with the exception of the little time that I spent in Tasmania -
                I have heard the same cry of &#34; an invasion,&#34; but the only invasions that I
                ever read of are invasions of rabbits. To-night, therefore, just for a few moments                I want to dwell upon the reason of this thing. I take it that this is a democratic
                government - I take it that it is resting on justice, that it is regulated by law                and that there are a reasonable lot of people to manage the affairs of this country                That is the way it looks to me ; but, perhaps, I am mistaken. Let us look at the
                Bill which is before us. It is absolutely full of the wildness and sublimity of
                romance - military romance. But it is just a little too strenuous to quite satisfy
                the ideals of the romantic military people. These are not the days of Napoleon nor
                of Hannibal, neither are they the days of Alexander. The nations cannot sneak an
                army into a country now. Before that army starts they send a wire. Before ever they
                start somebody sends a wire - some newspaper man to tell us that they are coming.

                            <para>- Yes certainly. Before they are on the ship another wire will come - &#34; The
                Japanese army have started.&#34; All we want is a national police force. I remember
                that one time when I was in England an Englishman said to me, &#34; Supposing that
                Lord Moseley . landed in New York to-morrow with 200,000 red coats, what would
                &#91;the President of the United States do&#34;? I replied, &#34;He would simply
                wire .to the .police of New York to arrest them as vagrants.&#34; That is what we
                should do here. If the Japanese landed here we should send out for a few constables                and arrest them for vagrancy. If they landed at Carpentaria they would i eat
                themselves out of house and home before they got half way to Port Augusta. I do hope
                that the Australian people are reasonable. I understand that reasoning with men who
                have renounced their reason is like administering medicine to dead cats. But I know
                honorable members are intelligent, and that is why I talk to them. Would I be in
                this House if I had not confidence that I should meet a lot of reasonable men here ?
                Long before an army sailed from Japan or China should we not have the news of their
                intended departure? Did not honorable members know the very morning upon -which the
                American army sailed for Cuba <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Did they not
                know it upon 13th April, 1897 ? Did we not know at Kalgoorlie, and did not I have to
                give an announcement that the Americans had won? I did not get a wire. There was no
                trouble about that at all. I knew that the Americans would win, because we belonged
                to the Anglo-Celtic people. What is your British babe - he wants to fight from the
                very start. We are a fighting people. Then why talk about not being able to fight
                the Japanese ? They have to bring coal and provisions upon their ships. Look at the-
                trouble which Admiral Dewey had to get munitions, supplies, and coal with which to
                go to Manila. If the British had not allowed him to get his supplies of coal in Hong
                Kong before he was ordered to clear out under a sort of understood veiled threat
                business, where would the Americans have been at Manilla ? The Japanese have no
                place where they could put this army j no station where they could get their
                supplies from,&#34; yet they are going to come down here and 4,000,000 Australians
                are going to get down sup in ely on their knees and say &#34;Oh King Jap ! take us !
                &#34; Is that to be the position ? No. I believe I could fight them myself
                single handed. I say that 5,000 Australians such as we sent to South Africa - not
                machines, massed together like the poor Tommy Atkins, but intelligent individuals
                - any where in this great Commonwealth could defend it against 200,000 Japanese                200,000 Chinamen, or 200,000 of any other nation of the world barring our own. Let
                us look at the matter from another stand-point. Suppose the foe lands at any of
                these places, they have to live. Where are they going to get then- supplies from ?
                How are they to live ? Are they to live on rabbits till they can get into civilized
                parts ? It is preposterous to talk of an invasion of Australia. There is another
                little point bearing on this matter, and that is in regard to training. I have done
                with the question of invasion, because I do not think there is any nation in the
                world which could invade us. Three or four hundred of us went to South America to
                take the Mosquito Kingdom, but we found that they were too strong for us, and we did
                not attack them. We recognise that every nation that trades&#39; with another has an
                interest in that nation. The Americans are getting a big trade in Australia, and
                even if Great Britain were not able to face the music when an enemy threatened, the
                United States would step in and say - &#34; No ! We have a little trade out there                -and you cannot interfere.&#34; Did I not talk to the United States admiral in the
                Town-hall here, and did he not say - &#34; These are a great people, and I regret
                that we do not get more trade out here.&#34; That was his first thought. I say right
                here that there is no fear of any invasion, and I do hope that we shall not go in
                for a military oligarchy. Every great democracy that has been crushed has been
                crushed by military despotism - by the &#34;man on horseback.&#34; I admit that war
                wastes the accumulation of the people. A few men grow into great opulence and wealth
                and great importance, but it casts a great gloom over the vast multitude of the
                people. They recognise that they have to pay the taxes. We do not want a military
                despotism, or the &#34;man on horseback,&#34; in Australia, and that is why I
                suggested the other day that the only uniform which the men ought to wear was a
                button on the shoulder. If we do away with the feathers, if we do away with spurs -
                and I have often seen the spurs worn by these military men tear the dresses of the
                ladies, with whom they dance - we take all the military glory out of these chaps. If
                they want to earn their living _ by butchering, instead of developing industries for
                the advance of the people, let them go at it ; but I am going to oppose any system
                that has an idea of establishing in this country any sort of a military organization
                which is going to interfere with the people. What does it mean? In the United States
                they have regiments of millionaires&#39; sons, and barracks, and guns. They have two
                or three hundred thousand men there under&#34; the volunteer system. That is a most
                dangerous system to a democracy. . Why is it so ? Birds of a feather flock together                and when there is trouble you will see them crossing the stream together. Abraham
                Lincoln said - &#34; Don&#39;t swap horses while you are crossing the stream ! &#34;
                But we do not consider that we have any streams here to cross. I believe in a drill
                system. I believe in teaching the young men a little discipline, so as to make men
                of them. I wish we had every larrikin in Melbourne in a barracks for a couple of
                months, anyhow, once a year. The country boys will join, and will learn something
                about military discipline, but the vast multitudes in the cities will not do so. We
                could have our drill-masters going out into every town and teaching the young men on
                twelve or fifteen afternoons a year, and it should be compulsory for the men to
                close up their places of business and to go out and drill on the squares on those
                particular afternoons. Those who have travelled the United States since the Spanish
                war find that it is a great drill camp. Prom the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from
                the tepid waters of the Gulf of Mexico to the snow-capped regions of the Arctic
                north, it is one great camp. In fact they are even drilling the women there. That is
                all we need in this country. We simply want to train men so that they can march and
                counter march, arid then teach them to have confidence and self-reliance. Once we
                have done that, there can be no danger of invasion. If we set up a great military
                establishment, it will mean spending thousands of pounds of the people&#39;s money                or of loan money. I am going to oppose loans. Let us tax ourselves to meet the
                future, and not go on mortgaging posterity, because it is not we who pay ; we only
                pay the interest, and we hand down the payment of the principal. If we build up this
                great military system what will be the result ? In two or three years it will be
                obsolete. We have this new submarine &#39;cigar-shaped ship which slips under the
                ocean for twelve or fifteen hours and blows up our big warships, and we may have an
                army in balloons dropping lyddite on our cities before long. Let us put all this
                aside and establish a national police force. If we have drill masters we can send
                them into the country to drill the men to fire the enemy out. Then we should have a
                national gauge of railways. If we had a war- at Cooktown, by the time that the
                Queensland army would be defeated the New South Wales army would get to the line                but the Victorian and South Australian armies would be playing hoo key and quoits at
                Albury, waiting for trains. Such would be possible under the present system. And yet
                we hear of all this military glory. I want Australia to rest on industry and love                and on intelligent application to progress - not on military despotism, and not on
                cunning or violence - so that we shall all work together to advance this country to
                be the great country that every one is talking about. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BATCHELOR</inline>(South Australia).The honorable member
            who has just sat down has thrown quite a new light on some of the subjects relating to
            defence, and I think &#39;there is a good deal in many of his remarks. I am not going to
            deal with them now. I do not want to touch on the details of the Bill or on the very
            many interesting points in connexion with military matters that have been raised during
            the debate. This has been a most interesting debate. I have listened to the greater part
            of it patiently, and have enjoyed the tone of the speeches. I certainly think it would
            be difficult to have speeches couched in a more democratic strain &#39; than we have
            heard or which On the whole could be in better taste. They were filled generally with
            ideas of lofty patriotism, and a determination to go in for such defences as will best
            enable Australia to work out her own career. The debate has been of an exceptionally
            democratic nature. We have had speeches in which it has been laid down that we ought to
            have a citizen soldiery. Old-world military ideas are to be completely discarded ;
            everything is to be up to date. We are -star ting a new nation and a new defence force
            with it. We are not trammelled by old conditions, and we have the advantage of a recent
            war - fought with modern weapons and modern armaments for the first time - for our
            guidance. The question that has been occurring to me right through is, &#34; How are we
            going to get all these democratic notions of ours within the four comers of the
            Bill&#34;? That is the difficulty. I see nothing of these democratic proposals in the
            Bill. It has been described as a skeleton measure. It is not more than two or three
            years since a measure almost exactly similar was introduced in the South Australia
            Legislature by the right honorable the Minister for Trade and Customs, Sergeant
            Kingston. That Bill was introduced before the Boer war, before the advantages of a
            citizen soldiery had been proved, and before federation at all, so that the similarity
            between the two measures has not failed to impress me. </para>

            administration. As a skeleton it might do very well with some alterations,ashave been
            suggested by the honorable member for Northern Melbourne and others, whose amendments I
            shall certainly feel impelled to support. The whole Bill depends upon administration            and I have been wondering whether we can trust the present Government to administer the
            Bill in the spirit in which this House has certainly shown, by the speeches delivered            that it desires that the military affairs of the country should be conducted. At the
            head of the administration we have the Right Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir

            having the military affairs of. the Commonwealth conducted on more democratic lines than

                    <para>Mr.BATCHELOR.- I recollect seeing the right honorable gentleman at the celebrations
            connected with the opening of the Commonwealth Parliament, and certainly he was the most
            gorgeous in all that dazzling throng. But I can to some extent trust the Minister for
            Defence - because he is full of practical . common sense - to discard this kind of thing
            when he starts out to administer the department. One thing the Government have done
            which makes it look to me as if they really did not mean what they have said about
            having a citizen soldiery,, wherein every man from the lowest rank will have a clear
            opportunity of rising up to the position of a general. If we had local administration by
            men who understood the conditions prevailing in Australia, and who had been trained in
            the work of governing a citizen soldiery, there would be a probability of what we have
            been promised in that respect, and in the direction-, of a reduction of the expenditure
            connected! with the high positions, being realized. But, as a matter of fact, we find
            that the Government have sent to England for an Imperial officer, trained under Imperial
            conditions, and knowing nothing of the conditions prevailing in Australia. I hope I am
            mistaken,but I am assuming, from what I have seen in the newspapers, that we are to have
            an Imperial officer, possibly with South African experience, but who at any rate has
            been brought up under a system which has utterly failed, and which has to be entirely
            reorganized in order that it may meet the needs of the times. We have seen, with some
            regret, in connexion with the British Military department, the spectacle of a squabble
            between the late Commander-in-Chief of the army and the political heads of the War
            Office in Parliament, as to who is responsible for all the mistakes which have occurred
            lately. But although that organization has failed, we are going to it for a man whom we
            expect to come here and rule our citizen soldiery under conditions of which he canal            necessarily have had no experience whatever. Can we expect such an officer to discard
            elaborate uniforms and do away with all the summery, frippery, and foppery that so
            much hinder real efficiency in military matters ? Seeing that the Government propose to
            go outside the States of Australia altogether, and to import some officer who cannot be
            conversant with what we desire to. see brought about, it is idle for us to make
            democratic speeches on military matters embodying ideas which cannot be very well
            embodied in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- -I very much regret that we have to discuss a Bill like this at all. Certainly              in the opening session of this Parliament, there was quite enough work for us to do in
              regard to other matters without having this Bill brought in. I take this opportunity
              of expressing my exception to it, because it is perfectly clear that the time that
              will be occupied in the discussion of this measure will leave us so much less
              opportunity for the discussion of other Bills if they are to be brought before
              Parliament before Christmas. But the Bill having been introduced, it is incumbentupon
              us to consider it. In the first place I have no hesitation in saying that the Bill has
              been drawn by officers belonging to the old school of aggression instead of to the
              school of defence. It is only with the school of defence that, I believe, Australia
              wishes to deal. Certain honorable members have expressed the idea that we ought to take
              our part in the defence of the Empire. I altogether protest against that opinion. We
              have nothing whatever to do with the defence of the Empire while we have no voice in
              regard to the wars that the Empire takes upon itself. It might be a different thing if
              we had such a voice. At the present time all that we can be expected to do is to
              provide for the defence of our local forts and to guard against invasion. Beyond that
              we are not called upon to do anything, nor should we advance beyond it. It is quite
              possible that the High Commissioner for Australia, when he is established in London              may at some time be required to notify to a nation with which England happens to be at
              war, that Australia will not engage in the contest, but will hold itself as a neutral
              body. Holding that view as strongly as I do, it seems to me to be clear that all we
              have to do is to provide for the defence of our shores. If the. last war in which
              Great Britain has engaged has taught us anything at all, it is . that no nation can
              well be invaded. Invasion to-day is an extremely different thing to what it was a few
              years ago. It must be remembered also, that although we are a continent in size, we
              are still an island, and that all troops coming here for the purposes of invasion
              would have to be transported in ships. If honorable members really consider what war
              is under present conditions, they will realize that if twenty transports were to come
              and try and land soldiers on our shores they could not land a single man, and that 50
              or 60 riflemen on the shore could hold that force at bay.&#39; If England had not had
              possession of the ports in South Africa, she would not, even with her powerful navy              have been able to land a single man. We have seen 30,000 soldiers barred by a single
              river like the Tug el a. Surely we should learn lessons from facts like that; and if the
              military men will not learn the lessons themselves, and are so&#39; wrapped up in
              their own ideas of war that modern instances have no weight with them, we must set
              them aside. </para>

                            <para>- That is true; and T would give the Government power to get the very best arms
                and ammunition that can be bought. I would also allow the creation of two kinds of
                corps that cannot be established in a day. The first is an engineering corps, which
                is much needed in time of war. From personal knowledge of engineering officers&#34;
                who have served in the Transvaal, I can say that in war, as in everything else                common sense rules the day, and those officers who possessed common sense were far
                move useful than any one else. The second corps that needs to be established is an
                artillery force. Men need to be trained in the use of artillery, and you cannot have
                artillerymen springing up at a moment&#39;s notice ; although the Boer war has shown
                us, even in this respect, that men can rapidly learn to use artillery so as to
                become equal to the most experienced artillerymen in the world. It has been proved
                that bush gunners have been far more useful in war than men trained at Shoeburyness,
                Aldershot, or anywhere else. I only say that in this spirit - that the man who is
                fighting for his home, and who is used to the country for which he is fighting, is
                capable of rendering a very good account of himself in conflicts with the enemy. Bad
                as the war has been in South Africa, I am convinced that no nation except Great
                Britain could have undertaken it at all, because no nation except Great Britain
                could have transported the troops to the scene of battle; and I am sure that the
                troops of other nations would have gone down in the same way as our men did in the
                early battles. What we have to fight against is the introduction of what I may call
                the trained military system. I was myself at one time a volunteer, and having some
                knowledge of the use of the rifle I on one occasion happened to proclaim rather too
                loudly the opinion that, given 1,000 bush irregular troops, I would beat 10,000 of
                the best trained men who ever went into the field. So much exception was taken to
                that statement by my brother officers that I felt I could not work with men who held
                the idea that troops should be massed together in a body where they could be shot
                down by a few riflemen. That is one of the reasons why I withdrew from the corps                The old idea of officers, full of their ideas of drill, Was to keep their men massed
                together. How would it be possible to mass men together if any invasion took place
                  <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The first order given is to get as far
                apart as possible to avoid rifle firing. Experience has taught us that we ought to
                give up unnecessary drill. I agree with the honorable member for South Australia,
                  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor,</inline> that the Bill appears to have
                been drawn up in 1896 or 1897 - perhaps by Sergeant Kingston - and embodies the
                ideas which were then current. I suppose one of the worst things that can happen to
                a man is to be trained to military pursuits. The stories which we hear from South
                Africa of the officers trained in the English military schools almost exceed belief                and the honorable member for Parramatta stated that even in New South Wales
                positions have been given to certain men on account of their family influence. An
                officer who has returned from South Africa told me that he would prevent any man who
                could even remember that he had a grandfather from holding a commission, and it
                behoves us to do all we can to put an end to the nonsense and tommy-rot which has
                grown up in connexion with the military forces of the Empire. This officer told me                among other illustrations which he gave of the peculiarities of English officers                that he heard a man who was in command of a considerable body of troops, and is
                still in active service, complain in affected tones, &#34;I came out here without
                enough toothpicks, and I cannot get any here that I like.&#34; What folly it is to
                train men like that. </para>

                fools.&#34; &#34;No,&#34; said the Australian officer, &#34;my father came from
                England, and he was not a fool ; but I should like to know where some of these
                officers come from.&#34; The reply was, &#34;I do not know, but it seems to me that
                every influential family in England has opened the door of its private idiot asylum
                and got its members positions in the army.&#34; We want to do away with that sort of
                tiling. All that is necessary here is some system for the calling of men together in
                the case of emergency. This could be done in a week or a fortnight. I do not object
                to the formation of militia regiments, </para>

            conducted mainly by volunteer regiments. &#39; If people will not fight for their
            country, in a spirit of patriotism, in time of invasion, they should be wiped off the
            face of the earth, and another race should take their place. But to resist invasion, no
            such thing as drill is wanted. War is coming back to a state of things in which the mind
            must triumph. One hundred men with brains, and skilled in the use of the rifle, will be
            equivalent to 10,000 men who have been trained by rote, and whose power of initiation
            has been drilled out of them. In the framing of provisions for the retirement of
            officers at certain ages, those who are responsible for the Bill seem to have lost sight
            of the fact that some of our volunteer regiments largely owe their existence to the
            popularity of the man at the head of them. I could name at least two instances of the
            kind in New South Wales, where the public spirit of the colonel and the interest he
            takes in everything appertaining to the advancement of his regiment are responsible for
            its strength and efficiency, and there must be many other such cases. </para>

                            <para>- I will mention the New South Wales Lancers for one, but I am not anxious to
                give names, because there may be other instances of the kind with which I am not
                familiar. If the Government aid -the rifle clubs, they will do almost all that is
                necessary for our defence. I do not think that there should be any permanent men                except such as are necessary for manning particular forts. To show the absurdity of
                official recommendations, I would point to the fact that it has been proposed that
                the Commonwealth should fortify Thursday Island. That might be very well if we had a
                fleet, but as we have no fleet, and are intent only upon fighting in our own
                defence, the proposal seems an absurd one. Then it has been suggested that the enemy
                might land at Port Darwin or other places of the kind, but it is forgotten that if
                they did so, it. would cost them ten times as much to prosecute the war as it would
                cost us to repel them. If they held such a place for a short time then, they would
                find themselves in such bad straits, that they would soon wish to get away. I think
                that if we see that ports, such as Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Newcastle could
                not be entered by boats straight away - and the formation of a corps of submarine
                miners ; and a few torpedo boats would be sufficient- for the purpose - we should do
                all that is required. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Eden Monaco, in mentioning Twofold Bay, has shown why
                even Monaco should not be chosen as the federal capital j because if we have to
                fortify that port it would add enormously to the expense of the federal government                I am sure that any man who really understands what war is will see how impossible it
                is for any nation to bring a body of men there. Once the men landed they could never
                get away, and they could not force an entrance into Sydney. They would be unable                once they disembarked, to get away, because a very few sharp-shooters could clear
                them all out. We have seen already how small an impression artillery can make
                against riflemen, especially when protected by pits, and we know that ships of war
                could not carry sufficient stores. I am sorry that nobody has moved an amendment
                that the Bill be read a second time this day six months. When I consider the spirit
                in which it is drawn, how much its authors have dwelt on the past, and how unable
                they have been to take the lessons of the Boer war ; how, in fact, they have
                declined to profit by the experience which all other nations have gained, even if we
                have not - I should have been only too glad if some one had moved that its second
                reading be postponed until this day six months, and I would have voted accordingly.

                        <para>- I disagree with the contention that this is not a very important Bill. It is one
              of the very important Bills that we as a Federal Parliament have to deal with. It is
              of that importance that it is worthy of the discussion which has taken place and of
              the consideration which will be given to it. I. am with the honorable member for South
              Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor,</inline> in the expression of
              regret that we cannot incorporate the ideal type of militarism in a measure of this
              kind which we would like. But by means of discussion and by amendments where we can
              see our way to introduce them, we may be able to bring about the constitution of a
              federal form of defence on those lines which we think will accord with our democracy
              and with the principles of a good, efficient, and effective defence. We were led to
              suppose that the Bill was the outcome of the united wisdom of the leading commanders
              in Australia or the military authorities. But we have been informed to-night that it
              is practically a reprint of a Bill which was introduced by a former Premier of South
              Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> who now fills an
              important position in this Parliament. I find that this contention is largely borne
              out by a document which came into my hands to-day. It is entitled &#34; A Further
              Report of the Federal Military Committee,&#34; and in the 4th section they say -

                    </talk.start>
                    <para>As the principles embodied in the Bill drafted by the committee have been repeatedly
            altered, and as their recommendations on the alterations previously submitted to them            which were forwarded to tl|| Minister on the 15th instant have not been adopted in the
            draft submitted to them on the 20th instant, they consider it unnecessary to repeat
            their former objections, which in their opinion still hold good. They therefore
            respectfully request that if the Bill is brought before the Cabinet or Parliament in the
            form in which it was sent to them it should be made plain that it is not recommended by
            them, and does not meet with their approval. </para>
                    <para class="block">This is a report which was submitted by the military experts, who were
            asked to advise the Government- upon the Bill. From what little experience I have had of
            militarism, I do not think a Bill which would recommend itself to military experts such
            as we have had in the States up to the present time, is likely to be acceptable either
            to myself or to others who take a more democratic stand on this matter. I quite agree
            with those, speakers who have contended that the militarism with which we have been
            acquainted - largely a repetition of that which obtains in the old country and in the
            old world, - is a militarism which does not harmonize with our ideas of freedom and
            democracy, is a militarism which would be inimical to that freedom and that democracy
            which we are so desirous of building up in this new nation. At the same time, we cannot            get away from the fact that we must have some form of defence, that we must make
            provision against dangers which may assail us from without, because I hold that it is
            only from without that dangers are possible. That be ing so, the next consideration we
            have is to devise that form of national defence which will harmonize with our free
            institutions - with our democratic ideals - and, at the same time,, secure for us that
            protection which is necessary, and which we are striving to obtain. The question arises
            - what form should that kind of defence take ? The Bill proposes, first of all, that the
            form of defence shall rest in an active service which shall be constituted, a certain
            reserve force withdrawn from it, the formation of rifle clubs and the formation of
            cadets, presumably amongst our schools and so forth Our defence forces are to consist
            firstly of&#39; permanent men, who are to give us continuous service, who are to devoted            themselves wholly and solely to military matters, and whose salaries and keep are to be a
            charge upon the Commonwealth. It is also proposed to establish a militia whose services
            will not be- continuous, and whose payment will bein accordance with certain prescribed
            rules. Then there is to be a purely volunteer force, whose services will not be
            continuous, and to whom no payment will be made except in times of warfare. Power is
            also given to the authorities to establish rifle clubs and to form cadet corps. The
            principle is also - introduced that all the male inhabitants of&#39; the Commonwealth
            who have been here fora period of six months, who are British subjects, and between the
            ages of 18 and 60, shall be subject to be called upon to perform military service. First
            of all the- - unmarried men between the ages of IS and 30 are to be called upon, then
            those-, between the ages of 30 and 45, then the married men and widowers without
            children between the ages of. 18-- and 45, and finally the men between the ages of 45
            and 60.. The provision that these men may be called upon to take up arms in time of need
            seems to me to introduce that obnoxious Continental system of conscription, and in so
            far as it goes in that particular direction, I shall oppose it. I am opposed to any form
            of conscription, no matter in what shape it may present itself. I believe that, in a
            country which is well governed, the patriotism; of the people will be sufficient to call
            forth voluntary service in its defence sufficient to meet its requirements. If a country
            is so badly governed that the people believe that they will be better off under a
            foreign yoke, conscription is not going to save it ; and if the people are so degenerate            that they require compulsion in the form of conscription to take the place of
            patriotism, then they are in a condition in which conscription will not save them. -I
            believe that this is a retrograde movement on the part of those who framed the Bill, and
            that it is- proposing to impose upon the free people and institutions of this
            Commonwealth the methods and measures of the old world that ought to have been swept
            into- oblivion long ago. &#34;We should look upon out military defence as something in
            the shape of an insurance against possible loss, and deal with it accordingly. We should
            see that the premiums we are to pay for that protection are not of such a character that
            the benefits to he derived will practically cease to be benefits at all. We should see
            that for a minimum amount of premium we get a maximum amount of efficiency and
            protection. If we set up this ideal we shall have as small a permanent force as
            possible, and shall depend for our protection mainly upon citizen soldiery in the most
            efficient and best equipped form. We should make our insurance against the <inline font-style="italic">risks</inline> of invasion as cheap as possible for the whole
            community. At the commencement of our Federal Government we are hampered in many ways            and particularly in the direction of raising money to defray the cost of the Federal
            Government. We have to face that wretched provision, the 87th section of the
            Constitution Act, known as the Braddon blot, which requires us to raise so much <inline font-style="italic">money</inline> for purely State purposes, in addition to that
            required for federal expenditure, and the larger our expenditure for defence purposes            the heavier will be the burdens of taxation on the people, and the greater will he the
            general dissatisfaction with respect to our federal form of government. We want to avoid
            anything of that kind, and, therefore, our expenditure in the direction of defence and
            other matters must, for the next ten years, be kept down to a minimum. With regard to
            the direction which our defence movement should take, some honorable members say that
            our defence operations should be confined to Australia, and that we should only concern
            ourselves with land defences, making no provision for operations beyond our own. shores            I disagree entirely with that &#34;contention. We &#39; ace a part and parcel of the
            British Empire, and our. location is such that if we wish to have an effective defence
            we must be prepared to strike a blow outside of our own borders, and not wait until the
            enemy has obtained a footing on our shores. I would go a step further and say that the
            commercial interests and the freedom and the true progress of the people of this
            Commonwealth are so bound up with the parent stock that we must look at this matter from
            the stand-point of the Empire as well as from the Standpoint of our own Commonwealth            There is a good deal in the contention that we should, have a voice in the making of
            war. W&#62;e may wish to have some say in the matter ; but wars are not made <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> us or by the British Empire for the mere sake of war            Wars are forced upon us, and the main question we have to consider is, are these waist            vital to the Empire as a whole or not ? If wars are vital to the Empire as a whole, then
            I say that we, the peoples of the Commonwealth, must take a hand in them for our own
            protection and for our own liberty, and we must be prepared to consider the position
            from that stand-point as well as the standpoint of mere local defence. Another reason
            why we should look at the matter from the naval as well as from the land defence
            stand-point is that we have an enormous commerce. We are looking to the outside of our
            own territorial bounds for the consumption of our surplus goods. In comparison with our
            population, I suppose that we carry on as large a commerce as does any nation. If we are
            to maintain that commerce, and fit is essential to our progress and welfare, it is
            necessary that we should do something to protect it. AVe are not going to protect it by
            creating an armed soldiery within our shores, find by confining their operations to
            &#34;our territory. In this connexion I may mention that in a work on <inline font-style="italic">The Federal Defence of Australasia,</inline> by Craig, which is
            published in the old land, the figures relating to our commerce are brought up to 1895.
            I find there that the British commerce in that ye al- totalled in value something like
            &#163;970,000,000. Of this amount, the self-governing States of this- Commonwealth
            practically contributed about &#163;143,000,000 per annum, or one-seventh of the total
            commerce of the Empire. As against that sura, the cost of the British navy which
            protects and maintains this commerce amounts to something like &#163;20,000,000 per
            annum, of which these States contribute about &#163;268,000. In other words, the States            while having about one-seventh of the total commerce of the Empire, only contribute
            about 1-7 5th of the cost of protecting and maintaining that commerce. The mother
            country contributes the remaining 74-75ths, or about &#163;19,700,000. This is an aspect
            of the question which, in estimating the form of defence into which we should launch, we
            should be very short-sighted, indeed, if we overlooked. The same work goes on to deal
            with the exports of the States. It shows to what extent those exports are carried on
            with the motherland with the different colonies, and with foreign countries. It is
            summed up on page 39, where the writer says - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The Australian colonies are a proud part of the Imperial Empire, second only in
              trade and wealth to India. The past and present progress of Australia is nothing to
              what it will be in the future. The imports and exports between the United Kingdom and
              her colonies are greater than that with foreign countries. They totalize <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50,</inline> 000,000 for imports, and &#163;(.i0,000,000
              for exports. The imports from home ports showed 32 per cent., <inline font-style="italic">5i</inline> per cent. of intercolonial imports, and 14 per center              from other countries. The proportion exported to England amounted to 42 per cent., to
              other colonies 44 per cent.., and 16 per cent, to other countries. </para>
                        <para class="block">These figures briefly indicate the extent to which we are doing
              business with the mother country, the extent of our oversea business, and of our
              business with foreign powers. Those who say that the operations of our defence forces
              should be confined to the limits of the Commonwealth seem to lose sight of the
              important fact of the wealth of our nation. They do not seem to realize that we should
              look beyond out own coastline if we are to protect our wealth and our people to the
              full extent that is necessary. If we are going to do justice all round, the bordello              which has hitherto fallen upon the mother country must be borne by her children so
              long as they are prepared to share with her in the advantages derived from this source
              of creating wealth. The only way in which I can .see that this can be done is by
              maintaining within our own waters, if not costly war vessels - to which objections
              have been raised on the ground that they are no sooner constructed than they become
              obsolete - at least some torpedo-boats, that will enable us to do our fair share in
              defending the wealth that we are sending from and bringing to our shores, and which
              goes to create our national prosperity. It is my firm opinion that we are working on
              safe natural lines when we work in harmony with the mother country, as far as it is
              possible for us so to do. Our land defence and the equipment of our soldiery is a
              matter which more particularly affects ourselves, and in which, under the central
              control of the Federal Government, we ought to attain a higher degree of efficiency at
              a, less cost than we have been able to attain hitherto. The old world idea of
              militarism) considers that the best form of defence - the best system of militarism -
              is that which drafts the flower of the country from the avocations of production, from
              practical citizenship into large standing armies, where men are really converted into
              parts of a huge military machine. The standing armies become <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> drain upon the resources of the country in every
              possible form, without returning anything by way of compensation, except as a sort of
              insurance, as a kind of guarantee against outside aggression, if that should ever
              threaten them. That is the kind of defence which our military authorities &#34;seem
              inclined to impose upon us. I do not know what the experience of the other States has
              been, but our experience iri New South Wales is that the efforts of our high military
              advisers have been wholly in the direction of creating the nucleus of a standing army
              in our midst - of getting together a number of men whose special qualification and
              purpose in life should be militarism. Anything in the nature of a citizen soldiery has
              been regarded <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> these military experts as
              inefficient, and has been discouraged as much as possible. Those military experts and
              this prevalent idea of defence have recently received a rude &#34;shock in South
              Africa. I trust that the result of the experience gained there will be to show that
              these old-world ideas are about worn out, and that after all a citizen soldier is not
              such bad material for fighting purposes, as we were led to suppose prior to that
              event. If the price of the defence of the Commonwealth of Australia is to be the
              creation of a large standing army, consisting of a large number of men whose whole
              idea and purpose in life is merely militarism, who contribute nothing to the
              development of the resources of the country, and who are a burden on the taxpayer              then I say, &#34; No kind of militarism like that for me.&#34; I believe that it will
              be necessary to have a -certain number of men devoting themselves to military purposes
              so as to secure efficiency for the rank and file of the citizen soldiery, but our
              permanent forces should be limited to that, and that only. We should never look to a
              permanent force as the main source of our defence. I am not, however, altogether in
              love with the proposal that a citizen soldiery should be composed purely of
              volunteers. I did believe that the man who was prepared to volunteer his services was              perhaps, the best man to have, but I am forced to admit from experience that has been
              obtained in America, and from the general trend of events there, that tha pure
              volunteer is not altogether the great friend of democracy that we were led at one time
              to suppose. It is found in America, under the conditions which obtain there now, that
              the great rank and file of the toilers are unable to devote themselves to a purely
              volunteer movement. They are prevented largely not only by lack of time, but by their
              inability to bear the expenditure that is absolutely necessary in connexion with it              The purely volunteer movement has therefore got into the hands of wealthy nien, and is
              being used by those wealthy men as a means for enforcing upon the people their demands
              in respect of the settlement of labour disputes. It has been found in America that
              these wealthy volunteer soldiers are as much the enemy of the democracy of the country
              as the paid soldier was. I can clearly for see that the same conditions may be brought
              about here. The ideal form of citizen soldiery which I favour is that which will give
              an amount of State assistance sufficient to cover the actual cost of those who take
              part in it. They do not want to be paid for their time, but the expenditure which they
              have&#39; to incur should be covered, so that every citizen of the Commonwealth may
              have an opportunity of enrolling himself in the defence of his country and of securing
              that efficiency in military knowledge which the various means adopted to that end
              provide. In our country districts it very often happens that a man has to ride 15 or
              20 miles to a centre in order to receive drill instruction. That means that his
              presence in that centre costs him two or three shillings. Such an expenditure would
              not be a matter of much concern to him if it only occurred once or twice,. but when it
              becomes a regular and necessary thing, in order to obtain efficiency, it excludes a
              number of deserving men from the movement, and leaves this militarism in the hands of
              those who have a little more wealth at their disposal. I want to see all men placed
              upon an equal footing with regard to the opportunities offered to secure efficiency in
              this form of defence. The ideal lines on which to start a system of the character that
              I should like to see established, and which, I think, would accord with our democracy
              and free institutions, are first of all to lay the groundwork in our public schools              Let our free s&#39;chools and colleges be the drilling grounds wherein the first
              principles are imparted. Necessary military knowledge would be imparted in that way              and the boys would be better scholars for it. Drill instruction should form part of
              the public school curriculum throughout the Commonwealth. The proposal to establish
              cadet corps should also be carried out, and a certain amount of physical training and
              knowledge of military movements obtained in that way. Then, again, the establishment
              of rifle clubs in every town and country centre should be encouraged. One of the
              essentials of efficiency on the battle-field - an essential greater than that of the
              mere knowledge of military tactics - is the ability to shoot and to shoot straight. .
              It is only by the establishment of these clubs that such ability can be secured, ltd              can be obtained in this way at very little cost to the State, and without the
              necessity for establishing anything in the nature of a standing army. The
              establishment of cadet corps, the creation of rifle clubs in town and country centres              the formation of militia or citizen soldiery regiments, with just sufficient payment
              to cover their out-of-pocket expenses, so as to place the poor man on an equal footing
              with the rich man, and the formation of a small permanent force to control and give
              greater efficiency to the citizen soldiery - these, in my opinion, constitute the
              ideal form of land defence. A point which has been touched upon is that of military
              dress. I agree with those honorable members who say that the plainer our military
              uniforms, the less expensive they are, the more they will be in harmony with our ideas
              of a citizen soldiery. The more expensive they are, the worse it is for that
              particular form of soldiery. As it is the man and not the dress that fights, I fail to
              see any great need for a large expenditure in that direction, or for insisting that
              expensive uniforms shall form part of a man&#39;s equipment. Another matter I should
              like to see taken in hand is the establishment of a State factory for the manufacture
              of small arms and ammunition. There is no use having the human fighting material
              unless we have something for it to fight with. We must have weapons and ammunition              but so far, whilst we have good fighting material in the Commonwealth, we are
              lamentably deficient in this respect. The only way we can remedy that deficiency is by
              establishing a factory of this description, and I prefer to see that factory under
              direct Governmental or State control rather than in the hands of private enterprise. I
              cannot say that I am altogether in love with the Bill. It does not meet my ideals, and
              I hardly see how it is going to be amended in order to meet them. But an army is not
              made on paper, and the mere passing of this Bill&#34; will not create an army. This is
              only a means by which the powers that be are enabled to bring the army together, and
              what we should see to is not only that our Bills are framed, but also that the
              departments are administered, on democratic lines. That will be the work that will
              concern this Parliament later on, when the formation of a Military department is
              completed. When that takes place I shall endeavour to see that the military system is
              in harmony with the democratic ideals of the people of the Commonwealth, and&#34; with
              free institutions. At the same time I am not going to lose sight of the fact that we
              owe a duty to ourselves and to the Empire to which we belong, and that in fulfilling              that duty we should do justice by the old country and by ourselves. I am not going to
              be led into limiting the military provisions to a mere land defence. I trust that the
              Government will realize that, in order to protect our commerce and te maintain our
              position, we need to look&#34; a little further afield. England has maintained her
              proud position not so much through her land forces as through her navy. Therein lies
              her strength, and therein will lie our strength. As far as patriotism is concerned              whilst I am a native Australian, and hold that the highest patriotism to which I or
              any one else can claim is to see to the defence and the promotion of the interests of
              the </para>
                        <para class="block">Commonwealth which we are now building up, I do not limit my
              patriotism nor my ideas of nationhood to the shores of Australasia. I look to the
              great Empire to which we belong, and am prepared to work hand in hand and in harmony
              with that Empire to build up the future progress and welfare of the Commonwealth.

                        <para>- If the House is not too tired of this very long debate, I should like to add a
              few words. I am averse to war, but I quite recognise that we must expect invasion at
              some time, unless we are prepared fully to repel it at any time. &#34; The price of
              liberty is eternal vigilance &#34; ; and it is our first and highest duty to fight in
              the defence of our liberties. The ideal system of defence appears to be, first a small
              permanent paid force ; then a large militia; next a still larger body of cadets ; and
              finally a huge army of volunteers. As has been pointed out by other speakers, the
              strength of a chain is measured by the strength of its weakest link, and the link that
              is going to fail us is the volunteers. It will be recollected that the honorable
              member for Wannon pointed out how necessary it was to keep up the spirit of the
              volunteers by arousing enthusiasm, but in almost the next sentence he pointed out that
              this was found almost impossible in actual practice. How is this to be accounted for
                <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Simply because it is contrary to human
              nature. Men will, in times of danger which they visibly see, make large sacrifices -
              any sacrifices- in defence of their liberty ; but when there is no danger apparently              they will not consent to make those small daily sacrifices which arc required to learn
              drill, the movements of troops, how to shoot, and the discipline of a soldier. It will
              be found in practice almost impossible to get a body of volunteers large enough to
              defend our shores. For this reason I very greatly sympathize with the views of the
              honorable member for West Sydney, who delivered a brilliant speech upon this Bill. I
              should like to see something akin to what he suggested taken in hand. His idea was
              compulsory, short service, which should be undertaken by every able-bodied man in the
              Commonwealth. I sympathize with that view, which I believe is the only true solution
              of the military problem now before us.:, Englishmen have a holy horror of compulsion              and I need hardly say that Australians have a still greater hatred of that ominous
              word. But we are all subject to compulsion all om1 lives, from the cradle to the
              grave. When a child is born we &#39;are compelled by law to register him. Within a few
              months we are obliged by law to have Mm vaccinated, although we may conscientiously
              object to doing so. I may tell the House, by-the-way, that when I lived in Victoria              because I objected to vaccination, I was subjected to considerable persecution at the
              hands of the authorities, and had to shift my house several times to get rid of this
              obligation. But still, the law remains. Then we are obliged by law to send the boy to
              school. All the time we are obliged to maintain him, and be responsible for him until
              he attains to years of maturity. -No man pays rent and taxes because he enjoys it, but
              because he has to do it. lt will be admitted that no man pays customs duties from
              choice, but from necessity. I rather think that there are thousands of people, even in
              this twentieth-century enlightened Australian Commonwealth, who would never pay their
              debts at all but that the dread of something after purchase makes men rather pay the
              bills tilley owe than brave the terrors of the District Court. The whole system of
              human government is based upon the power to compel a citizen to bear his fair share of
              the nation&#39;s burdens. Why then should we be afraid of compulsion in regard to
              matters of defence ? . The Minister for Defence stated that we could call out 974,000
              men for the defence of the Commonwealth, and he left it to be inferred what a terrible
              thing it would be for any European power if they attacked us. I think however that it
              would be fairer to say that we have 74,000 men who are able to bear arms and have arms
              to bear, and 900,000 men and boys ready to cheer them on. What practical good would
              these 900,000 men be in actual warfare if they had no arms ? We might as well have
              900,000 wallabies to defend us. The position would be very different if we had only
              half as many men as the Minister mentioned capable of bearing arms, and trained by              perhaps a three weeks&#39; drilling in the year. Then the larger the city the greater
              the force that it would have to defend it. We might have 50,000 men able to bear arms
              in the defence of Melbourne, the same number to defend Sydney, and a similar
              proportion in the great centres of population. With such arrangements for our defence
              we could sleep secure against invasion. It may be urged that it would take an enormous
              amount of money to arm so many nien, but if it were to be a question of our national
              existence, Australia would very soon raise the necessary money, and if she could not
              do so, the people to whom she owes her huge debts would advance it to her. I have
              nothing to say against that gorgeous person known as the English officer, but I think
              that Australia will be wise to have as little as possible to do with imported
              officers. I have not had much acquaintance with those magnificent heroes, but I have
              never met one of them who had any sympathy with Australians. I do not think many of
              them really understand the art of war, and I am certain that they do not understand
              &#39; Australia ; and foi- these reasons I think we should have as little to do with
              them as possible. It may be said that I am a layman and do not understand these
              matters. But I understand what I read in history, and I ask - who saved the Empire of
              India to England ? It was Clive ; and two years before he gained one of the greatest
              victories ever &#39;achieved under the English flag he was a miserable clerk hi the
              East India Company&#39;s service. Where did he learn his knowledge of warfare              Cromwell thrashed the English, the Irish, and the Scotch - one after the other- where
              did he get his military training ? Then look at America. She certainly had a small
              military college, but it was in the tremendous conflict in which she was engaged that
              her officers were made competent to lead her to glory and to victory. I do not think
              we shall have any difficulty in raising a force sufficient to repel any enemy that is
              likely to come against us, if we imbue our population with, not a jingoistic spirit              but a determination to fight in their own defence. I do not think we require a navy
              unless it maybe to maintain communication with our gallant little partner, Tasmania              If we can get enough short-service men - we might call them compulsory volunteers -
              that will be the solution of the whole question. No doubt honorable members are
              inclined to smile at the term, but we talk about compulsory conciliation, and why not
              compulsory volunteers? Modern warfare has shewn how great an advantage a defender
              always has. I do not believe that all the powers of Europe could conquer Australia, if
              we had 500,000 men who knew how to use arms. I would not like to compare European and
              Australian troops. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">But it is just as well for us to speak straight out what we mean, and
            not to hold back anything. I would not say for a moment that if we took a good number of
            the crack regiments of England - the Inn is kill in gers, the Scots Greys, and the Guards -
            and put them into a splendid open square, and place an equal number of Australians
            against tho see magnificent well trained soldiers, the Australians would beat them ; but
            if you put them into rugged country, if you put them into conditions such as they would
            have to face in actual warfare, the Australians would knock the head off them. I do not
            believe there is any man in the House who has another opinion on that subject. With
            regard to calling out Australians to fight in another country, I decidedly oppose any
            such movement. If I had the power 1 would sell New Guinea and Solomon Islands to
            whomsoever liked to bid for them, and I would bc content with the four corners of
            Australia. We shall have quite enough to do to fight for ourselves without thinking of
            extending a magnificent Empire. I think that accords with the idea of Australians            Australians generally believe that we ought to be content with Australia. I do not think
            that the great United States of America have made anything by their attempt at Empire. I
            du not think they will ever make anything; on the contrary, in less than 50 years they
            will be very sorry that they ever went out of their own boundaries. Australia is big
            enough for me. I do not wish to take up the time of the House at this late hour; but To            think that something ought to be done in the direction of organizing a force of
            volunteers. The lost speaker spoke as if it might be possible to raise a sufficient body
            of unpaid volunteers to defend the Commonwealth. If that is at all possible, it is
            decidedly the best movement of all, because it would not press too heavily on our
            finances. I think that with the assistance of our able Treasurer we could easily find
            money for the rifles and the ammunition ; but&#39; the trouble would be in finding the
            millions of money required to pay the men, owing to there being such a large number. I
            om afraid it is rather Utopian to expect that the men would all work for nothing, so
            that we should attach some expenditure under that head. But I believe that the
            patriotism of Australians is so great, and the value of Australian commerce is so
            colossal, that, even if it came to the worst, we could raise by a tax sufficient -money
            to inaugurate such a system as this. </para>

                    <para>, in reply. - I expressed the intention of the Government on this subject on a
            recent occasion. I told honorable members that the second reading of the Immigration
            Restriction Bill and the Pacific Islanders Bill would both be moved before the Tariff
            was- brought on. I am happy to say that the further expected report of which I spoke in
            making that announcement is likely to be received by the end of the week, and there will
            be received about the some time, I hope, further information for which I am
            telegraphing, and which will be circulated. Before the Tariff is laid on the table            and&#39; therefore before the Customs Regulation Bill has been through the Senate, the
            second reading of the Pacific Islanders Bill will be moved. I cannot say any more than
            that at present, because honorable members will recognise-the difficulties which beset            the Government iii the arrangement of its business when the notice-paper is so heavy as
            it is, but they may rely on this, that before the Tariff is considered, the second
            reading of the Pacific Islanders Bill will have been moved. With regard to the order of
            business to-morrow, we shall take first, as directed under a standing order, Supply            Under standing order 241 to-morrow is what is called in this State grievance day ; Iamb            in the fond hope that honorable members will have no grievances to ventilate, and that
            we shall then get on to other business. Then there will be the consideration of the
            committee&#39;s further report on the Excise on Beer Bill ; next, the continuation of
            the debate on the second reading of the . Defence Bill, and afterwards the continuation
            of the debate on the second reading of the Post and Telegraph Bill. </para>
