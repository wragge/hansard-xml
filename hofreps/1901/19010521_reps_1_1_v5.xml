                    <para>- Before the order of the day is called on, I have to inform the House that I have
              mode a careful examination of that part of the building which is at the disposal of
              Members of the House of Representatives. I may mention at once that, in my opinion              the accommodation for members, officers, and the press is extremely limited. I have
              decided to place the large room on the second floor at the disposal of the Ministerial
              supporters. The next room on the same floor I have allotted to honorable members of
              this House who arc identified with the labour party. The large room on the first floor
              I have set aside for honorable members belonging to the Opposition. After to-morrow
              honorable members using the rooms I have mentioned will find their correspondence
              placed therein. Some further conveniences are to be arranged. Door-keepers will bo on
              duty from nine o'clock in the morning until the rising of the House, to specially
              see that all requirements of honorable members arc properly complied with. Honorable
              members may rest assured that I shall do all in my power to study their convenience
              and comfort in every possible way, and I am sure that the Bight Honorable the Prime
              Minister will assist me in that direction. I should be glad if all honorable members
              will, as soon as possible, band to the Clerk of the House their Mel bourne addresses              to facilitate the distribution of parliamentary papers, &#38;c. With reference to a
              petition which' has been lodged against the return of an honorable member, having
              carefully considered it, I have formed an opinion concerning it ; but in the absence
              of standing orders relating to such a matter I have felt bound to reserve it for the
              consideration of the committee which is to be appointed to deal with such questions.

                    <para>I have on many occasions addressed the members of the Parliament of
            my own State, and I have also on many occasions addressed my fellow citizens of that
            State; but I do not remember an occasion when I have risen to speak with such a heavy
            sense of responsibility as that which now rests upon me. Will you allow me, Mr. Speaker            in the first place, as the oldest parliamentarian in this chamber, to congratulate you
            on the very high position to which you have attained. I trust that the dignity that
            characterizes your conduct of business in the chair will be a standing example to the
            long line of Speakers who will follow you in this Commonwealth Parliament. I beg also to
            take the opportunity of congratulating the right honorable and learned gentleman the
            leader of the Opposition on his restoration to health, and on being able to take his
            seat in this chamber. I once heard a speaker declare the Address in Reply to be a
            document having nothing in it; he said there was never intended to be anything in it            and that the debate following on it was more for the ventilation of grievances than for
            the discussion of public policy. I cannot say that I altogether indorse that opinion            But I will certainly say this: that as far as the opening speech on the present occasion
            is concerned, there is a great deal in it for our consideration, and there is, in my
            opinion, a thorough enunciation of public policy for the Commonwealth. Sir, during the
            last few weeks - I may say since the 1st January - we have been creating history. I was
            present in Sydney on the occasion when His Excellency the Governor-General was sworn in            I witnessed then a great pageant, worthy of Sydney itself, and worthy of the
            Commonwealth. During the past fortnight we have been creating further history. It was a
            happy inspiration on the part of our late great and good Queen to suggest the sending of
            her distinguished grandson to open the new Commonwealth Parliament; and I think, Sir            that the whole Commonwealth may well congratulate itself upon the splendid reception
            which was accorded to their Royal Highnesses by the public of the city of Melbourne, and
            upon the admirable addresses which his Royal Highness delivered on that occasion. I am
            sure that those addresses will be treasured in many a home, and will be of value
            especially to the boys attending the public schools of Victoria. Now, sir, we are
            commencing yet another page of our history. </para>
                    <para>I feel the responsibility of this occasion, because we are now
            supposed to be rising above the provincialism of State Government. We are supposed to be
            now in that "higher sphere" to which reference has so often been made; and I
            cannot but express the hope that in the discussions and deliberations of this House we
            shall set such an example to the other States in matters of legislation as will reflect
            honour upon the first Commonwealth Parliament. Now, in regard to the different measures
            which the Ministry propose to introduce, the first of highest consequence will provide
            for the appointment of "a High Court of Justice with an extensive appellate and
            federal jurisdiction." Sir, I have long been of the opinion that such a court ought
            to have been established among the States many years ago. I have witnessed appeals which
            have been made to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and which have resulted
            almost in ruin to the litigants. I have one particular case in my mind affecting the
            State of Queensland. A question of title to thousands and tens of thousands of acres of
            land was involved. One of the leading barristers for the Crown stated that had he been
            before the Appellate Court in London himself, and argued the case on behalf of the
            Crown, he was quite satisfied that a different decision would have been given than was
            given on that occasion. The decision of the Privy Council was adverse to the Crown, and
            the State of Queensland lost tens of thousands of acres of land, which it has since had
            to purchase back at a very high price. Through having appeals heard by a court within
            the Commonwealth, and heard before the high and distinguished judges who will be
            appointed to that court, we shall not only have a better administration of Australian
            law, but shall certainly save a great amount of the expenses which litigants are now put
            to in their appeals to the higher courts. I regard this as one of the greatest of the
            measures to be passed by this Parliament. I have no doubt as to the wisdom of the choice
            the Government will make of the high and distinguished men who will compose the High
            Court. In regard to the creation of an Inter-State Commission, that is a measure which
            might possibly involve a conflict of opinion. I understand it is proposed to appoint
            three commissioners. My own impression is that the commission should consist of five. I
            have no doubt whatever that in the various States of the Commonwealth the Government will be able to find able
            and competent men who will discharge the duties. I do not think there is any necessity
            whatever to go to the old country in search of good men to form the Inter-State
            Commission. I believe that there are to be found connected with the railway departments
            of the various States men who have for years - some almost for a lifetime - devoted
            their attention to the study of Inter-State matters in connexion with the working of our
            railways and the conduct of traffic upon them; and I feel sure that the Government will
            be able to appoint a commission that will accomplish all that is desired in connexion
            with this measure. One of the principal Bills that the Government proposes to introduce
            is - </para>

                            <para>Probably it is of more importance to Queensland than to any other State. I
                hope honorable members will not consider me egotistical if I claim to have a
                thorough knowledge of this question. I strongly supported the introduction of a Bill
                in the Queensland Parliament in 1885, by the then Premier, Sir Samuel Griffith, for the abolition of Kanaka
                labour from and after the 31st December, 1890. I can only express to the House my
                very deep regret that that legislation was subsequently interfered with by the
                Parliament of Queensland, after being accepted by the people, indorsed by a general
                election in 1888, and accepted, as it was then believed, as a final solution of the
                difficulty. But, in 1888, a change of Government took place, and an agitation then
                commenced for the re-introduction of kanakas after the time mentioned in the Act of
                1885.  Sir Thomas Mcilwraith, at the close of the
                session 1888-9, appointed a Royal commission to inquire into the whole question, and
                he did me the honour of asking me to accept the position of chairman of that
                commission. In the course of its inquiries the commission visited every plantation
                in Queensland. We examined 140 witnesses, and we were enabled to go minutely and
                carefully into the whole question. Having done so, we brought up our report and our
                recommendations. What we recommended has been partially carried out by Governments
                subsequently, and indorsed by the people. We recommended the establishment of
                central mills. For the information of honorable members, let me explain what that
                means. An enormous area of land was selected in North Queensland for the
                cultivation of sugar. Special protective legislation was passed, offering
                extraordinary inducements to men of enterprise and capital to embark on that
                industry. We passed what were called the Cotton and Sugar Regulations, under which
                some magnificent scrub land on the banks of rivers in North Queensland was parcelled
                out in blocks of 320 and 640 acres at five shillings per acre. Altogether, an area
                of land amounting to, perhaps, 850,000 acres was selected in North Queensland to
                carry out this industry. The depression in 1889 led to the appointment of a Royal
                commission. The functions of that body were to inquire into the causes, and to
                recommend the remedies to be applied. One of the causes we found was the enormous
                amount of land which had been taken for the purpose of carrying on the sugar
                industry, and the very small area cultivated. Enormous mills, costing eighty or a
                hundred thousand pounds, in some instances, had been erected, but there was a
                comparatively small area of cultivated land which had to bear the whole burden of
                maintenance and the interest charged upon the outlay. What we recommended was the
                subdivision of these large areas into smaller areas. That has been carried out to a
                very large extent. The areas have been subdivided into sections of 50, 80, and 100
                acres. White families have settled on these small areas, and have carried out the
                growth and manufacture of sugar without the aid of black labour. Parliament has
                assisted these men in this way: we passed the Sugar Works Guarantee Act, by which
                the small selectors undertook to mortgage their land to the Government as security
                for an advance sufficient to erect a central mill. During the last three or four
                years the State of Queensland has invested ?500,000 in that way. Last session
                we were called upon to vote a further sum of ?150,000, of which amount                ?100,000 was for the erection of two additional mills, and ?50,000 to
                assist those who had already erected mills, but who had not the money to pay for
                their complete equipment, or for the introduction of new machinery into them. The
                Government did that to preserve their own security So that at this moment the
                Queensland Government itself is interested in the sugar industry to the extent of
                ?650,000. But, Sir, private enterprise has
                invested from seven millions to eight millions of money in the sugar industry. In
                addition to that, there are, at this moment, 20,000 of our white population, men                women, and children, whose daily bread is dependent upon it. So that what I am sure
                my honorable friends from Queensland will ask is this: That the House will deal
                with this question, not from sentiment, and not on narrow lines, but on broad lines                bearing in mind the great fact that the industry is the result of State legislation                All the arrangements of the sugar industry, for the introduction of the kanakas,
                have been made under legislation sanctioned by the Crown and indorsed by electors at
                general elections. This question is one of very great importance indeed to the
                future prosperity of Queensland, where the industry has assumed great magnitude. I
                dare say some honorable members may have been surprised by a statement made by the
                member for Wide Bay at a recent interview, that the sugar production of Queensland
                has doubled itself of late years. It is true the industry has doubled itself
                entirely by the establishment of central mills, by the subdivision of large
                properties, and by men going into the industry and carrying it on with the aid of
                white families. That is a fact which I ask the House to take into consideration. We
                shall have a further opportunity of debating this matter at length. But these are
                the main facts, which I now put before honorable members to carry away with them for
                their thoughtful consideration. One of the principal dreads of those who were
                disinclined to enter the Federation - and I frankly admit I was one of them- was
                that the numerical weakness of Queensland in this Chamber would be a danger to the
                State - that the larger voting power of Victoria and New South Wales would be highly
                detrimental to its interests. But when I look around the chamber, I feel assured
                honorable members will approach the various questions in a broad and statesmanlike
                manner, and will consider the interests of Queensland particularly by themselves                and also in conjunction with the many interests of the Commonwealth. So far as a
                " white Australia " is concerned I yield to no member of the House in the
                desire that this idea should be carried out as speedily as possible, consistently
                with the recognition of all interests. At the same time, I cannot shut my eyes or
                ears to the admirable address delivered by Mr. Chamberlain at the conference in London, when a Bill which had been
                passed through the New South Wales Parliament was submitted to him for
                consideration. We are not to forget that the great empire of India is part of the
                British dominions, and that His Majesty the King is now going to set an example
                tending to the consolidation of the Empire by having a body guard of 200 Indian
                troops in the city of London itself. These are incidents which we are bound to
                consider in considering a question of this kind, and I feel sure that when we do
                approach the question, we shall approach it in such a manner as will do honour to
                ourselves and honour to the Commonwealth, and that there will be no necessity for
                His Excellency the Governor-General to reserve the Bill for the Royal assent. With
                regard to old-age pensions, I am one of those who think the subject is now quite
                within the scope of practical politics. New Zealand has adopted a measure of the
                kind with very great success. A similar law is now in operation in Victoria, though
                I regret to say that no less than 16,000 persons in the colony have already applied
                for pensions. New South Wales has also adopted the measure; but Queensland has
                stood out, and I do not think I should be doing the latter State an injustice by
                saying I do not think there is an immediate prospect of an Act of the kind being
                passed there, although I am quite prepared to support such a measure, because it is
                of as great importance to the aged poor of that State as to the aged poor in the
                sister States of the south. I am not altogether sure whether the plan adopted by the
                late Prince Bismarck was not, after all, a sound one, namely, that those who were to
                receive the advantages of old-age pensions should be, in a moderate degree                contributors to them. It may be remembered that his scheme was that all wage-earners
                throughout the whole of the States of Germany should contribute one penny per week
                from his or her wages, the employer to be held responsible for the weekly payments                and that the fund should accumulate until it reached the sum of ?5,000,000,
                which was to form the nucleus, of a fund for the old-age pensions to be distributed                We have not in Australia the population they have in Germany; but I do not see why
                a similar scheme could not be worked out by the Commonwealth. In addition to the
                weekly contribution of the wage-earners themselves, there could be an annual
                contribution from each of the States, and from the Commonwealth, the whole to
                accumulate for a number of years, and form the groundwork of a scheme for the
                payment of old-age pensions. It has been said, and there may be some truth in the
                remark, that the Commonwealth revenue will not of itself, for years to come, admit
                of old-age pensions being paid. That is a debatable point; but that the subject is
                one which ought to receive the greatest consideration I do not for one moment doubt                May I be permitted to say one word more. We talk a great deal about old-age
                pensions, and no doubt it is a right and proper thing to make provision for the aged
                poor who are not able to provide for themselves; but there is another class which                I think, even at this early period of the Commonwealth, ought to be considered                even if we cannot carry out a plan in its entirety. I am sure it is with feelings of
                regret that every honorable member misses the venerable form of the late Sir Henry Parkes; and probably another Chamber will
                express its equal regret at the absence of the late Mr. James Service. 
                But, taking the first-named gentleman, we have one who
                devoted a life-time to the interests of his country, and to the building up of the
                great colony of New South Wales, and who is recognised as the father of the
                Commonwealth. Well, what was his condition in his late days? Could any honorable
                member depict the pain and sorrow of that venerable statesman in his dying moments
                in regard to those whom he was leaving behind                There is an unwritten law in the British Constitution that, if a gentleman has
                occupied the distinguished position of a Minister of the Crown, and has been in
                direct communication with the Sovereign, and declares, after his retirement from
                office, that he is not in a position to maintain his proper dignity without a
                certain amount being voted to him, that amount is cheerfully given. I know that in
                my own State of Queensland, we on two occasions had to vote sums of money to
                distinguished public men, in order that those they left behind them might not be
                left in a state of privation, and I think that at this early stage, when we are
                talking about old-age pensions, so far as the poor are concerned, we ought certainly
                to endeavour to lay the groundwork for some provision, in case it should be needed                for gentlemen who are now Ministers of State, and who may devote years of their life
                to the public service, so that in their old age they may not experience the cares
                and anxiety which poverty brings in its train. I do not think it can be said that
                men who devote themselves to political life generally acquire fortunes; indeed, the
                contrary can be told. The next matter, and a matter which may be regarded as the
                crux of the address, is that relating to the fiscal proposals of the Government. The
                Ministry say- </para>
                            <quote>
                                <para>The fiscal proposals of any Federal Government must be largely dependent on the
            financial exigencies of the States. The adoption of the existing Tariff of any one of
            the States is impracticable, and would be unjust. To secure a reasonably sufficient
            return of surplus revenue to each State, so as fairly to observe the intention of the
            Constitution, while avoiding the unnecessary destruction of sources of employment, is a
            work which prohibits a rigid adherence to fiscal theories. Revenue must, of course, be
            the first consideration; but existing Tariffs have, in all the States, given rise to
            industries many of which are so substantial that my advisers consider that any policy
            tending to destroy them is inadmissible. A Tariff which gives fair consideration to
            these factors must necessarily operate protectively as well as for the production of
            revenue. </para>
                            </quote>
                            <para>I do not think there is anything vague or indefinite about that
            statement. It appears to me to be a clear enunciation of the policy which the Ministry
            are in a measure pledged to by the electors, from whom we have just come. I know, of
            course, that the primary consideration is that we must have a certain amount of money
            for revenue purposes. That sum has been variously estimated. Some have said that the
            Commonwealth cannot do without ?8,000,000, whilst others have contended that
            ?6,000,000 is quite sufficient for all practical purposes. Then there is the "
            Braddon blot," as it is called, and it is satisfactory to note that the author of
            the clause is in the chamber to himself explain why the clause is in the Act. I can only
            assure the honorable member that the Braddon clause is regarded in Queensland as the
            very salvation of the Act, and that I have been authorized and commanded in a measures            by my constituents to offer most strenuous resistance to its repeal. The honorable
            member for Wentworth was good enough to say he thought ?6,000,000 would be
            sufficient for the purposes of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>I do not wish to misquote the honorable member for Wentworth; but I would
                remind him of a statement, of which he will, perhaps, admit the accuracy, that if
                the free-trade party got the ascendancy they would collect ?4,000,000 from
                direct taxation, and ?2,000,000 from indirect taxation and Customs, arranging
                the duties so as not to embarrass trade, and that in order to make up the
                ?8,000,000 he would say to the State Governments, " Collect it amongst
                yourselves." I do not wish to misquote the honorable member, but that is the
                purport of his remarks as reported in the Sydney newspapers. A remark of this kind
                attracted my attention because it appeared to me - and the honorable member
                will excuse my saying so - that the adoption of such a policy would certainly be
                breaking faith with the State of Queensland, and in this way: Queensland
                reluctantly entered the Federation. But it did so upon the express terms of the
                Constitution Act as it now stands, and understanding that we were to have back at
                the very least a million of money from excise and customs. In fact, the question
                resolved itself into this: Southern Queensland, by a majority, decided that it
                would not enter into federation: North Queensland decided by a majority that it
                would. It was mainly through the influence of the present Premier, Mr. Robert Philp, that they did enter the Federation                because he assured the electors that they need not be under the least apprehension
                regarding the Braddon blot, that under its operation they were to receive at least a
                million of money back into the State Treasury, and that, therefore, they need
                not be afraid that it would involve the State of Queensland in any additional
                taxation. I contend that if you repeal the Braddon blot, and adopt a system
                different from that contained in the Commonwealth Constitution, you will
                undoubtedly break faith with the electors, who recorded their votes for that
                measure, and who look to the present Parliament to see that justice is conceded
                to them in that respect. When it is said that you throw back on the States the two
                additional millions required </para>

                            <para>When it is suggested that, in the event of a certain contingency arising, and
                only a certain amount of revenue being raised through the Customs House, the balance
                necessary to keep the States in their present financial position must be contributed
                amongst themselves, then I say that honorable members must take into consideration
                the position of their own State. There may be States with sufficient wealth from
                other sources of revenue to enable them to do without assistance from the
                Commonwealth Government, but as far as the State of Queensland is concerned it
                cannot do without the million of money which the present Premier of Queensland
                promised should be returned to it at the time the election campaign took place. It
                seems, under present conditions, impossible to raise a revenue of ?8,000,000
                without the Tariff being more or less of a protective character. I declare myself                at once, a moderate protectionist. In my early days I was as strong a free-trader as
                the right honorable and learned gentleman, the leader of the Opposition. In my early
                days. I even went to the length of delivering lectures at Mechanics' Institutes
                and Schools of Art on the life and works of Richard Cobden. But my views and my
                opinions have been mellowed by time and experience. </para>

                            <para>I was struck by a remark made by Richard Cobden, in one of his speeches, to
                the effect that after the repeal of the corn laws by Sir
                Robert Peel the whole of Europe would become free-trade in less than ten
                years. Has it become freetrade? Let
                history speak for itself. Further, he stated, when addressing the masses of his
                fellow countrymen, that if they consented to the repeal of the corn laws, so that
                England could send her iron and steel to the United States, they would receive in
                return millions of bushels of wheat to make bread to supply the starving portion of
                their own population. Forty years have elapsed since those words were uttered, and
                what is the condition of affairs to-day? Did it occur to Cobden when he uttered
                those words what would occur in the development of the United States during that 40
                years? A clear-brained, hard-headed Scotchman in that country only recently sold
                his steel and iron works to a syndicate for ?40,000,000 sterling. At the
                commencement of the twentieth century we also find a steel and iron works ring
                formed in the United States with a capital of ?200,000,000. Was such a
                thing ever contemplated even by the most sagacious statesmen 40 years ago in England               When I look round and see what Belgium and Germany have done since those memorable
                words of Cobden were spoken, and when I remember what has been accomplished in the
                United States under her policy, I unhesitatingly come to the conclusion that a
                national protective policy is the right policy for the Australian Commonwealth to
                adopt. I have in my hand a little pamphlet containing the speech of Sir Charles Tilley in introducing to the Dominion
                House of Canada on March 14, 1879 - 21 years ago - the national protective policy of
                the late Sir John McDonald. Here is a Tariff
                conceived in most ingenious ways - I dare say if my honorable friends opposite were
                to read it they would be horror-struck with the scientific ingenuity with which
                Sir Charles Tilley formulated his Tariff. He
                put himself in communication with all the manufacturers of Canada, with all her
                great farmers, and with all her importers and exporters. He got all the information
                he could possibly collect; and, according to the statements contained in this
                pamphlet, he received no less than 30,000 letters from different parts of the
                Canadian dominion. A staff of clerks went through the whole of them, tabulated all
                the information collected, and on that information he framed the Tariff embodied in
                this pamphlet. What is the position of Canada to-day? Will any one say that Canada
                is not prosperous? Even Sir Wilfred Laurier, one of the most brilliant sons
                Canada has ever produced, a man of the greatest eminence and of the greatest
                ability, will not disturb the national policy of Sir
                John McDonald, because it has placed Canada on the pedestal of the
                greatest prosperity that the dominion has ever enjoyed. My contention is, having
                been converted from free-trade to protectionist principles, that in this early
                initiation of our history we should start a broad national policy which will give
                employment to our own population, which will make those who are
                endeavouring to secure advantages from Australia, without contributing
                anything towards its prosperity, contribute something through the medium of the
                Customs House. I feel sure, from honest conviction, and after having given the
                matter careful consideration, that the truest policy we can adopt is that of
                protection. Therefore, I hail with the greatest satisfaction this particular
                paragraph in the speech delivered to us at the opening of Parliament. There are one
                or two other matters which I should like to speak about, but I do not wish to weary
                the House with a long address on this occasion. I am one of those who think that the
                Government should take under its entire control the note currency of the whole of
                the Commonwealth. I have had a privilege which was probably not conferred on many
                honorable members, inasmuch as I saw the great commercial crisis in Queensland in
                1866, and I certainly would not like to see repeated the disasters, sorrows, and
                miseries which followed in its trail. The then Colonial Treasurer proposed to
                issue Treasury notes as a way out of his difficulty, but the Governor of the colony
                at that time, most unconstitutionally in the opinion of most people, whispered to
                the Treasurer that if he introduced a Bill of that nature he would not give his
                assent to it, as currency was undoubtedly within the Royal prerogative. That action
                led to a Ministerial crisis. In 1893, when we had another commercial crisis, but
                less acute than the former one, the Colonial Treasurer, Sir Hugh Nelson, took the entire note currency into his hands, and from
                that time we have issued Treasury bills bearing the signature of the Colonial
                Treasurer. That has proved of immense benefit to the whole of Queensland, and I feel
                sure that if the Commonwealth Government took the question of currency into its own
                hands, and made notes a legal tender throughout the Commonwealth, it would be of
                great advantage to commerce and industry. In Canada - and I may be pardoned for
                again referring to that country, since Canadian sons and Australian sons have fought
                side by side in South Africa, and we can therefore regard the dominion as portion of
                our empire - in Canada the Dominion Government have not only issued ?1 Treasury
                notes, but they have gone so far as to issue a 10s. and 5s. paper currency. There
                it has been found of great advantage, particularly in the north-western
                territories. There is ample precedent, therefore, for the introduction by the
                Commonwealth Government of a Bill providing for such a currency, and I hope it will
                not be long before such a measure is laid before us. With regard to the Public
                Service Bill, I know I am treading on dangerous ground in referring to it. I know
                that a certain appointment has been made which was not altogether acceptable.

                            <para>I do not think that on the initiation of the Commonwealth we should make
                appointments on what I call provincial grounds. I sympathize a great deal with the
                remarks which were made on the election of Speaker by the honorable and learned
                member for Parkes. I do not think appointments under the Commonwealth should be made
                on the American principle of "spoils to the conquerors." I rather think the
                men selected to be Under Secretaries of the great departments of State should be men
                of the highest ability and proved experience in the States. I do not care what State
                they come from, as long as by their experience in the past and their industry they
                have shown their adaptability for the public service. I know, as one of my
                lengthened experience of parliamentary life cannot fail to know, that the
                Under Secretary of a department is the right hand of the Minister controlling that
                department, and is often indeed his "guide, philosopher, and friend" in times of
                difficulty and doubt; and in selecting men of that stamp as Under Secretaries of our
                departments we shall ascend above provincialism, and set a bright example for the
                future of our public service. I think I have occupied the time of the House long
                enough, and I thank honorable members for the kind attention they have given
                me. </para>
                            <para>As I have already said, I feel a deep sense of responsibility on this
            occasion, because I know that the eyes of all Australia, and probably of every portion
            of the British Empire, are fixed upon this Parliament and its legislation. I hope
            that we shall rise to the occasion, and prove ourselves worthy of the Royal visit which
            has just been paid to us to celebrate the introduction of our work, and that we shall
            satisfy our countrymen in Great Britain that we are worthily following in their
            footsteps. I feel assured, however, from what I know of my fellow members, that every
            matter coming before us will receive the gravest consideration and the most matured
            deliberation, and I fervently hope that upon all occasions our deliberations and
            discussions will be of such a character that people may point to us with pride, and say
            that we are worthy of the great charter which Great Britain has conferred upon us.

                        <para>- I feel that it is a very great honour for me, the youngest member of the House              to be asked to second the motion for the adoption of the Address in Reply which has
              been moved by the honorable member for Darling Downs. I hope that my youth will not
              prove a sign of immaturity, and that any shortcomings of which I may be guilty will be
              more than lost sight of by reason of the excellent address which has been delivered
              with such dignity and gravity of manner by that honorable member. It will always be a
              pleasure to us to listen to any advice that he, as the father of the House, may think
              it wise to give us by reason of his long years of parliamentary life, and the great
              business experience which he has gathered. As a staunch believer in radical
              principles, I think that my first explanation to the House should be as to why I sit
              on the Ministerial side of the chamber; and, no doubt, every honorable member who
              speaks in this debate will give his reason for sitting on one side or the other. As
              members of a new House, we have not the advantages possessed by members of a State
              Parliament, who are able to know what are the politics and principles of the members of
              a new Government which they propose to support. In State politics we know a great deal
              of the principles of aspirants to parliamentary honours but, coming here, we meet new
              faces and new men, and find it very difficult to know,for instance, why certain members
              of the labour party should sit on that side of the House, while other gentlemen, whom
              we know to be thoroughly radical and liberal in their views, should sit among the
              reactionaries on the Opposition side of the chamber. Like a very large number of other
              people in Victoria, I am not very well acquainted with the Prime Minister. At the time
              of the elections a large number of the voters of this State knew him only by name, but
              they had this justification for supporting him, that when an election conducted upon
              absolutely democratic methods, on the basis of one man one vote, was held for the
              choosing of representatives to the late Federal Convention, the righthonorable
              gentleman was chosen in New South Wales by the largest majority given to any man in any
              State in Australia. In addition to that,we find that when the convention, which was
              composed of ten of the best men in each. State of Australia, met at Adelaide; it was
              considered advisable, 'and' even necessary, to appoint the right honorable
              gentleman to be the leader of the; Convention, and thus to constitute him . the
              Premier of what was really the preliminary Parliament of Australia. I thinkthatthose
              are sufficient reasons why I should support the right honorable gentlemen, now that he
              has been chosen by His Excellency the Governor-General to form a Commonwealth Ministry              But there are further reasons why I should support him. </para>

                            <para>-This Ministry is not a Ministry of all the talents, but it is practically a
                Ministry of all the Premiers, and if democracy means anything it means that the man
                who becomes the leader of the government of a State for the time being represents
                the absolute sense of that community. Therefore, the fact that the Commonwealth
                Ministry includes almost every premier who was was in Office, at the time of its
                formation is an additional reason why the democratic party in Australia should
                support it. </para>

                            <para>-May I say further that what really influenced the people of Victoriaand
                particularly the people of the electorate by which I have been returned to support
                the Ministry was the democratic programme by which it stands to win or lose. The
                Barton Government has in words , which I think are not equivocal, expressed its views
                on the public platform, and in the speech in regard to which I am addressing myself
                to the House. His Excellency's speech carries out, line for line, the programme
                put before the country, and to that extent it is an honest speech. It follows the
                views which were more largely and clearly expressed by the members of the Government
                in the various speeches which they made prior to the general elections, and I take
                it that it embodies what is in every way a democratic programme, a programme
                including all the present phases of liberal thought. I cannot imagine a man in
                Australia who is not a protectionist calling himself a liberal. </para>

                            <para>- It is the working men of the community who are chiefly interested in the
                question of work and wages. Believing that the employment of Australians in
                Australian industries will give work and wages to the working men of the country                and that it is better to employ our own people in the production of what we want
                than to send our orders to Germany, Japan, and England, I cannot imagine how any
                persons who call themselves liberals, who look at things from a radical stand-point,
                and who want to serve the interests of the Australian working man, can sit on the
                opposition side of this chamber among the conservatives. . I did not, however                intend to refer to the fiscal question on this occasion, because I have no doubt
                that in the future we shall have many opportunities for' dealing with it, and
                shall hear some very spirited speeches upon it. I make these remarks by way of an
                aside, in reply to the interjections which greeted my original statement. What I
                strongly approve of in the Address in Reply is the reference which has been made to
                the fact that the Government intend to bring in, at the earliest moment possible, a
                uniform franchise and a uniform electoral law. It is too late, at this stage of the
                history of Australia, with the record of the legislation of some very democratic
                states behind us, for it to be necessary to argue in favour of the principle of one
                adult one vote. That principle used to be considered perfect in theory, andonewhich
                could not be argued against ; but the States of Western Australia and South
                Australia and the colony of New Zealand have lifted it from the regions of theory
                into the regions of practice, and now allow their women to vote at all elections, I
                am very glad that that is so, and I feel that it would be impossible for the
                Government to do otherwise than propose the granting of adult suffrage to the whole
                of Australia. One of the sections of the Constitution provides that the franchise
                privileges of the States are not to be taken from them ; and, as two of the States
                have womanhood suffrage, it will be impossible to enact a uniform franchise except
                on the base of adult suffrage. I am also glad that the introduction of legislation
                for the enactment of a uniform franchise must mean - because of the section of the
                Constitution to which I have just referred - the adoption of the most advanced
                methods of voting existing in any of the States. That will mean that we shall have
                in all the States the system of registration which is now in force in New South
                Wales, and will abolish the system of preparing ratepayers' rolls which now
                exists in Victoria. To those who have had no experience of the working of the
                Victorian system, I should like to say that it is the bulwark of conservatism. Men
                who care nothing for politics are, merely because they own land and have their names
                on the ratepayers' rolls, dragged up to the polling-booths at the last moment                and induced to vote for one candidate or another, whether they know him or not. The
                ignorant vote is largely a conservative vote, and largely the vote which is obtained
                by reason of the existence of the ratepayers' rolls. The persons who vote under
                that system are people who do not take sufficient interest in politics to have their
                names placed upon the electoral rolls, but I trust that when next we have a
                parliamentary election, the ratepayers' roll will be no longer in existence, and
                that we shall have a system under which every man will be required to register
                himself, and to take out an elector's right in the manner required by the law
                now existing in the other states of the Commonwealth. The principle of one man one
                vote is not in force in one of the States of the Commonwealth at the present times                Here in Victoria we have a system under which, although an elector can vote only
                once, he can vote in any constituency, and as a consequence, a kind of pairing was
                indulged in in some of the electorates of </para>

            "A" and," but would vote against " C," who was a candidate for

            constituency he likes, he will vote where he feels that the interests of his party compel

            liberals here. I want now to refer to a matter which is of very great importance to me andtoa
            large number of my constituents the question of the defences. One of the main reasons why
            the colonies federated was to secure an efficient scheme of defence. The fiscal
            question, and the bringing about of InterState free-trade, also formed a very important
            part of the federal compact ; but the main reason that induced the motherland to support
            our federal movement so strongly as she has from time to time, and particulary in her
            last splendid grant of a Federal Constitution, which was passed through both Housesof
            the Imperial Parliament almost without amendment, was to secure that the defences of
            Australia should be placed upon a proper basis. In this matter I want the Federal
            Parliament to follow democratic lines. I see that notice has been given tonight by
            the Right Honorable the Minister for Defence of his intention to bring in a Bill to arrange
            for the defences of the Commonwealth. I think the first plank he should lay down in that
            Bill is this- that we should pay a fair day's wage: for affair day's work. I do
            not want to see adopted systems which have been current from feudal times in England            where by gradual stages only they have raised the pay of the English soldier from 6d.
            to1s. 2d. per day. I think the soldier who does his work is just as well entitled as is a
            policeman to a fair day's pay. When it is pointed out to honorable members that at
            the present time there are men in the permanent forces of Australia who are being paid
            only 2s. 3d. per day, and who are keeping a wife and family on 15s. 9d. per week, I-
            think it will be seen that the plank of the labour platform, which says that there shall
            be a fair day's wage for a fair day's work, must be insisted upon, not only for
            the public service, but also for the defence forces of Australia. I trust that those who
            believe in that principle will help me to place my opinions before the House, and to see
            that this part, at any rate, of the radical programme is carried out. I also hope to see
            effect given in Australia to what is now conceded in every democratic country in the
            world the right of men to rise from the ranks. At the present time commissions are not
            granted except to a specially favoured few. There has been an unfortunate position in
            regard to this matter in the State of Victoria, and in other parts of Australia where
            there is a permanent military force. The man who goes into the ranks as a private
            soldier may eat his heart out before there is the slightest chance of - his rising. Men
            stay in the ranks for years and acquire a great amount of knowledge on military matters            but they find it is quite impossible for them, at any time, to raise themselves from the
            condition under which they joined, simply because they joined as gunners. We want to put
            an end to this condition of things that has existed in Victoria as well as in the other
            States of Australia. We want every man who has military ability, and who wishes to rise            to be able to do so. We should adopt a system such as has made it possible for that
            magnificent general, Hector MacDonald, to rise from the ranks in India and fight our
            battles in South Africa. There are in the English army an umber of officers who have
            risen from the ranks, and we want the conditions of advancement in the defence forces
            'of- Australia to be, not social status conferred by birth or the possession of
            money,, but military ability. If that principle, be carried out we ' shall have
            better soldiers as officers and better soldiers as men.-. If there is one thing more
            than another . I; .am- surprised at in connexion with the Governor-General's speech
            it is an omission- which' I thought would never have been .made; .'I should have
            thought that . .some reference would be made to;.! the- .fact that we have in South
            Africa! ii a large number of </para>
                    <para class="block">Australian ' soldiers who are .still fighting there. No reference
            whatever is made to that fact in his Excellency's speech, and some allusion should
            have been made to it. We have in South Africa, not only men who have been sent out by
            their own States and who are paid by their States, but also men who, although they are
            in the Imperial pay,, are really Australians. I trust that the Commonwealth, which takes
            over these soldiers, will see that they get fair treatment from the Imperial Government            and fair treatment also from the States Governments which have pledged themselves to it            I trust that in the future all obligations entered into will be strictly kept by the
            Commonwealth Government. One paragraph in the Address in Reply relates to the commission
            that was sent out by His Majesty the King to enable His Royal Highness the Duke of
            Cornwall and York graciously to deliver to us a memorable speech. I think that some
            reference ought to be made to that commission. I wish to point out to the House, and
            also to bring under the notice of the Government themselves, that that commission was
            signed by King Edward VII., under the title of King and Emperor. I think that the matter
            of privilege arises with regard to this House which arose in the British House of
            Commons when the Royal Titles Bill was before the Legislature. The House of Commons had
            a very long discussion on that Bill, and it was distinctly promised then that the use of
            the title of emperor should be strictly limited to India. As far as his Majesty the King
            is concerned "I am as loyal a British subject as there is. I do not wish to be
            misunderstood in this matter. I am a good subject of the King. I swore to bear true and
            faithful allegiance to His Majesty. I know a constitutional King, but I know no emperor            I take it that it is a matter of importance to me, and one affecting the liberty of the
            citizens of this land, that King Edward VII. should assume in this commission, and that
            the Governor-General should have been asked to accept in it the title of King and
            Emperor. Of course, I know there are some people who do not see that there is anything
            in this point. They will regard it perhaps as a mere inadvertence. I do not regard it as
            a mere inadvertence, because that communication, you may be sure, passed the strong
            scrutiny of the Colonial Office before it caine out to Australia. It is necessary at the
            beginning of things here to take up this stand-point. This is the first commission ever
            issued in connexion with this Federal Parliament, and I believe it is the first time
            that a commission has been issued in connexion with Australia in which the word emperor
            has been used, and in which the King of England, or the late Queen, assumed also in
            addition the title of Emperor, or Empress. The records of the English House of Commons
            will show that when the Royal Titles Bill was passed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              John</inline> Bright and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lowe,</inline> who was
            afterwards Lord Sherbrooke, strongly protested against the use of this word emperor in
            regard to India. It was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bright</inline>
            that in the course of time the title of emperor would be used not only with regard to
            India, but would also be extended to Canada and Australia, and other parts of the
            empire, until it came home to England. It was only after repeated assurances, to which I
            can refer honorable members if desired given by the Government of the day, that that
            word should never be used in any commission outside of India, and should be used in
            regard to India and India only, that the word emperor was allowed to remain in the Bill            Some honorable members may say that this is a matter of no importance. I wish it were
            not. But I find that publicists in all directions are doing their very best to
            strengthen against democracy the powers of the Crown ; and, also, that as the House of
            Commons has made encroachments upon the powers of the House of Lords, and as every
            popular Assembly has made encroachments on the second Chamber, every public leader who
            views democracy with a certain amount of fear, has desired that the position of the
            Crown should be strengthened purely in order that a proper defence may be made against
            the attacks of democracy. Democracy has its aberrations, but it always goes light in the
            end. Therefore, I do not believe there is any need to strengthen the royal power or the
            royal titles. No king should call himself emperor to us without a protest on our part            There was an English king who said to his son - " George, be a king." We should
            not have a King of England saying to his son - "Be an emperor." The word
            emperor, if permitted to be used without protest in this connexion, would soon become a
            colloquialism. I regret this use of it on the present occasion. If we do not fight the
            matter out at once our children will have to fight it out in the future as a matter of
            liberty. India is a' despotism. Empire has its rewards and advantages, and it also
            has its punishments and difficulties. And if we take a despotism to our hearts we must
            bear the punishments that that despotism brings to us. I hope that Ministers will take a
            note of the ' matter, and will see that on no future occasion they allow without
            protest an address by any King of England to be presented to the Parliament of the
            Commonwealth under the the title of King and Emperor. There is only one thing more I
            wish to say in regard to the external affairs of the Commonwealth. I feel that in this
            matter the Minister of External Affairs took a right course when he made the statement
            the other day that he is going to conserve Australian rights, and that he will have
            proper regard to the rights of the British people. I feel that, as a part of the great
            empire, we must regard the rights of the other parts of the empire, and although I may
            regret that there has been a certain loss of territory near our shores, I realize that
            that is the price that we pay for the protection of the empire and its flag. But I think
            we might even now', establish a Monroe doctrine for the Pacific. Through the
            pronouncement of that doctrine by President Monroe the people of the United States have
            been led to get what, they want without war. The mere fact that the principle of
            "hands off" has been established has meant, that time after time it has been
            realized that the American people are going to be masters of their own house. We are for
            the first time rising to the heights, of nationhood. We meet here as the repre-'
            tentative House of the Australian nation. I should like the Ministry to at onceestablish
            the principle of "hands off" in regard to all the islands of the Pacific within
            a thousand miles of the Australian- coast; that they should be declared to bell            Australian territory, within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth ; that is, having due            regard, of course, to present rights. We' should lay it down that we will allow no
            other entrenchments upon those islands of the Pacific, which are, I think, proper
            appendages to this Commonwealth. I would, also draw attention to the statement made at
            the banquet given by the Mayor of Mel- . bourne last' week, when the Prime Minister            said, that if we want to know about Fiji we .- should "ask Seddon." Am I to
            understand; that Fiji is to be handed over to Mr. Seddon ? </para>

                            <para>- I was there, and I did not understand it was said in a jocular spirit. But I am
                very glad it was so, because, however friendly we are to New Zealand, we cannot                permit the creation of a second commonwealth in the Pacific. If we are the
                Commonwealth we must see that the power already given us by the Imperial Parliament
                to administer the islands remains to us. Already honorable members have seen the
                difficulty created in Canada by the fact of Newfoundland not joining in the
                Federation there ; and since a jocular spirit is not always evident in cold print, I
                am glad of the assurance that Fiji is not, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned                to be handed to New Zealand. In conclusion, I would say we have to consider very
                carefully our position in regard to the Australian squadron. We are paying at the
                present moment a very large amount annually for the maintenance of a squadron over
                which we have absolutely no control. We have also during the past year spent large
                amounts of money in South Africa purely to support the Imperial Government ; and
                while I admit, of course, that the defence of Melbourne begins at Cape Town, and
                that the expenditure was thus also for our own defence, we must take up the position
                now that these grants of public money cannot go on without some distinct knowledge
                of where they are going to lead us. We are really surrendering a great principles                which is that there shall be no taxation without representation. So far as the
                Australian squadron is concerned, we have been taxing ourselves, voluntarily I
                admit, for years past to maintain a fleet over which we have no control. We have
                been taxing ourselves for participation in a war in South Africa over which we have
                no control, and with the bringing about of which we had nothing to do ; and if we
                are to continue to tax ourselves in this way, we must take up the position that we
                must have a voice in the policy which brings about the taxation. Of course it will
                be seen what that means. It means that we will really have to bring about some form
                of Imperial Federation, and I hope this House is large-hearted enough and
                brave-hearted enough to tackle the question. Do not let us be afraid to be great. We
                do not want to be little. </para>

              observe how the arrangement worked, with a view afterwards, if necessary, of putting
              some distance of time between the rising of the two Houses. If the honorable member

                    <para>Mr.REID (East Sydney- New South Wales). - I listened attentively to the addresses
            which have been delivered by the oldest and the youngest members of this Chamber, and Must            congratulate the Government upon having in those two gentlemen representatives of the
            people who we may hope from their beginnings in this House will prove thoroughly
            faithful and vigilant in their criticism of all the measures which the Government may
            have to submit. My little experience as the head of a Government suggests to me that if
            addresses go into detail so much as those two addresses did the Government have rather a
            dismal prospect in front of them. But at the same time Ave must all recognise the
            excellent spirit which prevailed throughout both addresses. There was a healthy ring of
            independence in both speeches, and personally I was gratified at the vigour and
            straightforwardness which was shown <inline font-style="italic">hy</inline> the youngest            member of the House* <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crouch,</inline> with reference to

            addressing the Parliament here, that it will be my duty to use words which may sound

            the long struggles which have prevailed throughout this continent in the direction of
            federal union have found at last their highest expression in the mere . fact that we are
            assembled here as a Federal Parliament. In days gone by we used to indulge in sentiment
            as to an Australian brotherhood * but now we can rejoice in the fact that this
            Australian brotherhood has become a perpetual and a . glorious accomplishment, and that
            all the scattered energies of Australia have at last been crystallized into a living
            national Organism which will give the fullest play to our own power and to the genius of
            the Australian race. I am glad to congratulate my- honorable friends opposite, many of
            whom were amongst the most distinguished advocates of federal union, upon the success of
            their labours, and I think I may fairly say that those who have laboured for this union
            are not confined to one side of this Chamber. I do not at all say that I was ever able

                that existed have happily disappeared ? If that has been the basis of the fears of
                my honorable friends, Ave do not grudge them the double .pleasure of succeeding to
                office and saving the Constitution at the same time. And, although I do not Wish to
                say much with reference to the formation of the Ministry, because there they are
                before us constitutionally to stand their ground and answer for all that they have
                done, or have not done, and to take credit for all that they may never do, I must
                make one or two observations with reference to that important part of the evolution                of this federation. My honorable friend, the youngest member of the House has
                explained to us the basis upon which this Ministry was formed. It was formed, he
                says, out of the Premiers of the colonies. Now at last I understand the presence of
                my distinguished friend the honorable member for Hume in the Ministry. It was
                because he was a Premier. That is the only explanation possible of the suddenly
                affectionate relations of my two friends the Prime Minister and the honorable member
                for Hume. If there were any dangers to the Constitution during all these long
                struggles I should have expected to have found them concealed somewhere about the
                person of the Minister for Home Affairs', because he fought against the
                Constitution right through - and though I do not wish to obtuse local politics into
                this august Assembly, and I hope we will all try to avoid that and many other things
                which exist in local Assemblies - still I may be allowed to say that those who are
                familiar with the history of New South Wales when the Prime Minister and the
                honorable gentleman combined and were opposed to me in the Assembly, must have felt
                greatly astonished at the sudden affection which sprang up between those two
                honorable gentlemen. But there they are. We do not know Sow they get on, that is a
                secret known only to themselves. There they are, and I do not wish to make any
                further allusion to the subject except to say that when the history of this
                mysterious affection comes to be written I have no doubt it will be amusing if not
                edifying to the public. But there is another matter, I think, of a more serious
                character. We deliberately implanted in this Constitution a provision that there
                should be seven Ministers of State - no more and no less. </para>

                            <para>- Is the Constitution to be respected or not? Was it intended that, side by side
                with that written expression of the Constitution, there might be seven other
                mysterious individuals in the Federal Cabinet who were not Ministers of State -
                because no person can be a Minister of State within the meaning of the Constitution
                unless he is in charge of a department. It is quite true there is power given to the
                Governor-General to call any number of persons to the Federal Executive Council, but
                I think we would not be prepared to learn that that power was to be used so as to
                intrude on the central principles of this Constitution the provision that the men
                who sit round the Cabinet table, and who in their necessarily secret deliberations
                govern this Commonwealth, should consist of two classes - Ministers of State and
                gentlemen whom they may choose to pick up on the road. I beg to say that I consider
                the conduct of the Government in the formation of the Ministry is open to serious
                objection. If anything could accentuate my objection it is the open and unblushing
                arrangement that was made which secured the admission of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis</inline> of Tasmania into the Cabinet. There was no thought of having a
                representative of Tasmania in the Cabinet when the Ministry was formed. That State
                was, I think, wrongly omitted from representation. </para>

                    <para class="block">If there was an. obvious principle which should have been observed in
            the formation of the first Federal Government it was that each State, however small            should have one representative at the Cabinet table. How could others presume to advise
            the Cabinet with a reference to a State of which they were wholly ignorant ? It was
            practically ostracising one of the Australian States. What honorable member here other
            than a Tasmanian is competent to advise the Cabinet as a representative of Tasmania ?
            When Tasmania, however, showed its righteous indignation, there occurred this immediate
            shuffle of the Ministerial cards,' which has no pretence to serious business            because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis</inline> announced that, although he
            entered the Federal Cabinet, he was a mere makeshift until some one else took his place            And when the gentleman from England arrived <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              Lewis</inline> disappeared. It was known when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              Lewis</inline> took his seat at that Cabinet table that he would disappear from the
            scene before the Federal Parliament met. These are things which are worthy of
            observation in the beginning of our history. It was a wholly' unjustifiable things            The State of Tasmania should have been represented at first. But the Ministry, having
            decided otherwise, should not have strained the Constitution in order to placate
            Tasmania, and certainly should not have taken in a temporary Minister, who never
            intended to face this Parliament. But <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline>
            Fysh having arrived, and the elections having gone strongly in favour of free-trade - by
            that I mean in favour of a genuine revenue Tariff - the Government which had not time to
            telephone to a genuine free-trade Premier of Australia, when the Cabinet was formed -
            and this rather jars on the theory that all Premiers were to have been in the Ministry -
            this Government, because some telephone went wrong, kept out one of the ablest and
            wisest public men in Australia. But he had the misfortune to be a freetrader, and the
            Government in those days had a higher temperature upon the fiscal question than they
            have now. After the elections, however, they had to get some sort of a free-trader into
            the Cabinet without delay, and they hooked the first fish they could - our worthy
            friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> Fysh. I do not wish to say one
            unkind word about that honorable gentleman, because I have no doubt that he has an
            understanding with the Cabinet, and has entered it to see that a genuine revenue Tariff
            is brought about. Under the circumstances, I look upon him as a sentinel in the citadel
            of the enemy, to see that they carry out the policy of the Opposition. Coming away from
            that matter, I wish to refer to what happened at the general elections. In a personal
            sense, it is a matter of absolute indifference where any member chooses to sit in either
            House of the Federal Parliament - that is absolutely a matter for his own discretion. I
            have no word of criticism, and I would consider it impertinent to offer any, as to the
            conduct of an honorable member in choosing his seat precisely where he likes ; that is a
            matter for himself. What the public have to do with is, not where he sits, but how he
            votes, and what his convictions are. Judging by an imaginative production which is
            published regularly in Victoria at a very reasonable price, and which has as its
            proprietor a gentleman who is, we know, the virtual dictator of "Victoria, who has
            all these Victorian politic ans in the hollow of his hand-- </para>

                    <para>Mr.REID.- I beg to take the liberty of telling the honorable member what I think. He
            will hear a little that is quite novel now. It is as much as a Minister in Victoria dare
            do to show the slightest act of civility to me in the open light of day ; it has got so
            far as that. A virtual dictatorship exists in this State which no prominent political            has had the pluck to face. But one man, not a politic an, not a great man in the
            community, the honorable member for Southern Melbourne, had the courage to face this
            dictator. He is sitting opposite me, is still alive, and seems to be tolerably well, and
            his act may infuse a certain amount of courage into Other Victorians. We hope that it
            may. I think I am stating what is admitted' in Victoria by every one, except the
            victims of this powerful influence, when I say that there is one newspaper which rules
            Victoria. That is the state of things with which we have to reckon. As I have said, I
            have nothing to do with the positions which honorable members choose to take in either
            House of the Legislature, but I have something to do with their convictions upon great
            public questions, and I have taken the trouble to go carefully through the results of
            the general election to see how the two great parties stand in reference to the chief
            subject of difference between us, the difference between the men who believe in a Tariff
            only as a means of raising revenue for the necessities of the State and the men who
            believe in a Tariff for other purposes. I have gone carefully over these lists, and            whilst they account for the phraseology of the Governor-General's speech with
            reference to the fiscal question, they can scarcely be satisfactory to our Mends on the
            Ministerial side of the House. I am going to be so perfectly open and straightforward in
            my statement of this matter that I shall enable every honorable member whose name I
            shall use to correct me if I am wrong. I do not propose to generalize ; I shall take
            each individual member who has been returned to the Commonwealth Parliament. I shall not
            read out the names of protectionists, because I intend to deal only with the revenue
            tariffists ; I shall leave the protectionists to look after themselves. I" shall
            begin with the representatives of the State of Queensland. I admit frankly, as we all
            must, that the fiscal question was not the burning question in Queensland, so that I
            must be understood in reference to the Queensland members not as saying that they were
            returned as revenue tariffists, because it would not be fair to say that, but as
            pointing them out as men who believe in a genuine revenue tariff, and who do not believe
            in protection. In the Senate we have three representatives of Queensland who believe in
            a revenue tariff, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson, Senator Ferguson,</inline>
            and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> In the House of Representatives
            - and these gentlemen being present, may correct me if I am wrong - we have, not as
            those who were returned on the fiscal question, but as those who, as a matter of
            individual conviction, which I do not suppose they kept secret from their constituents            are revenue tariffists, the honorable member for Herbert- </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to have that correction. May I suggest to the right honorable member
                that he will have to say protectionists and revenue tariffists in reference to his
                somewhat motley following. The representation of South Australia consists, as I have
                shown, of seven revenue tariffists and six protectionists; a total of thirteen. I
                come now to Western Australia. If ever a country was under the domination of one
                fascinating personality it was the State of Western Australia. My honorable friend                the honorable member for Corio, spoke of his aversion to any one in the position of
                an emperor. Just let him think, then, of the lot of the people of Western Australia
                during the past ten years. However, the emperor of the west has become an ordinary
                Cabinet Minister. But he still thinks that the charm of his personality may work
                wonders with the representatives of Western Australia when he insinuates that these
                honorable gentlemen, having been elected on great, principles, will prefer the right
                honorable Minister for Defence. They have taken means to dissipate that illusion of
                my right honorable and distinguished friend. We -find, with reference to Western
                Australia, this magnificent result : Of one . member returned by that State, I am
                doubtful,, and I am prepared to place him among the protectionists because he is not
                in this Chamber, and cannot correct me; but, as I have the figures, there are nine
                revenue tariffists from Western Australia and one protectionist- that is, if my
                right honorable friend ever was, or is, or will be a protectionist. I am putting him
                down as one, although he may be another free-trade sentinel in- the enemy's
                citadel. I believe that he had strong leanings towards a free-trade policy until he
                became a follower of my right honorable friend the Prime Minister. However, -there
                he is, and we will call him a protectionist. So that Western Australia is
                represented by nine revenue tariffists, and my right honorable friend 'is -the
                one protectionist member for that State, unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
                  De</inline> Largie be one too ; but of him I am doubtful. This magnificent result
                has been brought about by the sons of the -miners of Victoria, whose fathers
                sacrificed every consideration of self-interest, and all the rightful principles of
                taxation, in order, as they thought, to found artisans' homes for themselves and
                for their children in their own State. Now we find the children of these men, who
                were driven out of this State to the furthest ends of Australia, sending back here
                the most magnificent verdict in favour of freedom of commerce that any country in
                this world has ever been known to pronounce. I come now to Tasmania, and again I say
                that I am speaking only of the fiscal convictions of those whom I name ; but I
                believe that in the cases I am dealing with honorable members have ' all
                announced their convictions straightforwardly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
                  Dobson</inline> is a free-trader, and so is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> McFarlane. :' </para>

                            <para>- Revenue tariffists is the term I wish to use, because it is the term.'
                which has been used throughout, and it is the term which properly distinguishes this
                party. The gentlemen I have named are revenue tariffists, and so are Senators
                Clemons and O'Keefe. I have some doubt with reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> but 'L had his personal
                statement to that effect today. Then,- of the Tasmanian <inline font-style="italic">rel</inline> presenta-tion in the Lower House, four out of five are revenue
                tariffists. - They are the right? honorable member <inline font-weight="bold">Sir
                  Edward</inline> Braddon, the honorable member <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                  Cameron</inline> - in the Senate there is a Colonel Cameron, who is a
                protectionist - the honorable member <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse,</inline>
                and the Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> Fysh, who made some
                of the most admirable freetrade speeches ever heard in the Parliament of Tasmania                However, as I have said, I have no doubt that he has come to some sensible
                understanding with the present administration. There is Tasmania with eight revenue
                tariffists and three protectionists : that is, two senators and one representative                There is a total for the four colonies - allowing for the- honorable member for
                Herbert - of 31 revenue tariffists against 17 protectionists. Then there- are two                doubtfuls, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edwards</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. De</inline> Largie. I separate those two from the numbers                . Now, I come to the two colonies which we may say lead this- great fiscal fight -
                Victoria, on behalf of. its own long-established policy, which, unfortunately, seems
                to restrict considerably the number of people who live under it, and New South
                Wales. There is no doubt about the verdict of Victoria. There were four revenue
                tar if lists returned to this House from that State. Three of them, no doubt
                foireasons that are perfectly satisfactory to them, and which I have no right to
                inquire, into, as I said before, sit opposite.- But I may be allowed to rejoice over
                the one Victorian who has had the magnificent courage to sit with a revenue tariff
                opposition. </para>

                tilings with reference to <inline font-style="italic">him.</inline> 1 am simply
                putting him down amongst the revenue tariffists because I- believe that, as between
                the two parties, he wishes to be on that side, and that it represents his individual
                convictions. So that is the only observation I have to make as to New South Wales                that it has returned 21. re venue tariffists and 11 protectionists. Now, that gives
                us a grand total for the whole Federal Parliament of 57 to 52, with the two
                doubtful members to whom' I have , referred. That makes 111, the total of both
                Houses. So I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> whether the
                Government have not shown a proper sense of the force- of the voice of Australia in
                hauling down the protectionist flag, as they have done in this speech, and putting
                in a plea for charity, to save the lives of some industries which might otherwise
                expire? That is their charitable plea. There is in that none of the light chivalrous
                buoyancy of my distinguished friend the Attorney-General, who has been found in the
                great fights of the past, when the numbers were different,' I admit; holding the
                protectionist flag aloft, in full belief in the principle of protection, not as
                calling for the exercise of our charitable instincts, but as laying- at the root of
                all sound industrial progress, putting bread into the mouths of the poor, and
                showering comfort and prosperity upon the homes of the people. I believe he thinks
                that still, but the voice of Australia has been too strong for him. We find this
                state of results. Let us apply it : Here is New South Wales, .which has returned a
                magnificent and decisive verdict in favour of a revenue Tariff- - represented by
                whom ? Misrepresented by three Federal Cabinet Ministers - the Prime Minister,
                  <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline> Those three gentlemen sit in
                that Federal Cabinet by right as Federal Ministers. I admit that if all New South
                Wales were against them, they still have the right to sit in the Cabinet. I do not
                wish to become so provincial as to say that because a man's own colony is
                against him on a- certain point, therefore he has 110 right to' sit on those
                benches opposite. I make no such miserable claim as that. I merely point out the
                results as they are as affecting the politics of this Parliament. I point out that
                three of the most influential members of this Cabinet sit there, not 'by
                -the"- sanction and by the voice of the -colony which knows them, but of the
                colonies which do not. My honorable friend who seconded the motion for the adoption
                of the Address in Reply, was good enough to refer to one of the rightful claims of
                the Prime Minister to distinction, one of which he may well be proud, and of which
                his descendants may be proud - that on the memorable occasion when the people of New
                South Wales chose delegates to the Convention the right honorable gentleman was
                triumphantly elected at the head of the poll. That statement has been made often                and it is, as1 I say, a matter of distinction to my right honorable friend. But it
                is only fair to remember, I think, that the man who was next to my right honorable
                friend on the poll was a man who had trodden on all the political corns in New South
                Wales - by a land tax that no man in Victoria has had the pluck to propose, by an
                income tax which was very <inline font-style="italic">new to</inline> New South
                Wales at the time, by a thorough cleansing of the public service, and by the
                destruction of a number of monopolistic interests. Tens of thousands of my
                supporters, as my friends from New South Wales know well, voted - as they ought to
                do - for one of the most eminently fitted men in the world for such a position                whereas' tens of thousands of my right honorable friend's supporters forgot
                to vote for me. ' ;The feeling generated by an intense political struggle was in
                full force and fury, and it was too strong for my right honor- ' able
                friend's supporters to vote for me. My honorable friend the Ministerial Whip has
                said more than once that he regarded my position on the poll as the greatest                -wonder of the contest. He was always a generous opponent, and always will be one                -My friend, although opposed to me - honor- . -ably always - has made it no secret
                that the : fact that I was next on the poll was under : the circumstances a far
                greater achievement than that of the man who had no enemies. But now that the
                -people , of New South Wales have had to settle down to serious politics, if there
                should be a per- 'sonal question in such a contest, which I utterly repudiate-
                but if .there should . be a ; personal conflict of that sort, I have the
                satisfaction of knowing that in the country where my right honorable friend has
                lived all his life, and I the greater part of mine, the verdict of New South Wales
                was not only against my right honorable friend, but against him clothed in all the
                legitimate <inline font-style="italic">glory</inline> of his high office. So that
                when the youngest member of the House refers to New South Wales, I point out that
                where we have come down to more solid tests, when the people have had the men before
                them in contrast and conflict, whatever may be the majority in this House or the
                other House on this or that question, I and my friends behind me have, at least                this great solace - that we have the voice and the calm judgment of the' vast
                majority of the people of the mother State of Australia. I want now, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> if I may, to separate the numbers 'I
                have given'. I wish to show how these numbers apply to both Houses. Take the
                Senate. There are 21 revenue tariffists in 'the Senate of Australia. There are
                fourteen protectionists and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. De</inline> Largie, whom
                I put down as doubtful. ' That was under the Constitution the broadest test you
                could have. The whole political voice of the country was expressed upon one
                ballot-paper. As to that test, I do not wish to give too great a significance to any
                particular school of politics ; I do not wish to underrate the power of this House                and hope I shall never be one to do so. But I am dealing with the results of the
                election1. Honorable members will see, therefore, that I am justified in inquiring-
                what they are. Here is a fact which stands for the instruction of my honorable
                friends in Victoria, including my honorable friend who seconded the Address in Reply
                - that in the Senate, based upon the widest suffrage in Australia, we have 21
                revenue tariffists, fourteen protectionists, and one gentleman who is doubtful. In
                the House of Representatives there are 36 revenue tariffists, 38 protectionists, and
                one gentleman doubtful,- which 1 think makes up the 75. I candidly admit that it
                might, perhaps, have been, well in the public interests if this great reference to
                the people- had brought about a more thoroughly, decided result than these figures                -if correct, show 'the result to-be'; but- if my protectionist- friends call
                that a victory, it is a sort of victory -which needs only to-be repeated -to be
                -fatal. - And -we- have this great consolation, that when we asked the judgment of
                Australia we did not beseech the electors to think of everything but the great issue
                they had to decide. I can speak for my own State, and probably it is true of the
                other States - though in Queensland I admit the matter was not put in the way in
                which it was in the other States, and was not an issue of a serious character - but
                so far as I know we have this great distinction, that in our appeal - I suppose
                  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I may occasionally for a moment
                turn to honorable members. </para>

                            <para>- I am very much obliged to you, sir. As you know, in the ardour of addressing
                the House we occasionally address honorable members, and I hope you will understand
                that my doing so arises from no want of respect' to the Chair. I may on this
                point pray your forgiveness, for I have unfortunately not been in a position during
                the last fortnight to make myself acquainted with the names of honorable members and
                their constituencies, and I hope the House will give me indulgence under the
                circumstances which they know existed. May I express to you, sir, if I may be
                allowed the liberty, my deep gratification that the first honorable members whom you
                have reminded of the rules of the House are men in a prominent position in the
                House, thus showing the high standard which I am sure will always obtain under your
                rulings. I would infinitely rather see a Speaker strict with the. older members of
                the House than with the younger members, and I congratulate you, sir, if I dare take
                the liberty, in showing such an excellent example. As I have said,' the
                gentlemen on this side - and when I speak of gentlemen sitting on this side of the
                House, I do not mean that every one here is a member of the Opposition - I do not
                attach any significance to the positions honorable -members take up, because they
                have a perfect right to sit wherever they like - I speak of the party which I lead                and I wish to say that we have the great consolation, if we need to condole over
                anything, that our fight was absolutely straightforward. We mixed no issues with
                this great issue. We did not talk about mysterious dangers to the Constitution. We
                did not talk about the necessity of electing "good men" - " good men
                " always meaning men with principles which are not the principles of the people
                whom they ask to elect them. You never need to talk to a man who possesses the
                confidence of the majority of the electors about his being a " good man." It
                is the candidate who is not really at home with the constituencies who has to get in
                on the " good-man " ticket. I am happy to say that we have put a plain                naked issue before Australia, and let us apply the result to the Federal Ministry                Three members of that Ministry have come from a State - the Premier, the Secretary
                for Home Affairs, and the senator who leads the Senate - the people of which, if
                they had their own way, would have put them anywhere but in a Federal Ministry. Nowra                I come to my old dear and distinguished friend, the honorable member once for South
                Australia, but now for one of the constituencies thereof. </para>

                            <para>- That is so ; in South Australia it was a national vote for both Houses. I find
                that South Australia, by a majority, would have had my honorable friend anywhere but
                in a Federal Ministry. Where should we see the member for the Swan, if Western
                Australia had its way? He would be on some lonely island, condemned to isolation for
                life, like the other Napoleon. But he is in the Federal Ministry, although Western
                Australia, with a gigantic volume of electoral power, almost unanimously said -
                " We will have none of him, and we will have none of his policy." And yet he
                sits there to-day a member of the Federal Ministry of Australia. As to Tasmania, I
                do not wish to say a word in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir
                  Philip</inline> Fysh, because I know he is a staunch free-trader, and that he has
                gone into the Ministry to save these gentlemen from shipwreck. There is no doubt
                about that, and so I am satisfied with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir
                  Philip</inline> Fysh's position in the Cabinet, because we want a man like him
                amongst its members. Then besides <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline>
                Fysh, there is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake;</inline> but, as I say                Queensland has not spoken definitely on the subject, and, therefore, I do not wish
                to make any observations on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drake's</inline>
                position in the Ministry, as I do not feel I am entitled to do so. But in reference
                to the other gentlemen, we have the Colonial Treasurer and the Attorney-General
                sitting in the Ministry clearly by the voice of the people of Victoria, and it seems
                to me as the result of this great appeal to Australia, that although three of the
                States outside two gave majorities for a revenue Tariff - four of the States, if you
                count Queensland - this great battle in Australia has been decided by Victoria. I
                congratulate Victoria on the result. It is Victoria that is the beginning and the
                ending of the position of this Ministry. I do not say it is not a proper foundation
                for this Ministry to rest on. They have just as much right to rest on that
                foundation as a Ministry would have to rest on a foundation of New South Wales, and
                I only mention these things as the result of the opinions of the electors as they
                have expressed them. It is not for me to say the electors were right, but we are all
                true democrats, and, therefore; we must think so. But that is the practical result
                of this general election, and I thought it right in Melbourne, where these things
                are quite unknown, and where a " brilliant protectionist victory" has been
                mentioned day after day to put a few of our friends right on the subject. </para>

                            <para>- I hope my honorable friend will get accustomed to a little of the healthy
                atmosphere of a real democracy. If he had spent more of his time on the gold-fields
                and less at Perth he would have been accustomed, to it. But I wish it to be
                understood once for all that I cherish feelings, I would almost like to say, of
                friendship with reference to the individuals who form the Federal Ministry. I have
                no sort of feeling contrary to those of friendship, but I think the Premier and
                myself by this time have learnt that we each have a public duty to discharge, and
                that in the discharge of that public duty it saves a great deal of time ' to
                talk straight. I might have said the same thing about my right honorable friend in
                half-an-hour more politely, but time would not allow of that. I want now to invite
                the attention of honorable members to the utterances of this speech on the one big
                question on which there is a radical splitting of opinion. Just compare the language
                used in this speech with the language which would be used by mv two friends from Vic
                tori a in a vice-regal speech addressed to the Victorian Parliament on the subject of
                protection. That is the way to test this thing. I test it by the -two gentlemen in
                the Cabinet who I know are accustomed to believe in protection, and have never had
                any occasion to reconsider their position. I ' say that if these two gentlemen
                had put into the mouth of the State Governor of Victoria those expressions of
                opinion, the Melbourne. <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> would have had them
                out of office in a week. A more whining appeal to the merciful charitable instincts
                of a great House of Parliament was never uttered. Surely those gentlemen believe
                that the principle of protection which has caused so many struggles throughout the
                whole civilized globe is a principle which works well. If those Ministers believe
                that a protective policy will increase wages, steady the labour market, will add. to
                the volume of human industry and will bring happiness and comfort to the homes of
                the poor, surely it is a principle pf which they might be. proud. Now genuine
                protectionists believe all that, and do not put the principle forward on a plea of
                charity. The genuine protectionist does not say that industries, after 30 years of
                protection, have become so decrepit that if you gave them a bit of fresh air it
                .would be fatal. He does not say that, and he dare not say that ; but when we hear
                those gentlemen, now addressing a Federal Parliament, what do they say <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The Secretary for . Home Affairs for 20 years made
                my life miserable by assuring me that if I would only put a- duty of 30 or 50 per
                cent, on everything the colony would become an industrial paradise. But I acted on
                different principles. I swept away all the duties, and my honorable friend came into
                office and found the revenue expansive ; : even now, in spite of my honorable
                friend's accession to power, our revenue in New South Wales has increased by a
                million, roughly speaking, during the last two years. So that we built, as we
                thought, very soundly ; but my friend, now a member of the Federal Ministry, goes
                round assuring the people of New South Wales that there is really no difference
                between himself and myself, and that it is a matter of only 10 or 15 per cent., if
                not 5 per cent. That is very gratifying to the free-traders of Australia                Experienced politicians, however fearless and independent they are, do endeavour
                occasionally to glance at the political barometer, and my friends, in their study of
                the political barometer, have dropped the militant note of protection. They beseech
                us to save those decrepit industries which Victorians have established under a
                protective policy, and beg of us to show mercy to the derelicts they are committing
                to our charge. When on that ground my feeling of humanity is touched I will say that
                in the case of every Victorian industry that will produce its books I am prepared to
                take its case into merciful consideration if it can show that a rational, sound                Tariff will inflict any injury upon it. I am prepared, if it is to be a question of
                charity - charity officers inquire always into the means and circumstances of the
                objects which they relieve - and if our friends ask us as they do in this speech to
                extend our charitable feelings in order to save some weakly industry, and if those
                men can show me on their books, as any man to whom one was going to extend charity
                would be asked to show his means and circumstances that they really require
                assistance, I am prepared to extend the most generous consideration to them. But I
                am not prepared to make all Australia a hot-house for the sake of the cripples there
                are in Victoria. I will help them in any other way, but I am not going to live in
                that sort of atmosphere because they cannot live out of it. I understand of course
                the responsibility of the Victorian statesmen. I understand their position. They
                have incurred a great responsibility. They have led the industrial energy of
                Victoria into this path, and I can quite understand the feelings of Victorians, and
                especially of the men who are in any way responsible for this policy. Their desire
                is to save their victims from the consequences of bad legislation. But we are here
                as the representatives of Australia to lay the foundations of sound national
                principles which affect the masses of the people and every industrial and commercial
                interest. We are not prepared to twist and deform those principles in order to meet
                a case of distress. We will meet a case of distress with assistance to the
                distressed. We will not be so indiscriminate as to help to keep some tottering
                industry on its feet by multiplying the profits of the wealthy monopolists who have
                made their thousands of pounds out of their tobacco and their spirit laws. </para>

            indiscriminate way. We are here, I submit, as the result of the elections, with a
            mandate to pass a genuine revenue Tariff, which shall take no coin out of the pockets of
            the Australian taxpayer which is not destined for the chest of the Commonwealth
            Treasury. If we are to consider individual cases, let us consider them on their merits
            as individual cases ; but do not let us dwarf and stunt a great national policy to meet
            a few "hardships. I rejoice in the result of the appeal to Australia. We know that
            the moment an Australian constituency was appealed to the free traders were to disappeared            and were to become interesting relics of some bygone stratum which had been overwhelmed
            by a huge democratic wave. The wave has come, but it has made the advocates of a
            protectionist policy in the Federal Ministry remarkably damp. It has made them
            remarkably limp. All the fire has gone out of them, and when the youngest member of the
            House spoke out like a man on protection the beseeching glances from the bench of
            Ministers were most instructive. They burned to him as if he were about to fire a
            torpedo amongst them. My honorable friend the member for Corio will find, before he is
            here much longer, that the less he talks about protection the more Ministers will like
            him. Where is a word of protection in the Governor-General's speech? Let us look at
            the paragraph with reference to it. </para>

            policy of Victoria, which fills the homes of Victorians with happiness and plenty ! Why
            can not the Ministry extend this great blessing to the other benighted populations of
            Australia? Now that the chance has come of extending the marvellous advantages which the
            Victorian Tariff has conferred upon every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth, why
            do not we see one flicker of missionary spirit, instead of the attitude which suggests -
            "Hold on as long as you can, and say as little as you can? " This speech does
            not say that the policy of the Government will be a protective- policy. It says it will
            be a charitable policy. Why not adopt the Victorian Tariff, which has worked such
            marvellous wonders for the people of Victoria? It is all ready to the hands of the
            Government. Why, my honorable friend, the Minister for Trade and Customs, who looks as
            if this job would kill him before it is over, has in the Victorian Tariff, which is
            ready to his hand, an ideal policy, and it would save an immense amount of trouble if
            the Government would only let the flood-gates of prosperity loose at once, and give us
            the Victorian Tariff. Why call it "unjust ".if it covers t]ie land with
            plenty? Why "unjust " if it adds to the comfort of the homes of the poor ? Why
            " unjust " if it increases the volume of employment, and heightens the rate of
            wages ? Where is the injustice ? The fact is that it has broken down, and the Ministry
            do not know how to fix the pieces. There is one startling admission made in this speech            where it is stated that "revenue must of course be the first consideration." Why
            should revenue be a consideration before the well-being and prosperity of the people? If
            this policy will make your workers busy, happy, and prosperous, why should revenue be
            the first consideration? If there be a prosperous people the Government will get more
            revenue out of them, so that on protectionist principles they should give them a stiff
            dose of protectionist physic in order to make them turn out more wealth to the State            because the wealthier they get the more the Government can tax them, and the less it
            will affect them. The speech proceeds - </para>
                    <para>To secure a reasonably sufficient return of surplus revenue to each State so as
            fairly to observe the intention of the Constitution, while avoiding the unnecessary
            destruction of the sources of I employment, is a work which prohibits a rigid adherence
            to fiscal theory. </para>
                    <para>Has the protectionist flag sunk so low as this? Again, the plea for charity in
            the words - </para>
                    <para>A work which prohibits a rigid adherence1 to- fiscal theory. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is the result of the general elections. It prohibits " a
            rigid adherence to fiscal theory." If the Ministry had a majority that they could
            count on in. this House, and a majority in the Senate that they could count on, they
            would give us a genuine' protectionist Tariff as hot as any one would like it, but
            they do not feel strong enough for that. I, therefore, feel deeply indebted to my light
            honorable friend the Prime Minister, and my other honorable friends opposite, and think
            that they will probably do a great deal of work for us in carrying out a genuine revenue
            Tariff, and I can assure the House that if they do bring down a revenue Tariff they will
            have our support. As for the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> they
            must settle with that newspaper afterwards. The speech also states that - </para>
                    <para>Existing Tariffs have in all the States given rise to industries, many of which are
            so substantial, that my advisers consider that any policy tending to destroy them is
            inadmissible. </para>
                    <para>I agree with the Ministry, but I find that a "policy which puts shackles and
            taxes upon the great natural industries of Australia tends to destroy them more
            efficiently than by leaving them free from those burdens. I look across this mighty
            continent and see working there, against a million difficulties, the indomitable
            Australian settler, battling with droughts and sterility, and numerous other evils            There is a great natural-industry. The settler has to fight in the markets of the world
            against all the cheap and coloured labour of the world. Do you make him stronger for
            this great fight for a living abroad by multiplying the. taxes upon him at home, by
            taxing his implements and his clothes, and by making it necessary for him. to pay so
            much more in order to have the privilege of. living at all ? Then I look across the
            continent, and see' a great mining industry.. Do you help the miners of Australia            who, whether on the surface or deep, deep down in the heart of this continent, are
            working their lives out - do you make their lot easier by taxing every comfort they
            enjoy ? In. building up a- great nation- are we going in- the search for. a sound            national policy, to search for every cripple, and regulate your nation's policy by
            their necessities'!. No; and in spite of the marvellous advantages this Government
            had, and in spite of tine influence of their position and offices, right through the
            heart of Australia the light has gone, and the first lesson that labour has to learn is
            that the more free the country is in which it labours the better it is for labour. If
            you make artificial methods for creating wealth you give great advantages to the brain
            power and capital of the country. After all, specious as many of their arguments are            there are one or two small rules that Australia will insist on. So far as the great
            primary industries of the Commonwealth are concerned, Australia will insist that they
            shall not be handicapped. They have to fight, not here, but in the markets of Great
            Britain, against all the nations and all the serfs of the world. What sort of a policy
            is it which makes a man strong by tin-owing ropes around him, or intelligent by
            prescribing the lines of his enterprise; which makes a nation great by the ink of an Act
            of Parliament, drawn by men whom no persons of sense would trust, in the matter of
            business-like sagacity, to found an industry of the value of ?500 ? If you will
            attempt this enormous task, if you will seek to decipher the hidden destinies of human
            industry in this young, mysterious continent, call to your councils men who have been
            accustomed to deal with the great problems of Australian industry. I do not make this
            remark in disparagement of my honorable friends more than of the members of the party on
            this side of the chamber, and I apply the same remarks to myself. To ask men like the
            right honorable the Premier and myself, with our absolute ignorance of the problems of
            industry, to fashion a policy for the future of Australia, is a freak of lunacy. Our
            only safe line is to leave the people as free as we can, to put the hand of the State
            upon them as little as we can, to take as little out of their pockets as we can. After
            all, when the- money gets into their pockets they have a <inline font-style="italic">prima</inline><inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> right to enjoy it. No
            Parliament on earth has the right to put its hand into the pockets of the people, except
            to meet the necessities of the State. That is the solid principle upon which we take our
            stand. We say - " If you: will encourage new forms of industry, make Government
            industries' of them. If you believe that you can fashion industries, try a few
            experiments - Government experiments, and let us see how they get on. Then, if there
            is' failure, no one else can be blamed, and the experiments' can be
            dropped." But if you fasten this policy upon the country, a revolution may be needed
            to get rid of it If you plant this ever-growing octopus upon the fair young form of
            Australia, there will be much suffering when you come to tear it out. Fortunately in New
            South Wales we have the courage of our convictions. When I had an opportunity to- use
            the power of the State, I loyally and honestly gave effect to the policy in which I
            believed, and 'since the year 1896 the items upon our Tariff have numbered about
            ten, and we have not a single <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. I
            had the courage of my convictions, and I believed that in doing that I was not
            strangling industry but was improving the condition of the people We have had five
            years' experience of that policy ? Have our factories been shut up! Has Sydney
            declined ? Has the colony been ruined ? Is there one man in all New South Wales who now
            clam ours for the re-imposition of the duties' that were taken off? There are
            still' one or two - a candle manufacturer, a rope manufacturer, and some others. But
            the' great heart of the people was so sound upon tin's subject that the
            .Government of the honorable member for Hume had only one anxiety, and that was how best
            to assure the people of New South Wales that' they would do nothing to remove the
            policy which I had established. There is an object lesson for all Australia ; and
            Victorians must remember how inferior we are to them in enterprise, in skill, and in
            quickness. Yet in that rather lethargic State that great experiment has been tried, and
            one would think- that if it had not rested on a sound foundation our factories would
            have been closed. ' We had no barriers to take down when federation came. The cause
            of Australian Union did not call upon us to take down' the barriers between uganda            you. You in Victoria have had the free run of our State, although you have shut us out
            from your markets for a good many years past. But I was riot afraid of the competition
            of Victoria; because I knew . that the future in manufacturing industry must be
            with' us. I' could' 'understand a New South Wales man' who took a
            narrow view being a protectionist, But the idea of </para>
                    <para class="block">Victorians building up industries which depend upon the use of iron
            and coal against the competition of New South Wales is another phase of lunacy. I do
            not, however, view these matters in a selfish way. I would not come here to consciously
            do a wrong or inflict a hardship upon a single man in Victoria. It is because I believe
            that this policy of freedom will be good for Victoria that I feel the strongest
            determination to carry it through. What has been the result of our manufacturing
            enterprise since 1896? Our factories have increased the number of their hands by nearly
            11,000. Now that the figures are upon a uniform basis a fair comparison can be made ;
            but, though I have the New South Wales figures for 1900, I have not the Victorian
            figures, and I should not like to make a comparison for the period between 1896 and
            1899, because it would not be a fair one. I propose, therefore, to give only the figures
            for the State of New South Wales. In 1896, when our great change came, there were
            employed in our factories 49,840 hands, and in 1900 we had 60,732 hands so employed, an
            increase of 10,892 hands in four years ; so that experience has justified our policy. I
            shall now give a comparison between the States of New South Wales and Victoria ; but I
            shall not trouble the House with many figures. Taking the period between 1889 and 1899,
            I find, from the figures given in the statistical publications that in 1899 there were
            5,000 fewer males employed in the factories of Victoria than were employed there in
            1889. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with the States of New South Wales and Victoria, and, in making a
                comparison between them, I could not quote the Melbourne figures, though I admit
                that in one sense Melbourne has been Victoria for many years past. Melbourne                however, has a wider area to deal with now, and that will be to its great advantage                After eleven years experience of the Victorian policy, that is, at the end of the
                period between 1S89 and 1S99, there were absolutely 5,000 fewer males in the
                factories of Victoria than there were at the beginning of that period. But, during
                the same number of years, in the much slower colony of New South Wales we had an
                increase of 5,700. Adding the Victorian decrease of 5,100 to our increase of 5,700,
                we gained an advantage of 10,800. It is only right that I should give this
                information to the people of Victoria, because they have very little chance of
                getting it from any other source. Are my honorable friends, who speaks so
                confidently, aware that, according to the official census of Victoria, during the
                last 30 years more people have gone out of this State than came into it ? It is a
                marvellous fact that during the last 30 years 16,000 more souls left Victoria than
                came into it from oversea, or by land - I am leaving the births out of account. In
                30 years there have been 16,000 more people who were glad to run away from Victoria
                than there have been people who were anxious to settle down here. That is a fact
                which the Attorney-General would rather leave alone. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose it is a sign of national prosperity ! It shows the patriotism of the
                true Victorian, when he is ready to emigrate abroad in order to make . things more
                comfortable at home. If this is a sign of progress,- let us look at what has
                occurred in those benighted states which must be -going to the dogs. During the same
                period, New South Wales had 300,000 more immigrants than emigrants. What a terrible
                blow to New South Wales ! What a. sign of the ruin that our policy was working there
                ! Queensland in the same period had 185,000 more arrivals than departures. Poor
                unhappy Queensland ! In South Australia the. arrivals outnumbered the departures by
                only 16,000', so that that State would seem to have been doing rather well                Western Australia, however, under the reign of my right honorable friend, the
                Minister of Defence, went to the dogs altogether, because there the arrivals
                outnumbered the departures by 122,000. </para>

                            <para>- I believe so ; but my right honorable friend makes it a nile to say " more
                than that " to any conceivable figures that one may use about Western Australia                Then there is a little State which has been looked upon by Victoria as a sort of odd
                parish which ought to be annexed to Victoria. Little Tasmania, during the 30 years I
                have referred to, has had a gain of 16,000 instead of a loss of that number. So
                that, if Victoria is doing right in losing population, all Australia is doing wrong
                by gaining it; but all Australia is not such a fool as to think so. May I suggest                too, that during the past three years this exodus has been even more serious than it
                ever was before, and that during the past ten years Victoria has had 117,000 more
                departures than arrivals? Do you, sir, call that a sign of prosperity? Could not the
                versatile genius of <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> distinguished friend the
                Attorney-General have discovered some method for keeping those people in Victoria                They were good men you know ; they were Victorians. <inline font-style="italic">You</inline> must not say you were glad to get rid of them. -What does this
                movement of population mean ? 117,000 in ten years means about one-tenth of the
                whole population of this State. Yet- Victorians - those who are all right in
                Victoria - rise with an appearance of self-possession and confidence to speak of the
                success of their policy in "Victoria. It is a new phase of success that drives
                people away from a country. It is worth imitating when you want to get rid of
                people. But we all know - and I think the people of Victoria will more clearly see
                now that we have representatives of all Australia here-: - that this great continent
                wants to be developed by a healthy growth of human industry, and that if we had to
                contemplate 400^000 or 500,000 people leaving Australia, we should look upon it as a
                national calamity. Suppose that this last census, which shows that Victoria has lost
                nearly 120,000 people, showed that Australia had lost 400,000 or 500,000 during the
                ten years by immigration. Is there a man outside a lunatic asylum who would say that
                that was a sign of progress for all Australia <inline font-style="italic">t</inline>
                Yet there are persons who will say it. One of the objects of this, policy in the
                early days was to bring to Victoria the brightest artisans in the world. But they
                have not come; and those who have come have been glad to get out of it. They have
                paid their own passages, too, and they do not seem to be in a hurry to get back                They have gone to the other States, and they have stayed there. They send money
                orders here in large amounts, and I am sure Victoria is glad to get them. I speak
                in. this plain way because we are confronted with a Government who, if they are true
                to their policy and do not tamper with it, must come before Parliament with a Tariff
                framed on protective principles. They would be false to their trust - and we must
                not believe that they will be false - if they did not introduce such a policy. I may
                say on behalf of the Opposition that our policy ' is going to be that which I
                think Ministers will consider a fair one. We propose, so far as the Tariff is
                concerned, to wait until Ministers place their proposals before the House. We
                propose to raise no party issue until then; and not even then, if Ministers frame a
                Tariff such as we desire. But I feel that, torn as they may be by doubt, in the end
                they must be true to their principles ; in which case they should have said in this
                speech : " We are a protectionist Government ; we believe protection increases
                the happiness and prosperity of a country, and we propose to increase the prosperity
                and happiness of Australia by establishing a protectionist policy." But no !
                Charity for the derelicts ! We have none in New South Wales. You need not think of
                us. I see this reference in the speech - </para>

            look after themselves. Do not put 20 per cent, on the people of New South Wales under
            the pretence that you are keeping our industries from ruin. You may rum them by taxing
            them, but you cannot ruin them by leaving them alone. That is a little message from New
            South Wales. It is not my message, but the message which New South Wales has recorded at

            protection builds up new industries <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> In Victoria
            the cry was that this policy would build up new industries. Thirty years have passed            and now the cry from Victoria is not that you twill build up new industries, but
            "do not kill the unfortunates that are left." That is the most significant
            comment upon the value of their policy that the Ministry could give. I say that no
            Ministry has a right to claim an alliance with the pro tea 'zionists if they drag
            protection in the mire. It is an odious position to put a party in. When you have to cry
            for mercy your doom is sealed. Is that the attitude of the proteczionists of Australia ?
            Is their pride sunk so low that there is to be only one universal whine to be spared ? I
            think that ' does bare justice to the men who really believe in protection. But it
            is better to be silent and wait to see what you will get. Now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I have given such prominence to this matter because I say
            candidly that the whole of the speech of Ministers, except the reference to the fiscal

                            <para>- The honorable member need not thank me. Let him thank the Cabinet. I say
                honorable members are to be congratulated, you gentlemen who apply yourselves
                specially to the interests of labour. Probably I have had a great deal more labour
                votes than all of you put together in my time. But while I congratulate you on the
                force you are exercising, I would suggest to the Ministry that they have made one
                mistake. They have tried to bridge over one of the chasms of eternity with a pretty
                little string of vice-regal platitudes. You can get them for a penny a line from any
                intelligent press reporter in Australia - from any man who has . ever reported any
                speech of a public man. Of a comprehensive kind, too ! But what this House wishes to
                know is not only what Bills are to be introduced, but upon what principles those
                Bills are to be founded. I will admit this, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                  Speaker</inline> : that there are gleams of a perfectly reckless courage in this
                vice-regal speech. For instance, just mark the bravery of the Ministry in announcing
                that they are determined to be economical, and to avoid extravagance. There is
                something like the tone of a proud old Roman in that ! That is a ticklish subject                you know. It is a subject upon which a Ministry might expect to face opposition. !
                And how brave they are ' Then they are to propose penny postage. Mark the
                reckless courage of this promise of universal penny postage - when it is possible !
                Then there is another specimen of the reckless courage which animates this Minister                The defence forces are to be founded on the principle of a citizen soldiery. What a
                risky declaration that is ! Just think of the number of members in these two Houses
                who are clamouring for a big standing army ! Yet, in spite of that, Ministers come
                forward like men, and say - "We will stake our existence on the principle of the
                citizen soldiery !" Now I come to the part of the speech which unfortunately
                puts them in a dilemma as to one-half of the paragraph. They can be perfectly
                reckless and brave as to the other half. They do not yet know quite where they are                Mark the change of tone ! </para>

                friend knows that there was a long criminal trial - a capital case - in Sydney, and
                it was postponed in a most unexpected manner, which prevented me going to
                Queensland. It was a long case, and one which no man could leave. That took away a
                fortnight of my circuit month, which I thought to spend in Queensland. But I believe
                the people of Brisbane will remember that I said to them - "I am against your
                kanaka labour, until you hear from me to the contrary." I made no shuffle about
                it, nor have I changed my position. </para>

                already in Queensland, and the gradual abolition of the importation of fresh
                kanakas, are two very different things, and are matters that will have to be
                considered. </para>

            take up time unnecessarily, but will leave the matter with that explanation, simply
            pointing OUt to the House that the gradual abolition of kanaka labour is one thing and
            the gradual abolition of the introduction of fresh kanakas is another thing. I do not
            know' whether I am wrong, but I cannot shut my eyes to the significance of the
            verdict of Queensland herself. I confess it is a question which cannot be concluded by
            the Federal Ministry simply because a verdict at the general election went one way. But
            viewing the matter in all its surroundings it is somewhat embarrassing to any one who
            wishes to be indulgent in the matter, to find Queensland herself speaking in no
            uncertain voice as to her wishes, which, I suppose, Queensland would carry out if she
            had control of the subject herself. </para>

                            <para>- So I understand, and this is a matter which will have to be considered                because that is the only way of ascertaining the feelings of the State of Queensland
                on the subject. I should like to refer to a phrase in the Governor's speech with
                regard to " setting the machinery of the Constitution in motion." There are
                two ways in which you can set the machinery of the Constitution in motion ; one is
                by introducing necessary Bills, and the other is by appointing Mr. Began. There is
                a cloud over the doings of a Federal Cabinet, or any other Cabinet, during the
                recess, and it is convenient for all Ministers that it should be so. But we all know
                that one of the most important matters in setting the machinery of the Constitution
                in motion is that the permanent heads in the public service should be wisely
                selected upon sound principles. No man has been more eloquent than the Prime
                Minister himself on this point for many years. He has pointed out in terms which I
                cannot imitate that in these high permanent offices of State you must not only have
                ability, you must not only have a high range of culture, but .you must have a long
                and honorable record in the public service - not merely a record of public Services                but what is the glory of the public service of Australia as we wish to see it, the
                permanent officers of the Government must be absolutely free from political
                association. There should be no man appointed to a high office of State whom I
                should not be able to approach with the same confidence that my honorable friends
                could approach him, and one of the advantages of selecting men of long experience in
                the public service of Australia for those high positions is that from the
                necessities of their life and career, they have been accustomed to stand impartially
                between all sections in the -political world. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                  Fegan</inline> is a gentleman of whom no one wishes to say an unkind word
                personally, and now that he has resigned, I would rather not speak in respect to him
                at all. He has resigned, and we have nothing more to do with him, and I wish my
                remarks not to be understood as applying to him, though I do say this is a bad
                beginning in the vital matter of filling the permanent offices of State. It is
                doubly a bad beginning. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan</inline> was really
                the man to put there, the Government have disgraced themselves by throwing him over                I use strong language. If he was the right man he should never have been allowed to
                resign his Ministerial office in New South Wales to take up the position, only to
                find that public opinion had so terrified the Ministers that they broke their
                contract with him. This question rises above the personality of the gentleman to
                whom I have referred, and we have nothing more to do with him, but I say that either
                he was a fit and proper person to fill the office, or he was not. If he was
                appointed because he was a lit and proper person, why was he thrown over ? </para>

                    <para class="block">Government, and that we shall not have occasion to refer to such
            matters again. I now wish to say one or two words in regard to some of the matters
            referred to in the speech. As to the Federal Capital site, I commend the spirit in winch
            Ministers seem disposed to deal with this matter. I think the question is one which
            ought to be promptly dealt with, and it is also one of great importance, about which
            there should be no party feeling of any kind. This is one of the subjects on which we
            should try even more than in other matters to work together ; and I suggest to the
            Premier for his- consideration that, in view of the fact that this is a matter which
            should never take a party aspect, whether it would not be well to appoint a small
            committee from all sides of the House to act in conjunction with the Government. This is
            not a mere matter of executive administration, but is much higher than that, and so far
            as I and the members of the Opposition are concerned we are prepared to do all we can in
            helping the Government to deal with it in a prompt and satisfactory way. In reference to
            the High Court and the Inter-State Commission, we are all prepared to give the fullest
            consideration and aid. There are some expressions in the speech which I suppose we must
            have in such a document, but the Bills must follow the lines of the Constitution, and
            cannot be wider and ought not to be narrower. With reference to the public service, that
            is a matter of great importance, and is again one on which we should be all anxious to
            assist in framing a wise and satisfactory measure. In fact, I may say that, except in
            regard to the main subject which is a matter of principle on both sides, I hope to, as
            far as I can, and I believe my friends also hope to assist the Government. We claim from
            our friends opposite the respect which every Opposition is entitled to. Under our
            present form of Parliamentary Government there must be an Opposition, and that
            Opposition has a high and important duty to perform. It has the duty of watching
            vigilantly and criticising freely the doings of the Executive Government. When we come
            to a measure which is not radically bad, we ought to do our best to make it better. Our
            object should be, when Bills framed on sound principles are introduced, to help the
            Government as far as we can to make them as perfect as they can be made, and to reserve
            our opposition for matters of a serious character. I hope that this Opposition and those
            who succeed them will always avoid one serious evil in the working of our parliamentary
            institutions ; and that is an attitude of obstructing measures, the principles of which
            are not objectionable. I think I speak the feelings of honorable members with whom I am
            associated when I lay down the rule that, where Bills are framed on sound principles, it
            is the duty of the Opposition to help the Government to improve and pass them. Where
            Bills are radically defective, it is our duty to take a different course ; also when any
            question arises of sufficient importance it is our duty to take a decided course. But no
            Opposition should waste time in the way of attacks on a Government when the situation
            does not call for that action, and my hope is that both parties will be able to work on
            these lines. With reference to the system which governs our elections, I pointed
            out' the other day that the Bill to institute a uniform system governing our federal
            elections was put down at the bottom of the list, my right honorable friend said it was
            a trap on my part, but I am glad to see that the Government have thought better of it            and that the measure is to be dealt with without delay; I look upon the' duty of
            altering the electorates of Australia by this Federal Parliament as one of the highest
            importance. I know of constituencies which have been mapped out by the local Parliaments
            where great discrepancies exist in regard to the number of voters, one constituency
            having 9,500 electors, and the adjoining one 16,000. That discrepancy is destructive of
            the principle of manhood suffrage and one man one vote. What is the use of talking about
            an equal distribution of electoral power if in one part of the Commonwealth 9,000 men
            can return a member to the Federal Parliament, whilst in an adjacent electorate it
            requires 16,000. These matters require very serious amendment. It does not at all follow
            that the present system should stand over until a general election comes round. We all
            hope that there will be no such calamity for three years, but wise men prepare even for
            dangers which may not arise. It certainly would be a calamity if another election
            occurred upon the existing basis. It is a vital matter that we should set our electoral
            machinery in order. We must not go on a day longer than we can help under the medley of
            abominably absurd laws which exist in the different States. As to female suffrage after
            a good many years of consideration, I came to the conclusion that it was a wise things            and I hope to see that matter brought forward at an early date. I now come to the
            reference in the speech to old-age pensions. That is a matter as to which I tell the
            House frankly that I think it is more than a pity that the Ministry should take members
            for a collection of simple children. It is an absolute insult to the common intelligence
            of every honorable member to talk about bringing in a Commonwealth system of oldage
            pensions while the Constitution remains as it is. I cannot believe that there is a
            single member who does not know that for every pound collected through the Custom house            fifteen shillings must be returned to the States. Do not honorable members, therefore            see that if a Commonwealth Old-age Pension Bill were introduced involving an expenditure
            of perhaps ?1,000,000 sterling, and if that million were raised through the Custom
            house, the Constitution would require ?750,000 to be returned to the States. In
            order to get that million, we would have to raise ?4,000,000, because the
            Commonwealth Government could only retain one million by raising four. Is it not a
            monstrous absurdity that the Ministry should seriously speak in these terms with
            reference to old-age pensions : </para>
                    <para>Some time must elapse before the financial conditions of the Commonwealth will admit
            of provision being made for old-age pensions. It is, however, the intention of my
            Ministers to deal with the subject as soon as practicable. </para>
                    <para class="block">Ministers know very well that until the Braddon clause is altered we
            must hand back to the various States fifteen shillings for every pound raised through
            the customs. Of course, if the Government propose to raise the money from direct
            taxation, my argument will not apply. But I have understood that the clear policy of the
            Ministry is that the Commonwealth shall raise only duties of customs and excise, and
            that direct taxation shall be left to the States. I quite concur with the Government in
            that view. I am speaking, therefore, on the basis of the declaration of policy and of the
            intentions of the Government. That being so, I say it is the most trivial trifling with
            the members of this House and our constituents throughout Australia to speak in this way
            of that measure. It is simply obstructing the other States in carrying out a scheme for
            the relief of their aged poor, and it will be simply used as an excuse by Ministries for
            postponing the matter for years. The system ought to go right round Australia. If we
            cannot carry it out we should not humbug the people of Australia by pretending to do so            and this reference to the question is one of the serious blemishes in the
            Governor-General's Speech. It is a mere piece of make-believe intended to impose on
            children and not on honorable members of this House. I feel that I have taken up
            considerable, but not an unusual, time for a leader of the Opposition on an occasion of
            this sort. I hope that I have expressed myself with perfect plainness. The Government, I
            feel strongly, must be closely watched by those who believe as I do. If they prove
            faithful to the true protectionists of Australia, they must bring in a Tariff which will
            never pass this Parliament. The question is, "Are they going to throw the
            protectionists of Australia over and carry out a policy which they cannot approve
              <inline font-style="italic">1"</inline> If they do, it is only a matter between
            themselves and the protectionists, for we shall be only too delighted to get our views
            carried out. But I do trust that the Ministry will honorably do their duty by the
            protectionists of Australia, and that they will bring in a Tariff that will amount to
            some recognition of the sturdy protectionist principles of my honorable friend, the
            Government whip. If the Ministry bring in a reasonable Tariff which men with the
            principles which I hold can support, there will be no factious opposition, and we will
            co-operate with the Ministry in order to carry that Tariff through as rapidly as
            possible. If, on the other hand, the Ministry carry out their principles and place
            before us a Tariff which is a protective Tariff, they may wrap it up as much as they
            like under the term of a revenue Tariff, but it will meet with our determined
            resistance. But I do trust I shall never be carried beyond the bounds of legitimate
            controversy, and that we will all endeavour, in the discharge of the high duties
            devolving upon us as representing not only the constituencies from which we come, but
            the whole of Australia, whilst fearless in the expression of our views, to draw the line
            between public criticism and personal attack. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BARTON</inline>(Hunter, New South Wales - Minister for
            External Affairs). - I hope I shall show that I am, like my honorable friend opposite            capable of drawing the line between public criticism and personal attack, and I hope
            also that any remarks of mine that seem to put any matter warmly, will always be
            interpreted as the exercise of my right of public criticism, until it is found that I
            have done something which renders me unworthy to have that credit. T shall not delay
            long with the speeches of the mover and seconder of the Address in Reply, except to say
            that I heartily congratulate them on the temperate tone in which they were couched, and
            also on the thoughtfulness which characterized those utterances. The honorable member
            for Corio was a little mistaken in assuming that the Commission of the Duke of York            signed by the King, as King and Emperor, was addressed to the people in this
            Commonwealth. The letters patent were addressed to the Earl of Hopetoun, the
            Governor-General, who is an Imperial officer, informing him of the powers in trusted to
            the Duke of York, and there was no assumption in that Commission <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> any degree whatever, of the right to exercise Imperial
            authority as an Emperor over any subject of the Commonwealth. I only say this by way of
            easing my honorable friend's mind. I would also ask him not to be too impetuous over
            the question of the Monroe doctrine so far as the islands of the Pacific are concerned            The question of our relation with the islands of the Pacific is one of the most delicate
            that this Commonwealth will ever have to deal with. It is delicate in many ways, not
            only with regard to the relation of the King's Government to other States, but
            delicate with regard to our future relations with the communities settled in those
            islands. Any one who will take the trouble to think over the coloured labour question in
            its relation to those islands will readily discharge me from the necessity for saying
            another word on the subject, because a little consideration will show how very difficult
            such questions are. I would ask honorable members to abstain from laying down rigidly
            any doctrine with regard to these islands. There are Australian interests, it must be
            recollected, in those islands which it is our duty to attempt to preserve, and there are
            Imperial interests that we should all co-operate with England in endeavouring to
            preserve, so long as we do not defeat or embarrass the policy of the Empire itself            Subject to these one or two remarks, I should like to say I am thankful to the two
            honorable members who moved and seconded the Address in Reply for the tone in which they
            handled the matter. I wish also to make it clear that I said nothing at the Town Hall
            the other night from which it could be implied that I intended being a party to handing
            over the control of the Fijian Islands to the Government of New Zealand. What I did say
            had reference to the Tariff question, and it was in a portion of the speech intended to
            be purely jocose. It is a characteristic of speeches delivered just before the session
            commences that they do not anticipate too much the declaration of the Ministerial policy
            to Parliament, which has the first right to hear such declaration. As to what has been
            said by the right honorable member at the head of the Opposition, there is a good deal
            in his speech I need not touch, because it was not serious. From the standpoint of the
            Opposition there are only two ways of treating a Governor's speech - either on the
              <inline font-style="italic">ground</inline> that <inline font-style="italic">it says
              too</inline> much, or on the ground that it says too little. Either it is curt, with a
            view to baffling a deliberative assembly, or it is diffuse, with the same object in
            view. Of course, ministers are accustomed to hearing that kind of criticism, just as the
            members of the Opposition are accustomed to delivering it, and to hearing it again when
            they come to sit on the Ministerial side of the Chamber. We need not trouble about
            criticism of that sort, and I pass away from it altogether. But there is one portion of
            the right honorable member's speech, which dealt with the distribution of parties in
            this House and in the Senate, which is worthy of some comment, and which is of no little
            interest. The right honorable member has apparently made out a table to show the
            position of parties. He has indulged in a nose counting operation which will save me a
            good deal of trouble, because I have not resorted to it, and he seems to have found that
            there are, in the two Houses, 56 gentlemen whom he calls revenue tariffists and 47

                them. The Governor-General's speech is not so full as some of those utterances                and it is not so curt as others. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of my own speeches. The right honorable member knows that it is
                upon the utterances of the Prime Minister that the best political attack can be
                made. If . there have been Ministerial utterances inconsistent with mine, that is
                another ground of attack which the 56 revenue tariffists might well apply to the 47
                protectionists. But what is the sum and substance of all this criticism ? It comes
                to nothing, but that it is a necessity, when one is in opposition, either to attack
                a Government upon its policy, or, if the policy is too good to attack it upon, to
                make up some other reason - which is, of course, a legitimate thing to do in politics
                - in order that the ordinary stage play of party Government may be carried on, and
                so that the Opposition may save its face before its supporters in the country. That
                appears to be the expedient to which statesmen are sometimes driven, and I suppose
                that, as there are a great many precedents for it, the right honorable gentleman
                will not think I am imputing anything wrong or dis honorable to him when I say that
                he lias good warrant for the course he has adopted. It was a favourite expedient of
                the great organ of public opinion which for a long time consistently supported my
                right honorable friend when he was leading a certain administration, to say that if
                the Opposition did not challenge the Address in Reply by taking a division upon it                or move an amendment upon it, they thereby accepted the whole policy of the
                Government, and the right honorable member's Government lived complacently upon
                that sort of utterance for a series of years. It -was good food for the right
                honorable member's party then, but it does not seem to be good food for them
                now. They were ready to assume, or not to in any way contradict, the argument
                advanced for them then, that an opposition which did not challenge a Governor's
                speech accepted the policy contained in it ; but they will not say that nowra                although consistency might have led them to the same conclusion. However, we are
                brought to this position, that no serious attack has been made upon the policy of
                the Government. Any honorable member who listened to the right honorable
                member's speech during the considerable time which it occupied - time which I do
                not grudge him - will agree with me in the conclusion that any one who reads a
                report of it in the newspaper to-morrow will wonder what reason there was for
                uttering it. We are told that this thing or that which seems a, humiliating thing to
                say about a Ministry is a fact about this Ministry, and we expected that. We are
                told that we have, in the Governor-General's speech, hauled down the
                protectionist flag, that we have modified our utterances so that they may accord
                with the result of the general elections. The fact is, however, that a majority of
                honorable members in this House are satisfied, as the right honorable the leader of
                the Opposition well knows, with the utterances of the Ministry both before and after
                the elections, and are of opinion that they are as nearly as is humanly possible the
                same utterances. That is why it is of no use to make an attack upon us on this
                occasion, and to do so would be to invite ignominious failure. You may try to cover
                up these things by a thousand dexterous arguments and jokes, but the fact remains
                that if there were a chance of unseating the Government the opportunity would be
                taken. There is no chance, because a majority of honorable members are willing to
                accept the policy which has been laid down in His Excellency's speech. It is a
                nice thing to make jokes about our speaking of a firm policy of restriction in
                regard to a certain class of immigration, and because we have used one or two other
                phrases, such as the allusion to " citizen soldiery." I admit that there is
                not much virtue in those phrases, but they express a truth which the policy of the
                Ministry will be found to carry out. But imagine what would have happened if a
                reference to our glorious citizen soldiery had been left out, and if nothing had
                been said about the firm restriction of Asiatic immigration <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Does not every one know that the right honorable
                member, who made such a point about the occurrence of these phrases in Iris speech                would have been the first to say, if they had not occurred, that we were false to
                the country for not having used such expressions. We know that it is all in the
                game, it is one of those little things which we cannot be so offensive as to call
                " dodges," but which are usually resorted to by politicians to obtain a
                majority. I emphasize the matter to show the House that the texture of the right
                honorable member's speech was all of one kind - " No case ; abuse the
                plaintiff. There is no reason which we can take hold of for putting these gentlemen
                out of office. They must stay there until, with microscopic ingenuity, we canal                detect them in some mistake, or until we can catch another Began." I suppose it
                is not our fault that they must let us stop where we are. We worked as they did to
                put our policy before the country ; and " the country " now is Australia and
                Tasmania, not New South Wales or Victoria. We put our policy before the .country for
                the acceptance of the new nation ; to obtain the support of a majority of the
                representatives of that new nation was the object in which our right honorable
                friend tried to defeat us, and he has failed in that attempt. It is useless to talk
                now about the number of honorable members elected by the State of New South Wales
                who sit on this side of the House, or about the number of honorable members elected
                by Victoria who sit on our side of the House. This Parliament was elected for
                national purposes, not so that one State might rule the roost over all the others                That the accusation which I frequently made during the general elections against my
                right honorable friend is a correct one is abundantly proved, in that the speech
                reeks with references of the sort to which I refer, in which he is not able to
                disentangle any federal interests from the individual interests of a State. That is
                one point in his speech to which serious reference may be made. The right honorable
                gentleman speaks of the number of revenue tariffists and the number of
                protectionists elected for New South Wales. After using the term "
                free traders," and being somewhat corrected in regard to it, he adopted the term
                " revenue tariffists," and used it to the end of his speech. What then is
                the answer to the charge that we have hauled down the protectionist flag <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It is that the same exigency that makes it
                impossible to resort to any absolute fiscal principle in raising the revenue which
                must be raised, to meet the needs of the Commonwealth, and makes it impossible for
                any protectionist to hold to his policy, makes it impossible for a freetrader to
                hold to his policy, in the same way and causes him to become a revenue tariffist. If
                the protectionist flag has been hauled down, so too has the free-trade flag. If the
                free-trade flag has not been hauled down, neither has the protectionist flag. In
                that matter both parties row in the same boat. The time has come for the patriotism
                of Australia to endeavour to arrive at some adjustment of policy," which                without taking up everything that the doctrinaire has made a subject of worship                will strike out some business line for Australia, under which State interests which
                otherwise would conflict may be reasonably adjusted. I admit that perfect justice is
                impossible. It is utterly out of the question to embody in a Tariff every provision
                that justice would dictate in the interests of every State. That is why it is
                admitted in the speech that the Tariff of no one State can be adopted, because to
                adopt a Tariff wholly or largely framed under conditions from which intercolonial
                free-trade was absent, or a Tariff framed upon the needs of certain state, as the
                inhabitants of that State had been impressed by those needs, would have been the
                very childishness of which the right honorable member accuses us. We cannot take the
                Queensland Tariff, the Victorian Tariff, or the New South Wales Tariff, because to
                take any one of them as against the others would mean the perpetration of an
                injustice which ought not to stain the inception of Federal Government. Those are
                the reasons which have actuated the Ministry in this matter, and I would suggest to
                honorable members that we could scarcely have fitter reasons. If the right honorable
                member were to endeavour to force the New South Wales Tariff upon Australia he would
                have two difficulties to face. In the first place, he would be recklessly destroying
                industries which have grown up under a protective Tariff. It is all very well to
                talk about charity, but the industries which have been built up under the diverse
                Tariffs of the States - as, for instance, the sugar industry of New South Wales -
                were new industries when the Tariffs first brought them out; and, if some of them
                are not altogether new industries now, it is because they have gone on and thrived
                under these Tariffs, although in the case of one of them considerable injury was
                done by the policy of the right honorable member. </para>

                    <para class="block">Ministry are protectionists, and it is true that there are members in
            the Ministry who call themselves revenue tariffists. It is true, too, that both the
            protectionists and the revenue tariffists in the Ministry are content, as honorable
            members round them are content, to take the proposals which may be made for securing the
            necessary revenue to give a satisfactory return to all the States. That is true. But
            then there are gentlemen who call themselves revenue tariffists under Tariffs which my
            right honorable friend and his supporters in New South Wales would call rank protection            There is a widespread impression in Queensland, for instance, in which State the duties
            range up to 25 per cent., with a drag-net clause, that that is a revenue Tariff. In that
            State a large majority of the supporters of the existing Tariff consider it a revenue
            Tariff. Well, there is scarcely a man who supports my right honorable friend in New
            South Wales who would not, if that Tariff were placed before him, call it rank
            protection. These terms are, therefore, to a considerable degree relative. Something may
            be said of the Tariff of South Australia, under which that increase of population which
            seems to be impossible in a protectionist country has grown up. In the other States
            also, that growth of population which the right honorable gentleman seems to imply is
            impossible in a protected State has occurred. The fact is that the Tariffs of all these
            States are Tariffs which the right honorable gentleman's supporters, if transplanted
            to those States, would oppose tooth and nail, as being thorough protection. There are
            many gentlemen representing the people in those States who have studied this question
            perhaps according to a system' which entitles them to classify themselves under the
            name of revenue tariffists, and they are among the 57, but they are not among the
            supporters of the right honorable gentleman opposite. One of the paragraphs in the
            speech says - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The fiscal proposals of any Federal Government must be largely dependent on the
              financial exigencies of the State. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">There is the root of the question of the federal Tariff. If, as the
            right honorable gentleman admits, you cannot resort to federal direct taxation for the
            purpose of supplementing revenue, and are, therefore, bound down to revenue from Customs
            and Excise duties, your fiscal proposals must consist of those duties, and they must
            compare in amount to the return that has to be made to the various States under this
            Constitution. I admit that it may be impossible to return to every State as much as it
            has received from Customs and Excise in the past. I admit that under the bookkeeping
            clause it may be a necessity to return to some of the- States, or to one State at least            more than she has received in the past. That is not the fault of union. It is one of the
            consequences of past disunion. The fact that the States had these varying Tariffs during
            the last 20 or 30 years has resulted in the consuming and producing powers of those
            various countries differing to a very large extent. It has also resulted in some cases
            in this - that a large amount of consumption has been what is called home consumption            consumption of home products not resulting in any duty. Under the bookkeeping clause - I
            am not speaking of the Braddon clause at present, which the two right honorable
            gentlemen opposite, the honorable member for East Sydney and the author of the clause            can adjust themselves, the one as opponent, the other as proposer of it - there is to be
            paid back month by month, to the State Treasurers, the amount collected in the State            less the amount of Commonwealth expenditure, whether by way of maintenance or of new
            expenditure. Unless the States get back something approximating to the amount which they
            have had in the past, there will be financial embarrassment to those States: It is not
            necessary to particularizedd. Honorable members understand perfectly well that unless the
            Tariff is sufficiently productive to enable those returns to be made, financial
            embarrassment must ensue ; and, as the right honorable gentleman correctly put it, that
            embarrassment cannot be staved off by Commonwealth direct taxation, because that means
            the drying-up of those sources of direct taxation that should be conserved to the
            States. That being the position, I will put the case of New South Wales as an instance            Does any one suppose that her Tariff would yield the revenue required for all the States
            ; that a Tariff yielding a little over ?1 per head - it is ?1 5s. per head I
            think, speaking subject to correction - would be sufficient for all the States ? Such a
            Tariff would yield about ?6,000,000. Recollect that the States are now raising
            about ?8,000,000 by Customs. When intercolonial free-trade happens, as it will on
            the imposition of a uniform Tariff, something- like ?1,000,000 must-be lost. That
            must be' made up. A Tariff of over ?8,000,000 must therefore be devised in
            order to make proper and decent returns to all the States. Something like
            ?8,500,000 will have to be raised. I am only giving these figures tentatively, and
            am not attempting to anticipate the Treasurer's Budget speech. If honorable members
            take these facts they will see that if the New South Wales Tariff produced revenue in
            proportion to that which it has produced in New South Wales - and into that question I
            need not go - there will be raised a revenue of about ?6,000,000 through customs
            and excise - perhaps a trifle over that amount - while the necessities of the occasion
            demand something like ?8,500,000. That makes the New South Wales Tariff impossible            of course. The Tariffs of the other States must also be impossible, because they have
            been drawn up according to the exigencies and needs of those States, and in any case
            would not apply to the position of the' Australian States as a whole. It is the
            position of Australia as a whole that I ask honorable members to look to. You cannot            adjust this question in any sense by saying " You must accept this Tariff, because
            we have had it for 20 years in Queensland," or "You must take this Tariff            because we have had it for 30 years in Victoria," or " Adopt that Tariff            because we have had it so many years in South Australia." You cannot have one of
            these Tariffs. It is as futile to argue for the extreme of free-trade as it is to
            contend for the extreme of protection. You can only get out of the difficulty by raising
            a certain amount of revenue, because the need of revenue for the several States stands
            higher than any fiscal theory. To get that revenue, you must drop fiscal theories to
            some extent; but you cannot help that. Some industries may receive more- protection than
            before, or it may be that some industries receiving no protection, and which may be
            languishing in consequence, may receive some. But the object will be to raise such a
            revenue as will give back to every State what is reasonable, and at the same time - and
            this is the protective part of the position of the Government - not to see any industry
            destroyed that is in any. way substantial, if by leaving it to a certain
            extent protective, that destruction can be avoided. That is the position of the
            Government. It is absolutely the-position laid down in the- </para>

            maintained during my campaign in New South Wales. It is idle for any honorable member to
            say that that speech, and what I am saying to-night, is contrary to the manifesto of
            this Government. Now, without labouring the question of the Tariff to any greater
            length, because it would be perfectly idle for any honorable member at this stage to
            beat the old " tom tom " of free-trade and protection to any good purpose, when
            neither party can have the full meed of its way- </para>

                        <para>- Under the practice of the British House of Commons which, of course, we follow              and under any possible standing orders, interjections are disorderly. I do not object
              to any interjections that do not break the flow of the thought of the speaker ; but
              interjections such as those of the honorable member for Macquarie go beyond that, and
              are undesirable. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps it will satisfy the honorable member if I say that if I endeavoured to
                correct mistakes made in speeches about myself, I must have worked 36 hours a day                and then could never have overtaken them. But there is no difference in my treatment
                of this question. No party in power could bring in an entirely free-trade or an
                entirely protectionist Tariff. If my honourable friend were to find 50 newspapers
                attributing as many different statements to me - and if they were newspapers of a
                certain class I could understand it - I should still say that I said nothing
                contrary to what I say now. In fact, I made it a point to make the position of the
                Government clear. I said there would be little difference between the Tariff that my
                right honorable friend the leader of the Opposition would bring in if he had to face
                the situation, and that which I would bring in ; always recognising this - that
                there would always be more of a free-trade element in my right honorable
                friend's Tariff, and more of a protectionist element in ours. But I always
                recognised this - that there must be to a certain extent an abandonment of the rigid
                theories of either party in drawing up a Tariff. I said, and I say again, that I
                defy any one to draw up a Tariff for the States of this continent without adopting
                to some extent the course we outlined. I do not wish to detain the House at any
                greater length to-night. It would not be of any use my continuing longer so far as
                the outside knowledge of my speech would be concerned. I pass by all verbal
                criticism of the language of the Governor-General's speech. It can stand that
                criticism I trust ; and whether it can or not all honorable members know what it
                means. But I should like to say a few words on the criticism which the right
                honorable gentleman has bestowed on several measures. Reverting for a moment to the
                fiscal question, the right honorable gentleman says that it is a " freak of
                lunacy " to fashion a policy for the whole of Australia. I do not think it isa                unless the right honorable gentleman means that the only sane course is to have no
                policy. If we are to have a Tariff policy for the whole of Australia, we must face
                the difficulty of making it, and surely we are not the men our fathers were before
                us if we cannot do it with credit to ourselves and our own intellect. We are not
                afraid to face it, or afraid of the House facing the difficulty with us, and getting
                Australia through any difficulty of a fiscal character that may beset her, knowing
                as well as we do the resources of the country and the temperament of the people. It
                is a pusillanimous thing to confess you cannot frame a policy for the whole of
                Australia. Have not policies been framed for all the other Federations of the world                Was not a fiscal policy framed for. Canada which has stood the test, and another
                policy for America, and another for Germany ? Are these failures ? If they are, then
                what is to account for the marvellous progress of the three countries under their
                Tariffs. They were framed by men who were ready to meet the difficulty, and not by
                men who wanted to shirk it. You may take it for granted that any difficulties we
                have to face in relation to the Tariff will be faced by this House by a larger and
                ever-growing majority in the very proportion that honorable members who are leaders
                in. the Opposition show themselves afraid to face them. As to the measures mentioned
                in the speech, I have given notice to-night of two Bills dealing with the Asiatic
                immigration, or rather undesirable immigration generally, and with the introduction
                of kanaka labour. It will be time enough to explain the latter Bill when I bring it
                down, but the title will serve to satisfy members as to the intention, the title
                being, if I recollect the words, "for the regulation, restriction, and
                prohibition of the introduction of South Sea Island labour into Australia." That
                is a short statement of. the object of the Bill, and I do not think it is a
                statement which can be easily mistaken. The aim of the Bill will be the prohibition
                of the introduction of this labour; but I do not feel that that can be carried out
                in a crack, and I do not think my honorable friend would have the support of his
                party if he were to attempt to apply such a measure immediately. If he brought in a
                Bill of the land himself, and was so unmindful of the interests and the condition of
                things in Queensland as well as in other parts of Australia as to prohibit instantly
                the introduction of coloured labour, he would find himself attempting to carry out a
                policy in. which he would meet with failure at the outset. But there is a public
                opinion, and an absolutely just public opinion, in the country that this labour must
                be prohibited. I am in favour of that prohibition, and I have never wavered in any
                stage of my political life from the opinion that Australia must be kept pure from
                any racial defects, whether by contamination or by the growth amongst us of a pure
                black race I care not. Australia must be kept free from the dangers which surround
                such a growth ; but, at the same time, I decline to propose that kanaka labour
                should be absolutely prohibited on the day and instant. That would bring widespread
                ruin, and not only to black people. Of course, we knew that the pre-eminent interest
                is the interest of the white man in Australia, and a sudden prohibition would bring
                widespread destruction to large numbers of white people, as well as to black people                and therefore some little time must be allowed. </para>

                            <para>- How long ! The honorable member will find that in the Bill, and will see that
                it will not be a long period. Some little time must be allowed in which thosewho
                have been importing coloured, or who have coloured, labour on their plantations may
                turn round and make arrangements in order that white labour may replace the black                which we intend it should. So far as the prohibition of the introduction of this
                labour is concerned, the honorable member may be sure it will be carried out; but I
                am not going to be party to ruining a whole industry at one stroke. If there are
                honorable members on the other side who would vote against me on this question, I
                think their action would be foreign to the whole of their careers in the past. In
                regard to old-age pensions, my honorable friend was very angry with us because we
                have made some reference to our opinion on the subject. It was demanded of us to
                make some reference, and my honorable friend would have been more furious at the
                absence of a reference than at the reference being there. Of course, it is
                impossible to please him. If we put a reference in the speech it has no business to
                be there, he says, and if we leave it out, it ought to have been in. But we are all
                used to that sort of thing. We were bound to say something as to our opinions                Knowing as we did that the financial condition of the Commonwealth would not allow
                of the immediate adoption of a Bill, we were bound to say so, and nobody can blame
                us if we, at the same time, expressed our opinion in favour of it. </para>

                            <para>- I am saying all I have to say as plainly as I can, and shall continue to do so
                if honorable members will allow me. "We cannot bring in an Old-age Pensions Bill
                under the bookkeeping clauses of the Constitution. I admit at once that, unless we
                are to have an enormous tariff we cannot bring in an old-age pension scheme for the
                whole of Australia while those bookkeeping clauses last. It seems to me that                notwithstanding the references honorable members made during the general election to
                the much-abused clause of my friend the member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, that clause is not so much to
                blame in many of these matters as are the bookkeeping clauses, which necessitate a
                monthly return to the Treasurers of the States. But the bookkeeping clauses
                themselves, I admit, are founded on justice, and were, perhaps, the only equitable
                arrangement that could at the time be adopted in order to obtain the agreement of
                the six States. Those clauses have to last for five years, but may then be dealt
                with by the Commonwealth by abolition or modification, or in any way the
                Commonwealth pleases, and at that time it would be perfectly possible, I take it, to
                carry out a scheme of old-age pensions ; but while the Treasurer of the Commonwealth
                is hampered with the restriction placed on him by the bookkeeping clauses, even if
                he could institute an old-age pensions scheme, that scheme could not in any sense be
                termed a liberal one so far as the amount paid would be concerned. As to the
                statement by the right honorable gentleman that the words in the Governor's
                speech tend to prevent State action in the matter, I think honorable members may
                fairly say with me that there is no such meaning in any of the words we have used                Not in this phrase, guarded so carefully as it had to be in order to be honest and
                truthful, is there anything to prohibit State action in the meantime. Two States
                have adopted schemes, and others are on the eve of doing so, and there is nothing in
                the speech to deter State action if the State Treasurers can find the necessary
                funds. It may be necessary for us afterwards to bring in a Bill to unify and
                consolidate Acts of the kind, and carry them further than before, but I am
                constrained to admit that nobody could truthfully come before the House and say
                there is any probability of an immediate introduction of an Old age Pensions Bill
                under the Tariff the House is likely to sanction. </para>

                            <para>- As to the other matters which have been referred to, I think the most
                interesting had better be tackled now, and that is the question which excited the
                honorable gentleman so much - the question of a gentleman named Began. My honorable
                friend is very angry about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan.</inline> He was
                very angry that there seemed a possibility of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                  Fegan</inline> being appointed, and he is more angry that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan</inline> is not likely to be appointed ; and that is
                just of a piece with the rest of his criticism of the Governor-General's speech                If we put a thing into the speech he says it ought not to be there, and if we leave
                it out he says it ought to be there. So it is in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan.</inline> If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                  Fegan</inline> were still " on the boards " my friend would be awfully
                angry, and now that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan</inline> is off the boards
                my friend is angrier still. Of course it is one of these little things we have to
                take into consideration. </para>

                came before the Cabinet until the intimation was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan</inline> himself that, in view of the criticism lavished upon his
                appointment, he desired not to press his claim, and that all he asked was that he
                might himself make the first statement of the matter to the press. On this, the
                matter was explained to members of the Ministry, and the permission was given.

                            <para>- I do not know what statements were made in the press before. As I have said, I
                am not able to follow all that is in the press, and he would be a clever man who
                could do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan</inline> asked the right to make
                to the press the first statement of his intention not to press any claim he had, and
                it was freely granted. I have said over and over again that if the appointment had
                come before the Cabinet, I should have considered myself a mean person if I had not
                carried' out the word I gave. If the appointment had been brought before the                Cabinet, and authority asked for it, I should have endeavoured to make my word good
                ; and if I had failed, I should have known what course to pursue as a man of honour                That is the whole history of the Began appointment, or so-called appointment                because the appointment was never made. If honorable members require any further
                details as to the facts, they can have such details in abundance from the Minister
                for Home Affairs, whose statement, I am sure, will bear out everything I have said
                to the House. That then is the whole of the Began matter. How there should have been
                such a noise over it I cannot make out. There have been cases in the past of men who
                have taken high places in politics being appointed to positions in the civil
                service. There have been cases in which they have failed in the positions to which
                they have been appointed, but there have been as many cases in which they succeeded                In reference to this gentleman, who I think has been very hardly used, not by the
                Ministry, but by others, I can say that one of the best judges in Australia on the
                subject is of opinion that he reads more books and better books than most men.

                            <para>- The right honorable gentleman has sustained a loss, because he would have
                found when he came into office, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan</inline> by
                that time was not past work, that he would have had a faithful public servant. I
                would have stuck to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan.</inline> I never caused
                his withdrawal, nor did I make any statement which warranted any one in applying to
                him to withdraw; and I have been ready from the first to maintain my trust, and to
                keep my word. There seems to have been a too widely-spread notion that every
                appointment to the public service is to be reserved for those who have been in the
                public service of. a State. I do not think that is a good doctrine. Public servants
                in a State may well expect to be promoted in the service of that State, so long as
                there are not cases in which there are strong and just reasons for appointing other
                persons, and every fair advantage ought to be given to that ability and high culture
                of which my right honorable friend has spoken. But when we come to the establishment
                of a new public service, quite outside and apart from the services of the States, I
                know of no principle or precedent which entitles the civil servants of any one
                State, or of all the States, to say, " All the appointments in this service
                belong to us." It is a right thing that the qualifications of public servants
                should be considered; but I will not submit that it is right that there must be one
                dead rule of appointment from the State to Commonwealth duty, because that would not
                be calculated to give us the best public servants for the Commonwealth. I happen to
                know" that there are many civil servants who would undertake duties for the
                Commonwealth with great reluctance. I am not at all sure that there has been too
                much desire to further the interests of the Commonwealth, rather than those of the
                States.. I know there have been men who were prominent federalists in the various
                States, who are highly qualified for Commonwealth appointments, and who are worthy
                of consideration, so long as justice is done by appointing the best men. I do not
                want stones thrown at the Government about endeavouring to fill up the Commonwealth
                service by appointees from outside the State services. I am quite ready to recognise
                the qualifications of those who have done good service in the States, but I do not
                admit that those qualifications amount to claims, when the Government see that they
                can do better by taking some one else. </para>

                good ones, and to obtain the men of the requisite experience, quickness, and
                capacity is often a difficult matter. We could not make a proper selection, so as to
                get what we deemed to be the best <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff
                procurable unless we were prepared to make these appointments permanent by executive

                to this House to allow it to adjourn early to-night, as we begin business at
                half-past two o'clock to-morrow. I thank honorable members for the way in which
                they have heard me, practically without interruption. I would like to say that as
                soon as the debate upon the Address in Reply is finished, which debate I do not
                intend to unnecessarily prolong, the Government propose to push on with Government
                business, and, although I, in common with my right honorable friend opposite, may be
                absent for a portion of next week, that will cause no stoppage to the business of the
                country, which will be efficiently carried on nevertheless ; and I think that, as
                one will be absent from each side, there is no injustice in saying that. </para>
