            <para>- I desire to ask the Treasurer a question in reference to a statement made by the State Treasurer of New South Wales in the local Parliament last night. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Waddell</inline> said that, pending the transfer to the State of the balance of the revenue collected on behalf of the Commonwealth, it was found necessary to arrange temporarily for a small overdraft for which the Government was paying 1 per cent, interest in excess of the rate allowed by the banks on fixed deposits. I desire to know if the delay mentioned by the State Treasurer of New South Wales has been occasioned by the action of the Commonwealth Treasurer, and, if so, what is the cause of such delay ; and whether the Treasurer will take immediate steps to obviate the necessity of the Treasurer of New South Wales being compelled to make financial arrangements at the expense of the people of that State. </para>

            <para>- My honorable friend was good enough to intimate that he intended to ask this question. Section 89 of the Constitution Act provides for the &#39;collection of the money and for crediting and debiting it in a certain way, and then that the Commonwealth shall pay to each State, month by month, the balance, if any, in favour of the State. On the last day of each month each State has received the balance payable to it. Under the existing arrangement the staff of the Treasury, which is a very small one, remain till two or three in the morning of the 28th or the 29th of the month, as may be, in order that the whole of the calculations may be made. Telegrams are sent the next morning to our officers in each State that they are to remit to us a certain sum, being the share of the State in the new expenditure, and to pay over to the State the balance, whatever it may be. I can understand that, without there having been any delay or neglect whatever on the part of the Commonwealth, some little inconvenience may have arisen in the States through their not being able to collect their money day by day as in the post. No communication, however, has been mode to me in any shape or form, but, although the Constitution provides that the money shall be paid month by month, if it would be of any convenience to the States . for us to pay it at more frequent periods, I do not see any objection to our doing so. If, for example, it would be of any assistance to the States for us to pay week by week, we could arrange . to pay over what has . been collected, less what has been expended week by week, and at the end of the month the necessary adjustment could be made. If the Treasurer of New South Wales is anxious to have such an arrangement earned out I will consult with the Attorney-General. Honorable members may rest assured that we shall strain every nerve to enable the States to get the money at the earliest possible moment. </para>

          <para>- The principle involved in the new clause which has been submitted for the consideration of the committee is one involving very important considerations indeed. I yield to no honorable member of this House in my desire to see that no alien race is absorbed in our community, and that work which can be efficiently performed by our own kith and kin is done by them, if it can be undertaken without detriment to their health or condition in life. This is the first of the various fences in connexion with this class of legislation which the House has had to take. I do not think that the manner in which the fence has been approached is as satisfactory as it might have been. </para>

            <para>- I do not baulk as a rule ; I generally take my fences on the stride. Probably it is the intention of the committee to pass this clause upon the voices, but I do not propose that it shall so pass without having given some indication of my own view in regard to the principle involved. I believe that the attempt by the Attorney-General to overcome this difficulty by the insertion of a sub-clause in the clause relating to regulations was an attempt to get rid of considerable trouble. But personally, I prefer always that matters shall be dealt with in a straightforward way, and that there shall be no subterfuge adopted in the consideration of legislation of this character. I decline to believe that this is a question involving the greater question of a white Australia. I regard this Bill as a commercial measure entirely, and to hamper it with the restriction which is now submitted for our consideration is imposing upon those engaged in commercial transactions in an unnecessary obligation. I decline to think that we are studying the best interests of the Commonwealth by this hysterical effort to&#39; carry out the idea of a white Australia, and to bring about restrictive legislation within the period covered by  the first session which is necessarily  fraught with much anxiety to the Ministry who have charge of the Bills which are essential to the harmonious working of the Commonwealth departments. My&#39; object in rising is emphatically to enter my dissent from this&#34; prostration before an ideal, however lofty it may be, and against the consideration of this clause on other than broad commercial lines. When the proper time arrives for the consideration t of the question of a white Australia,  I shall not be behind any honorable &#39; member of this House in my desire to see ! that the people of Australia are not contaminated by fellowship with  alien races.  But I feel that the attempt which is now being made in this direction is .a mistake and a disadvantage to those who introduced it. I regret it very much. </para>

          <para>- I am a little bit puzzled to know exactly what is before the committee. So many clauses and amendments have been submitted that it is somewhat puzzling for any one to speak upon this question without entertaining a fear that before he has finished there might be some other alteration of the Government attitude in regard to this matter, and that possibly the proposal which is now before the committee might be withdrawn, as were the three previous amendments, in which case we should have to commence the debate <inline font-style="italic">de novo.</inline> I was both surprised and grieved at the attitude taken up by the members of the Government upon this question. First of all the Attorney-General&#39; endeavoured to smooth the matter over by suggesting that instead of dealing with it in a direct and straightforward manner, we should attempt to hoodwink those who have the right to veto &#39;this Bill, namely, the Imperial Government by inserting a harmless little clause in it, giving the GovernorGeneral in Council power to deal with a matter of such vital importance by regulation. He suggested that we should trust to the mere casual way in which some portions of the measure would be skimmed over, for this provision to be passed, instead of declaring in a manly and proper way what really was the policy of the Government. This is a question which has had  the attention of the Ministry for some considerable time. Up till a few weeks ago - and I do not see how I can avoid alluding to the treatment accorded- to this Bill by another representative of the Government who is not under the control of this House - we found the Government distinctly and clearly opposing a clause of precisely a similar nature in reference to the employment of coloured crews. </para>

            <para>- I ask you, sir, to look into the matter, and to give us your decision at a later stage. We have too much serious business to attend to in connexion with this Bill to delay its progress by challenging your ruling, or by placing you in a position which none of us desire to see you occupy. I shall content myself with saying that we do not know from one day to another what position the Government are taking up in regard to this matter. When they are backed by a large majority in sticking to their Bill, they refuse to insert a clause of this sort one day, and a little while after a member of the Government comes down and suggests getting over the difficulty presented by a side wind, and by adopting a course of procedure which I venture to think the majority of this committee would deprecate. The Attorney-General proposed to overcome the difficulty by a system of legislation -which I do not think it is a good thing in this higher Parliament of Australia to commence, namely by dealing with a matter in an underhanded, dodging, sinuous sort of manner. Those words perhaps are too mild to describe the &#39; position taken up by the Government upon this question. When it was found that there was a determination on the part of a certain section of this House and of a few other supporters of the Government to have this question decided promptly, and to have some such provision as is now before the committee inserted in the Bill, the attitude of the Ministry underwent a change, even though we were told by the AttorneyGeneral only a few minutes before that it was inadvisable that such a provision should be inserted in the way proposed. The inference to be drawn from the remarks of the AttorneyGeneral, carefully as they were couched, was that if such a provision were inserted the Bill would probably be refused the Royal assent. Within an hour after this endeavour on the part of the Attorney-General to &#34;draw a herring across the trail,&#34; we had the Prime Minister telling us he had come to the conclusion that there was not the slightest fear of any veto - that this Bill was on an entirely different basis from the Immigration Bill, or from any experiences of Queensland, and that there was nothing to prevent the Bill being passed with this clause. </para>

            <para>- Some of us are, and, like the Government, do just what the honorable member suggests. It seems strange to me that we should waste, in two branches of the Legislature, a considerable number of hours debating this question. The Government have had this matter under consideration, and have fought tooth and nail to win ; and yet, in a few minutes, we had the Prime Minister taking an attitude entirely different from that assumed by the Attorney-General on the same clause. . If that is a specimen of the way in which we are going to legislate on these questions, I am somewhat sorry for some of the supporters of the Government. Some of those who thought that the position taken up by the Government on this matter for over two months, and up to as late as four o&#39;clock yesterday, was one that had received the consideration we naturally imagined such a question would receive at the hands cf the Cabinet, suddenly discovered that when threatened by a certain section of the committee, the Government climbed down very ungracefully. </para>

            <para>- I am sure the speech of the honorable member for Maranoa, eloquent with the torrid heat of the district he represents, had great influence with the Prime Minister. My idea is that when the Government advocate a policy, they should advocate it fairly and squarely and take a test vote as quickly as possible. They ought not to dodge until they have carefully counted noses, and then frame the i policy of this great Commonwealth accord- I ing to the peculiar altered circumstances in this House. I am inclined to compare the attitude taken by some members of the Government on this occasion to those assumed by the spineless lady who sometimes appears at the variety shows ; and I never expected to see the Prime Minister of this Commonwealth emulating such an example. The real point of the question was put very clearly by the honorable member for Wentworth. This is not a question of a &#34;white Australia,&#34; and though it may suit some honorable members of the committee to raise that cry, it has very little indeed to do with the case. The question of a &#34;white Australia&#34; will have to be dealt with in a Bill which we hope will shortly be before us. As the honorable member for Wentworth pointed out a large majority of members have been returned pledged to support a &#34;-white Australia.&#34; and I say with all due humility that there is no member of this House who has done more for that object during the past sixteen years than myself. I was the first who raised the cry against Chinese immigration, and endeavoured to conduct a crusade against the influx of these aliens at Port Darwin, and to induce the Government of South Australia . to put a stop to it some sixteen years ago ; so that I do not think that my advocacy of a &#34; white Australia &#34; which has been reiterated time after time in the State Parliament, for over ten years, can be questioned. As to the probability of the Imperial Government vetoing the Bill with the proposed clause in it, I do not think there is much danger, considering the form in which the proposal is now framed. When the clause came down to us at first it was proposed that none but British seamen should man any vessel which was under contract to carry Australian mails, and there was a very grave possibility of the Bill being vetoed by the Imperial Government. But the only danger we are running in stipulating that Indian subjects of  His  Majesty shall be debarred from employment in the stoke-holes of mail steamers, is that of jeopardizing the very handsome contribution which Great Britain at present contributes to our mail subsidy. In round figures I understand that the cost of the subsidized mail services at the present time is &#163;177,000 per annum, of which Australia contributes about &#163;70,000, and Great Britain the balance. Is it likely that Great Britain is going to negotiate these contracts, and submit to Australia placing a bar against her subjects in India working in the stoke-holes of the steamers? </para>

            <para>- The honorable member must have been asleep not to know that the expenditure in regard to defence has gone up by leaps and bounds, while the expenditure of other departments has very much grown. I am not blaming the Government for this for one instant, but I say the expenditure we estimated a few years ago has been greatly exceeded, and exceeded in many instances by the actions of the States. Instead of &#163;300,000 constituting the total expenditure, in some of the transferred departments, the cost will be very much greater than at the time of the estimate. </para>

            <para>- Undoubtedly I will; I am pledged to do so. I mention the fact of the increased expenditure in order to show how careful we should be that the whole cost of our mail services in two or three years time, when the contracts expire, is not thrown on the Commonwealth in consequence of Great Britain declining to continue her handsome contribution.I am not going to argue the question whether the steam-ship companies will take the contracts at the same rates as in the past. Possibly even with the stipulation as to the employment of white labour, the companies may be found willing to take the contracts at not much more than at present ; but on the other hand there is the point which I wish to emphasize, that I am very doubtful whether the British Government will be satisfied to negotiate these contracts and contribute at least one-third more than Australia towards the subsidy, while coloured British subjects in India are barred from employmenton the steamers. We had a warning in connexion with the Natal Immigration Bill. It was pointed out that Great Britain would be placed in a very difficult position if colour were made a bar to the people of India coming to Australia. In Natal the educational test was adopted, and the Government of South Australia tried to follow the example. Of course, I do not know whether the education test now proposed by the Government may not be put aside and that of colour substituted ; judging from recent events, I should think such a contingency extremely probable. I want the committee to consider whether under the circumstances, with only two or three years to run before the contracts expire it is wise to hamper this purely machinery Bill with a clause of this kind. I do not think the fact that black stokers are not employed on the mail steamers will give one additional man a day&#39;s employment in Australia. In addition to the disabilities we have already placed on steam-ship companies in regard to ships&#39; stores in the Customs Bill, the disabilities in another Bill to which I am not going to allude in detail, and also in the Inter-State Bill, are we going to impose another by saying they shall not enter into a contract for the carriage of Australian mails so long as they employ a black man in the stoke-hole? I am not going to argue the question whether white men can work in the stoke-holes in the Red Sea, but I know that in some six or eight trips round the coast of Australia, through the Torres Straits and on to Port Darwin, I have seen thestoke-hole work on the boats of the China Navigation Company, the Eastern Australian Company, the Netherlands-India Company, and other vessels, as much as the black stokers could stand, and it was sometimes pitiable to see the condition in which they were brought up on deck. In hot climates I have no hesitation in saying the work is absolutely unfitted for white men, and that it is more trying than is the work in the sugar-fields. It is for the committee to consider whether we are not opening the door to too much additional expense in taking up the attitude now suggested. I desire as much as any one to establish a white Australia, but I wish to see it done in such a way as not to unnecessarily hamper our trade relations. I think that a white Australia should be brought about, and I am pledged to assist in bringing it about, but I think that it would have been better to leave the question out of this Bill altogether, and to deal with it by legislation relating purely to the question of the introduction of black people into Australia. We have no right to smuggle the question into this Bill, and I can see no excuse at all for adopting the course which is now advocated by the honorable member for West Sydney. The desire of the labour party is apparently to bind the Government - whom they are at present supporting - to a definite line of policy on this question. </para>

            <para>- Judging from what we have seen I am very much in sympathy with the idea that such a course is necessary. I hope that the proposed new clause will not be passed, but that the committee will see that as a matter of purely financial consideration it would be very much wiser to deal with all questions relating to the employment of coloured labour on mail steamers, and the introduction of coloured immigrants into Australia, in a separate Bill covering the whole ground fully and fairly. </para>

          <para>- I have been rather surprised to hear the utterances of the honorable member who has just sat down, and, as one of the supporters of the Government, I must thank him for the very favorable opinion he entertains of us, as if we were some stream that would follow in whatever channel the Government might choose to cut. As far as I can gather, the Government lay down a very clear course. The Attorney-General clearly put it before the House that he could see that a difficulty would probably arise with the British Government if we included in the Bill the principle contained in the proposal of the honorable member for West Sydney, and he proposed that the matter should be dealt with by a provision merely stating that any proposed mail contracts should be brought before the House, and submitted for discussion, before they were accepted by the Government. This would enable honorable members to express their approval or &#39;otherwise of any proposed agreement &#39;before any subsidies were paid. A number of questions ocCur lr connexion with this matter which require the serious consideration of the House. We have to consider what we shall have to pay for a white Australia, and we can1 only arrive at a :just conclusion upon this point, when we know what steamers it is proposed to employ, what kind of labour is to&#39;be employed, and what subsidy will be required under different conditions. We shall have to go further than this even. We shall have to take into account considerations of trade and commerce not only on our own shores, but with foreign countries; and the time is- not very far distant when we shall have to consider what sort of labour shall be. encouraged and paid for on those steamers which carry on our trade beyond the Commonwealth. So far as my own personal feeling goes I would employ not only white people but British subjects as far as it is possible. I believe that white men are quite capable of doing the work in the stoke-holes of these steamers, and I would have gone further than the honorable member for West Sydney has gone, by providing that all men employed in connexion with these steamers, whether for coaling or other purposes, should be white men and British subjects. </para>

            <para>- No, I do not go so far as that. I think the Government have been treated rather harshly by members on the opposition side. The Government and those supporting them are doing something which the members of the Opposition do not want them to do, but which honorable members on the other side would, at the same time, like the country to -believe that they are in favour of. The Government are taking the proper course in this matter, and the discission which has taken place will be of the utmost value, because it will show that the feeling of the House is strongly in favour of having this question of the employment of coloured labour on mail steamers fought out at once on high principles. </para>

          <para>- I do not intend to take up the time of the committee more than a &#39;moment, because  I recognise  -that we are all-sick&#39; of this Post and Telegraph Bill, and &#39; will be glad to see it through the House. I am glad that the result of the debate has been ;to modify somewhat- and in a way that will render it less objectionable -  the  amendment  introduced by  the &#39;honorable member for. West Sydney. At the same time! I must again enter my protest against the introduction of this clause into the Bill, because I think it is absolutely unnecessary, and that it will. give rise to unnecessary irritation. We have four years ahead of us before the present contracts will expire, and at least two years before they will have to be considered, and there is no necessity to raise a question of this kind and cause a ferment before the occasion arises. After the severe  castigation  that the Government have received at the hands of the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. V.</inline> L. Solomon, I do not think I will - say anything further, except that the Government is the most openminded Ministry that I have ever met ; it has the most elastic conscience, and will be an interesting, psychological study for the future historian. I think that I covered the ground last night as completely as it could be covered, and I do  not want to obstruct the proceedings of the committee or take up time now. While the further alteration of the amendment does away with a great deal of the possible obstruction  to the practical  carrying  out of the mail contracts, I think the - whole thing is unnecessary at -this stage. </para>

          <para>- I do not intend to enter into a discussion of the merits of this question, because I understand that the majority of honorable members are at one upon it, but I think it would be wrong not to say a word Or two in reply to the observations of the honorable member for Wentworth, for the reason that hereafter- it might be questioned whether this House was really resolved upon having this principle carried out or not. I should be very sorry indeed if any doubt existed on&#39; that question, and I should be also sorry if it were ever understood from observations that might be pointed out in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard-</inline> &#39;such as those which have just fallen from the honorable member- that the Government ever- wavered in their ideas on this subject. I listened very carefully to the speech of the Attorney-General, and I did not detect any doubt or &#39;hesitation in the views he held. I understood him to say that whilst he thoroughlyagreed with the views expressed in theamendment proposed by the honorable member for West Sydney, he raised the question as to which was the roost politic and the most certain way of attaining the desired end. Very forcible reasons werebrought forward by the Attorney-General,but, on the whole  balance of the argument, I agree that the course of inserting this provision in the body of the Bill is the preferable one. After discussion, the Government are prepared to agree to that course, but it is an unfair aspersion on them to say that they have changed their minds on the subject. I think that we all thoroughly understand . that the Government, a majority of the House, and a vast and overwhelming majority of the country are in one accord with the principle embodied in the clause. </para>

        <para class="block">The main differences betweenthis provision and theclause as it passed the committe e are to be found inanendeavour to render what was somewhat obscure more easy of comprehension. I trust that the subdivision which has been made - particularly in regard to the matter of newspaper supplementswill make itmuch more acceptable to those who have to study it without obtaining legal advice. As far as I havechecked the clause - and I have checked it very carefully - I believe it includes everything that was agreed to by the committee in clause 26. The changes are comparatively trifling, but are &#39; such as were promised. The first change meets the point taken by the honorable member for Barrier, who feared that technical publications published for the purpose of general education might not be included under the definition of a newspaper. Consequently the last part of sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> deals with that difficulty. A newspaper is to consist in substantial part of news and articles relating to current topics or of technical or practical information. The &#34; technical information &#34; is intended to cover the masazines to which the honorable member so frequently referred. The &#34; practical information&#34; is intended to cover the cases, of those journals to winch attention was: directed by the honorable member for Gippsland. It has reference to the farming journals which contain the latest price for produce, stock,&#38;c, and which are circulated in the country. The next alteration made is in the omission of the limitation as to the size of a supplement, and the substitution of a provision to the effect that the size shall not be inconvenient. The further alteration is made that whereas formerly a supplement was a sheet that required to be issued . with every copy of. the paper - a matter of which the Postmaster-General could have no means of proof - an easier proposal has been substituted that it shall beenclosed in every posted copy of the newspaper. We have thus liberalized the clause in that regard. </para>

            <para>- No; but the supplement must be included in each posted copy of the newspaper. I must admit, however, that there was one minor amendment which we undertook to consider, and which does not appear in the printed copy of amendments ; and consequently I shall have no objection to alter paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> and (b) of sub-clause (2). In order to put it beyond all doubt, I propose to include &#34; coloured supplements &#34; in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(a).</inline> In my innocence I thought that all coloured supplements were lithographs, but I am informed that such is not the case. In order to remove all possible doubt, I propose in paragraph (a) of sub-clause (2), after the word &#34; of,&#34; to insert the words &#34; or coloured supplements.&#34; </para>

          <para>- I think that the clause has been improved by the Attorney-General, but I would point out that he has omitted to take notice of a necessary amendment which was first suggested by the honorable member for Moreton. If a person wishes to register a new newspaper he is confronted with the difficulty presented by the words of the clause - &#34; a publication known and recognised as a newspaper.&#34; Seeing that his newspaper does not exist, it cannot be &#34; known and recognised,&#34; nor can it placed upon the registered list until it has actually been issued. I think the Attorney-General might make the first line of the clause read - </para>

            <para>- The adoption of such an amendment would enable a person to register a newspaper before it was actually issued. I should like to direct attention to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> of sub-clause (1). It seems to me that under that provision no publication will be regarded as a newspaper entitled to registration, unless it contains news as well as articles relating to current topics. Unless I am mistaken, a publication like the English <inline font-style="italic">Spectator</inline> would, under the operation of this provision, be prevented from passing through the post, because it does not contain news as well as articles. </para>

            <para>- These words ought to be omitted as unnecessary, for the restriction is ridiculous. According to the new subclause <inline font-style="italic">(b),</inline> which was introduced at the instance of the honorable member for Bourke, the letterpress of the supplement must be printed within the Commonwealth &#34;from type set up within the Commonwealth, or from stereotypes or electrotypes made therefrom;&#34; but this provision could be evaded by anybody who liked to take the trouble. There is nothing toprevent the proprietor of a publication from printing his newspaper from stereotype cast from type set up in Europe, while setting up in his own office the local news and embodying it in the supplement. In this way he could evade the object of this paragraph. If the object is simply to protect local labour this clause does not attain that purpose, and some additional words are required in subclause(b). Then in sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">(d),</inline> after the word &#34;newspaper,&#34; the words &#34;and date thereof&#34; might be inserted, because I do not see why the supplement companies should have the advantage in this regard. </para>

I do not say this because I believe in the policy proposed, but merely to help the Attorney-General. I understand that cheap rates are to encourage literature, but the principle of the Government is to encourage local literature, and exclude some of the standard papers  like the <inline font-style="italic">Spectator,</inline> which has existed for generations, and is looked on as perhaps tha most polished expositor of liberal opinion in, England. And there are other papers with whose opinions it would do us a great deal of&#39; good to be inoculated occasionally. The only wonder is that the Government have not inserted some provision that only pictures locally produced shall be hung on our walls. Legislation with that object was once before a State Parliament some years ago, when it was proposed that only the works of local artists should be placed in the local art gallery, and that a Tariff should be imposed against the introduction of competing works. </para>

        <para>New clause (26) proposed - </para>
        <para>Generalhas certainly draftedthis clause fairly well in accordance with the ideas of the committee. I was not with the majority of the committee, there being two or three proposals in the old clause, land in the clause now, to which I objected. I would like to see the words &#34; printed and publishedwithintheCommonwealth &#34; omitted. A vote wastaken on this point, but I know there were some honorable members who voted in the divisionunder a misapprehension. We might very well allow a newspaper to come into the Commonwealth, and betreated so far as the Post-office is concerned, in exactly the same way as a local newspaper. We need not be afraid that such imported newspapers will compete with local newspapers, seeing that under all the circumstances, even the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> couldnot be adangerous rival to the smallest &#34;rag,&#34; in Australia. There are publications which wedesire to have in this country as muchas possible, suchas those, for instance,devoted to technical and scientific subjects. If these publications were imported inbulk, and thepostal rates here made a little more thanifthey were sent direct fromEngland,France, or Germany ,  the resultwould bethat they would be sent direct to the readers, instead of being; ordered through a locals bookseller. The consequence of this wouldbe that the postal revenue would be reaped by Australia, and not by thoseothercountries, while acertain amount of work connected with packing and despatch would be lost to persons in Australia. To place a bar against the importation of these publications would not give a compositor in Australia a day&#39;s work, and seeing that thepapers will come in any case, a little work might be afforded in another direction, and some postal revenue derived. At present, under the States postal laws, these publicationscome direct from London to the readers, with the result, as I said before, that the English Government get the revenue, and the Postoffice in Australia carries them for; nothing. </para>

            <para>- I think it would come a little cheaper to the reader, and we are here to do what we can for the Post-office. Free-trader as I am, I would give employment to the people ofAustralia in any way thatI possibly could rather than provide work for those outside, but I do not want to go out of my way to drive away trade. When we come to consider the number of these papers that are wrapped up and, addressed and posted in England, and the amount of labour that is involved, we can see that the question is one of greaterimportance than at first appears, and that we should havethat workdone here if possible. I desire to be fair in this matter, and I acknowledge that the Government have treated us very fairly, but I am veryanxious to have these magazines, and newspapers carried throughourown Post-offices instead of through other Post-offices. If a newspaper is posted in London for Tibooburra we have to carry the paper fromthe seaboard inland for nothing, whereas if the paper were posted within the Commonwealth we should get the benefit of the postage rate for newspapers. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MAHON</inline>(Coolgardie). - I hope the committee will notreverse the decision which has already been arrived at on this point. I can give very good reasons, without touching on fiscal matters at all, why we should retain this definition. In the first place our Post-office might be abused, and the people of the country absolutely taxed for the benefit of people outside, if we do not retain the. definition which it is now proposed to strike out. There will be nothing to prevent a large advertiser from going to New Zealand, registering an alleged newspaper there, and publishing advertisements for himself or others, and afterwards sending thousands of papers to Sydney and Melbourne, and having them distributed throughout the Commonwealth by means of the Post-office. There would be nothing whatever to prevent him from fulfilling all the other conditions relating to the definition of a newspaper in this clause. I voted for the retention of these words without having any fiscal motive in my mind, but simply because I did notwant to see our Post-office abused by people who contribute nothing to our revenue. ButI voted against sub-clause (b), defining a supplement, because I believe it is simply a protectionist dodge. </para>

          <para>-I desire to enter a protest against the suggestion of the honorable member for South Sydney that we should look upon the Post-office as a commercial concern. The Post-office affords one of the most valuable means of opening up vast areas of this continent, and if we were to consider it from a purely commercial stand-point we should prevent the development of vast tracts of territory, which it would be impossible to settle at all without offering facilities such as those now enjoyed through the Post-office. It is because of the facilities which the Post-office offers for disseminating useful and interesting publications for the benefit of the people in the outlying districts that we have to define the publications which shall be carried at a low rate of payment. I protest, therefore, against the commercial aspect being imported into the consideration of matters connected with the Post-office. </para>

          <para>- I should be glad if the Attorney-General would extend the period provided for in paragraph (6) of sub clause (1) to three months. I should like to see magazines like the <inline font-style="italic">Nineteenth Century</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">FortnightlyReview</inline> produced locally. That, however, will not be possible if we insist that in order that they may pass through the post they shall be published monthly. Possibly we might be able to publish a fairly good magazine once in three months. </para>

            <para>- At all events, therewould be very little punishment in many cases. There are degrees of offences, and to say that a paper is to be removed absolutely for some of the offences is. too great a punishment, and there might be provided some power of suspension or other lighter penalty. This clause errs - first, in the direction of a penalty, which is far too severe, and secondly in its ineffectiveness to inflict a severe punishment for a serious offence. According to the amendment moved by the honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> there would, for all time, be an appeal from the federal authority, the PostmasterGeneral, to either a justice of the High Court, when that court is established, or to a J udge of the Supreme Court of the State. The last words of the sub-clause must be- altered, because we cannot allow the decision of a State Supreme Court Judge to be final as to the rights of the Federal PostmasterGeneral. </para>

            <para>- But this clause provides that the decision of such Judgeshall be final. There may be a conflict between the decisions of judges in the different States on some matter, and we must have the right given to the Commonwealth to go, sooner or later, whether by original jurisdiction or appeal, into the High Court. I do not disagree withthe suggestion that we should have the power to go to a State Judge, but I think that this ought to be accompanied by the right to go to the Federal High. Court if the Commonwealth or the other party is not satisfied with the finding of the State Judge. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. GLYNN</inline>(South Australia).--I find it is dangerous to take things for granted. Some honorable members have assured me that clause 41 makes provision for stop- ping, obscene matters contained in newspapers from passing through the post, and that that provision will cover the cases of papers published outside the Commonwealth. I find, however, that clause 41 does not affect my argument. It is true that newspapers are specified as coming within the definition of a postal article, but the Attorney-General has now defined newspapers for the purposes of this Bill as meaning a particular thing, that is, a newspaper published in the Commonwealth, and therefore clause 27 will have to be read as only attaching newspapers that are published in the Commonwealth, and clause 41 does not help us at all. </para>

          <para>- It seems to me, that a paper which is not a newspaper within the meaning of this Bill would be a postal article. By excluding newspapers published beyond the Commonwealth from the definition of a newspaper under this. Bill, we bring them within the definition of articles transmissableby post.

Now, several of the Acts passed in Queensland relating to the construction of private lines provide that the companies may and shall establish and maintain  on or alongside  of  their railways  such telegraph and telephone communication as the Postmaster-General shall approve. That is the nature of the provision in the Gladstone and Callide Railway Act, and a similar provision, in a slightly different form, appears in the Albert River and  Bourketown  Tramway Act, and other similar measures.

          <para>- In the absence from the House of the technical electrical authority, who has been advising the Minister in respect to all these clauses, I am not in a position to accept any such amendment. I know that the electrical authority - having been in conversation with him and the Postmaster-General on two or three occasions - strongly urges the position that the complete control of all. systems of telegraphy, and indeed of everything connected with the use of electricity, shall be under the supervision of the Post and Telegraph department. I understand the honorable member for Melbourne to say that there is in existence at the present time a tramway which is the property of a private company. On the, poles of that private company there are wires stretched for the use only of that company. In country districts similar provision might be made to that set out in paragraphs (&#171;) and (6) with respect to telegraphs and telephones,  which  are used on private estates. In the city,&#39; however, the electricians urge that all the. restrictions contained in this Bill should absolutely apply. , </para>

            <para>- Only such reasons, as are given in the Electric Light and Power Act of London, which imposes all these re,strictions with respect to&#39; private lines, and places them under some regulations which the  chairman  of the Board of Trade controls. As we have  no Board of Trade here the Postmaster-General wishes to step in, and acting under the advice of his electrical authority, to lay down regulations and1 establish practice with regard to the user of these particular lines, especially when they are within cities. It seems to me that where there are lines which may interfere with public lines there should be some special power in the hands of the PostmasterGeneral to exercise control over them. I must leave the matter in the hands of the committee, and if the honorable member should be successful in his endeavour to insert these words, it must remain for the electrical authority to show cause why they should not be retained. </para>

          <para>- I think that the Government would do well to consider this matter carefully before consenting to the amendment. I have no objection to private railway companies being allowed to transmit their own messages over their own lines. They may very well have telephone or telegraphic lines to facilitate the general working of their railways, but in regard to tramways it seems to me that the position is very different, because the matter of erecting a separate set of poles for telephonic communication in Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, or Melbourne might be a very serious one. </para>

            <para>- But I would point out that there sire tramway companies in the Commonwealth other than electric companies. Whilst I am prepared to allow any private railway company in country districts to have telephone or telegraph lines to facilitate the transaction of their own business I do not think we should go any further. In a Queensland Act there is a section which actually allows a private company to receive and transmit messages for the public. That is a matter which I hope the committee will never tolerate here. The main object of these private companies is to run railways and not to conduct telephonic or telegraphic communication. I ask the Government to carefully consider the matter before giving way. </para>

I am quite with the honorable member for Bland in refusing to extend privileges to companies in relation to federal jurisdiction. As a matter of principle I should be against granting any privileges to companies to establish telegraph lines. But in the Queensland Act to which the honorable member for Melbourne has referred, I find sections which lead me to suppose that we must be very careful before we take away grants which have already been made, and rights which have been given in consideration of public duties and services performed.

        <para>SirMALCOLM McEACHARN (Melbourne). Inreply to the honorable member for Bland, I maysaythat it is almost essential, in the case of tramways, that there should be telephonic communication. It may beamatter of life or death at times. If an accident happens at a distance from the head -station, the drivers of the car have instruments with them which they can connect with the telephone wire, and they are thus able to ask for the electric current to becut off, whereas if a messenger had to be sentback, it might be a quarter of an hourbefore the disconnection could be made, and in that time death might be caused to some person who might come into contact with the heavily-charged traction wire. Not longago there was a death in Melbourne through some one coming into contact with a wire which had fallen. </para>

            <para>- No. That company would have had control of one-sixth of the telegraph linesof Queensland. We should watch these matters very closely, and provide definitely that the PostmasterGeneral may resume telegraph and telephone lines after due notice has been given. If a mining field becomes a large centre&#39; of population, big profits may be made out of these private lines, upon which, in some cases, the companies are allowed&#39; to charge 50 per cent. more than the Government rates. </para>

          <para>. - I do not feel competent to discuss the question now before the committee, but I would suggest to &#39;the honorable member for Melbourne that, if we passed this clause, we might, in the clause which gives the Postmaster-General power to make regulations, authorize him to make regulations providing for the use of these lines by any private railway or tramway company upon such terms and conditions as might be prescribed. </para>

          <para>- I am a believer in the Commonwealth retaining the control of great undertakings, such as those to which the clause applies, but if private enterprise is to be hampered by unnecessary restrictions, I am afraid that the development which there is the strongest justification for expecting in the northern parts of Queensland will be interfered with. I agree with the honorable member for Melbourne that the committee should exercise caution and see that restrictions are not placed in the Bill which will interfere with the expansion of private enterprise. Where the Commonwealth will not undertake the responsibility of providing and maintaining telegraphic or telephonic communication, unnecessary restrictions should not be imposed to prevent private enterprise from doing the work. </para>

          <para>- The Government recognise that the honorable member made out so strong a case for his amendment, that we have done what the Post-office officials strongly object to, namely, struck out sub-clause (2) and left the whole of the clausesubject to subsequent provisions which set forth thatif the Postmaster-General does any damage he must pay adequate compensation. The Post-officeofficialssay that the danger bes in boughs of trees which project over without actually touching the telegraph lines,and which when saturated with moisture, affect the lines to such an extent as to greatly impede their working. All the officials require is that these particular branches should be lopped off. </para>

If a railway is projected, and a house and a tree stand in the way, that house and tree have to go. If the honorable member had a tramway proposal and a house stood in the road, the house would have to be removed. </para>

          <para>- I see that this clause commences by saying that the Governor-General may make regulations, but there does not seem to be any power given to alter or rescind them. I am not sure whether the Acts Interpretation Act covers what is required. I know that it does with regard to Acts of Parliament, but regulations can be regarded as equivalent to an Act of Parliament only for certain purposes. In the latter part of the clause mention is made of the alteration of regulations, and it, therefore, seems necessary to refer to alterations, although there is no mention of any such thing in the principal part of the clause. Furthermore, I fail to see the use of providing that regulations shall be laid on the table of the Houses of Parliament, unless power is given, as in some of the States, to the Legislature to alter or vary the regulations in part, or to reject them <inline font-style="italic">in toto.</inline> There are all sorts of different procedures adopted with regard to regulations. In some cases power is given to amend or alter, and in some instances to reject or accept the whole, whilst in still further cases there is merely an obligation imposed upon the Executive to place the regulations upon the tables of the Houses, and no power is ; given to Parliament beyond that. I think  j  the Government will do well to adopt  i  some uniform procedure in regard to | all regulations, and I would suggest that power to alter or amend, or reject should be given to Parliament within a certain time, and that instead of requiring that a motion relating to these regulations should be passed within a certain time, it should simply be necessary to give notice of motion within a certain time. It is sometimes utterly impossible to get a motion&#39; passed within a certain time, but it is a comparatively easy matter to give notice of a motion and so secure one&#39;s position. </para>

          <para>- If the honorable member looks at section 33, sub-section (3), of the Acts Interpretation Act, he will find that the point to which he referred with regard to the alteration of regulations is fully provided for. I agree with the honorable and learned member for South Australia, and also with the honorable and learned member for Indi, who raised a similar point previously, that it is highly desirable that the regulations in all our Acts should, as far as possible, be dealt with by the same procedure, have the same authority, and be enforced in the same manner. As it is, under the State Acts, when reference is made to a regulation under an Act, one is obliged in each case to look up the Act in order to ascertain the force given to the regulation, or the manner in which it can be challenged. It is desirable that there should be uniformity in all these matters, and my attention has been directed towards it, although I do not know that I can promise to make a beginning with this particular clause. </para>

        <para class="block">I do not think that the various lighting systems will be sufficiently protected unless my proposal is adopted. The position of course as to any material dispute will be governed by the subsequent clause in the Bill which sets up arbitration as between the Postmaster-General and any electric authority. But at the same time the adoption of my proposal will be a sort of guide to the arbitrator as to the lines upon which he is to work in arriving at a decision. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HIGGINS</inline>(Northern Melbourne).The honorable member for Maranoa has asked a very reasonable question. The effect of clauses 136 and 138 is that before an electric lighting or traction plant can be erected, the promotors must give notice of their intention to the PostmasterGeneral, who may authorize the work subject to compliance with certain requirements. If the requirements of the Postmaster - General are considered unreasonable, the matter may be referred to arbitration. What more is wanted than that? It seems to me that the honorable member for Dalley has moved the amendment in compliance with the very natural but excessive anxiety of the Sydney electric authorities. </para>

As the clause stands we obtain finality as to the determination of what are &#34; reasonable precautions &#34; by the decision of the arbitrator. The arbitrator would have no power to define &#34; reasonable precautions &#34; as referred to in the amendment ; he can deal with &#34; reasonable precautions &#34; only as they are to be ascertained from the provisions of clause 138. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WILKS</inline>(Dalley).- The Minister accepted this amendment some days back, on the suggestion of his professional advisers. The electric advisers to the Post and Telegraph authorities of New South Wales suggested that the conditions which we wish to  embody here should be inserted in a measure to empower the Municipal Council of Sydney to erect electric lighting plant for the illumination of the city. I think that the amendment should be agreed to, if only to make it doubly sure that the large interests of the State of New South Wales in electric lighting and electric traction should not be injuriously interfered with. </para>

          <para>- The point of the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne was that the acceptance of the amendment will not help the honorable member for Dalley in achieving his object, and may perhaps put him in a worse position. lt seems to me that we should be very cautious in this matter, because we must remember that in the future, when undertakings of this kind ask for legislative sanction, the Postmaster-General will not be a party to the legislation. We must therefore put into this Bill all the provisions that are necessary to protect him. </para>

          <para>- I read the amendment the other way. Clause 138 provides that certain proceedings must be taken before a line may be constructed. But no matter whatmay be done with theconsentof the Postmaster-General under clause 138, ifhis lines are not necessarilyinjuriously, but in any way affected, within the meaning of clause 137, the electric authority will be responsible. The honorable member for Dalley wishes to make an exception in favour of tramway companies which have complied with certain requirements. </para>

        <para>Amendment (by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse)</inline> proposed - </para>
        <para>That the following be added to stand as subclause (2) :  - The provisions of this section shall extend to authorize the Postmaster-General, or any Deputy Postmaster-General, to refuse to transmit or deliver through or in any State any newspaper, packet, or parcel containing any article, book, picture, or printed matter which within the intention and meaning of any Act of that State for the time being in force is of an indecent or obscene nature, and to cause the same to be destroyed. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. GLYNN</inline>(South Australia). It would be a great mistake to insert this subclause, which draws a distinction in immorality between one State and another. This is using the federal power to suppress as immoral in one State what is moral in another. So long as a State declares a certain thing to be immoral or obscene, the Postmaster - General, under this subclause, may stop its circulation in that State, thus introducing into federal matters a spirit of diversity, and doing that in the region of morals. There is another objection to the amendment. The words &#34;obscene&#34; and &#34;indecent,&#34; as used generally in the Bill, may be held to be obscene or indecent within themeaning of theState Acts. It may be held that these words should not have a loose terminology depending upon the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of the Postmaster-General, and that they should not be subject to one interpretation with a liberal Ministry in power and another interpretation with a conservative Ministry in office, so that for the sake of uniformity the High Court would declare indecency or obscenity to be as so declared by law. The possible limitation of the interpretation of these words &#34; obscene or indecent &#34; to the meanings given by the State Acts may be abrogated by putting in this provision, because it will really be an acknowledgment that the words &#34; indecent or obscene &#34; have a general significance, and the courts will refuse to consider anything as indecent or obscene unless it is so declared by a State Act of Parliament. </para>

          <para>- I hope the honorable member who has proposed this sub-clause will not press it. It deals with an important proposition, the object of which I entirely sympathize with. But I doubt if it would be possible to compress within the limits of the sub-clause, or even a clause, all the powers and provisions that will be necessary to give effect to the honorable member&#39;s purpose. It aims at the very desirable end of, at all events, assisting, with the consent of the Executive of the Commonwealth, each State to carry out its own legislation within itself to a further degree than would otherwise be possible. It need not see its own intentions under its own acts defeated by the overriding power possessed by the Federal Post-office to carry into the State articles which the State laws prohibit. As the honorable member has drawn up this clause, however, he casts upon the PostmasterGeneral the duty of determining what is, within the intention and meaning of any Act of the State, an indecent or obscene book or picture. That is a serious obligation which I think cannot be too lightly undertaken, and the subject is too large to be dealt with in a sub-clause as now proposed. </para>

If a State has on its statute-book a law which enables the Postmaster-General of that State to refuse to pass certain matter through the mails, I think it would be very unfortunate if, by handing over the control of the mails to the Commonwealth, the State should lose the control which the statute gave, and I do not see why we should not pass this sub-clause.

            <para>- I do not see why we should shirk that responsibility. The question is whether this. Parliament can legislate in the direction in which the States have already legislated to protect themselves.&#39; If we cannot, then by handing over the control of the post-offices to the Commonwealth the States will have deprived themselves of one of those elements of administration that are necessary for the enforcement of local laws. If the States are not to have continued to them the  advanctages  they have hitherto possessed, because they have handed over &#39;certain powers to the Commonwealth, they ought to know their position at once. I hope the committee will consider the matter, and that if there is any way of meeting the objections raised we shall have them removed. I cannot consent to withdraw the amendment, as I desire that the committee should take the responsibility of dealing with it. </para>

            <para>- If the amendment had reference only to Acts which had been passed, I should support it. I think we have no right either to diminish the revenue of any State or to interfere with any domestic law in a State, and if a State &#39; has passed a law with a view to prevent the transmission through the Post-office of literature defined to be of an objectionable character, we ought to do nothing which would render that law ineffective. The provisions of this Bill deal with the subject to a certain, extent, and I think the honorable member for Tasmania would be well advised if he altered his amendment so as to make it apply only to Acts passed prior to the Postal department being taken over by the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>- 1 intend to support the amendment. In some of the States certain enactments have been passed providing that newspapers containing particular kinds of advertisements shall be destroyed by the PostmasterGeneral ; and, so far as&#39; South Australia is concerned, the Acts there relating to this matter would be rendered  inoperati  ve, unless protected, as proposed here. I do not think that the provision should be extended to legislation that may be passed in the future, because the State might throw all sorts of duties upon the Federal PostmasterGeneral. If the honorable member makes the sub-clause apply only to the Acts which have already been passed, I will support him. </para>

            <para>- However that may be, I shall take every opportunity of upholding the laws of South Australia, which are directed&#39; to the suppression of a certain class of advertisements. These advertisements will be suppressed in South Australia until this Bill is passed. But when this measure has passed there will be no legislation in force for their suppression. The words have a special meaning in the South Australian statute. I intend, therefore, to support the honorable member, though I believe that he ought to make it clear that the amendment applies only to Acts at present in force. More machinery than appears here requires to be inserted for the carrying out of the provision. </para>

We should have the Postmaster-General attempting to administer the Acts of the different States, although those Acts might vary to a very considerable extent. Itwould be utterly absurd to ask the Postmaster-General to attempt in the slightest degree to administer State laws. Moreover, the States have full power to protect themselves in regard to all publications issued within their own territory. </para>

          <para>- I wish to ask if there is anything in the Constitution that enables my honorable friend to move this amendment with a view to giving the States the power proposed. It seems to me that the amendment is an invasion of the Commonwealth powers and of the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s rights. Under its operation each State could set up and run the Commonwealth under a sort of split division. Tasmania would exercise one power, Western Australia another, and so by-and-by we should have a lot of Postmasters-General. There is thus no telling where the matter will end. For that reason I must vote against the honorable member. </para>

        <para class="block">I would point out that in some States concessions have already been given to certain companies to run railways. Not only have they been allowed to construct telegraph lines for the successful management of those railways, but they have also been permitted to send public telegrams. It is just possible that upon some of the mining fields of Northern Queensland, one or two places like Charters Towers, with a population of 26,000 or 27,000 inhabitants, may spring up, in which case these concessions would become very valuable. The concessions were given merely to enable the companies to facilitate the transaction of their business, and it was never intended that they should undertake the transmission of telegrams for the public. I therefore think that the Postmaster-General should have power to resume such lines if it is  thought desirable so to do. </para>

Instances have arisen in Western Australia, where railways which were constructed by contract were not taken over by the Government till twelve or eighteen months after their completion, during which period the contractors were making very large sums of money. I think that, if a concession of this kind does prove&#39; to be valuable, those who possess it should, when it is taken away from them, be paid reasonable compensation - say 10 per cent, above the cost of construction. </para>

            <para>- Another omission in the amendment is that it ignores the conditions under which these telegraphic or telephonic lines were constructed, inasmuch as the agreements relating thereto contain conditions under which resumption can take place. It would be arbitrary to propose that, the Postmaster-General should be able to ignore the express terms of an agreement in which the power, of resumption is given under certain conditions. </para>

            <para>- In a hurried consultation with the Postal authorities I was informed that they favoured the amendment since it enlarges their powers, although they rather hesitate at the absolute form which it takes.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MCDONALD</inline>(Kennedy).- I would point out that the clause does not say that the Postmaster-General shall take over these lines. I do not think that the Ministry would be foolish enough to authorize the Postmaster-General to take over certain lines contrary to existing agreements. It appears to me that power of resumption should be given, so as to provide for a contingency arising such as I have previously suggested. Sooner or later I believe that the Government will have to come down and deal with the State Acts, to which reference has been made. There are some places where these concessions have been given, which within a few years will have a very considerable population - probably 20,000 or&#39; 30,000 inhabitants. It is not right that any private company should have control of the telephonic or telegraphic communication in such centres. It is a fair thing that if the Government desire to resume such lines, say at 10 per cent, above the cost of construction, they should have the power to do bo. </para>

          <para>- I think that we are all agreed that it is eminently proper that the Commonwealth should have power to resume these means of communication where that is deemed advisable in the public interest. The choice which the honorable member for Kennedy places before us is not between resumption and non-resumption, but between resumption as an executive act, of which Parliament may not be fully informed, and resumption as an act of the Commonwealth Legislature. As a representative of the people, I am very loath to part with the control of Parliament in these matters. If the resumption is an executive act, Parliament will have the choice, not between approval or disapproval of it, but between approval of it and the dismissal of the Ministry for making it, so that, instead of being able to deal directly with the question, we shall be able to deal with it only indirectly. A 50 years&#39; concession of rights such as the honorable member for Kennedy referred to is not a thing which I should have supported if I had been in the House in which it was proposed, but I think that Parliament should have all proposals for resumption definitely before it, and should not allow resumptions to be made without its sanction even by so trusted an Executive as that now in office. </para>

When it is said that we must abide by agreements which have been made, it must be remembered that the State continually breaks agreements by resuming land for public purposes, and even allows private companies to do so. In England railway companies for many years have regularly been given power to take land upon .payment of compensation. </para>

          <para>- For the purpose of private profit, though, no doubt, the public interest is subserved, or otherwise the power would not be given. The honorable and learned member for Corinella objects to the power of resumption being given to the Executive instead of to Parliament,&#34; but if each resumption had to be authorized by special Act, it would be an exceptional and invidious procedure. What we want is a general rule. We are providing now for the regulation of the post and telegraph services of the Commonwealth. Certain companies and individuals - especially in Queenland, where they have done some queer things- have been given special concessions. I understand that in some cases private companies have obtained concessions in- regard to telegraphic and telephonic communication which extend over 50 years. It is not going too far, however, to say that the Postmaster-General may take over those lines on payment of reasonable compensation, if he thinks it necessary to do so in the public interest. It is our duty to recognise contracts within resonable limits, even if they have been wrongly made, but it is not necessary for us to be pedantic in the matter, when there are precedents for compulsory resumption which go back for years. I think that the principle of the amendment should be embodied in the Bill, though I admit that it requires to be moulded into proper shape. That can best be done by the Minister in charge of the Bill. </para>

          <para>- We must recognise rights and concessions which have already been granted, but where it is thought advisable to acquire private property for public purposes, it is the duty of the State to do so, paying at the same time a fair equivalent for it to the persons from whom it is taken. I do not think, however, that we are at present in a position to say what are the terms upon which this should be done under the Bill. The Commonwealth cannot resume a private telegraph or telephone line which never belonged to it. This is not a mere technical difficulty, it is a practical difficulty. One can understand the Postmaster-General saying to a private company - &#34;You shall no longer have the control of your lines. I intend to take them over,&#39; and to pay you compensation for them &#34;; but if he takes over a line he must take land, or right of access, with it. </para>

            <para>- He must take an easement. We must be &#39; more definite than the wording of the clause as drafted, and no final bargain should be made merely by executive act. It has been found in Victoria, and I have no doubt in other parts of Australia also, that when the construction of a railway is contemplated the value of the land through which it will pass is enormously increased. Therefore, I think it would be well, if we give power to the Postmaster-General to give notice of intention to take over a line, to provide that the compensation shall be based upon the value at the date of the giving of that notice, and that it shall be finally agreed upon before the matter is placed before Parliament; and that the PostmasterGeneral should not be allowed to commit the Commonwealth without the sanction of Parliament. The desire of the honorable member for Kennedy is a right one, but his amendment will require very careful drafting for the protection of the interests, not only of private companies, but also of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>- I indorse the view that, where the interests of a private company or. a private individual may be found to clash with those of the general public, they must give way, but, at the same time, we should see that the private company or &#39;private individual whose property is taken for public, purposes obtains fair compensation for it. No new principle is involved in the amendment. Every time that the State resumes land for a railway or any other public purpose  it violates  an existing contract, but it does so in the interests of the public, and the individual suffers no loss, because he receives fair compensation. It appears to. me that if we fail to insert any such provision as this in the Bill, rights may hereafter accrue. Concessions which have been received may become more valuable, and, therefore, this amendment or the principle involved in the amendment, is a proper one. . At the same time, I quite agree with the honorable and learned member for Indi, that the Government, before adopting the amendment should look carefully into it, and so frame it as to meet all the exigencies of the case : and if that be done the committee may very well affirm the principle. </para>

            <para>-  It relates  to land and property : and the measure is drawn in the most general terms. From my recollection of the Bill as it entered the Chamber, I believe it  provides  amply for carrying out the intention of this clause. I am aware that it has been amended in some respects, but I have not undertaken to follow the discussions elsewhere. I cannot say whether its efficiency in this direction has been impaired by amendments, but I think not in any respect. If the principle of this clause, which is a familiar principle, is again indorsed in relation to telegraph and telephone lines, as the honorable member for  Kennedy desires; and if, when we again examine the Bill, which is about to be sent down to us, it is found not to cover the case, we can consider whether such a provision may not be more properly introduced  there than here. If it be not provided for there, it may be as well to leave it in this Bill. It is unnecessary to have a double discussion of the same principle. If the committee, as I understand they do, accept the principle, I will examine the Bill, and consider the best procedure. </para>

            <para>- I do not agree with the honorable member. In the case of a railway considerable risk has to be taken, and a railway may be worked for years without any profit. It would not be just for the Government .to have the option of coining in at any time, and taking the works over for one-tenth more than they cost. Under the Queensland Act the Postal department had the right to buy, after 50 years, under certain conditions, the purchase money to be not more, under any circumstances, than one and one-tenth of the actual cost of construction. The same principle will apply to the case of telegraphs. </para>

That was not a very sound objection as it appeared to me, but, in any case, it does not apply to the new clause. The sole object I have in view is to protect the cable communication, and to do that in a way to which I am sure no one, who is not inclined to be prejudiced against a certain company, can take the slightest objection. The suggestion that the proposal is in favour of any particular company is quite ridiculous, the only object being to protect international cable communication. </para>

            <para>- That is not the present law, and it certainly would not be the law under this Bill as introduced. In the case of an electrical authority being there before the cable company are connected with the Post-office, the cable company would have to protect themselves against induction. That is a different proposal from the amendment submitted last night. It is only fair that a cable, on which we depend so much for getting our messages with as little delay as possible, should be protected where another electrical authority may come in and ruin the cable connexion for a considerable period, unless the metallic return be adopted. </para>

            <para>- I also was compelled to oppose the amendment submitted last night, because it appeared to place a private company in a position of apparent superiority to a State-owned system. Neither a State, nor municipality in a State, which desired to establish electric trams or electric lighting in the neighbourhood of the junction between the cable and the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s office, should be placed in a position of inferiority to a private investment. But I am now compelled to re-echo the remarks of the honorable member, for Melbourne. The proposed new clause is of a very different character from the  amendment of  last night, and maybe regarded without apprehension. The connecting line can only be a short line, and no right is conferred on a private company which is not conferred throughout the Bill upon the Postmaster-General in all cases in which his lines are affected by any more recently constructed work. As I had occasion, in discussing the general question, to point out last evening, this being a telegraph line, it cannot possibly injuriously affect any other line, seeing that it is constructed on the low-current system. But if by any possibility there should be on the shores of South Australia, where this cable will land, any electric trams or system of electric lighting, the utmost burden imposed on the new venture is to either pay the small cost of moving the telegraph line - which might be the cheaper course - or adopting the metallic circuit, or some other device to meet the case. We have consistently throughout the measure provided that the last comer in matters electrical is to be responsible for putting the previously established system to any extra expense. That is not unreasonable, and is all that is proposed. The new clause gives neither the Eastern Extension Company nor the Pacific Cable Company any new rights or privileges, but simply puts this position - that a new company may be put to the expense of rendering their system impervious against leakage or induction from the more powerful systems used for tramways or electric lighting. Under the circumstances, I think the proposal is not an unreasonable one. </para>

          <para>- Last night I opposed an amendment to the same intent, proposed by the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Langdon</inline> Bonython. Apparently the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor,</inline> has modified the proposal then made ; but has the AttorneyGeneral considered the effect in the near future of the Eastern Extension Company opening offices in New South Wales ? Under these circumstances, it will be not only a line connecting the cable with the Post-office, but a  distinct line altogether, running a considerable distance to the company&#39;s own offices. If that point be explained satisfactorily, I may be able to vote for the amendment. The Eastern Extension Cable Company have power in most of the States to open their own offices, and they will have their own lines - which are not limited as to length - connected with the cable end, placed under the same protection as the State lines under the control of the Postmaster-General. </para>

Either the ordinary law permits what I may call the second electrical authority to do the acts contemplated or it does not. If the law permits it to do that act we should not take that right away, because we should take a right away from somebody by imposing obligations for the benefit of any private authority. We have no right to show preferences to any private individual. If the law does not permit that second electrical authority to do the work then the ordinary law can stop them or make them pay the penalty if they act contrary to the law, but why we in this, which is a paramount act, should override the existing rights of all other companies for the sake of one company is more than I can understand, and I say that we should be grossly inconsistent if we, by supporting this amendment, were to reverse the vote which we gave last night. </para>

            <para>- We know that the lines of the Eastern Extension Company are contemplated. I have no objection to that company, but I have just the same regard for any potential company which may come into existence for the .purpose of carrying out any tramway or electric lighting scheme, and for the State tramways and the municipal electric lighting schemes. Each and every one of these authorities have to take their chance under present, circumstances, and if they clash with one another under the law of the State in which they are operating, why should we single out any one for specially considerate treatment? Hie main objections which were urged against the amendment in its original form have not been removed, and I shall certainty oppose it in its present shape. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline>McLEAN (Gippsland).- I voted against the amendment that was proposed last night to achieve the same object as the honorable member for South Australia now has in view, and although I sympathize with the honorable member I have heard no reasons urged that would justify me in reversing the vote I gave last night. If the Bill proposed to take away any of the rights now enjoyed by the cable companies, it would be right and proper to insert some such provision to protect them against any possible injuries, but it is not proposed to subject them to any risks that they do not incur at the present time, and I see no reason why we should go out of our way especially to provide for the protection of certain companies when we refuse to give the same consideration to the States or to any other companies. If we went so far as to do this, in order to be consistent and fair, we should provide that when any electrical authority has constructed a work it should be entitled to compensation from any authority who might interfere with and injure that work. It is not, however, proposed to go so far as that, and therefore I think we should pause before agreeing to the amendment now proposed. </para>

          <para>- The position that was taken up last evening that we cannot give such special protection to any one company as we decline to give to the States, appears to me to be incontestable. No one can set bounds to the purposes to which electricity will be applied, and the Commonwealth Government would do a very great wrong if it created any vested rights in favour of any one company. We do not know how far the interests of the  various  States might be prejudiced by such a provision as that now suggested, and I hope the committee will not waste any further time over this matter, but decide to reject the amendment once and for all. </para>

            <para>- I think it is only just that I should call the attention of thecommittee to the fact that this is not as somehonorable members have put it, an instance of giving to a private company certain rights that we are refusing to the States. None of the States can own telegraph or telephone lines, and no private corporation can be affected except the Eastern Extension Company, the Pacific Cable Company - if that can be considered a private corporation - or any other cable company that may  construct  a cable and land it on our shores. It is only in these instances that we can have connexions made between cable ends and the lines of the PostmasterGeneral. It cannot be said that we are granting to a private company what we arerefusing to a State, because these cablecompanies furnish exceptional instances of which there can never be more than two or three in Australia. The question as. to State rights cannot very well arise. These connexions must be very few and very short. Although the States cannot construct telegraph or telephonelines, they can authorize the carrying out of certain forms of electrical enterprise, but as. has often been pointed out, these enterprisesmust always take the form of using electricity at a higher power than it is used in connexion with telegraph or telephone lines. These enterprises cannot suffer from the telegraph or telephone lines, but the high power works may have an absolutely disastrous effect upon a telegraph lineor cable.  The telegraph lines require protection, because nearly every other form of high electrical power can damage them without damaging itself. The honorable member for South Australia has put his case very clearly, and without over-stating it in the least, lt appears to me that the language of the clause is capable of improvement, and if it be approved by the committee it will be necessary to revise it. It might be rendered perfectly innocuous, if the mover sees no objection to that course, by coupling with it a general power of control by the Postmaster-General. That is to say the Postmaster-General shall approve the length of the line to be deemed a connexion, and shall be the arbitrator in the event of any electrical authority coming into such close proximity with that line as to cause injury. </para>

If I have a shop upon one side of the street for the purpose of selling groceries and a man establishes himself on the opposite side, and also sells groceries, thereby injuring me, I have not the least right to compensation. &#39;It is for the State law to deal between the Eastern Extension Company - where its cable touches its shores - and other companies. Let us suppose that a State law enacts that it is perfectly lawful for a traction company to lay down its lines in a certain place. If by laying those lines in that place the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s lines are interfered with, thereby involving that company in a little expense, that is a matter between the traction company and the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. Surely it is not for the Federal Parliament to interfere and to give the same lights to the Eastern Extension Company as it gives to its PostmasterGeneral.

The question, as I understand it, is that the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s cable ought not be regarded as a private concern at all. The public has a very great interest in it. Next to the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s own lines, if there is anything that we should protect it is the shore end of that cable system. In the proposal before the committee we are trying to prevent a private company from doing injury to a line in&#39; which the public are very greatly concerned at the present time. We merely ask that if a company does injure that line they shall be bound to pay compensation to the extent of the injury. The honorable member for Kooyong put the position very clearly.

          <para>- I look at this matter from a Commonwealth stand-point. It is merely an accident that this cable lands in South Australia instead of one of the more populous States of New South Wales or Victoria. We all benefit by the cable running from South Australia, and it is not a very big concession which is asked for. South Australia merely asks the Commonwealth to protect a little piece of land line from being spoiled by a company which is likely to start there with electric traction. They do not ask for any special legislation on the matter, but merely for a little protection. By all means let us extend to South Australia a littleVictorian protection on this particular occasion. I hope that the clause will be carried. </para>

          <para>- That does not leave us very much to complain of, I admit, but there is still the question between the Postmaster-General and the electrical authority concerned. Is it fair that the Postmaster-General should be made the arbitrator in a matter of this sort? We are not merely dealing with the South Australian end of the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s cable, but with other cable ends also. For example, there is a cable end which comes into Queensland from New Caledonia. I have a decided objection to giving special privileges to a company like that, which is entirely a foreign company, and which has overreached various Governments to an extent to which it ought never to have been allowed to do. In New South Wales we have to pay this foreign company &#163;2,000 a year for 30 years for a line over which we have not the slightest control, and which produces practically no revenue at all. </para>

            <para>- We get no news over it of a public character. It is used only by a few merchants. I really think we ought to allow the matter to rest upon its merits. Both these cable companies will still have their tights, and if any other company injures them, they will be able to protect themselves. The Eastern Extension Cable Company is sufficiently rich to be able to look af ter itself, if we continue to give it the opportunity of so doing. But if we buttress it up by giving it special concessions, it will continue to ask for them. </para>

          <para>- I quite agree with what has been said against this clause, and the reason I am going to support it is this : We have, I think illogically and wrongly, given to the Government certain rights. We have put the PostmasterGeneral in a preferential position, and, since we have done that, it is only right, if we want to be consistent, that we should allow something like the same protection to the portion of the line that connects the Government&#39; system with the cable. We can only regard the cable as a matter of convenience and utility. </para>

            <para>- I do not know what further extension the honorable member refers to. I am looking at this cable as a convenience to the Postmaster - General, because it connects his system with the outside world. We have given the PostmasterGeneral certain rights, and to be consistent we should grant the same rights to the Eastern Extension Company. If the question was whether the PostmasterGeneral should have these rights, my vote would bo against it, and then if this proposal were made I would vote against it also. </para>

          <para>- I would like to ask the Attorney-General if he would consider the matter which was raised on the clause in regard to the Indecent Advertisements Acts. Although there was a very strong chorus of disapproval negativing the proposal which was made, I understand it was not so much directed against the principle as the manner in which it was attempted to be carried out. I suggest to the Attorney - General that he might be able to insert a definition in this Bill which would cover the definitions in the Acts of Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, and other States which have adopted this legislation. A portion of the provisions of those Acts will be inoperative, unless the Post-office can be used as it has been used for the purpose of preventing indecent publications coming into the States from abroad. If the Attorney-General accepts the suggestion, he can introduce into the Bill a provision which will cover the definitions already in the State Acts, such as that &#34;indecent&#34; shall mean what is understood by the common law of England, or what it is interpreted to mean by any such Act. I hope the Attorney-General will seriously weigh the matter, which is one of considerable importance. </para>
