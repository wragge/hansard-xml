            <para>- Seeing that there are a number of motions on the business paper for the production of statistical returns,I should like to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs if he will be good enough to have a compilation made of all obtainable information bearing upon the Tariff question, bringing the statistics as nearly upto date as possible. The statistics which we are using at the present time are the statistics for the year 1899, so that they are almost two years behind time. I think that such a compilation as I ask for would aid honorable members very much in preparing for the consideration of the Treasurer&#39;s Budget speech. </para>

            <para>- There is no doubt that the State statistics upon which we are depending at the present time are somewhat in arrears ; but the Government have been in communication with the State Governments with a view to expediting the preparation of later statistics. The Government fully recognise that it is highly desirable that, in dealing with the Tariff, honorable members should have before them all the available statistical information which can be of use to them, and to that end we have had certain statistics collated. I notice that motions are to be moved by various honorable members for the production of statistical returns, and the Government will be very glad if other honorable -members who may be thinking of moving similar motions will indicate as soon as possible what they require. Our desire is to supply all the available information at the earliest date possible, and any suggestion which will help us will receive our most favorable consideration. </para>

        <para class="block">I would like to explain why I have ventured to assumethe responsibility of asking the House to consider this motion. Immediately after the Commonwealth elections I wrote to the head of the denomination with which I am associated, the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, asking that body if any steps were being taken unitedly by the churches to secure consideration by Parliament of the need of opening its proceedings by the reading of prayers. I found that the Council ofthe Churches was taking the necessary action, and subsequently I was invited bythe churches to move a motion. That I felt an honour and a privilege, to which I readily assented, and accordingly I gave notice of this motion. I felt that this action might have been properly provided for in the standing orders, but I found that the Government preferred that it should receive a distinct instruction from the House, and I am hopeful that </para>

          <para>The Council of Churches in Victoria, deeply impressed with the propriety and necessity of a national recognition of our dependence upon the blessing ofAlmighty God in our prosperity, desires respectfully to urge upon the members of both Houses of the Federal Parliament that the sittings should be regularly opened with a suitable form of prayer. To show the practical unanimity with which this desire is expressed, we subjoin communications on the subject from representatives of the different churches, and indulge the hope that you will give the matter your most favorable consideration. In making this request, we would deprecate any thought of dictation, our motive being entirely to afford information to our legislators as to the feeling and desire of the Christian public on this question. </para>

            <para>- Although the practice is not uniform in the States, I would venture to claim that we ought to look to a wider area of national interest in other great Federations of the world. We might look to the mother of Parliaments, where, honorable members are aware, prayers are read in the House of Commons and in the House of Lords. Prayers are also read in each House of the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada. I may refer to a parallel case with ours. In the United States of America, a prayer is read in the House of  Representatives  and in the Senate. In those cases the chaplain reads the prayer; but I am one of those who believe that it will be better that the prayer, if honorable members approve of the motion, should be read by the  Speaker,  not by any denominational or sectarian representative. I wish to mention that an offer came from the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> incumbent of St. Peter&#39;s Episcopal Church, undertaking to read the prayer daily; but I replied expressing my own individual opinion as I have expressed it to-day. The form of prayer should be entirely unsectarian in character, and refer only to the fundamental truths acknowledged and professed by all Christian people. I believe that no prayer will have more universal acceptance than the Lord&#39;s Prayer. What I am anxious to secure is a day by day acknowledgment of our dependence on Almighty God. In our Commonwealth Constitution Act that recognition is recited in noble and memorable words, and at the opening of the Parliament hopeful prayers for Divine assistance were read. I am sure that those prayers found a ready echo through the length and breadth of this Commonwealth, and through the other civilized countries who watched the birth of our nation. I am persuaded that the sense of the vast majority of the people of Australia will be in favour of the step which the motion proposes, and its acceptance by honorable members will be hailed with general satisfaction. This is a subject upon which every honorable member, will have already made up his mind, and I am disposed to believe, from the conversations which I have had with several honorable members on the subject, that it -will be sanctioned by the majority of the House. I earnestly hope that it will have the unanimous approval of honorable members. As delivered by yourself, sir, I am sure that every honorable member is satisfied that the prayer will be read with reverence and propriety. Speaking from my experience of the Legislative Council of Victoria, I can say that the prayer read there at the opening of every sitting was always joined in by all honorable members with fitting decorum and with full attendance. I sincerely confess that I possess no appropriate fitness for the responsible position of submitting this motion to the House. On the contrary, I have a profound sense of my own inefficiency, and the need for Divine guidance in this and the other responsible work which is before me. But in the fullest sense I express the earnest hope that the resolution may find unanimous acceptance, in order that we may, with due reverence, acknowledge the sovereignty of the Almighty, and our dependence upon  Him for guidance in our legislation to the end that it may be wise and liberal legislation, for the good of the whole people, for the advancement and prosperity of humanity, and for the cementing together of the brotherhood of the. people of this Commonwealth in fullest loyalty to our King and in fullest loyalty to&#39; our God. </para>

          <para>- I have very much pleasure in seconding the motion which has been so eloquently and effectively proposed by the honorable member for Kooyong. At the same time, I can quite appreciate the motives of the opponents as well as  the supporters df a proposal like this. It seems to me that the supporters of the motion think that the manifestation upon a suitable occasion, of the faith which most of us profess in one form or another, at least once a week, should, as coming from a great representative body, not only have a salutary influence upon - the daily relations of the members themselves, but be an example to the rising generation whose destinies to an extent we are engaged in moulding. They think that, as on some minor occasions of life, we should solicit the descent of &#34; prevenient grace,&#34; and seek regeneration by prayer, a submission to the will of Providence, and an appeal for guidance to  His  omniscience, should be regarded as an appropriate preface to our daily gropings  for light. On the other hand, there are some who, taking a less ideal view of the occasion, think it should be regarded as a purely business one; that the silent prayer of the heart, which is open to all who wish to offer it, might, as the more voluntary, probably prove the more efficacious, and that custom too often tends to lower what should be a fervent aspiration into a cold formality. But, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> we must take human nature as it is, with its many imperfections; we must deal with ourselves as men, liable,&#39; if left alone, to be remiss or to forget - men who require the reminder of some recurring occasion, or the stimulating sense of community of purpose, to keep them to the regular discharge of their higher obligations. As to the possibility of a prayer becoming a mere lifeless formality, the remedy is with ourselves. We can scarcely refuse to do good because we may possibly be tempted to do evil, or make the possibility of a subsequent fall an obstacle to an attempt to rise. A form of prayer such as the Lord&#39;s Prayer in the revised version, as published by the University of Oxford, would be one in which all worshippers, whatever may be our differences in the non-essentials of form and method, could readily join, and we may possibly take from its spirit, and the feeling of unity of ultimate aim induced by its repetition in common, a larger measureof charity and of mutual toleration. It may possibly be that many a man, whose faith may be somewhat delicate, may remember, that even the ignorant pagan, &#39; who was unable to give form to the object of his hopes, still worshipped where he could not fathom; for on the statue of the Egyptian Isis were inscribed the words - &#34; I am whatever is, whatever was, whatever shall be, and mortal never yet has raised the veil that covers me.&#34; </para>

            <para>-Then how are we to reach the subject <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I suppose all of us have been taught to cherish a deep-seated reverence for prayer, but should we retain that reverence if in this House we saw a Speaker with whom we had been on the &#34; spree &#34; the night before, praying for us when we ought to be praying for him ? This is a question that is going to affect our future standing as a House. If we are prepared to have this House opened with prayer we certainly ought to be prepared to have a chaplain, and pay him like honest men, and not do it on the cheap. That is the position I take. In the United States they open the House with prayer, but there is a paid chaplain connected with Parliament, and known as the Chaplain of the House. In England, there is a paid chaplain, but there is a recognised State church in England, while there is no recognised State church here, and there is nothing in the Constitution which says that we should have a chaplain, or that we should open the proceedings with prayer I would like to ask the legal members of the House whether it would be really constitutional to have a chaplain and open the House with prayer. If we encroach on the Constitution, may it not be the first breach of which advantage may be taken in future to destroy the liberties of the people? I am thoroughly willing to have the House opened with prayer. I do not give second place to any man in the House in my reverence for prayer and for religion ; but I do hope the House will not lend itself to becoming a part of the whole system of veiled hypocrisy which prevails throughout the world. </para>

            <para>- On the point of order raised by the honorable member for Kennedy, I may call the attention of honorable members to the fact that this motion is simply a recommendation to the Standing Orders Committee. It will be necessary before the Standing Orders Committee can make any definite provision that some appropriation should be arranged for, but there is no objection whatever on that ground to the motion proceeding in its present form. As to the point raised by the honorable member for South Sydney, it would be quite competent for the House at a later stage to make a further amendment. </para>

            <para>- I am not going to move any such amendment ; there is, therefore, no cause for alarm. The amendment which has been put from the Chair precludes me from doing so if I wished, and I had grave doubts whether I should do so at any time. I am not about to oppose the motion, and, so far as the members of the Government are concerned, I am quite sure - and honorable members will agree with me - this ought not to be made a Cabinet question. Therefore, if there are any differences of opinion in the Cabinet on the subject - as to which I have not consulted my colleagues - there will be none the less friendship between its &#39; members. Although 1 do not oppose the motion, I have my doubts whether ordinances of this kind do really tend to the improvement of morality and the inculcation of piety. I have my doubts whether, apart from those prayers we say in church, we should not adopt the advice which is given by a very high teacher, who told us to pray in our closet. I recognise, however, that there are very large differences of opinion on the subject. I know that a large number of those who have their doubts as to the propriety of these ordinances are not so offended in their religious susceptibilities if they are carried out, as those would be who demand that ordinances of this kind should be observed if their wishes were not complied with. That being so, I am inclined to give way to the course which is least offensive to the religious susceptibilities of the public, and, therefore, to assent to a proposition of this kind. But I do hope this House, will not ask for the appointment of a chaplain. </para>

            <para>- I think members generally approved of the course which was taken at the opening of the Federal Parliament, in the reading of the prayers by  His Excellency  the Governor-General and in  His Excellency&#39;  s swearing in the members of Parliament. That course was taken in order that there might be no religious quarrel on the subject. To appoint a chaplain of any denomination, unless we are so eminently successful as to find a religious chaplain of no denomination, would only go to feed those religious quarrels of which we have had more than enough in the country which ought to have the least of them - Australia. I therefore hope, quite irrespective of the question of salary which the honorable member for Kennedy has raised, that there will be no thought of appointing a chaplain, and that the prayer read will be purely unsectarian, and one acceptable to the feelings and wishes of members of every denomination in the community as well as to honorable members in this House. I believe in the suggestion contained in the amendment, that the prayer should be the Lord&#39;s prayer - nothing more and nothing less - a prayer which can be accepted by the Unitarian, and which contains no request of the Almighty which a member of the Hebrew faith could not readily accept. A  prayer which is of the broadest, which for that reason appeals in the strongest degree to our common feeling of humanity and our common reverence for our Maker, is the kind of prayer which should be adopted ; and I hope no other prayer will be thought of by the Standing Orders Committee. For. myself, I shall vote for the motion without the amendment. </para>

          <para>- I follow the Prime Minister in his view, that this is neither a party question nor a Cabinet question, but one upon which every honorable member must vote according to his own conscience. If we can gather anything from the speech of the mover of the resolution, this matter has not been a, question of to-day. A movement has been going on for some time in order to bring about this result. I should have had more hesitation in coming to a decision on this question if it had not been the consequence or- corollary of a movement which was initiated during the sittings of the Federal Convention. Honorable members will recollect that it was the great.desire of a large body of our .fellow citizens - if not an overwhelming majority - that there should be some recognition of Almighty God in the Constitution.

          <para>- I hope khat the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Malley,</inline> will not press the amendment. Coming from Queensland, I may say that in the first session of Parliament, which was held there in 1860, a motion was moved by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Jordan, a Nonconformist, that the proceedings of Parliament should be opened by prayer. The prayer suggested then was a prayer for the High Court of Parliament, adapted to the position of the State Parliament of Queensland. That prayer has been read by the  Speaker  of the Legislative Assembly and by the  President  of the Legislative Council from that time up to the present, and has met with universal concurrence. Of course we are .aware that no two minds are constituted alike, and that every man has his own opinions with regard to religious matters. In the Parliament of Queensland there are some honorable members with peculiar ideas on the subject, and if they have any objection to the course taken by Parliament, they generally walk outside the Bar of the House whilst the prayer is being read, so that the religious susceptibilities of honorable members are not in any way offended. I agree with what has been suggested by the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Malley,</inline> that the Lord&#39;s prayer would be an appropriate one with which to open the proceedings of the House. It embraces no religious dogma. It is, as the Prime Minister has observed, one which appeals to the common humanity of all of us. </para>

            <para>- It is socialistic, and  was drafted  by  the greatest  social reformer that the world has ever known.  My principle  reason in rising was to ask the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Malley,</inline> not to press the amendment for the appointment of a paid chaplain. I am aware that the  Speaker  of the House of Commons appoints his own chaplain, and that the chaplain continues in office during the Speaker&#39;s term. But in England there is a recognised State Church, and a State clergyman is therefore appointed. But the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Malley,</inline> must also know that the very fact that a chaplain is so appointed has given very great offence to other denominations, and seeing that we have no recognised -State religion we ought not to follow in the footsteps of the mother country. I have sufficient confidence in the people of the Commonwealth, and in their choice of representatives, to believe that the gentleman whom they elect as their  Speaker  will always be a fit and proper person to read the Lord&#39;s prayer. </para>

That would be very much better than dictating in the resolution the special form of prayer known as The Lord&#39;s Prayer. Personally, from my standpoint, I can see no objection to The Lord&#39;s Praye r whatever, but at the same time we must consider the view of others who may have a different opinion. I think that the prayer should be such as would be unobjectionable to all sections of the community.

          <para>- I think this may be an opportune time for asking the Government in what way they intend to compile their statistics. There is a State statistician in each of the States, and in these matters of manufactures there has always been a difficulty in tabulating the information according to the particular busi ness, which may be called a manufactory. A great deal of these statistics, as a matter of comparison, depend for their value upon their method of compilation, and it would be of great advantage if there were some agreement among the statisticians of the different States as to the basis of these compilations, so that when we made use of them for the sake of argument we would know exactly that they were all compiled on the same basis. I think the information for which the honorable member&#39; asks, like a great many other things in the way of statistics, will be very necessary for the intelligent discussion of the Tariff question when it comes up; but all statistics depend for their value on their reliability. </para>

          <para>- I think it would be well to amend paragraph No. 5 by including the schedule of exemptions from duty, because we encourage our various industries by exempting a very large quantity of raw material. Unless that is included, the object the honorable member has in view is only partly secured. I submit that the exemptions from duty, as scheduled in the various Customs Acts of the States, is of as much importance as the difference between the rates of duty and excise. I intend to move - </para>

          <para>- It strikes me that in the form in which this motion stands it will not be of very much use. The return is to be compiled from the latest available statistics, whatever they are. That is a difficulty in itself, because the latest statistics available do not cover the ground we desire. I am sure we have all experienced very considerable difficulty recently in obtaining from statistics the information we require. To be of any use to us this information must be obtained, as it seems to me, from sources extending over a wider -area than the available statistics. Then there is another consideration. The motion refers to the average number of persons&#39; employed, and the average wages paid. For what period of time is this average to be calculated ? </para>

            <para>- But the motion does not say so. It is so indefinite that it cannot be worked out. Some information should also be obtained as to the minimum wage paid in each industry to adults and children respectively. This is necessary, because when the matter comes to be investigated we willfind that at the root of many of the troubles we are considering is the question of the minimum wage.

          <para>- In seconding the amendment, I desire to say that I agree with the honorable member for Indi, when he states thatit it will be exceedingly difficult to collect these statistics on a satisfactory basis. For instance, on the question of wages I find that some firms include the wages paid to managers and foremen, who receive perhaps &#163;10, &#163;8, or &#163;6 per week. By that means they bring up the average very considerably. Others exclude the salaries of such employes. To get at the correct figures it will be necessary to obtain the ages and the average paid in the respective divisions of labour. Unless we have uniformity the return will be of very little value. </para>

          <para>- I would draw the attention of the mover of this motion to the fact that the information which he asks for in division either cannot be given or will be given in such a form as will -be quite misleading to the House. It refers to &#34;the rate of customs or excise duty by which the several industries are at present protected in each of the States.&#34; I suppose that what is desired to be arrived at is what are the duties on the articles produced by each of the industries in each State, but the motion will not achieve that result. How can statisticians say, for instance, what are the ingredients of the articles produced by some of these industries? How can they say what is the duty, or by how much a particular article produced by a certain factory is protected? They cannot go into these details, and yet to comply with the motion they will have to do so or else to furnish a misleading return. The only thing that should be asked for is the customs and excise duties, or the customs or excise duties in each of the States on the article manufactured therein. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline>H. GROOM (Darling Downs).To my mind the amendment of the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> Fysh, is more valuable than the suggestion of the honorable member for North Sydney. From the  discussion to which we have listened it would appear that only the States of Victoria and New South Wales are concerned in this matter ; we have not heard a word about the other States. Now, in Queensland we have adopted a policy of our own, which is quite distinct from that of any of the other States; a policy which we think is beneficial to our interests, and which, by establishing our industries, has given employment to. hundreds and thousands of our population. Under this policy we remitted, in 1896, &#163;50,000 worth of duties, chiefly duties on raw material. If the motion is not amended as the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> Fysh, has proposed, there will not be a word about this exemption in the return which is being moved for. I have some knowledge of the difficulty of collecting these returns, and I know that in the State of Queensland alone a great many supernumerary clerks will have to be appointed to undertake the, work of obtaining this information, because they are now preparing for the meeting of the State Parliament, and if the honorable member thinks that the return will be ready in time to enable this House to use the information in connexion with the discussion on the proposed Tariffs, he will be very much disappointed. If the House had been sitting in January last, and the honorable member had moved for the information then, the return would probably be nearing completion now, and we might have hoped to obtain the information by the end of June or the beginning of J lily ; but, under present circumstances, I think that a great deal of the information which is being asked for will not reach us before the end of November, by which time I hope the Tariff question will be pretty well settled. In my opinion the amendment of the honorable member for Tasmania <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Philip Fysh)</inline> meets the difficulty which the honorable member for North Sydney has suggested, far better than his own proposition does, and I hope that the honorable member for Kooyong will accept it. </para>

If he seeks to show the extent to which the various industries of the States are protected by the exemption of the raw products imported for use in their manufacture, that information should be asked for by adding another paragraph to the motion - &#34;The extent to which the exemptions of duty protect the several industries in the State.&#34; The object of the amendment is, I assume, to show the extent to which our manufactures are protected by the admission of raw products duty free.

          <para>- I had no intention of interfering with this motion ; but, as it seems to me to have developed into an attempt to obtain information which will assist various fiscal doctrines, and as I observe that a number of honorable members are endeavouring to cast the motion in such a form that the facts elicited will be such as they can hereafter use for the purpose of showing us that what they have told us before was true, I propose to add a sixth paragraph to deal with the difference of opinion which has for many years existed between the statisticians of the different colonies. For many years it was the practice of politicians to refer to the number of manufactories in the various States. We used to hear from the Victorian protectionists that the New South Wales freetraders were including every blacksmith&#39;s shop under the head of a manufactory. Statisticians got over that difficulty by ascertaining what the horse-power of the different manufactories was. I propose to insert a sixth heading giving the horse-power of the manufactories in existence in the respective States. That will give us some idea of the difference between a blacksmith&#39;s shop and a  manufactory, which probably gives occupation to 100 or 500 persons. I move - </para>

          <para>- I thinkthat if we want to make this return complete, we need not go any further than has been proposed. A return showing the number of factories will not be correct unless it starts on a proper basis  - unless  it shows the number of hands. If I read this motion aright, it does not in any way stipulate as to what shall constitute a factory. If in one State, one man constitutes a factory, and if in another State four is the minimum number, honorable members can see how delusive the return will be for comparative purposes. I would suggest that this further sub-section be added -  &#34;A nd the minimum number of employes which constitutes a factory in each State be stated.&#34; </para>

Surely an appeal from the Minister for Trade and Customs to the various States would elicit data far more reliable and uniform than any data based on factory statistics. We all agree that the present system is unsatisfactory. It is not a bit of use compiling the return unless, so far as different States are concerned, it is prepared on the same basis. I would suggest to whoever may compile the information that he should, as far as possible, rely on the census. </para>

          <para>- I rise to second the amendment. Unless we get reliable information the whole return will be practically valueless. If we get an assurance from the Minister for Customs that the statistics will be arranged on a uni form basis so that they will be really com parable, it will be satisfactory to the House But if the statistics are to be compiled just as the ordinary statistics are compiled in each State we shall be no further forward than we are by comparing the records of the State statisticians. What we want is to get something which will be really reliable, and based on figures and facts which are compiled in an exactly similar way in each State. If we get that assurance, together with certain specific orders, I think that the information will be of use and will be reliable ; without it it will not. </para>

            <para>- I am not raising an objection, but I want to point this out in case there may be any more amendments. Without naming a day for the introduction of the Tariff - which is a secret so momentous that I am sure I shall not be expected to disclose it - I think I may say that the return to this motion may run a very close, or almost neck and neck, race with the Tariff, and will be last if we have much more added to the motion in the way of research. There is so much to be done under the various heads, so much information to be collected, especially by a Commonwealth which has not yet had time to turn round or  look about for a statistician even, which has so many Acts of Parliament to pass before it can take up the Tariff, notwithstanding its eagerness to deal with that question, and it means to deal with it this session - that the position is a difficult one. If with all the work we have on hand we have to make researches of the most laborious character, with the help only of the statistical departments of the various States, which differ in the basis on which they collect their statistics, he would be a fortunate man indeed who could get the information which has already been asked for, before the Tariff is brought in. That is the point I want to emphasize. We shall do all we can to prepare this return in time. We shall not play with it.. We shall endeavour to get it and have it in the hands of honorable members. But if it happens that the task is one which cannot be performed in time for the introduction of the Tariff, I want to throw out this note of warning, we shall not hold ourselves responsible At the same time wo shall do everything we can. to meet the views of honorable members. </para>

          <para>- I beg to second the motion. I think we should affirm the principle, at the outset, that at least one day&#39;s rest in seven shall be given to every employe of the Commonwealth. A practice has grown up in Victoria, at any rate - and here I speak of a State about which I know something- of employingmen continuously on Sunday labour. They arc not paid extra wages for this work, but they are occasionally given time off. This is a practice which should be deprecated. If Sunday labour is necessary - and I would have as little of it as possible - the men whodo it should receive extra pay; and under all circumstances every man should have one clay off in seven. That means that in place of working some men at high pressure, a greater number of men will be employed. For these reasons, I am strongly in favour of the motion, and I hope it will commend itself to the judgment of the Ministry and the House. </para>

          <para>. - I am in sympathy with theobject of this motion, and so also, I am sure, are my colleagues in the Government ; but whether it will be desirable to affirm it in its present form,may be another question. I take it that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports does not insist that the one day&#39;s rest for employes shall always be on the same day of the week ? </para>

But there cannot bea time fixed within which the Government must make an alteration of so drastic a diameter.

I merely wish to say, further, that members on this side ofthe House, as well as myself, are undoubtedly in favour of the motion. We think it eminently a reasonable proposal that Government employes should have at least one day&#39;s rest in every seven, and I hope it will be carried out as soon as possible. I am quite sure that the motion will be supported quite as cordially on this side as on the other side of the House. </para>

The honorable member desires information as to the quarititiesof the articles mentioned on which duties are paidin each State, the actual mean of such quantities per head of population, and what a uniform Tariff would yield on the actual mean. </para>

          <para class="block">I have altered the motion slightly from its original form, for the sufficient reason that . it would have entailed much more work than will be necessary if the House agrees to the motion in its present form. My object is to follow on the lines of the Public Service Bill which has just been introduced, and in which civil servants have been classified in four divisions under the headings of special, professional,clerical, and non-clerical. The motion will enable us to get the return asked for in time to discuss it in connexion with the Public Service Bill. To-day the honorable member for Tasmania <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. O&#39;Malley)</inline> asked a question for the purpose of eliciting certain information. Numbers of honorable members no doubt have been plagued and pestered as to the rates of salary to be paid. The Government&#39; doubtless have had the information prepared for themselves, otherwise I do not understand how they could have arrived at any specific salary to be paid throughout the Commonwealth.I only ask that honorable members shall be placed in possession of the same information as the Government must have obtained for themselves in connexion with the Public Service Bill. </para>

          <para>Thisis the ordinary formal motion, and I wish to limit it to the Standing Orders Committee, the Library Committee, and the House Committee The Printing Committee in the Senatehas not the authority to confer.

          <para>- The second reading  of  those Bills will not be moved until copies have been distributed. I may tell the honorable member that it is  necessary  to get Supply as soon as possible, and I believe that the Supply Bill will be ready to be gone on with on Tuesday. If Supply is speedily granted, then the Minister for Home Affairs will move the second reading of the Public Service Bill. In the meantime the other Bills will be put in circulation as rapidly as possible. </para>
