                    <para>. - I stated to the committee last night that I would draft an amendment to meet the objection taken to that portion of the second sub-clause which refers to the allowance or disallowance of rates aud charges. The objection was urged that the clause did not make it sufficiently clear that the veto of one House would be sufficient to prevent, in whole or in part, rates and charges laid upon the table under Executive authority from taking effect. A further objection was raised that from the present form of the clause it might he thought that a veto of portion of the schedule of rates would be as effective as a veto of the whole. I think I have met both objections in the amendment which I drafted last night, and with regard to which I have since had an opportunity of conferring with the parliamentary draftsman. I think it is wise to adhere to the principle of the clause, and to modify its application. I therefore propose to move - </para>

                    <para>- Whilst I admit that the Prime Minister has improved the clause considerably by the proposed alteration, I regret to say that the amendment does not touch the main point which was objected to last evening. I sincerely hope that the Government will give consideration to this matter. I have been 22 years in Parliament, and this is the most serious encroachment upon the rights of the people that has ever come under my notice. We should remember that the privilege of controlling the revenue of the Commonwealth is the most important and the most precious privilege that we possess.. That privilege does not belong exclusively to Parliament,, but to the people who sent honorable members here. We may be here to-day and gone&#62; to-morrow, and the right to control the revenue; of the Commonwealth should remain with the people. The Government proposal is to take away from the people the right to control the revenue, and to hand it over to the Cabinet of the day. Then, unless Parliament disallows the rates proposed - which: can only be done in the form of . a want of: confidence motion - they become law without the representatives of the great bulk o&#163;: the people having a voice in the matter.Prom my past knowledge of the Attorney-General I cannot think that he concurs in the proposal to legislate on a most important question behind the back of Parliament, or,, by giving Parliament an opportunity to dealt with it only in a most objectionable way,, namely, by a motion of censure upon the Government. I hope that the Government;&#39; will give further consideration to this matter, which is certainly a most serious one. I could not under any conceivable conditions vote for their proposal, and in this respect a very large proportion of the.committee, if not a great majority, willi&#39; share my feelings. I am sure that if the Government had given the matter the consideration which its importance merits they would never have made such a proposal.. During the present .session some honorable! members, including myself, were placed in: a most disagreeable position by a motion almost similar to that which would have to be moved in order to prevent any schedule of rates under this Bill from becoming law. I refer to the time when a motion was submitted condemning certain appointments.. A great majority of the House approved of that motion, but some of us felt that we.could not express that disapproval without creating a political crisis, which we deemed most undesirable. I, for one, voted&#39; against my own conviction&#39;s,, because I thought I was voting for the lesser of two evils. I hope that there will be &#62; no attempt to put honorable members in that . position in the future. Moreover, Parliament&#34;, could not deal with this matter in an intelligent manner in the way proposed.. Even an extension of the period prescribed.! to 42 days would not-overcome the difficulty presented. I think that the business paper is taken up upon Fridays for eight or ten. weeks ahead. How could any honorable member get a motion discussed in that. time <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Such a motion would be placed at the bottom of the business paper for that day, and past experience shows that we have never been able to deal with one subject, much less with a number. Without a no-confidence motion it would be impossible for Parliament to secure an opportunity of dealing with it; and even if we did it would be dealt with in a most perfunctory manner. An important matter of this kind, affecting &#163;300,000 or &#163;400,000 of the revenue, should be dealt with by a Bill, when Parliament would have an opportunity of considering amendments and of hearing the reasons which induced the change. Another objection is that almost every Government of the Commonwealth will consist exclusively of city men. In Victoria, we had for years an agitation for the adoption of the penny post in the cities, but the country districts opposed it because they felt that it would mean the denial of postal facilities to them. They preferred to pay the higher rate rather than be deprived of postal facilities altogether. If the metropolitan constituencies brought pressure to bear upon the Government, the representatives of the country districts would practically be deprived of any opportunity of dealing with this matter, except in the form of a no confidence motion. As there is only one day a week devoted to the transaction of private members&#39; business, -we know that that day will, within a very short period of the opening of Parliament, be monopolized, if not for the whole of the session, at any rate for the greater portion of it. If such regulations were laid upon the table within three or four weeks of the closing of Parliament, is Parliament to be kept in session during the time which must necessarily elapse before a motion could be brought before the House? I should like to know the reason why the Government desire to take away from Parliament the right of controlling the revenues of the Commonwealth. To tell us that this proposal does not involve taxation is an insult to our judgment. If a deficit of &#163;300,000 or &#163;400,000 be created in the revenue of the Postal department, do honorable members not think that an equal amount of taxation will be necessary in some other direction in order to make up the deficiency? I ask the Prime Minister in all friendliness - and I think he knows that my only desire is to help the Government, and to make this Bill as perfect as possible - to reconsider this matter. Is there any honorable member who told his constituents on the hustings that it was his intention to deprive them of any voice in the control of the revenue, or that he intended to delegate the powers which properly belong to them to some seven members of the Commonwealth Parliament? </para>

This proposal is an encroachment upon the rights of the people, which should not be tolerated for a single moment.

                    <para>- I have listened with great interest to the remarks of the honorable member for Gippsland, in which I think every honorable member will concur. I join with him in asking the Government to reconsider their position. In a matter of this kind no party interest is involved, and while the Government must retain a hold of their own business, it is still their duty to gauge the feeling of the committee, and up to the present there has not been a single honorable member who has differed from the view expressed by the last speaker. There are two points which cover the whole question, and one is to a large extent the complement of the other. In the first place - &#34; Is this a sufficiently important matter for Parliament to discuss &#34;? If it is, and if it involves the possible taxation of the people of the country, surely before the Government attempt to formulate a scheme they should bring the matter before Parliament, get a deliberate expression of opinion upon it, and explain the reasons which induced them to submit their proposals. But under the scheme of the Government, as embodied in this clause, there is no explanation. The whole thing is decided <inline font-style="italic">in camera.</inline> Neither the public press, nor the Parliament, nor any one else will know anything about the matter. The schedule will be placed as a sort of dead document upon the table of the House. Recognising the drastic process which this Bill has undergone in another place, I think there are only two or &#34;three points which require very close consideration. We do not want to lose time over it, and I think that the Prime Minister might intimate to the House that, in view of the general feeling - without any division at all - these matters will be dealt with by Act of Parliament, and not by Executive minute. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to join with those honorable members who have pressed the view that the question of. rates for the carriage of letters and telegrams ought to be dealt with by Act of Parliament, and not by regulation. Regulations, as we understand them, ought to be confined to mere matters of procedure, and not to matters involving taxation, either direct or indirect. The rates for the carriage of letters, newspapers, telegrams, and cables especially, may involve very important questions of policy. For instance, it has already been mentioned that the question of the price to be imposed for the carriage of newspapers will shortly have to be decided as a federal question. I should like to know whether that very important question is to be decided by the Cabinet as an Executive act. I contend that it ought to be determined as a matter of legislation, to&#39; be thrashed out in Parliament. I cannot conceive that any Ministry would take the responsibility of dealing with so important a question merely as a matter of administration, without consulting the Legislature. There may be urgent matters which should be dealt with by Executive regulation, but questions involving the placing of burdens on the people ought to be dealt with by Act of Parliament. I therefore join with those who have already pressed on the Ministry the desirability of reconsidering this clause. It is evident that it has not been reconsidered by the Government, because the Prime Minister has not come down prepared to make any statement, although, I understand, that last night he promised to do so. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BARTON</inline>(Hunter- Minister ,for External Affairs). - I did not give any promise to make a statement upon this&#39; subject. I made a statement last night which I thought put forward fully the position taken up by the Government in regard to this question. I said, however, that there was other legislation which was germain to this matter, and which ought to be considered, and I promised to mention it. Provision equivalent to what we propose in this clause has been in force in New South Wales, as to postal matters,&#34; for 34 years, and as to telegraphic matters for 44 years.. In Victoria we have a similar provision so far as it applies to telegraphic matters. To put it shortly, the provision in New South Wales legislation is that such postage as the Governor in Executive Council may think fit shall be levied on every letter and package respectively, provided it shall not exceed the scale of rates set forth in the schedule. </para>

                        <para>- The experience of countries which have reduced their post and telegraphic rates is that, although there may be an immediate loss, that loss is generally made up in a very short time. That has been the recent experience of New Zealand. I do not say, because of that fact, that we should be justified, in the present financial position of the Commonwealth, in making an Australian penny postage apply immediately. I do not want my words to be misunderstood, simply because I have made that statement. Such a reduction could not be made at the present moment. We must see our financial way much more clearly than we do now before we can make such a change. At the same time, the whole tendency is in favour of reduction, and the result of experience is that these reductions, so long as they are not absolutely too extensive, are at no long period recouped out of extra receipts. A progressive Post-office will keep these matters in mind ; a. congealed one will not. I am not so blind to the signs of the times as not to know that the tendency of officialism is rather towards the crystallization of these matters than in the direction of rapid progress, and if there is a tendency &#34;one way or the other to be guarded against it is the tendency to stagnation. I think this provision. goes in that direction. Reverting to the postal provisions of New South Wales, I would point out that the postage is not to exceed the rates set forth in the schedule to the Act except in certain cases, where arrangements are made with the Postmaster-General of the United Kingdom, or the proper authority of any British possession, and so forth. As far as that is concerned we do not care in this case about the prohibition of any excess, because the tendency is not towards excess. The schedule to the New South Wales Act of 1867 provides that the postage rate upon letters, not exceeding ^ oz., shall be Id. for town addresses, 2d. for country addresses, and 6d. for foreign ; upon letters and packets containing gold, not exceeding 4 ozs., 2d. for town and country addresses, 4d. for foreign and so on. This is the old schedule. Many alterations have been made since by way of reduction. I simply mention the rates for letters so that honorable members will see how the rates stood at that time, and how they have moved since. Section 6 of the New South Wales Electric Telegraph Act 1857, makes it lawful for the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council to fix the fees and dues to be received for the transmission and delivery of every message, and to make all necessary rules. It gives power to recover the fees and dues, and provides that - </para>

                <para class="block">I have only mentioned these provisions to show that the Government has not acted without warrant in this matter, but that they have adopted a practice which has worked very well in New South Wales and elsewhere. I am quite sure that honorable members who come from New South Wales will bear testimony to the fact that the provisions I have referred to have worked well during the last 30 years. . I have not heard of any endeavour to alter them, which seems to show that they have given satisfaction. This is not a vital provision in the Bill. There ave some matters in it which I do consider to be so. The constitutional power to deal with such matters as are dealt with in. clauses 54 and 55 I do consider vital, and if they were not carried I should abandon the Bill. Seeing that the evident sense of the House is against the Government, seeing that we have been unable to convince the committee, as I thought we should, that this is a reasonable and proper provision, it is useless to waste time over it. I intend, therefore, to submit to the amendment of the BDI in the direction indicated by the&#39; honorable and learned member for Corinella. There is one question in my mind, however, and it is that there may be quite as much policy involved in the fixing of rates for the transmission or delivery of telegraphic communications, especially on cable lines, as there may be in regard to postal lines. This amendment is confined to postal matters. I anticipate that there will be considerable inconvenience experience&#39;d in work of this kind if an Act of Parliament is necessary, but if it is to be experienced, the only&#39; way of finding, out the best means of reform is to allow it to operate in reason and logic upon both the postal and telegraphic systems of communication. If the honorable and learned member carries the amendment, to which I shall offer no further opposition, I shall ask that the remaining portion of the same clause shall be subject to the same necessity for an Act of Parliament, so that we may see how it will work. I am not without the belief that the provisions will be found to be irksome. We must deal with these questions in perfect good temper with each other, however, and seeing that this is a not a vital matter, I propose to allow the amendment to go, although T believe that the honorable member for Gippsland will one day say that it would have been better to leave the clause as it - stands. </para>

                    <para>- I shall be con- tent to accept the further amendment suggested by the Prime Minister if that proposed by me last night is carried. I confess that I think both can be treated together, and I shall be glad to see that done. I am very pleased that the leader of the Government has recognised that the committee requires the amendment to be made. The matter involved is of too grave importance to be dealt with in any other way than that which is now mentioned by the Prime Minister, beset though it may be with difficulties which face the passage of legislation, and wisely beset it, so that every opportunity may be given to see that right legislation is passed. The helter-skelter method of passing laws is never profitable. The Prime Minister&#39;s observations seemed to be directed to the question of reductions in postal rates. There are some postal rates which are at present <inline font-style="italic">nil,</inline> and they cannot be reduced further  unless the people are to be subsidized for sending postal articles through the post. Certain rates will.have to be increased if we deal with a uniform system at an early date. From first to last I have opposed penny postage in Victoria until it can be shown that it will pay its own way. As soon as it will pay 20s. in the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;11</inline> will support it, but not a minute before, because until it does its introduction would be simply requiring those who do not post letters in large numbers to pay a portion of the postage charges incurred by those who do. </para>

But his references to the New South Wales Act were scarcely accurate, because he spoke of many changes having been made in the schedule. The rates for town and country letter&#39;s for New South Wales, which form the bulk of the business of the Post-office, have remained at the rate which is in the schedule. </para>

                        <para>- That is a different thing. The New South Wales Act practically fixed the rate at two pence per half ounce f for country letters, and one penny per half ounce for town letters. That was the policy of the Parliament, .and that has remained in force ever since, except that the town radius has been, defined differently. According to the growth of population in different parts of the colony the town charge has been extended to these localities. I regret that the Prime Minister introduced into his statement a remark with reference to clauses 54 and 55 about which I believe there will be a very serious discussion. I, cannot understand the confusion of thought which must have led him to say that he regards those clauses as vital clauses in this machinery Bill because of the constitutional issues involved. It strikes me that some persons may raise constitutional questions as &#39;to the power of this Parliament to pass such clauses ; but in committee the practical point will be not whether the clauses are within our powers, but as to the policy of introducing them as a matter of machinery into a machinery Bill. , How the Prime Minister can say that he will regard the clauses as vital clauses, does seem to me rather puzzling. It satisfies me that there must be a majority iri the committee in favour of them. It clears up the atmosphere most materially. I see now that the clauses will pass, and personally, I have&#39; no objection. I may not perhaps be here when they come on, and, therefore, I should like to be allowed to say that, so far as I am at present advised, I acknowledge that there is a constitutional power in Parliament to do this, and after giving the matter very serious consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the exercise of the power in the manner embodied in the Bill is one which, upon the whole, will be an the best interests of the community. </para>

                    <para>- This provision is a copy of existing legislation - and it is very well understood throughout the States - that loose letters which are posted on steamers and which are not prepaid, shall be surcharged. It gives power to deliver such letters, even though they may not bear postage stamps of the country from which they are sent. This provision has been in existence not only in New South Wales, but in every State I know of for a considerable time. It has been the practice for a long time in Tasmania and elsewhere. Sometimes honorable members may not see the full effect of a clause, but, seeing that this provision has stood the test of time, it is well to insert it. </para>

For example, in Victoria all the agricultural returns which are demanded by the Government Statist, ballot-papers, and votes by post have been sent without prepayment of postage, and I believe income tax schedules too. I would urge that on returns which are demanded by the Government for statistical purposes - agricultural returns, friendly society returns, or matters of that kind - prepayment of postage should not be demanded. I do not know whether it is provided for in another clause; but apparently there is an omission. </para>

                    <para>- The purpose of the Bill is rather to restrict the privileges which have been exercised over freely by various departments, but in restricting those privileges surely honorable members will give to Ministers the latitude which they ask for, in order that under clause 93 they may be able from time to time by regulation to fix the charge or freedom from charge as to various papers and documents which it may be represented to them should be allowed to pass free or at a lower rate. I have numerous letters on this subject from bankers and others who have been in the habit of transmitting a pass-book or other documentary evidence of account, as well as from other persons such as the honorable member has just named. It is desired by the Government that any latitude of that kind should be well considered, and acted upon according to the conditions which may present themselves when the claim is made. So far as it is practicable, there will be a diminution of the- freedom to send free telegrams and free letters. Any special representation to the Postmaster-General will be considered on its merits, as will all other matters which may be necessary in the carrying out of the Act and its efficient administration, and such regulations as will be found necessary from time to time will be promulgated by him after due consideration. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to ask the Minister in charge of the Bill whether he has taken the power to make such regulations as he has alluded to. In glancing through clause 93 I have not been able to discover that he has taken that power. It would hardly cover an explicit provision to reduce the rate of postage, which I under-( stand he contemplated would be in the power of the Postmaster-General. If he intends to take such a power he ought to expressly ask for it. This clause does not provide for an exemption from postage. It simply says that the sender of the parcel or packet shall not pay the postage, and that it shall be payable by the officer by whom it is received. The request which was made by the honorable member for Bourke, and some others which I think will be made presently, might be very well acceded to. Every facility should be given to those who have to send in statistical, agricultural, or other returns to do so without being obliged to pay the postage. The postage. should be paid by the department to which the return is sent. The sender is asked to do something which it is not to his personal interest to do. A duty is laid upon him by law, and he ought not to be made to pay for discharging that duty. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the Postmaster-General will give this matter consideration. The friendly societies are very closely interested in it, because they have to furnish certain official returns every quarter. As their funds available for the payment of contingent expenses are very limited, it will be a serious matter for them if they have to pay postage in every instance. I do not believe in franking letters where they ought to be paid for, but I certainly think that these returns should be forwarded to the Government free of expense to the friendly societies. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BATCHELOR</inline>(South Australia).There are a number of returns or documents other than those mentioned which really ought to be allowed to pass through &#39; the post free, or certainly without the necessity of prepaying postage. Take taxation returns, for instance, which can only be sent through the post in many cases, and upon which it would be unfair to ask the taxpayers to prepay the postage. The practice hitherto has been to allow persons to send these returns without paying postage, leaving it to the department to which the return is sent to pay the Post-office for the service rendered. I quite agree that it would be wrong for the Commonwealth to do this work for the States without getting some proper return for it ; but the provisions of the clause might certainly be extended in the way I suggest without involving the Commonwealth in any loss. Perhaps the better plan would be to strike out the claus&#169; and leave the whole matter to be dealt with by regulation. </para>

                        <para>- It will be evident to honorable members who read this clause that it is the outcome of an effort to restrict the passage of matter through the post without the payment of postage. One instance might be cited of a most extravagant arrangement. In the local courts - not the Commonwealth courts - under certain regulations of the Judges remittances.of sixpence or a shilling may be sent through the post-office under franked stamp, and a, letter purporting to be an acknowledgment of the receipt of the money may be sent also under franked stamp to the person who made the remittance. The purpose of the honorable member for South Australia seems to be to throw the whole responsibility on the Commonwealth of carrying on the work of the local Governments. </para>

                    <para>- I would suggest to the honorable member .for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor,</inline> and to the Minister, that it might be better to put in words which would exempt from prepaid postage all returns and documents that may be prescribed. That would permit of an arrangement being arrived at between the State and the Federal Minister. The Government in one State might desire to have taxation returns or electoral returns delivered without prepaid postage, and if the matter were allowed to be fixed by regulation the Postmaster-General could meet such a case as that. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the suggestion of the honorable member for Bland will be adopted. I can quite conceive that a number of returns will have to be made in connexion with the statistical branch of the Commonwealth by municipalities and other bodies, and there should be full power given to the Postmaster-General to allow such information to pass through the post without the prepayment of postage. I hope the amendment will be modified in this direction. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to see this clause amended in a liberal way, so that it may provide for the many returns that have to be sent in under the laws of the States, and also for remittances of taxes in the various forms which they assume in the different States. At the present time these are carried free, and why in the name of common sense should the taxpayer now be called upon to pay postage by reason of the Commonwealth having taken over the Post and Telegraph services. Are the taxpayers to bear the charge, or is the State Government, which receives the benefit of the ta.x, to pay the Commonwealth so much on account of the services rendered ? I hope that the clause will be all embracing, and cover every possible return prescribed by law that is now carried free. </para>

                    <para>- I almost think that the amendment proposed by the honorable member for South Australia goes too far, because it will compel the State to pay postage in cases where it might not desire to pay it.. That is <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> say, that whenever an Act passed by the State Parliament requires returns of any description from any one in the State, such returns shall be carried free - by the dictum of the Commonwealth, and not with the acquiescence of the State. I do not think we ought to go sofar. What the honorable member really desires is that it shall not be necessary to prepay postage on matter on which postage is not payable under any existing State Act, or on which the Government of the State agrees to pay the postage. But if we go as far as the honorable member for South Australia does in his amendment, we shall compel the States to do what they may not wish to do, and do not do in all cases at the present time. </para>

My suggestion is that in clause 93, providing for regulations, power shall be taken to make regulations providing for the payment by the receiver, instead of requiring prepayment by the sender, of the rate payable on any postal article. I think that will meet the whole case, and I will undertake to alter clause 93 in this way when we come to it. </para>

                    <para>- When a newspaper has been registered as such under clause 27, that will be a safeguard in regard to the transmission of all newspapers through the Post-office hereafter, and the further definition which is given in that clause is to amplify the words &#34;known and registered as a newspaper.&#34; I suppose that all of us know and recognise what is a news sheet or a newspaper. When it is once submitted to the Postmaster-General, and a fee of 5s. for registration has been paid, there is the licence for its being so recognised. Then the clause goes on to define what a newspaper should be. The honorable member for Bland, on a previous occasion, gave us evidence of newspapers which were not what he termed wholly or in part newspapers ; but if he will read the clause he will discover that the provision that it shall consist principally of political or other news, together with or without advertisements, governs the whole purpose. The reading of the clause is not that because there are 74 columns of advertisements and 72 columns of news matter, it is not a newspaper, but that because with such a combination of news and principal matter, political or otherwise, it becomes a newspaper. </para>

                    <para>- It is advisable that we should have some definition of a newspaper, and the safest definition is that a newspaper is a publication substantially for the purpose of conveying news to the public. Probably, the words which follow, referring to political or other news, will be sufficient, and the words which are objected to might be omitted ; but I think that some words ought to be retained for the purpose of indicating that newspapers, and not mere advertising sheets are meant. There are a large number of institutions and firms who would like a definition which would include mere -advertising sheets or publications. The committee ought to protect the revenue to the extent of not altering the definition to admit of the wholesale transmission of mere advertising sheets. </para>

It cannot consist entirely of advertisements, and, therefore, I think his objection cannot be sustained.

The generally accepted sense would vary with different persons. Some publications, for instance, monthly scientific publications, are not known to a great number of persons. The clause merely provides for the Postmaster-General, with no good reasons whatever, saying - &#34;I do not recognise that as a newspaper j it is not a newspaper in the generally accepted sense of the word.&#34; The further provisions are the real safeguards, and I think one of them, at any rate, is amply sufficient for the purpose.

                <para>That describes sufficiently, I think, a newspaper ; but the strongest provision to prevent mere advertising sheets is to be found in the words &#34; and printed for sale.&#34; The fact that they are printed for sale and not for free delivery will stop what are not newspapers. With that safeguard, and the other description which is given of a newspaper I agree with the honorable member for Bland that it is only confusing, and serves no good purpose to have the words in which he objects to. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JOSEPH</inline> COOK (Parramatta).- I am inclined to think that the words&#34;printed for sale&#34; do not bring us very much nearer to the prohibition of trade circulars, and that is unmistakably aimed at by the clause. The definition of a, newspaper is the most troublesome thing which the post-offices of the world have ever had to deal with. No post-office has yet been able to get a definition which is satisfactory. No definition which has been framed has been able to keep out trade circulars. I do not think this clause will do it either. The only effectual way of putting them down is to allow the Postmaster-General a large discretion. Let me describe what happens in connexion with trade circulars. At first they come with little or no reading matter, and. they are refused registration. The firms put in a little more reading matter, and then they come again and try to get registered. The Postmaster-General refuses to register them as long  as he possibly can, but they keep putting a little more news in, until they come within this definition of a newspaper. A trade circular need not vary its advertisements at all, according to the interpretation of the clause. All it has to do is to keep in enough reading matter to make it a newspaper in accordance with the definition. I know very many newspapers which are good readable publications, but which are advertising sheets none the less. Some firms go so far as to employ an editor to run their newspaper. The <inline font-style="italic">Field,</inline> for instance, is a. very good newspaper. </para>

                    <para>- Yes ; but they are general advertising mediums, and- that is precisely what these sheets are not. They are full from cover to cover with their own advertisements, but nevertheless they contain good reading- matter. I admit that, there is no likelihood of a House of Parliament leaving it to the discretion of the Postmaster-General, and the next best thing to do is to get a clause which we hope will come near to meeting the: difficulty. The Postmaster-General should have some reference to the advertisements in determining what is not a newspaper, because after all it is not the reading matter which determines the <inline font-style="italic">bonafides</inline> of a newspaper, but the advertisements. The distinction between a trade circular and an ordinary newspaper consists alone in the character of &#39; the advertisements. Many advertising sheets are better newspapers than some of the publications which are <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> newspapers according to this clause. There is very little news in some up-country struggling newspapers. There is infinitely more interesting news in some advertising sheets than in some back country newspapers, but, nevertheless, they are run for advertising purposes and in the interests of a particular firm. This definition I am afraid will not get over that trouble. I do nob think the use of the words &#34;printed for sale&#34; gets over it either, because it is very easy to put &#34; price sixpence,&#34; or &#34; price threepence,&#34; on newspapers, and say that they are printed for sale. That provision will be met by selling half-a-dozen copies a week, and giving away half-a-dozen thousand. If the honorable member for Bland takes out these words I am afraid that he will leave matters exactly as they are. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMAS</inline>(Barrier).- I shall be quite prepared to vote for the omission of the words which it is proposed to strike out, and also for the excision of the rest of the clause. I really cannot understand why anybody should object to advertisements being passed through the Post-office. It is evidently feared that unless we have some definition of the word newspaper, we may have trade circulars passed through the Post-office, but I do not see any reason why that should be objected to. I could understand a small shopkeeper in the back blocks objecting, but I do not see that we, who are here to give postal facilities to the people, should raise any difficulty about it. The big business houses which issue trade circulars broadcast throughout the States would not continue to do so unless they received replies asking them to send goods to various parts of the country, and every letter sent in response to such advertisements involves a contribution to the postal revenue, to say nothing of the money that is derived from the parcels post. If the clause is adopted in its present form, a great number of trade and technical journals might be objected to, and I do not think we should do anything that would restrict the circulation of these papers. I know of a trade journal in Sydney that is circulated right through the whole of the States. When it was started I know that the proprietors had very little capital, but what helped them on was the fact that the paper could go through the New South Wales Post-office free of postage, and eventually they were enabled to make their position secure and to do thoroughly good work. If this clause were passed the postal authorities would say that they would not allow advertisements to go through at the rate of 1/2d. for1oz. weight, but if a lot of rubbish were introduced into the paper to make up the 2oz. it would be allowed to pass through for id. To take up a position of that sort seems to me to be absurd. I have a paper here called <inline font-style="italic">Australian Hardware and Machinery,</inline> which seems to me to be a very good technical paper. I should think there is fully four times as much space devoted to advertisements as to ordinary news matter - although that matter looks to be of a very good class. But I would point out that it is impossible to run a good technical paper unless the advertisements preponderate over the reading matter. If the clause were passed in its present form in order that the magazine might pass through the post, it would be necessary to lengthen the articles four times or, in other words, for every half column now written two columns would have to be inserted, and the Post-office would have to carry the extra weight. If there is any class of newspaper that we require, it is these journals of a technical character, because whether we are free traders or protectionists we should aim at extending and improving the technical training of our artisans. I know that in the country and elsewhere these journals are extremely useful and are read with great interest, and I see no reason why a man in the back-blocks, who wants his trade or technical journal, should not have it sent to him under the same conditions as newspapers, which are of far less value to him. The outcome of leaving this provision in the clause regarding advertisements would be to lower the quality of the reading matter, and certainly detract from the interest and value of the papers in the eyes of those who desire to have information imparted to them in the most succinct and readable form. I am strongly in favour of the proposed amendment, and at a later stage, when I have an opportunity, I propose to move that all periodicals, no matter what they are, shall be carried through the post as newspapers. If it is intended to carry newspapers free, these periodicals should be carried free, and if newspapers are to be charged for, the issues I have referred to should be dealt with on the same scale. The trade circulars to which so much objection has been taken, very strongly tend to increase our postal revenue, and I heard the other day of a case in which a single advertisement, which cost1s. in one of these newspapers, elicited 72 replies, and thus resulted in a contribution of a least 6s. to the postal revenue. We are here to look after the requirements of the general public, and to grant them&#39; every possible facility. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member or the Barrier has quite unintentionally raised an issue which no doubt ought to be considered in connexion with this Bill, but which I venture to submit ought not to be dealt with here. The clause we have now before us is a definition and nothing else. Its object is one and one only - namely to define what is, and therefore by negative what is not, a newspaper, so that when we come to deal with newspapers hereafter in regard to their registration in the next clause, and in a variety of other clauses, and when we come to determine the postage they are to pay, we may know what is meant by a newspaper, it is here defined. I have not a word to say now in opposition to the remarks made by the honorable member for the Barrier on the general question. There is a great deal to be said in support of his contention that, so far as technical journals are concerned, every consideration should be extended to them by this House; but it is quite unnecessary to call them by any other name or to cause confusion by extending a definition which ought, within reasonable limits, to be as strict as possible. That is why the honorable member for Parramatta, in the light of his experience as a Postmaster-General, was able to see what was desired by this clause, and that there was necessity for the words to which the honorable member for Bland has taken exception, apparently for the good old conservative reason that they are not to be found in existing Acts. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The reason for the phrase that was objected to was supplied by the honorable member for Parramatta; it is to provide an additional safeguard, so that when we see newspapers referred to in the Bill we shall know that in addition to meaning those which are printed for sale, though they may never be sold, and those which contain news as well as advertisements, they shall be publications such as are usually and generally accepted as newspapers. Thus we may clearly know that when we use the word newspapers in regard to this Bill - it may be when we are dealing with them as to rates, or in any other respect - we shall know what publications are intended to be affected. If we mean trade journals why not say so? If to mean technical journals why not say so, and thus have a proper definition ? If&#39; we desire to lay it down that technical journals shall be carried at the same rate as. newspapers, that is a perfectly proper thing to say and to argue. But that is not a. reason why we should call a trade journal or a technical magazine a newspaper, because by so doing we should be extending the word &#34;newspaper&#34; until it ceases to have any connotation with the precise class of publication included under that term.. This clause merely defines what is meant by the word &#34; newspaper.&#34; </para>

This is ti definition, and the question of policy raised by the honorable member for the Barrier is foreign to it. As was pointed out by the honorable member for Parramatta, the object of introducing these words is to provide an additional safeguard so that those publications which are not newspapers shall be referred to under their own names. Then, if this House adopts any special treatment for them, it will know what it is doing. But if we enlarge the term &#34;newspapers&#34; to cover every class of desirable publication, the rest of the Bill will need to be altered accordingly. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WATSON</inline>(Bland).- I quite sympathize with the desire of the Government to discriminate between newspapers, pure and simple, and advertising sheets. But the explanation put forward by the Attorney-General has not improved the case for the retention of these words. It seems to me that they put into the hands of the Postmaster-General the power of imposing disabilities on political opponents by refusing to register as newspapers publications with which he is not in sympathy. It would not be a question of absolute fact, and. that is what we should attempt to provide for in this Bill. It would be a mere matter of opinion. In the hands of a political Postmaster-General such a power may be a very dangerous weapon. Under the circumstances, I trust that the committee will omit the words. I recognise, too, that .it is difficult to discriminate between a trade circular and a newspaper proper. From a commercial stand-point; the proper thing would be to charge postage according to the weight carried. But there is a very proper desire to treat newspapers which do convey news to the people in a more liberal fashion than mere advertising sheets, which are circulated for the advancement of some particular business. In New South Wales that desire has found expression in free newspaper postage. I believe that that State has gone too far, and. that newspapers ought to contribute something towards the general revenue. By offering too liberal terms for the transmission by post of different classes of advertising matter, a heavy increase may be in volved in the cost of the ordinary maiL service to the people of the back country.. If it becomes a question of choice between.giving the people frequent communication and carrying these advertising sheets at a low rate, I shall always vote in favour of the former. By overloading the mail service with non-payable matter, there is a danger that people in the interior maybe deprived of some of the advantages which they at present enjoy. In the meantime, I must insist upon the omission of these: words. </para>

                    <para>- I feel, that the words &#34; printed for sale&#34; will exclude some publications which it is not generally desired to exclude. There is, for example, the <inline font-style="italic">Victorian Stock Journal.,</inline> which, is a weekly publication. The news which that journal conveys to all the Victorian farmers is of vital importance to them. It gives the prices for the different kinds of stock in the different markets of the States. It is not printed for sale, but the stock agents combine to pay for its publication and distribute it free to the farmers throughout the States. I have named the <inline font-style="italic">Stock JournaL</inline> of Victoria, but I only referred to it as a sample of the journals, which I certainly think should rank as newspapers, and be carried as such. </para>

                    <para>- I think, that the words proposed to be omitted only confuse the definition. They would do well enough if we were not likely to have any more newspapers. If a newspaper is about to be issued &#39; for the first time, it can neither be &#34;known&#34;&#39; or &#34;recognised&#34; as such. It appears to me, then, that we have to put in words providing for any publication &#34;of the kind&#34;&#39; known and recognised as a newspaper. I cannot, for the life of me, see what distinction should be made between the carriage of a newspaper published by a man as an advertisement for his own business and&#39;&#39; a newspaper which publishes advertisements- received from other people. In the first case the proprietor issues the paper, and publishes his advertisements in it in order to make his business pay ; while the proprietors of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and other newspapers take advertisements from other people in order to make their businesses pay. I quite agree with the honorable member for Barrier that under this definition a good many journals will be excluded that are of very great use to certain sections of the public, although they may not be recognised as general newspapers. There are technical and educational publications, the <inline font-style="italic">Public Service Journal,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Electric Telegraph Magazine,</inline> and others, which do not contain items of general interest to the general public, but are of surpassing interest to the men who subscribe to them. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for the Barrier seems to have put forward an objection -to the present clause, which the Attorney-General apparently is not inclined to consider as it deserves. This is a definition of a newspaper for the purposes of the Bill ; a definition of a newspaper in regard to its carriage through the post, and which, under clauses 55 and 56, the Postmaster-General may refuse to carry if it contains objectionable matter for other purposes in connexion with this Bill. According to this definition, a newspaper is a. daily, weekly, or monthly publication which contains a certain proportion of news and of advertisements. Surely that is a very undesirable and inaccurate definition. A newspaper is not something which contains a certain proportion of one thing and another thing, but it is something which, at periodical intervals, gives its <inline font-style="italic">clientele</inline> a certain amount of news in a well-known way. There is a great difference between a trades journal and a newspaper, but they both convey information. We all know that a trade journal appeals to a section of the community for which an ordinary newspaper does absolutely nothing. To show how inaccurate and unscientific this definition is, it is only necessary to point out that if the Postmaster-General stands on the strict wording of this clause nearly every newspaper in the Common-, wealth will be refused transmission through the post. If a newspaper be successful it cannot be carried through the post, because a journal is never burdened with advertisements unless it is a successful one. There is a reference in the clause to coloured supplements. Newspapers in Australia never go in for such things, although the yellow journals in New York do so. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that the clause deals with coloured supplements proves conclusively that the honorable gentleman has a hazy idea of a trade circular supplement. If we exclude coloured supplements we will not do a very grave injustice to the newspapers of Australia. I certainly think that while it is a good thing to define what is a newspaper, it is also a good thing to define what may be carried on the same conditions as a newspaper. If weight be a consideration, and I agree that it is, let a certain weight be fixed as a maximum, and let us provide that payment shall be made for anything over that weight. </para>

I am very much afraid that the words to which the honorable member for Bland takes exception do not define it very accurately. In New South Wales we have had for many years the advantage of free &#39; newspaper postage. Those honorable members who come from that State and decry the great advantage of the system are gentlemen who, unlike myself, do not hail from the back blocks. They obtain their newspapers in the streets. If they had to live, as I have done, where the postman only comes at irregular intervals, and where we prize our newspapers almost as much as we do the written communications that we receive, they would not cry out against free newspaper postage. It is one of those things that make life bearable in the back blocks, and I should like to see the system continued under the. Commonwealth. The great difficulty in New South Wales has been that a great deal of printed matter not generally recognised as newspapers has obtained this concession, because the publishers have succeeded in complying with, the definition of what - is a newspaper. In Sydney we. have a lot of big business firms who have withdrawn their advertisements from the regular newspapers and are issuing publications of their own, which they have succeeded in making of interest to the country people, and no doubt in a cheaper way than they could do under the old method. Some of these advertising mediums contain very valuable literary matter. Most of them cater for farming requirements, and produce a farming and family magazine, which appeals very strongly to the settler in the back country. No doubt they serve a good purpose, but whether they could come within the province of a newspaper, as regards the rate of postage, is another question. Again, nearly every religious body or political body lias its own organ, which for the purpose of winning adherents is circulated through the Post-office as a newspaper. I do not see how we are going to define what is and what is not a newspaper in such a way as to give general satisfaction. It is a matter which must be left largely to the discretion of the Postmaster-General, but to that suggestion the objection has been taken that Ave may get an interpretation which may be purely political. More completely than any Act of Parliament can make him, the Postmaster-General is its servant, and if Parliament is not satisfied with his administration of that department, it has the remedy in its own hands. I do not see that there is anything to be gained by retaining the words to which exception is taken, because they really :mean very little. </para>

                    <para>- I think that this discussion discloses what little basis there is for the whole thing. We ought to have proceeded with the Bill on purely business lines. If we had done that we should not have to define a newspaper at all, nor should we need the other clauses which deal with newspapers. If the Bill had treated all printed matter alike we should not have all this discussion about trade circulars and newspapers. As a mere matter of common fairness to a large number of the citizens of the Commonwealth, whatever is carried through the post : should be paid for. There is a principle underlying that. But what Ave have been talking about for nearly two &#34;hours has not the ghost of a principle i underlying it. It used to be said at </para>

                <para>11 Q </para>
                <para class="block">one time that we should carry newspapers free on account of their educational effect on the minds of the people. I defy any man to prove to me that there is more educational influence in the best conducted newspapers in this land than there is in some of the sixpenny classics now sold on the book-stalls. If Ave are going to pass matter through the Post-office on account of its educational influence, Ave should pass through it at the same rate the master works of the master minds of the world. It is said that the newspaper is a social relaxation to country people, that it is not only a means of education, but also a means of amusement to them. But there are other forms of amusement. Manuscript music and books of jokes, for instance, have just as much right to go through as a matter of principle to provide amusement for people in the country districts. Again, an honorable member said that those persons who are so far away from the centres of town life should have the newspapers brought to their door free by the Post-office, because </para>
                <para class="block">Ave, who live in the city, have our newspapers delivered at the door by the newsboy. On that principle Ave should take a man&#39;s bread and groceries free to his door. There is np principle underlying it at all, and if the committee can only make up its mind, as I believe a great many persons in the Commonwealth have done, that newspapers should pay postage, and that all printed matter should be charged so much per weight, Ave would make the Post-office a much more paying institution than it is, while it would make very little difference, if any, to the mass of the people. See what it comes to : I have to acknowledge - and I defy any business man here to say that his experience has been against mine - that I throw into my waste-paper basket morning after morning unopened newspapers on which there is no postage, or newspapers on which there - is a postage of Id. or &#163;d. - I never think of opening them.. If any one walks into the Opposition room he Will find in the waste-paper baskets newspapers with and without postage stamps which have not been opened. It is a scandal that Ave should continue to carry through the Post-office these bulky mails time after time, and make a loss upon them. On the other hand, as Ave conduct the Post - office mainly for the purpose of carrying letters, Ave incur certain expenses, -which Ave can call general charges, for the carriage of letters. Consequently, we could afford to carry printed matter at a very low rate, and make no loss on it. If we put a postage of1/2d. or1d. on printed matter according to weight, the Post-office would make a revenue, and 1 do not believe that any person in the Commonwealth would be any worse off. </para>

That paper is at present registered in Victoria, although copies of it are supplied gratis to people engaged in the occupations to which I refer. It is true that those who conduct the newspaper derive benefits from doing so, but so do the proprietors of all successful newspapers, and that in itself is not sufficient to debar it from recognition. It seems to me that the other safeguards in the clause are sufficient to prevent the Post-office from being flooded with advertisements of patent medicines and other things. </para>

When its reconsideration takes place, the Minister in charge of the Bill will have made inquiries from the Postmaster-General as to the effect of these proposed amendments. It seems to me that publications of the kind to which the honorable member for Laanecoorie refers - speaking from the small knowledge I have of those published in Victoria - merit consideration, and deserve encouragement ; but it is difficult to deal with a question of this kind without knowing what the attitude of the Postal departments of the various States has been in regard to them. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MAHON</inline>(Coolgardie).- There is another publication which ought to be taken into account. In some of the States the Agricultural department issue a gazette to the farmers which I think ought to be transmitted through the post at the ordinary newspaper rates. In reference to the&#39; difficulty which has been raised by some honorable members, I would point out that if newspapers had on the top of their sheets, &#34;price 6d.&#34; or &#34; price1d.&#34; it would be overcome. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HIGGINS</inline>(Northern Melbourne).I wish to ask the Minister whether he intends to make special provision in the regulations with regard to monthly literary magazines or reviews ? In considering this question of newspapers, I feel strongly in accord with the general principle put forward by the honorable member for South Sydney, namely, that the whole distinction is baseless. We have no right to treat newspapers in a different way from other literary matter. I have in my mind a useful little journal, issued by the University of Melbourne - the <inline font-style="italic">Alma Mater</inline> - which gives the social and literary events of each month. It is quite as meritorious as a newspaper, and still, under this provision, it would have to pay1d. for postage, whereas a newspaper would have to pay only a 1/2d. I do not instance that publication solely. Apart from the amendment which has been proposed, I think it would be well if this committee had some assurance that the Ministry is in sympathy with the view that if newspapers are to be carried at a cheap rate, so also ought reviews and magazines to be similarly carried. </para>

                    <para>- I would point out that provision has already been made that all foreign newspapers which are duly posted shall be delivered. But if New Zealand likes to send a large number of newspapers for distribution to some agent here we should, in the absence of the paragraph under discussion, enlarge the orders of our postal contractors very considerably. In some of the existing Postal Acts provision is made against the free carriage of stale newspapers. We merely wish to transmit under our postal arrangements newspapers which are printed within the Commonwealth. If a bale of newspapers sent from New Zealand, Fiji, or elsewhere were to enjoy the same rights as are conceded to newspapers posted within the Commonwealth, a great deal of additional work would be thrown upon the Postal department. I do not know whether the committee are seised of the fact that a very large number of our postal contracts cost much more than need be the case by reason of the facilities which are given for the transmission of parcels or newspapers. Many of our inland postal contracts, which might otherwise be undertaken on foot or upon horseback, have - because of the large mass of printed material which is to be carried - to be undertaken with carts, and in some cases a two-horse vehicle has to be employed where a one-horse vehicle would have sufficed. I hope that the committee will prevent more leakage in this respect than has hitherto taken place. We should look forward to the time when the Postal department will pay its way better, in order that increased facilities may be given for the carriage of postal matter at a lower rate. That is the purpose which is aimed at by the PortmasterGeneral. </para>

                    <para>- It is apparent to me that the free carriage of these publications is undertaken in the interests of their proprietors, and not for the benefit of the general&#39; body of the community. The honorable member for Tasmania mentioned that a bale of newspapers might come in from New Zealand, and said in effect that the Post-office would stagger under that sort of blow. This shows the absolute folly of allowing anything to be transmitted by post free. I am not in favour of the amendment. If it is simply in the interests of the proprietors of these publications that they shall be carried free, we ought to acknowledge it, and to say that it is only another form of that protection to which a great many honorable members upon this side of the House are opposed. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMAS</inline>(Barrier). -I cannot understand the argument of the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> Fysh, or of the last speaker. There is no provision in this clause that newspapers shall be carried free. I have no doubt that there will be a charge made for their carriage. What I desire to get is a definition of the word &#34;newspaper.&#34; It is an open question whether newspapers should be carried free or not. The question is what should the Post-office carry. If newspapers are to be carried free, of course there is not much in this argument, but if we are to make a charge, the omission of this sub-clause will not increase the cost of running the Post-office by an additional half-crown. We have our Postmaster-General, our Deputy Postmasters-General, and all the paraphernalia of the Post-office in existence for the carriage of mails. Apart from some of the city letter carriers, I venture to say that every postman can carry twice as much as he carries now. It would not cost any more to deliver two letters to the same address, than it does to deliver one. I do not think we shall be flooded with newspapers from other places ; but, if a bale of newspapers come across from New Zealand, and are carried at one penny each, some thousands of pounds must be added to the revenue. </para>

                        <para>- We are always talking about the cost. Take the case of the telephones. The charge for the use of the telephone in New South Wales was formerly &#163;12 per annum. When the honorable member for Parramatta was Postmaster-General, he wished to reduce the rate to &#163;8 per annum for a telephone in a business place, and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per annum for a telephone for private purposes. He was told by his officials that such a reduction would simply mean ruination. Nevertheless he insisted upon it with the result that he secured for the department a bigger revenue than it had before. We have our postal system, and our trains to carry the mails, and the more we have to carry the more revenue we will receive. </para>

In the schedule to the Victorian Act, power is given for papers printed and published within Victoria to be sent through the post at per pound. I think newspapers printed outside the Commonwealth should be restricted to that extent, and that they should not be allowed to be sent in bulk.If there was a shortage in the postal revenue at the end of the year, we should have to look to our own people to make it good ; we could not look to outsiders to make up the deficit. I think we might allow a single newspaper, provided that it does not weigh more than 10ozs., to be re-posted within the Commonwealth on the lines that we have followed in Victoria. We receive newspapers from the old country, and after we have read them we re-post them to our friends. It would not be fair, however, to get papers in bulk from the old country, and re-distribute them. I object to paragraph (a) as it stands, because it prevents the re-posting of a single newspaper. Still 1 do not want to prevent the Commonwealth giving a certain amount of protection to newspapers printed and published here, because if our postal revenue falls short we have to look to ourselves to make it good. &#34; </para>

The Opposition have made no factious interruption of Government business, but have endeavoured to assist Ministers in the passing of their measures. It is not fair to the Opposition under such circumstances to introduce a fiscal proposal into a Post and Telegraph Bill. Under these circumstances, it is not dealing properly with the committee for the Minister to accept a protective provision in a Post and Telegraph Bill where there is no occasion to have any provision of the sort. If the Government desire to deal in their Tariff proposals with this question they can, and that is the proper place to do so. . It will not facilitate the final passing of this Bill.

                    <para>. - The committee has just found the first of these sub-clauses to be a reasonable one - that the paper should be printed and published within the Commonwealth. It is a corollary to that that the supplement should also be produced within the Commonwealth unless we want an Australian dog with a French or German tail. Surely the committee is going to be consistent. This is not a fiscal proposal. It is a proposal designed to prevent the Commonwealth from having its Post-office deluged, with matters which do not pertain to its own transactions, and which it is not bound to carry or deal with unless it gets some consideration. The portion of the clause which has been assented to is a business portion, and this is nothing more than a business consequence of it. If the honorable member for South Sydney thinks otherwise, then he must confess that he is a little bit at the heel of the hunt, because if there is anything in the objection he raised it ought to have been brought forward on sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">(a).</inline> It would seem to be perfectly preposterous and idle to carry sub-clause (a), and then to listen for a moment to a suggestion that, while we provide in that sub-clause that a thing to be deemed a newspaper is to be printed and published within the Commonwealth, we can take everything produced from the ends of the world, even in Asia, and say that is a proper supplement to attach to it. </para>

                        <para>- One thing at a time. We are providing in the Bill that certain tilings which are deemed newspapers shall be printed and published within the Commonwealth. It would be an absurdity to attach this consequence - that, whereas the paper which is the body, is to be printed and published within the Commonwealth, the supplement which is the tail can come from anywhere else. That has nothing to do with the question whether it ought to be printed on paper made within the Commonwealth. Let us leave that for a little while, and consider it in due course ; and I have no doubt that when it is considered my honorable friends will derive great satisfaction from its consideration. </para>

                    <para>- I think the honorable member for North Sydney has thrown a great deal of light on this amendment. I am astonished at the statecraft of the Prime Minister. I am astonished that he should attempt to sneak in pro- . tection under a guise of this character. If the newspaper has to be printed from type set up within the Commonwealth, why should it not be printed with ink made within the Commonwealth ? I might go a bit further and suggest that the wrapper and the mucilage which is used on the wrapper shall be made within the Commonwealth, and to go right back to the. base of protection that the articles shall be written by aboriginals. </para>

                        <para>- I have looked, at the latest Act - the 1893 Act - and I have not found any such provision in it, although that Act was passed when a Ministry was in power which is known in the history of New South Wales as the Ministry which sneaked in protection. If it is right to provide that these stereotypes and electrotypes shall have been made from type set up in the country, why should it not also be provided that the printer&#39;s blankets, the printing paper, the ink, and the mucilage on the wrappers shall have been made in the country? I could understand this and similar proposals if we were dealing with the Tariff now, but I object to the sneaking in of a policy to which I am opposed, under the cover of a Post and Telegraph Bill. It might as well be proposed that no parcel should be carried by the parcels post unless it contained goods manufactured in the country, and the honorable member for Melbourne Ports might equally well move that the men employed in setting up the type and working the machinery shall receive the minimum wage. I believe that the mover of the amendment is a prominent member of the Australian Natives Association. To carry out his views to their logical conclusion he should insist that all the men employed in the newspaper offices shall be Australian natives. Another objection that I have to the proposal is this : In matters of art we cannot confine ourselves to local productions ; but, if the amendment were agreed to, the proprietors of provincial papers, who, to make their publications attractive to their readers, from time to time issue illustrated coloured supplements, would be compelled, as they could not afford to buy the plant to print them for themselves, to confine their purchases to the productions of the Australian market. I suggest to the Ministry that this matter should be allowed to stand over until the Tariff is dealt with. Victorians are always credited with having their eyes open, but in this instance they did not see that the Opposition were equally wide awake, and would understand the object of the amendment. We are not being treated fairly in this matter, however, because a number of the members of the Opposition are away, thinking that only machinery provisions were to be considered. </para>

It is about time that a protest was made against the emptiness of the Treasury benches, while important public business is under consideration. It has come to this pass that the House is counted five or six times a night, and the number of members present at different periods in the evening is published in the&#34; newspapers. Perhaps the newspapers will take note of the fact that the leaders of the House, who are primarily responsible, are scarcely ever in their places. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the honorable member is not serious in regard to this matter. I protest against the time of the House being taken up with motions that can lead to no good result. It is time that those honorable members who feel that they are enduring a long absence from home took a little part in this discussion. The honorable member for Parramatta has referred to the absence of Ministers from this Chamber. In this connexion I hardly think that Ministers have been fairly dealt with on many occasions. If honorable members will recollect the difficulties which beset the. Government when they took office, and will bear in mind that they had to conduct an election, besides attending many ceremonies and State functions, they will see that more allowance ought to be made for them. It would have been better if this Parliament had not been summoned for six months yet. Then there would have been ample opportunity for Ministers to get their measures in a more: forward state than they could reasonably be expected to do under the circumstances. Until recently they have had no assistance in the preparation of their Bills. I trust that we shall get on with the business because this motion can only result in waste of time. </para>

We had a debate the other night in which as strongly as we possibly could word our language, we deplored the absence of Ministers from the House. We have made our protests, but we cannot compel Ministers to attend in their places, and I think the procedure proposed would be a very unwise one at present.

It is very foolish and ridiculous for the honorable member for Parramatta to take up the stand which he has taken. What matters it to us whether Ministers are present or not? The Minister in charge of the Bill is present, and even he might well be allowed to go away, because we could then get the Bill altered in any way we chose. It is absurd for any one who voted against my motion to urge that this is raising the fiscal question. Whether Ministers are present or not, is optional with them. It is a question which concerns only their constituents. </para>

                    <para>- I think I may offer a small apology to honorable members for having accepted the-, amendment without giving any special reasons for so doing. I was not aware at the moment of the over tender susceptibilities of some honorable members in regard to what they call the fiscal question. Since - they have spoken on the subject, however, I see that from their point of view possibly they may smell a rat in it. But certainly when I accepted the amendment I did so on the ground that it will enable the Postmaster-General to reduce the amount of heavy matter in the shape of newspapers which is carried by the Postal authorities. I ask honorable members to recollect the very large weight of postal matter which is often imported from the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, or America, by newspaper proprietors who put their headings upon it, and then circulate it as part of their supplement. As a result our newspapers have sometimes grown in bulk very seriously indeed. I have seen advertisements in the shape of almanacs imported, upon which newspaper proprietors have merely printed the words &#34; supplement to the <inline font-style="italic">Mercury,&#34;</inline> or something of the kind, and which has then, cost nothing for transmission by post. Now, we are going to carry newspapers either free, or at a very low cost. I very much doubt whether Parliament will . accept any standard rates for newspapers, which will recoup to the Postmaster-General the expenditure which must be incurred in sending those newspapers into the outlying districts, where the expense of conveyance in proportion to their number is excessive. I hope, therefore, that no honorable member will repeat that I accepted the amendment on behalf of the Government with the idea of raising any fiscal issue. That was foreign to my intention and foreign to the intention of the Government. </para>

                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMSON</inline>(North Sydney).- I am glad that the Minister has given this expla - nation. He has stated that the explanation which he has offered constitutes the one reason for his having accepted the amendment of the honorable member. If, then, I can show that he is absolutely mistaken in the reason which he gives, surely he will be induced to withdraw from his position. The honorable member said that he was induced to accept the amendment, because it would not pay the Post-office to add extra weight to the carriage of the newspapers by foreign matter. Then the .honorable member for Northern Melbourne said that having passed the provision- that newspapers should be printed within the Commonwealth we should not object to the amendment. There are reasons altogether -apart from the fiscal question for the acceptance of the proposal that newspapers should be printed within the Commonwealth before they receive the advantage of the rate of postage which we fix. One reason is that if carried below cost and a large influx of foreign papers were permitted there might be a deficit caused in the revenue. &#34;Then, again, if there is to be a rate of postage upon newspapers below that existing in other countries, it may be argued that there is no reciprocity if we carry foreign newspapers at that rate or for nothing whilst -other countries demand payment upon our newspapers going through their territory. The same arguments do not apply in regard to these supplements. The amendment says that after the word &#34;supplement&#34; there should be inserted the words, &#34; the letterpress of the same being printed within the Commonwealth from type set up within the Commonwealth, or from stereotypes or .electrotypes made therefrom.&#34; I would ask the committee whether there is any difference between the weight of printed matter impressed in the States and that impressed elsewhere ? There is no difference, and there can be no difference in the weight that the Post-office will have to carry, whether this provision is in the Bill or not. </para>

                        <para>- How does the honorable and learned member, know that ? Is this a Bill to restrict the distribution of supplements, or is it not ? We do not want to stop newspapers having supplements, but this is simply proposed in order that all the work may be given to local type setters. This is a most extraordinary provision. I do not know why the honorable member if he did not do it for fiscal motives, should have introduced his proposal in this form. The designing work which would give infinitely more work to the States can be done abroad, but before the newspapers send out such supplements they must take care to print something on them. What object is there in that? If the honorable member who has moved this amendment can give me any good reasons, other than fiscal ones, for the adoption of it I may be prepared to support it. If they are only fiscal reasons then what is the position of the Ministry ? Have they not asked us to treat this measure as a non-party one ? Has not that request been responded to ? Have not honorable members on both sides of the committee been seen intermixing in every division? There has been no attempt to make a party question of it, nor has there been any attempt at obstruction on the part of the Opposition. There has been as much criticism from the opposite side of the House as from this. Under these circumstances has not the Opposition responded to the very proper request made to the committee that the measure should not be treated as a party one ? When we have responded in that way why put in a provision in support of which no good argument can be brought forward except for fiscal ones % In these circumstances I think that the Ministry might well see that they are not acting in a fair manner to the Opposition. The honorable mover of the amendment has interjected that this provision is in the New South Wales Act. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Dalley says that it is not in the New South Wales Act. If it is in the Act, and was placed there by a protective Ministry, are the party on this side of the House to accept the amendment for that reason ? Or even if it were put there inadvertently by a free-trade Ministry, are we bound to accept it % It has been&#34; said that honorable members should have been prepared for this. There are several honorable members of the Opposition who might have been here if they had known the possible importance of this amendment. They have been taken by surprise to this extent, that although it was known that the amendment was coming, it was never 1 anticipated that the Ministry would accept it. It was thought that the Government would hold to their Bill, and that having the weight of the Ministry as well as of &#39; the Opposition against it the proposal would not have been entertained. Under these circumstances I do think I can appeal to the Minister in charge of the Bill, with every reason, to leave this matter over. What harm can be done to those who are in favour of it on fiscal grounds? The Tariff will probably come before the House before long, and then honorable members, if they choose, can exclude every bit of lithographic and other printing work done outside the Commonwealth. I do not object to honorable members trying to force their views on the fiscal issue, but <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> do say that this is not the proper place to bring in a fiscal proposal. The Ministry having asked for a treatment of this measure on non-party grounds, and the Opposition having heartily responded to that request, would appeal to the Prime Minister not -to force us to treat the rest of this, measure on party lines, but to remove this bone of contention, satisfied that if there is any loss to their fiscal policy, it can be set right on the Tariff. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir WILLIAM</inline>McMILLAN (Wentworth). - I think that the- committee ought to be thoroughly ashamed of this amendment. I certainly consider the Minister in charge of the Bill must have taken a very low gauge of the intelligence of the committee when he introduced his inconsequential and irrelevant remarks in regard to the principle underlying it. We have tried on this side of the committee to deal fairly and honorably with honorable members opposite, and 1 do not think that we are getting any reasonable reward to-night for our magnanimity. Let us look at the question simply. The Bill recognises that a paper may have a supplement, and with certain safeguards it allows that these supplements may be sent through the post in the ordinary way. We have now introduced a question as to where the particular type for the supplement is made, and where the lithographic work may be done. When we come to deal with the Tariff, some honorable members wish to impose certain duties, but we have been told, from the Prime Minister downwards, that those duties are to be of a revenue character. Clearly in this amendment we do not propose a duty, but a prohibition. If that is not introducing the fiscal question into a Bill which has nothing to do with it, there is no sense in words. It is done for that set purpose. A spirit of mischief actuated the honorable member who proposed it. It is a spirit of mischief designed to create a controversy at this stage on the fiscal question. I would go even further, and say that this is introducing the great fiscal issue, which divides the House on party lines, when we are asking the Government to forbear at present from introducing such an element. Even if the case were only half as strong I think that, as a matter of right and honour and fair play, the Government should accede to our request. I do not believe that the great majority of honorable members behind the Government are in sympathy with this back-stairs way of introducing the fiscal question into a harmless Bill. I could scarcely believe my senses when I learned that the Government had immediately accepted the proposal made by the honorable member for Bourke. The Minister has committed himself. He confessed that he did not see the whole scope of this amendment but he was able to apply a salve to his conscience by saying that, by means of this provision, we should prevent such a large quantity of newspaper matter from being carried throughout Australia. Are we not here, however, to give facilities for postal matter to be carried through Australia ? By this very Bill we allow the principle that supplements are a right tiling. Very often they are of a most educational character, both with regard to knowledge they disseminate, and in relation to their aesthetic character. Yet, according to the Minister in charge of the Bill, by a side wind which, by a peculiar coincidence, pleases honorable members on his own side of the House, he wants to reduce the weight of the papers distributed throughout the country. Do we not know that, if this is a purely patriotic desire coming from a protectionist, it is a desire that the number of supplements shall not be decreased, but that they shall be manufactured within the States <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Consequently, the whole thing is unreal. I warn honorable members sitting behind the Government, whom we have treated fairly, that if they vote in this party spirit to-night, they will probably, to a large extent, put an end to all that friendly political feeling which ought to exist in connexion with Bills of this kind, and which no  honorable member of this Chamber has done more than I have done to try to create here. This is going beyond the amenities of public life. lt is going beyond all the traditions of party warfare, and while I do not know how it will affect me individually, I shall be responsible in the future if this party is more pugnacious and aggressive than it has been. Honorable members on the other side have thrown down the gauntlet prematurely and unfairly and they must take the consequences. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. PIESSE</inline>(Tasmania).- To my mind it does not matter very much whether the amendment is inserted or not. The supplement, if it conforms to what we have agreed to, will have to be a supplement which is printed in the Commonwealth. All this heroic talk we have been having is utterly beside the mark. The honorable member for Bourke has been a little over-cautious in proposing words which to a great extent it is not necessary to put in. The clause already provides that a newspaper, to be a newspaper within the meaning of die Bill, shall be a newspaper printed and published within the Commonwealth. I suppose the honorable member for Wentworth will allow that a newspaper may have an illustration on it. If it be so, the illustration must be printed within the Commonwealth, and if the spirit and the intention of the law is carried out, the supplement will have to be set up within the Commonwealth. The precedent for these words, as to newspapers is to be found in the English Act. Section 6 of the Act, 34 find 35 Vic, chapter 79, says - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Any publication coming within the following description shall, for the purpose of this Act be deemed a newspaper, that is to say, any publication consisting wholly or in part of political or other news, or of articles relating thereto, or to other current topics, with or without advertisements, subject to these conditions : - </para>
                    <para>That it be printed and published in the United Kingdom. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>If the newspaper is printed and published in the Commonwealth, the conditions which the honorable member for Bourke desires to insert in this clause will have been complied with in regard to the major part of the publication. Sp far as I can see, the words are not necessary. If honorable members had really considered the due proportion which this proposal bears to the measure, I think they would have saved us a great deal of unnecessary heat and a great deal of this unnecessary warning. </para>
                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HUME</inline>COOK (Bourke). - I think the honorable member for Tasmania has hardly grasped the purport of my amendment. If he will look at the clause again, he will find that a definition has been given to a newspaper, and a definition to a supplement. The definitions vary, and it is the proposed addition to the definition of a supplement which has excited the wrath and ire of honorable members opposite. I wish to emphasize the position which has been stated by the Prime Minister and others that the effect of my amendment is to make the supplement the complement of the newspaper, and not to distinguish between them. It has also a further effect, and that effect is not sought to be made out of any spirit of mischief, as the honorable member for Wentworth has asserted, but because I have a desire to help Australian workmen and authors, and have not disguised that fact. Honorable members have claimed not to have had any notice, to have been taken by surprise, and to be astonished that the Government have accepted the proposal. My amendment has been printed for a week, and no doubt it has been circulated amongst the honorable members on the other side. How can they know or have any indication of what, amendments the Government are going to accept ? Honorable members, on their own side, have had propositions accepted ; it is just possible that some propositions from this side will be accepted. The Government do not always refuse to accept suggestions from their own supporters, although they sometimes accept them from honorable members opposite. The contention that this amendment is sneaking in protection is hardly fair. I have heard some honorable members on the other side aver with respect to the kanaka traffic and black, labour generally that it has nothing to do with the fiscal issue, and that when protectionists: have claimed that it has they are entirely in. error. The same kind of argument applies: with equal force to this amendment. It is. a matter of internal administration. It does net deal with the fiscal issue; it does not impose a duty ; all it does is to give a chance to Australian workmen in preference to those who live in America, Germany, or other countries. </para>

I am endeavouring to do something which, I think, will assist the workers and authors within the Commonwealth. We have been told that we should deal with this question on the Tariff. How can we deal with a postal matter on the Tariff? This is the time to deal with it. Other States have dealt with this question in precisely the same way in similar circumstances, and, as a matter of fact, in precisely the same words. Under all these circumstances I am at a loss to understand the heat and vigour which has been put into the objections raised by the other side. I had no intention to raise the fiscal issue. I had no intention to take an unfair advantage of honorable members opposite ; but because it is raised, and because honorable members choose to take that view, I am not going to withdraw the amendment. I am going to rely on the strength of the Government to help me to cany it. Of course it is always unfair when the minority protest, and it is always right when the majority can carry the proposal. I am with the majority on this occasion, and I believe the proposal is a right one. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for Bourke submits that because we have passed, after a division, a provision which stipulates that a newspaper shall mean a newspaper which is printed and published within the Commonwealth, we should also pass this provision, which says not only that a supplement shall be printed in the Commonwealth, but that it shall be printed from type set up within the Commonwealth, or from stereotypes or electrotypes made therefrom. There is a very considerable difference between the two provisions. In the first place, we have passed sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">{a),</inline> providing that the newspaper must be printed and published within the Commonwealth to enable it to be carried by the Post-office, much against the wish of many honorable members on this- side, who can see that it is liable to prevent the circulation of English newspapers on which postage has already been paid to Australia. A person will be debarred from sending such newspapers through the post. </para>

                        <para>- A person who receives a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Weekly Times</inline> and desires to send it to a constituent, will be forced to pay four dr five times the postage he would have to pay on the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> If that is the way in which some honorable members think it best to disseminate knowledge or educate the people it is not my way of thinking. But the interpretation of a newspaper provides that it has to be printed and published within the Commonwealth. It does not say that it has to be printed and published from type set up within the Commonwealth or from stereos token from that type. All the extract matter for any newspapers published here could be imported and would still come within the definition ; so that the amendment in regard to supplements does go a great deal further than the interpretation of a newspaper. On the one hand the bulk of any newspaper, except the mere local topics, could be printed from imported stereos, and would come under the definition of a newspaper. Although the honorable member for Bourke says that he has no intention to introduce the fiscal issue by a side wind, in the next breath he admits that his object is to protect the printers, authors, and writers in the Commonwealth against outside competition. He not only goes for protection in its widest form, but he goes still further and makes it absolute prohibition. In a Bill of this kind it is of the utmost importance to avoid the introduction of debatable matter, which must be dealt with when the fiscal issue is submitted. The desire of the Post-office, I take it, is to give the greatest facilities to the people of the various portions of the Commonwealth for the transmission of letters and newspapers. So long as this traffic can be conducted, if not perhaps on strictly commercial lines, at any rate so as not to involve the States in any financial difficulty or large pecuniary loss, it appears to me that the object of the Bill will be achieved. To introduce into its discussion an element of discord, such as has been introduced by the amendment, has been, I think most honorable members will admit, a very grave mistake, because honorable gentlemen are anxious to deal with these machinery Bills as speedily as is possible, with due regard to their careful consideration. </para>

                        <para>- What we are seeking to do in the clause is to give special postal facilities to newspapers, as distinguished from other printed matter. But, while we may be willing to give these facilities to newspapers which are printed from plates made in our own country, and therefore, presumably, contain matter of special interest to our people, it does not follow that we should give them to foreign newspapers ; so that, in the ordinary sense of the term, I do not think the amendment affects the fiscal question at all. The carrying of the amendment will not place any extra burden on the people who buy newspapers containing these supplements. </para>

In illustration of the statement that the reduction of the cost of production does not guarantee a reduced price to the consumer, I would point out that, although the New South Wales Parliament took off the excise duty from tobacco some months ago, the price of tobacco there has not been reduced. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MAHON</inline>(Coolgardie). - If the honorable member for Bourke moved the amendment in a spirit of mischief, he has achieved his object, because it has been productive of a very stormy and heated debate. The acceptance of the amendment shows that the Government are willing; to go out of their way - as I pointed out during the second-reading debate - to mix up in these machinery Bills attacks upon the liberty of the press and of the subject, and now we have an attack upon the fiscal policy which a large number of honorable members were sent here to defend. The pretence that the amendment has nothing to do with the fiscal question is an idle one, because, as a matter of fact, it goes further than any fiscal proposal usually goes, and actually prohibits foreign manufactures. But do not honorable members know that scarcely a newspaper supplement in Australia is imported? During my time I have read nearly every newspaper published in Australia, and I have never come across a newspaper which systematically circulated foreign supplements. </para>

                        <para>- Not quite. If honorable members object to the stereotypes coming here, they should also object to the paper coming. The honorable member is not qualified to pose as an authority on the printing and publication of newspapers. Of what use is the amendment, unless it is anticipated that large numbers of foreign supplements will be imported into Australia in the future. If the Ministry are well advised, they will recede from the position they have taken up in regard to the amendment;. Even if the committee accept it, is this protectionist morsel likely to be swallowed in another place? We are bound, as practical men, to consider whether another representative Chamber, whose members were elected on the widest franchise possible, will accept a pill of this kind. Honorable members all round the Chamber have hitherto helped the Government with these machinery Bills, and therefore I appeal to them to withdraw their support from the amendment. I have voted frequently with the Government on this Bill, and I hope to do so again whenever they are right. But if they are going to make this question a party one, a good many honorable members who have supported them may have to change their attitude. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMAS</inline>(Barrier).- I think that the Government have made a mistake in accepting the amendment, because I believe that the functions of the Post-office should be limited to the carrying of mails, letters, and parcels. That department has quite enough to do to attend to its own business. A matter of this sort should be dealt with in another Bill. I know that a similar provision has been operative in New South Wales for a considerable time, but I always objected to it. As a result of that law the Christmas supplements had to be practically manufactured in Australia. Thus, instead of getting firstclass up-to-date supplements, the people have had to be content with inferior ones. Whilst anxious that all the work which can be done in Australia should be given to the compositors who are working here, I say that the employes in the country newspaper offices will not share in that work. The whole of this class of work is done in Sydney, Melbourne, and the other large cities. In order to provide work for the men whom I desire to serve, I should like to see the amendment extended to provide that the matter shall be set up by the compositors employed in the office which is issuing the supplement. If the honorable member for Bourke will go as far as that I shall vote with him. A little further on in the clause honorable members will find that this provision does not apply to coloured illustrations. What is the matter with black ink? On the 1st July last, a gentleman started a trade journal called the <inline font-style="italic">Saddlery and Harness Journal.</inline> He went to the General Post-office, Sydney, and said - &#34;I want to send a supplement through the post. This supplement specifies how to make buggy saddles. It is a pattern of buggy saddles drawn to scale.&#34; The authorities said - &#34;It cannot go through, because it is in black ink.&#34; The man had, therefore, to pay &#163;5 extra to send this paper through the New South Wales Post-office. On 1st August another issue was published containing a supplement giving hints upon bridle making. It was printed in black ink, but the man put the words &#34; see letterpress &#34; upon it, and by that simple act secured its free transmission through the post. It seems ridiculous to impose all these restrictions. We ought simply to recognise the Post-office as a carrier. I should like to see first class up-to-date supplements issued with the different journals at Christmas time. It would be a good! thing if some of these fine pictures could be hung up in the selectors&#39; homes, because people resident in the back blocks cannot visit our art galleries as we can. If this provision be carried, we shall have only daubs of pictures transmitted throughout the country. The English papers contain magnificent supplements at Christmas time, and I would like to see them available in </para>

                    <para>- I should like to ask the honorable member for Barrier how we are to get the fine artistic supplements of which he spoke unless we encourage our own artists ? We are legislating specially for a certain&#39; production. We propose, I presume, to make special rates for the carriage by the Postal department of a certain class of publications. It is proposed that Inter-State newspapers shall be carried at a lower rate because they disseminate news amongst the people of the Commonwealth. The honorable member for Coolgardie said that the imposition, of this restriction would result in the people getting an inferior article. I claim, however, that the press of Australia compares very favorably with that of any other part of the world. The <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> is always referred to as one of the best papers of its kind that :is published anywhere. The Christmas supplements of the <inline font-style="italic">Australasian,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Town cmd Country Journal,</inline> and other newspapers compare very favorably with those produced in the old country. But I would point out that the mere setting of the type and the making of the stereos from that type is not all that is involved in the amendment. The honorable member for Coolgardie said that the supplements were not imported, but that the stereotype blocks were. I am aware of that. I know that in Queensland the law in this respect has been a dead letter. Any one engaged in the printing trade knows that we can get any amount of stereotype blocks for advertising patent medicines from America and England. We should endeavour as far as possible to provide work, not only for the compositors here, but for the authors and artists which Australia is capable of raising, and who hitherto have had to go to other ;parts of the world in order to obtain employment. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the Ministers will adopt the very excellent advice offered by the honorable member for South Sydney. He has pointed out - justly enough - that if Ministers would adhere to their Bill the_amendment would be withdrawn. I cannot but commiserate with the Minister in charge of this measure for having been got at so completely by a protectionist move on the part of the honorable member for Bourke. He seems to have dropped into the trap in the most innocent way. He pleaded that the treason he welcomed an amendment of this : sort is because it would reduce the weight of the matter to be sent through the post. T hope, however, that honorable members by a majority will resist it, and allow us to deal with the fiscal question as a plain straightout issue when the oft-promised Tariff is submitted. I feel strongly that we should do everything we possibly can to secure the circulation amongst the people of the best form of illustrated literature. I believe with the honorable member for Barrier that the homes of the settlers would be made all the happier by the introduction of such literature. </para>

I quite admit that honorable members are justified in raising the Tariff issue whenever it appears, but surely after the speech which has been delivered by the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse,</inline> there is not one in this Chamber who does not clearly see that the debate started under a misapprehension. As the Bill stands, the purpose of the honorable member for Bourke has been achieved. The strongest argument against the insertion of these words is that they are npt wanted. What is the use of proceeding further with this discussion. I am quite sure that honorable members feel that their time is valuable. Surely they want to have the debate terminated at some reasonable time. The only unfairness I have found in the honorable member for South Sydney was this evening when he accused the Government of not having stopped the debate. If the Prime Minister had rebuked the other side for all this talk, he would have been charged with bullying the committee. It is unfair to the Government to accuse them of not aggressively trying to stop the debate. I think they have allowed the question to be discussed so as to prove conclusively the uselessness of the discussion. </para>

The whole ot this discussion, so far as it has proceeded from the other side, has been, if not a careful blinking, at least a careful forgetfulness of the real issue. The real issue is whether this part of the clause should be brought into conformity with the preceeding part, which was carried by thirty-one to fifteen on a division. It has been urged by the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. V.</inline> L. Solomon, that the words &#34;printed and published in the Commonwealth,&#34; in subclause <inline font-style="italic">(a),</inline> are very different from the words which the honorable member for Bourke wishes to put into this sub-clause. We will test that question. The words of the amendment are - 1 </para>

If that were the amendment there would be twice as much noise about it as there has been about this amendment, yet those are the very words which would bring the one thing into absolute conformity with the other. That is the test, and it establishes that the objection is to the attempt at uniformity, and not to the mere form of words. The committee has, by two to one, carried subclause <inline font-style="italic">(a),</inline> which it was attempted to leave out, and the question now is whether a supplement should, for good or for ill, share the fate of the newspaper - that is to say, whether there is any reason that the Opposition can advance to distinguish a supplement in such a way from the newspaper that the newspaper, unless it conforms 11b to certain conditions, shall not be a newspaper within the meaning of the Act, and yet a supplement, without any conditions whatever, is to be part of a newspaper within the meaning of the Act. That is the whole matter of reason which is involved. Let us look at the matter sensibly and fairly in the face. That does not depend on any fiscal conditions. If there was anything to be attacked on the score of fiscal conditions it was sub-clause (a) ; it was not attacked on those conditions, and it was carried by two to one. If the committee is not going back on its decision, it will absolutely adopt this amendment, or an amendment like it, to bring the two things into something like uniformity, or it will say that the main thing is under this definition not to be a newspaper, and yet that a. thing which belongs to it is, under the same definition, is to be a part of a newspaper. </para>

Therefore, that question is absolutely disposed of, and notwithstanding what is much nearer to bluster than anything that I perpetrated, and notwithstanding the taunts we have received, as to our intelligence and other qualities, we intend to divide on the amendment, and leave the country to decide as to the fair play or otherwise which we have received from the other side. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has absolutely condemned the Ministry for the waste of time. We naturally looked upon this amendment as anticipating the Tariff. Who would be the best judge of what was intended in that connexion ? Surely it would be the mover of the amendment, and did he not confirm our attitude when he stated that he moved it for a protective purpose? That being so, there is a breach of faith by the Ministry in stating that this was a non-party question, and allowing an admittedly party issue to be introduced, and standing to it when their own supporters say that it makes no difference at all. There is no justification for the attitude which the Ministry has taken. It is not a proper return for the manner in which they have been treated by the Opposition. We having raised the objection that the acceptance of the amendment was a breach of faith, the Ministry, knowing that this matter could be dealt with in the Tariff, should have withdrawn their support from it. </para>

The amendment is a protectionist, move ; but, if I were a. protectionist, I should be ashamed of stopping short where it does. All the protection secured to the Australian workman is in regard to the setting up of a few letters on a supplement. There is no prohibition of the importation of expensive lithographic work which employs so much labour. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. That Act was introduced by a protectionist Ministry for protectionist reasons, but we have been asked to treat this Bill as though it were not a party measure. It has been stated that the free-trade Ministry which held office in New South Wales after the passing of the Act did not repeal that provision, but that was because it had many other important matters to deal with, just as the present protectionist Ministry there finds itself unable to reverse the free-trade policy of its predecessor. I have not dealt with Government measures in a party spirit, but have tried to improve them, and have supported where I could, and spoken as briefly as possible; but the only consideration this side gets is that the fiscal question is allowed to be raised in a machinery Bill, which we have been honestly and fairly treating as a non-party measure, by an amendment which the Prime Minister should have requested his supporter to withdraw. </para>

It would have been more logical for the Government, if they believe that the amendment is inconsequential, to use their influence to obtain its withdrawal. If honorable members on this side feel that the gage of battle has been thrown down by the moving of the amendment, they are justified in accepting it. The Government have given no just and sufficient reason for the amendment, and I intend to vote against it. </para>

                    <para>- The views of honorable members opposite seem to vary very much. The Minister in charge of the Bill has told us that he accepted the amendment in order to carry out the intention that the postal service should be conducted on commercial lines, but the mover of the amendment said that he moved it in order to encourage the Australian worker, by which he appears to mean the artisan who sets the type, and not the man who has the brains to compose the literary matter which is printed. Then the honorable and learned members for Northern Melbourne and Tasmania say that there is nothing in the amendment. But, as it has come from a member who sits directly behind the Ministry, the Government apparently do not like to reject it. The Opposition have been twitted with having raised the fiscal question, but we were told by the mover of the amendment that his intention was to raise the fiscal issue. </para>

If what the Prime Minister spoke of were carried out, and every newspaper were compelled to print its supplement in its own office, there would be something in this suggestion ; but, as the amendment stands, its only effect will be to compel the&#39; smaller newspapers to obtain their supplements from printing firms in the large cities of Australia. If they can get better supplements from elsewhere, why should they not do so 1 Why should not Australian writers and printers be prepared to enter into competition with writers and printers of other places <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                <para>Standing Order No. 267 clearly provides that a report of any speech during the current session shall not be read, and I take it that the honorable member for Macquarie having assured me that he intends to read a report of such a speech that has been taken down in shorthand, his proposed action comes clearly within the scope of this standing order. The honorable member for Macquarie would be quite in order in referring to anything that the honorable member for Bourke may have said during his speech, and he can reply to him in any way possible within the limits of the standing orders ; but when he proceeds to read directly from a report of the honorable member&#39;s speech he is out of order. </para>

                <para>I do not think that that applies to a shorthand note taken by an honorable member himself - that is neither a book nor a newspaper. If. the standing order did so apply it would be absurd and against all usages, and the House would be stultifying itself by assenting to any such proposition until all means are exhausted of coming to some contrary decision. The practice of taking a note either in longhand or shorthand of remarks during a debate to which it is desired to reply, is one which, I am sure, every honorable member in .the State Parliaments and in this Parliament has frequently followed, and I am sure that you will not take umbrage at something like an authoritative ruling being obtained upon this point by referring it to the Speaker. </para>

I refer to this because, as leader of the House, I feel myself bound not to take any party side upon a matter of this kind. That standing order means that the committee decides when the Chairman of Committees decides. It seems clear, therefore, that the matter must be settled in the committee, and by the committee itself.

                        <para>- Tn the House of &#34;Commons - the mother of Parliaments - the actual decision is never given by the Speaker. There is no such thing there as a &#34; ruling &#34; in the sense of a decision by way of law. Whatever the Speaker says in the House of Commons is merely an expression of his opinion. He is the mouthpiece or spokesman of the House of Commons, and the House always has the reserve power of taking its own course, whatever the Speaker does. That power is secured to the committee by Standing Orders 227 and 228. I should be the last to say that there is not the reserve power in this committee to dissent from the decision of the Chairman of Committees. I say that when we give the Chairman the same powers as are given to the Speaker, and no more, we give him the power to be the mouth-piece of the committee, and to be subject to the decision of the &#39;committee in all his utterances. I hope that the right honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, will consider my remarks as divested of any colouring derived from the debate which we have just gone through. I merely feel it incumbent upon me to state my opinion. Any one who has studied the proceedings of the House of Commons- knows absolutely that the  Speaker  is only the mouth-piece of the House, and that the House can always decide for itself, notwithstanding what is called the &#34; decision &#34; of the  Speaker.  That is so clear that it justifies from day to day the statement that  Speaker  Lenthall made to Charles I., when he said that he had neither eyes to see nor ears to hear save as the House should direct. I am pleading for the right of the House, in the one case, and. for the right of the committee in the other. Where the standing orders give the same right to the committee as to the House, the committee can decide without the intervention of the  Speaker.  I say no more than that. This &#39;deliberative assembly has the right to control its own officers in case of its dissenting from their decision. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister is entirely of the opinion which I hold. The decision of this matter- is in the hands of a majority of the committee. Speaking on the point of order which has been raised, I would suggest that Standing Order 266 does not touch it in any way whatever. I speak from eighteen ^years&#39; parliamentary experience, and I have over and over again in conformity with rule and order done what the honorable member for Macquarie proposes to do. That is to say, I have read from a written report, or a written memo., what has been said by somebody in the course of debate. If we are to have anything like accuracy of debate, by all means if it be possible, let every honorable member who wishes to quote another get his <inline font-style="italic">ipsissima</inline><inline font-style="italic">verba</inline> taken down in shorthand. But the standing order upon which the Chairman relies relates to the reading from a book or paper of something touching a debate which has previously occurred, and which- is not now occurring. I hope that this committee will not suffer such a stifling of debate, and will not sacrifice its freedom of speech in such a way as would be the case if this ruling were upheld. </para>

An honorable member cannot bring up a question which Parliament has decided, just as in many Parliaments he cannot introduce the same BUI twice in the same session. But here is a question upon a debate which is pending. The point involved here is whether an honorable member is entitled to get, in any way he chooses, the exact words of a speaker, so as to be able to rebut his argument. </para>

Upon their face these standing orders appear to provide that no extract can be read from a debate in the same session, even if it were from the same debate. We are told that no honorable member shall read from a printed newspaper or book the report of any speech made in Parliament during the same session. That applies no doubt only to printed newspapers or books which were-the foundation of the original rules of- the House of Commons. Those rules were founded upon the old theory that strangers were supposed to take no part in the debates of the House, and therefore were not to report them.

                <para class="block">So far as these standing orders go, they seem to state the matter on the bare principle prevailing in the House of Commons, which is no doubt apart from referring to any previous debate in the same session. Apart from that matter, they seem to deal with the question of reading from printed newspapers, books, or extracts, except Standing Order 270, which prevents allusion to any debate of the current session. I take it that the last named standing order refers to previous debates. The question therefore rests on Standing Orders 267 and 268, which do not necessarily refer to the same thing. On page 308 of <inline font-style="italic">May&#39;s Practice</inline> occurs a passage which I have not the least doubt has guided the  chairman  in the opinion which he has expressed.

That, I admit, does not cover the whole ground. The real point is that we are all entitled to canvass the arguments of each other as freely as possible, otherwise this would be no House of Parliament. The question is whether the rule of the House of Commons, which prevents the reading from extracts or newspapers - which rule is founded upon what is, no doubt, a principle now growing obsolete, that is the objection that strangers should not take notes - applies to the reading of an extract from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> There is a great deal more in this case if honorable members will bear with me.

This rule,, indeed, applies strictly to all debates whatsoever, the publication of them being a breach of privilege, but of late years it has been relaxed by general acquiescence in favour of speeches delivered in former sessions. It is also irregular to read extracts from newspapers, letters, or other documents referring to debates in the House in the same session. </para>

With every desire, sir, to uphold the constitutional authority and the ruling of the Chair, I think it is a-matter on which you may well hear debate from honorable members before giving your final opinion. While this ruling appears to be strictly within the letter of the standing orders so far as the reading of newspaper reports and extracts is concerned - because that rule of the House of Commons really applies to the current debate, as well as to former debates, on the objection to reading from extracts from newspapers generally which prevails there - still, we must remember that in these Australian Parliaments we have gone a great deal further than thai; - that some of these rules are to some extent obsolete, and unless you find yourself bound by the form of these standing orders to bring this case within that rule of the House of Commons, to which I have alluded, I am quite sure that you will do all you can to liberate debate- in this particular, and not to prevent the reading of any extract of this kind. </para>

For the sake of greater accuracy I read a true and correct account of what the honorable member for Bourke stated. I may have used the word &#34; report,&#34; but a report is really a statement of what took place. I pointed out that if we are to be debarred from making any reference to the speeches made by honorable members on the question then before the committee, it would place us in a very awkward position. Honorable members, I take it, are only anxious to know the truth of this matter. </para>

I do not think, however, that that rule has ever been used to prevent -a member from reading the notes of a speech delivered during the same debate. It has not been so applied in the New South Wales Legislature, nor do I think that our standing orders are capable of an interpretation which makes them applicable in the case .which we are now considering.

                        <para>- Honorable members know that I have been, very anxious to make progress to-night, but a discussion, has taken place which has prevented us from doing so - and I say that without casting any blame on members of either party. This important point having arisen, I think it is worthy of the utmost attention, and I am about to propose that we now report progress, although I do not wish honorable members to infer that I am taking that course because I am satisfied with the progress which we have made. I have endeavoured to take a non-party attitude with regard to this point of order, which, in my opinion, hinges upon two of our standing orders. In my opinion, Standing Order 26S refers to extracts from newspapers or other documents commenting on debates, and, therefore, I think we must look for guidance to Standing Orders 266 and 267. The first of these refers, I think, to previous debates, because it says that - </para>

                <para class="block">The next standing order possibly refers to the reading of the reports of speeches delivered in the debate then proceeding. But it is clear that what the honorable member for Macquarie was reading from was not &#34; a printed newspaper or book,&#34; and therefore the question arises, does it come within the standing order ? I would suggest to the Chairman of Committees whether he can go behind the limitation of the standing order to &#34;printed newspapers and books,&#34; and rule that, according to the unwritten law of Parliament, by which, we are bound in matters not specifically provided for in our standing orders, the same mischief arises - I do not use the word in a controversial sense - by reading from a document which for purposes of reference occupies the same position as &#34; printed newspapers and books.&#34; A quotation was about to be made from some shorthand note, we do not know whether it was that of a newspaper reporter or of one of our <inline font-style="italic">own Ilansard</inline> reporters - that is perhaps another difficulty, and I mention all these grounds for the reason that I think we owe it to ourselves to suspend these proceedings now, and report progress, to give you, sir, an opportunity of considering the matter, and giving a decision, as I am sure you will, in perfect fairness to the committee, and without any desire in the least degree to take away from the privilege of freedom of speech. I say that where it is a question of freedom of speech in this House, I shall be found on the side of freedom. There is nothing in the course I suggest now that can work against that in the least degree, and my only desire is to have a considered decision upon an important point. I therefore move - </para>

                        <para>- If this question is to be decided, it is only fair to the Chairman that the motion dissenting from the ruling of the Chair should state properly the grounds of the- decision given. I call attention to the fact that the motion which has been submitted by the honorable member for Bland does not state really the gist of the Chairman&#39;s decision. As I understood it, the gist of the decision was that an extract or a report was read, purporting to be a shorthand record, which had not been made within the walls of this chamber, but which had emanated from an outside source. &#39; </para>

The Chairman&#39;s I ruling was with respect to a report which emanated from an outside source, and he did not rule that an honorable member could not, read a note of his own or a note taken by another honorable member. The honorable: member commenced his speech by a flourish, of a report, and it was quite open to the inference of the Chairman, as well as the inference of every other honorable member present, that the honorable member had procured that report from an outside source. I think it was quite competent for the Chairman to rule that an honorable member has &#39;no right to go outside the Chamber for records or reports, and then come down and use them authoritatively. &#34;What I am submitting is. that when this motion dissenting from your ruling is put from the Chair,, care should be taken that the ruling is properly expressed. </para>

                        <para>- I am really astonished! that the honorable member for Bendigo,, who should be a&#39; constitutional authority,, should put forward such an extreme idea in this committee as that the Chairman is to* rule on inference or assumption. I have always heard the Chairman and the Speaker take the very opposite course, and say that,, although so and so might be the case, it was. not within their knowledge, and they had no right to take cognisance of it. That is. the proper course to pursue. If we are to. have our standing orders so wrested that, we may go beyond the question at issue,-and beyond what is within the knowledge of the Chairman or of the committee, and take inferences or assumptions to any degree that, a Chairman or Speaker likes, then all. freedom of debate in this Chamber is gone. Whilst I say that, and say also that outstanding orders are an exact reproduction of what <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> states, and do not provide in anyway for stopping an honorable member quoting from such a report as was quoted from in this instance, I still quite agree with the Prime Minister that it would be well to leave the matter over. I am sure we are all quite willing to give the  Chairman  every opportunity for consideration. We are sure of this also, that he has. not decided from any other motive but the best, and, if he has made an error, he has made it in all innocence, and we can give him an opportunity to consider the&#187; matter further. </para>

                        <para>- Before you put the motion that the committee report progress, sir, I will ask you whether it is competent for you to put it. I understand that the usual practice in discussing dissent from a ruling of the Chairman is to refer the matter to the Speaker, and it may be competent for progress to be reported for that purpose. &#39; Now you, sir, are clothed with the same authority as the Speaker, and you have a motion dissenting from your ruling. You propose now, on the suggestion of the Prime Minister, to take another motion, which is really an amendment, if it is anything at all, to report progress. If the committee like to allow the Chairman&#39;s ruling to stand without interference, that will only follow out the Prime Minister&#39;s statement that the House of Commons in the last analysis has the right to overrule the decisions of both the Chairman of Committees and the Speaker, though in practice the House does not exercise that power. We have the power to dissent from the ruling of the Chairman, and the honorable member for Bland has moved that one of the Chairman&#39;s rulings be dissented from. Now we are asked to report progress. I am only putting it whether it is in order for the Chairman to report progress when there is a distinct motion before the Chair that the Chairman&#39;s ruling be dissented from. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt in my mind on the subject at all. Standing Order 238 makes provision that a Minister can at any time propose a motion that progress be reported. I do not think there is any honorable member, no matter on which side of the House he sits, but will say that in a question of this kind there should be full opportunity for consideration. It is a question of the interpretation of the provisional standing orders. I wish, not only for my own sake, but for the sake of good order in the future, that a little more time should be given for the consideration of the matter. Before putting the motion I wish to repeat - as a misapprehension evidently exists in the mind of the honorable member for Macquarie - that had the statement been made at the time that has now been made by the honorable member I should have ruled differently. I did not far one moment attempt to take up the position that any honorable member was. precluded from taking notes either in shorthand or in any other manner, and quoting from those notes during a debate upon any question. </para>

What I desire is to give a proper decision upon the question before the committee ; and I say that I have a right, under the standing orders, to be satisfied that the manner in which my ruling is put to the committee is the correct one. Had not the honorable member for Macquarie given me the impression that he had obtained the report from outside - had he given me the impression that the report was his own - I should have ruled differently. The honorable member, however, distinctly led me to believe that the document which he was quoting was a shorthand document which he had obtained from outside, and such a document would, under the provisional standing orders, be a document that he was not entitled to quote. </para>

                    <para class="block">I wish to say that the Post and Telegraph Bill will be proceeded with again on Tuesday. In regard to the other matter as to which discussion has already arisen in the House - the apportionment of public time- I wish to indicate that I intend to ask the House to take the following course. In the Senate, the sitting days are Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. I intend to ask this House to sit on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and to forego private business on Tuesday for a few weeks. I shall ask the House to sit at two o&#39;clock on Wednesday and Thursday instead of half -past&#39; two ; and shall also ask them to give me a little more time at night, though I&#39; do not intend to lengthen the sittings to any serious extent. On Fridays I shall ask the House to sit at ten o&#39;clock in the morning, and I suppose the House will not of its own volition be desirous of sitting&#39; later than four o&#39;clock in the afternoon. We shall, however, see about that. This arrangement will enable the two Houses to sit cote&#39;rminously and will result in Ministers being in attendance in both Houses, whilst- it will give honorable members one other day to themselves, and at the same time secure precisely the same time for </para>

                        <para>- I desire to bring under the notice of the Government the present telephone service at Parliament House. The telephones are all, or nearly&#39; all, connected with the local exchange, with the result that honorable members desiring to become connected with the central exchange have to wait for long periods until the telephone attendant at the House, who is also the telegraph operator, is disengaged. This sometimes involves a delay of half-an-hour or even an hour. I brought&#39; this matter under the notice of the Postmaster-General two months ago and pointed out the inconvenience resulting to honorable members who desired to communicate with the public departments in Melbourne. After the lapse of two months I to-day received a letter from the secretary of the Post-office saying that, after having bent their immense energies to the subject for that period, the departmental officers had discovered that the exchange at Parliament House is connected with the central exchange. They say further that any suggestions 1 may have to make with a view to improving the service will receive consideration, but as I made several suggestions two months ago with the result I have already indicated, I do not feel disposed to take up the time of the postal officials with any more suggestions. The letter which I have received reads as follows : - </para>

                        <para>- I desire to call the attention of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to the impossibility of getting anything done to the. post-offices in need of repair in various parts of the country. We are told in New South Wales that the Postal department authorities have no funds with which to carry out ordinary works of maintenance and repairs ; but the Treasurer here tells mo that there are funds, ashe has given the central Federal department &#163;9,000 for that very purpose. Notwithstanding this, I have received a letter stating that the department will be pleased to carry out the very urgent repairs required at a post-office in my constituency when there are funds for the purpose. I think that Ministers might strain a point with a view to insuring that the ordinary every-day requirements in connexion with the post-offices shall be met. </para>

With regard to the telephone service at the Houses of Parliament, I have a good deal of sympathy with the complaints that have been made. It is not for me to say in what condition these matters were before this Government came into office, but I cannot help thinking that a good deal is needed to bring tilings up to date. I need say no more than that, because 1. do not want to be unjust to officials. I promised some information last night, which I forgot to give in moving the adjournment of the House. It is this: That on the 2nd August last I caused the following memorandum to be sent by the Secretary for Defence to the military commandant of Western Australia. </para>
