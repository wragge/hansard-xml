The right honorable gentleman knows that the whole of the shipping interests of the States have been very much agitated because of the form of that Bill, and if the amendments are in the direction of meeting the objections raised against it, they will save that particular branch of commerce a great deal of the trouble which they are now taking to resist it. </para>

                    <para>- I am afraid that I cannot agree to the amendment. I looked into the matter some time ago, and the whole question was discussed when the Bill was going through committee before. With reference to these licences to distil, the position is that those who follow the business, of distillers should not carry on retail business, otherwise there would be opportunities for leakage which should not be permitted. We are providing a limit in connexion with beer, and I think 2 gallons, or twelve bottles, is a fair limit to fix for a. distiller. </para>

                        <para>- I would remind the Minister that at the present time several wine merchants and vignerons in South Australia have the very same facilities, afforded by the State Act as are proposed to be given by the amendment. These facilities, have not been abused under the State law, and they are not likely to be abused under the Commonwealth law. The effect of passing the clause as it stands will be to deprive several wholesale wine merchants and vignerons of the advantages attaching tostorekeepers&#39; licences in South Australia, and I think the Minister ought to accede to a reasonable suggestion. This is not a. matter of splitting the difference, as it appeared to be regarded when the matter was formerly under consideration, and there is no reason why an arbitrary limit should be fixed by the Minister, instead of making the limitation coincide with the State Acts. No State would be injured by the amendment, but there is at least one State that might be injured by making the limitation more than 1 gallon. </para>

If we were to proceed upon the basis of what is the largest and most extensive provision in any State, we should be forced to go to lengths which we should scarcely be able to justify.

There was a protracted debate with reference to this clause on Friday, but I think a number of honorable members were not as fully seized with the importance of the question and its bearings as they are now, after the matter has been more fully discussed in the press and elsewhere.

                <para>The object of that amendment is that no spirit other than that made from the grape shall be added to wine for the purpose of fortification. We desire to keep up the character of Australian wines, and the amendment will bring the Bill into line with the Victorian law at the present time. Furthermore, a Bill is now drafted in New South Wales, and is shortly to be laid before Parliament, containing the same provisions as exist in the Victorian Act. Among the other representations that have been made through the press are those of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gresswell,</inline> the health officer of Melbourne. In to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> it is stated - </para>

                    <para>The Board of Public Health views with great alarm some of the proposals contained in the Distillation Bill now before the Federal Parliament. Speaking at a meeting of the board yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gresswell</inline> said that great danger to the Victorian wine industry existed in the clause providing for the fortifying of wines with potato spirit of a strength of nearly 30 over proof. If such provision should become law &#34;the Australian wine trade would be utterly damned.&#34; </para>
                    <para>Unquestionably, Victoria had produced, and was producing, magnificent wines to be matched with, if not to excel, those that any part of the world could produce. The Victorian market might now be said to be almost free of the stuff that used to be palmed off by unscrupulous vendors, and a physician could with confidence advise his patients - sick, convalescent, and weakly -as to the nourishing and stimulating properties of wines of local production. If the provision referred to became law, however, they might say good-bye to an industry which so many had laboured and expended their all to establish, and which the Government of Victoria had so heavily subsidized. </para>
                    <para class="block">If the proposal were passed it would become Federal law, and the consequence would be that throughout Europe, England and America, it would be believed to be the law of Australia as a. whole ; the Victorian restrictive law would not be specially thought of, and while in this State persons putting fusel oil, aldehydes, and so on, into their wines, were punished, Victoria would derive no benefit from the exceptional purity of its wine. The Victorian trade was a very considerable one, the exports of wine in 1898 amounting to 238,000 gallons; 1899, 362,000 gallons ; and last year, 399,000 gallons. </para>

                    <para>The Victorian Wine Adulteration Act prohibits addition of foreign matter, and makes an exception for pure wine spirit only. The same Act. will very soon be submitted to the New South Wales Parliament, and very likely passed. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I do not wish to read all the letters, but I may say that I have also had a communication in very strong terms from the Wodonga. Wine and Fruitgrowers&#39; Association, others from the vignerons of Rutherglen, the Wine and Fruitgrowers&#39; Association of Corowa, the distillers of Ballarat, the Goulburn Valley Wine and Distillery Company, and a. strongly worded telegram from the Barnawartha Wine Association of Victoria. These communications state that there is a feeling of great alarm amongst vignerons. in the wine-growing districts, as to the clause passing as now drafted, and they ask that an amendment may be made. At present this clause affects South Australia and Victoria more than it does the other States, but these latter are entering into the industry, and we desire that they should enter it under the very best conditions, without the shadow of a suspicion of possible adulteration of the kind which will be permitted under the clause. If it is to go forth that Australian wines, can be fortified with any spirit, we may be sure that the opponents of our wine trade, which has been built up at the cost of a great deal of money and hard work, will use the fact to the great disadvantage of Australian wines. We &#34;have to compete with other countries, and -the clause, if allowed to pass in its present form, will no doubt be made a ground for strong attacks on our wines. We ought to use our wine spirit, and not leave it open to -vignerons to use &#39; the cheap spirit distilled from roots, potatoes, and other material. If we pass a clause providing that pure wine spirit only shall be used, it will be a great help to our wine growers. The matter has been so fully discussed, that I shall not take up further time. </para>

                        <para>- The position I take up is that if we apply this to spirits used under this Bill for fortifying purposes there is no need for it. The only fortification permitted is with spirit, and we have no right to go further. What right have we to say that a man who has cleared spirits, and has wine in his possession, has no right to use those spirits for the purpose of fortifying wine ? </para>

                        <para>- Of course, there are two ways of discussing this matter. On the last occasion I pointed out that I dealt with the broader contention which was raised, and, I think, intended to be raised by honorable members, that under no circumstances whatever should Australian wine be fortified with other than Australian wine spirit. </para>

                        <para>- As regards distillation, the Customs take control for the purpose of excise. When all the duty is paid, if the spirit be used for certain specified purposes, well and good. But do honorable members contend that when a man has wine of his own, and has spirit cleared at whatever duty may be applicable to home consumption, we have aright to go further and say that he shall not use his own spirit to fortify his own wine ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I can. The honorable and learned member has again shifted his ground ; but I will so explain the question that every one may understand it. We have provided for the fortification of wine with wine spirit. We have a right to regulate that as we please, and so we find that under clause 58 more than a certain quantity of spirit cannot be put into wine. Certain privileges are given, and the Customs keep control, saying that no more than a certain quantity of spirits shall be used in that way. It is a fair provision, or otherwise the character of the wine might be so changed as to be practically turned into spirit. But honorable members want to go further and say that, although a man may have cleared his spirits and paid all duty on them, he shall not use any other than wine spirit anywhere, or under any circumstances for wine fortification. That is the broad point at issue. </para>

First the honorable and learned member for Indi says that because we say that a man cannot fortify with a spirit of more than a certain strength, we are equally entitled to say that he shall not be allowed to fortify with any other but wine spirit. We are entitled to do nothing of the sort. Then the honorable member for Laanecoorie contends that because we say that fortifying spirits from grain shall be of a certain strength and quality, we have a ight to say that no other than wine spirit shall be employed. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members can search the Distillation Acts of the various States right through, and they will not find one word of limitation of the character referred to. As regards South Australia, the vignerons there have the fullest power. Let me tell the honorable member for Melbourne, who has just interjected, that I find that the Victorian Act is the laxest of all the State statutes on this subject. It contains no provision as to the strength of the spirit which must be used, and, although I have not searched through every line and letter of all the Health Acts, a great deal of credit is attributed to legislation upon this subject for which, I understand, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gresswell</inline> is responsible. That gentleman tells us that it was a great pity that this proposal to allow of the use of potato spirit should have been made. Why, it has been shown by the figures quoted that the quantity of wine spirit used by distillers in Victoria is but a Small portion indeed of the total spirit which they produce. The proposal under consideration is to forbid the use of any other spirit and to force vignerons to use only grape spirit. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rowan</inline> puts it that under the provisions of this Bill the vignerons will be able to get rid of their &#34;off&#34; wines by distilling them. Those wines are to be utilized for the purpose of turning out this spirit. </para>

                        <para>- Then I must congratulate honorable members upon the rapidity with which the reputation of Victorian wines has been built up. The British public apparently read the legislation upon the subject, and did not care at all for their own particular taste. They took this section out of a whole lot of other sections and were satisfied. </para>

                        <para>- I have been trying to discover the original Victorian Act bearing upon this subject. I told my officers to be sure that they gave me the original Act, which I find is dated 1 7th October, 1 900. I do not claim to have that acquaintance with Victorian legislation which some honorable members possess, but this morning I acquainted myself with the legislation which has been passed dealing with this matter, and my officers assure me that this is the first Act. This is <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gresswell&#39;s</inline> famous Act. So that within 11 months, by the sheer force of passing a measure of this sort, Victoria has gained a reputation which formerly she did not possess. I always believed that there was a preference for old wine rather than for new, but evidently the English public have had only new wine since the passage of this Act. What extraordinary taste some people must possess if they sampled that wine to such an extent as to induce them to affirm that the reputation which Victoria previously enjoyed was not worthily won. No provision of this sort has ever before been found in any Distillation Act. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing that we have a right to put into any Act. The remark of the honorable member for Echuca, that one State has dealt with this matter whilst another State intends dealing with it, shows that the States consider that their powers extend so far. Let them exercise those powers. We have a right to look to everything in connexion with excise. We have a right to give certain privileges. We have given certain privileges interpreting the Bill in its broadest sense in regard to the fortifying of wines with grape spirit. I do not think that we ought to go further. </para>

He filled a very distinguished position at the University of Oxford, and came out here mainly for personal health reasons. During the whole of the time that he has been connected with the Government of Victoria he has shown upon every occasion not only a keen appreciation of the very responsible duties attaching to his office as chairman of the Board of Health, but also that he is a strictly honorable and impartial man. Any utterance which comes from him is accepted by the people of Victoria, at any rate, as an utterance which is strictly in accord with truth, so far as he knows, and they will believe that there is not the slightest attempt on his part to cause any panic amongst the people who drink wine, and that his action is amply justified by the facts of the case. The Minister has attempted to throw ridicule upon the legislation enacted in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- I really think it is not our business at this juncture to discuss the relative merits of the wines produced in any of the several States. I believe that in the old country Australian wines are looked upon as wines grown in any part of Australia. They have a very high reputation. They have not gained that reputation because the vignerons have been allowed to use any kind of spirit for fortification purposes. They have gained it largely on account of the guarantee of purity which is given by the growers. Australian wines have such natural properties that it is unnecessary, except in a very few instances, to sophisticate them in any degree whatever. They are able to stand any test which may be applied to them, and their reputation has been achieved very much for that reason. The Minister attempts to make little of the fears which have been expressed with regard to the future of this great industry should it become known that, after a debate in the Commonwealth Parliament, it has been determined that vignerons and others dealing in wine shall be allowed freedom for the addition of any kind of spirit to their wine for purposes of fortification. The Minister says that the proposed amendment is beyond the scope of the Bill, but surely clause 57 is equally beyond the scope of a. measure relating solely to distillation? I believe, however, that the first thought of the Minister was the right one. His idea was to protect and preserve the reputation of Australian wines. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. I think that that was a right provision. My objection to allowing any kind of spirit to be used for fortification was very much intensified by the reduction of the over-proof standard from 50 to 30 degrees. It must be remembered that in the Bill we give the vignerons a certain advantage. We give them an opportunity of using their own material and their own stills. That is a very great privilege, and one very highly prized by those engaged in the wine industry. Why is the Minister prepared to give that privilege, notwithstanding the great danger that is created by the multiplication of; stills? The Minister is prepared to give it in order to assist the wine industry, because he recognises that that industry is one of the greatest within the Commonwealth. But, while he is prepared to give that privilege with the one hand, he is prepared with the other to place the reputation of Australian wines at the mercy, not only of dishonest vignerons, but also of dishonest merchants who may have &#34; off&#34; wines in their cellars, and, by adding a certain amount of spirit to them, may be able to make them fairly palatable, and thus get rid of them, to the detriment of the public health and the destruction of the reputation of Australian wines generally. </para>

                        <para>-I am aware that we are dealing only with vignerons, but I should be prepared to support an amendment which would deal also with wine merchants. We have given the vignerons a certain privilege, and we have a right to demand that they shall use only such materials as will not have a deleterious effect upon the health of the community. The Minister has changed his ground since Friday last. He then argued that vignerons should have the right to use potato spirit if they desired to do so, and that the reputation of their wines was a matter for their own concern ; he did not think very much about the reputation of the Australian product generally. To-day, however, he uses a stronger argument, when he tells us that, because the Bill does not deal with vignerons in the way we desire, we have no right to attempt to introduce into it an amendment dealing with what may be looked upon as a foreign subject. Clause 57, however, provides that any spirit may be used for fortification so long as it is 30 degrees over proof, and is passed by the Customs officer, and all we ask is the addition of the further provision that it shall be pure wine spirit. I am not concerned with the loss of reputation that may be sustained by any one vigneron or wine merchant. </para>

He has been tried in every way, and has been found one of the best public servants that the State of Victoria has ever had. He is not an alarmist ; he is a sane, well-educated, well-trained, and thoroughly honorable man, whose word is entitled to consideration. He speaks on behalf of the health of the people, and the Minister, who has done so much to protect the great masses of the community from deleterious food and drink, must feel some qualms of conscience because of the attitude which he has now taken. </para>

I am satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gresswell</inline> either did not read the Bill, or failed to apprehend the meaning of its provisions, because he makes statements -I am sure unwittingly - which are not supported) by those provisions. Since the matter was. last debated, I have had the advantage of an interview with some members of the New South Wales Wine-growers&#39; Association who favour the amendment, and, in answer to their representations, I stated that if they could give me one good reason for its acceptance I would reverse my previous vote if the matter came: before the committee again. In my opinion, they failed to do so. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to go into some of the arguments which have been used here, and which practically embrace them. It must be remembered that a reduction has been made in the strength of the spirit which can be used for fortification. That reduction was made largely upon representations from the wine-growers. It is admitted, however, that there is no greater security for the purity of spirit than the highness of its strength. We have reduced its degree over proof. There is a further provision in the measure which allows the Customs authorities, acting under the instructions of the Minister - who will always be in touch with the members of this Chamber - to approve or disapprove of the use of any spirit. Surely that is sufficient protection against adulteration, as long as the feeling of this House is against adulteration. </para>

                        <para>- It is not belief in the Customs officers at all, but it is a belief in the Minister, with the Parliament behind him, and that is as great a security as we can have. Under this Bill there is really no protection offered to the public, because, after the spirit has once left the custody of the Excise department, there is nothing whatever to prevent the admixture of grain or any other spirit with wine unless such -admixture is contrary to the Health Acts of the different States. The States, of course, can draw any distinctions they like, and if they are in earnest, and believe that only grape spirit is wholesome in wine, they, and they alone, can effectively stop the use of any other spirit for fortifica&#34;tion purposes. It has been stated that there is a very great difference between wine spirit and other spirit, but two out of three authorities to whom I have spoken on this subject have admitted that with spirit of a strength of more than 30 deg. over proof there would be no aroma or bouquet that would add any perceptible quality to the wine. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member practically agrees that grape spirit above 30deg. over proof would not impart any particular aroma or bouquet to the wine to which it was added. So far as the potato spirit is concerned, I am quite willing, if honorable members think potato spirit is deleterious, to provide in this Bill against its use for the purpose of fortifying wine ; but I do not see why we should 4*0 beyond that, and say that spirits which are now allowed to be used for other purposes in much larger proportions than in wine, should not be also used for fortification purposes. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It seems to me that it is rather absurd that we should make all this fuss about the grape spirit only being used for the fortification of wine when we allow the consumption of grain spirit in any quantity by the community. It is said that the amendment is to prevent adulteration. The fact is that the use of spirits in three cases out of four - grape spirit or any other spirit - will be simply for the purpose of adulteration so as to cheapen the cost by maturing the wine quickly. We are providing for adulteration all along the line, and I would rather see&#34; a provision in the </para>

                <para>Bill that no spirit should be used unless the Customs authorities approved of its use as being necessary. If we followed that course we should get rid of the use of three-fourths of the spirits, but there would be a tremendous outcry from a certain section of those engaged in the wine industry. While I cannot see the advantage to the public of the amendment, I can quite see the advantage that would follow to the wine industry by giving it the protection that would be secured to it by requiring that only wine spirit should be used for fortification purposes. It is clear that it would protect the vine-grower against the grain-grower. </para>

                        <para>- I am giving my reasons for objecting to make a distinction in favour of wine spirit, and, if the honorable member fails to see any reason for my objection, except a free-trade one, I am failing to express myself properly, or he is unable to appreciate my meaning. The grain-grower might be protected also if it were provided that his spirit might be used for the fortification of wine, but the amendment proposes to confer advantage on the vine-grower as against the grain-grower. Apart from this consideration, a further reason for the amendment is that the still-holders who are raising this question know that there is now only a limited number of vine-growers with stills, and that in future the vinegrowers&#39; stills will be fewer in proportion than now, and that those who possess stills will have a great advantage under the amendment in having not only an outlet for their wines, but in being able to make a considerable profit out of wine-growers who have no stills, and who are compelled to use grape spirit. Of course, so far as grape spirit is concerned we may make an exception in favour of it in connexion with the excise duty; but as matters stand now, if any man wishes to use other spirit than wine spirit he simply pays the duty on the spirit, and can do as he likes. His wine will not be under the control of the Customs if there is no excise on it, and the States alone can pass laws to effect the desired result. </para>

                    <para>- Although the Minister made a pretty good fight for the clause as it stands, he displayed at the same time a great amount of adroitness in fencing the question at issue, because, while he was careful to inform the committee that the Bill made no provision for the use of potato spirit, lie did not tell us in so many words that the Bill does not prohibit the use of that spirit. Under the Bill as it stands, it will be quite competent for any vigneron to go to any distiller and get whatever spirit he likes, and use it for the fortification of his wine. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister and honorable members must recognise that, in connexion with the excise duties, some distinction will be drawn between the amount of duty paid in respect of spirit used for fortification purposes and the spirit that goes into ordinary consumption. It would be manifestly unfair to charge duty on spirit used for the fortification of wines intended for export, and consequently, if there is &#34;to be a distinction, especially from the point of view of export, it follows that the vigneron who has not a still of his own, or is not able to provide himself with the spirits he requires, should be able to buy spirits without being subject to the ordinary rate of duty. With regard to the suggestion of the honorable member for North Sydney, that he would prefer to see a provision prohibiting the use of potato spirit, if it were considered deleterious, rather than that the prohibition should extend to all spirits but those made from the grape, 1 would point out that there are other spirits, such as those made from beet refuse, which are quite as deleterious as potato spirit unless they are distilled up to a very high degree of rectification. As to the argument that the strength of spirits used for fortification purposes should be raised, the view put forward by vignerons is that with spirit of a very high degree of strength, they might as well use potato or any other spirit as that made from the grape. But they say it is the desire of those who wish to see our wine attain a high standard in the markets of the world, to use wine spirit only and of a strength sufficiently low to allow all the characteristics of the wine to be carried through the spirit. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so ; but the contention of those who have been all their lives engaged in distilling and wine-growing is that at that strength it is impossible for the wine spirit to carry all its characteristics - that it becomes a spirit approximating to pure alcohol, and loses all its aroma and bouquet if distilled at a high strength. As to the contention of the Minister that we have no right to go beyond the general outline of the Bill, I would say that if the Minister had been wise lie would, perhaps, have made this a revenue measure only, in which case both clause 57and clause 5S would have been left out. What concern is it to this Parliament, from a revenue point of view, whether Australian wine has more than 35 per cent, or less of proof spirit added to it <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> In clause 57 the statement is absolute and not comparative, there being no such restriction or modification as is shown in the words &#34; under this Act &#34; in clause 58.

                        <para>- The broad term &#34;wine&#34; is used. If the Minister chose to regard this Bill as a purely revenue measure, I should be with him in eliminating all clauses which have no revenue aspect, and it is questionable whether we have a right to regard the measure from any other&#39; aspect. But when in other clauses we deal with the class and quality of the wine allowed to go out from distilleries and places under the control of the Customs, and while we go further and lay down the degree of fortification to be applied to any wine, we are quite justified in following the advice of the health authorities in regard to the class of spirit that shall be added. I trust the committee will see their way to alter the decision arrived at last week. </para>

                    <para>- It is a very strange position that we are in at the present moment. I could not help thinking, when the Minister was speaking on the subject, that perhaps a good deal of his fervour was due to the particular State from which he comes. When he was criticising, in a somewhat sarcastic vein, the substantial provision of the Victorian law - which made an honest and, I believe, perfectly successful attempt to obtain a character for purity for Victorian wine - and when he went on to criticise the verbiage of the Act, quite unnecessarily for his purpose so far as I could see, he seemed to me rather to be departing from the impartial position which a Federal Minister should take up in dealing with a matter affecting all Australia. It will be still more strange to my mind if the other members of the Government vote with the Minister in this matter. It seems to me that the Minister&#39;s own conscience would prevent him from saying that the object sought to be attained by this amendment is a bad one, although he might contend that the amendment would not attain that object. That, however, is no reason for not trying. The objection raised by the Minister is, as the honorable and learned member for Corinella said, one that has been raised hundreds of times&#39; to liberal legislation of various kinds, and the answer I am giving is one that I am sure the Minister has given to opponents of his measures on many occasions.&#34; The amendment is that Australian wine shall not be fortified with anything but pure grape spirit. We are saying that we will allow the distillation of spirits in Australia under federal authority, subject to certain conditions. One of those conditions has already been inserted in clause 58, namely, that the spirits so distilled shall not raise wine to a higher standard than 35 per cent. We now seek to add a further condition that only grape spirit is to be used. </para>

                        <para>- I grant that I am pointing out that we can only affix those conditions in a measure which primarily and substantially deals with taxation. The Minister says he is going to allow spirits to be distilled in Australia under conditions. There may be a general, spirit-maker&#39;s licence, and the spirit-maker, when he takes out the licence, may make spirits from any material he pleases, and the spirits he makes may be used by him, or anybody else,, for any object that is desired. The spirit-maker may be a man of large capital with a large vineyard, and it may pay him under certain circumstances to take out a general spirit-maker&#39;s licence. He may make spirit from anything he pleases, and, unless we put in the amendment, he may use spirits distilled from cheap materials for the fortification of wine. The Minister must see that that would give an. advantage to the large capitalist over the smaller man. I distinctly say that, to my mind, there is absolutely no question of protection or free-trade in -this matter. No one hears of protection or free-trade as between our own people. Protection is against outsiders, and it is a new definition, so far as I understand, for any one to say that protection is given to one class of citizens as against another class. </para>

                        <para>- When a wine is put on the market, it is put forward as the product of the grape, and if it is necessary to fortify wine for the purpose of. preservation, or for the purpose of commerce, let nothing but the grape product be used. When a person purchases wine he understands that he is purchasing a product of the grape, and if fortification with potato spirit or any similar spirit be allowed, the person who thinks he is buying wine is defrauded. The Minister, when he brought down the Customs Bill and included amongst prohibited imports all sorts of things, such as exhausted tea, was taking up a position absolutely inconsistent with his position to-day. He then said he would protect the public of Australia from fraud and imposition at the hands of unscrupulous persons. </para>

                        <para>- I am talking of the inconsistency of the Minister, who has already put into the Bill provisions which are at variance with the position he now takes up. If he had said that he would have nothing to do with the question of distillation, except from a revenue point of view, I should have understood his position, though I should not have agreed with him. But when he says that no Australian wine is to be fortified with spirit, so as to contain more than 35 per cent., I say he has departed from the line of pure revenue. He has taken up a position that is very honorable and praiseworthy, and says to the people of Australia that he is doing what he can to protect them from deleterious articles. I say that that course should be continued. </para>

                        <para>- Look at the absurd position the honorable member is getting into ! He says that the vigneron and wine maker is advocating a course of conduct which compels them to pay more money. All the vigneron wants to do is to conduct his business honestly. He wants to put a wine on the market that the public here and abroad will understand is honest, and contains no admixture of foreign or injurious substances. It is not to be denied that apart altogether from the question of aroma, a great deal depends on whether potato spirit or wine spirit be used. Potato spirit is a dead spirit, and wine mixed with it will not improve. But if the wine spirit be used, though in itself it may be in no sense purer than potato spirit, the wine will improve with age. </para>

                        <para>- I heard the honorable member give reasons, but I did not understand that they were the reasons which had been given to him. If they were reasons given to him by practical men of years of experience, surely - adopting the view advanced by the Minister that the wine-growers know what is best for themselves - we might very well accept the views of the honorable member for North Sydney, and allow the wine-growers to judge whether the reasons are good or not. This is a matter which concerns our reputation. It concerns us not only in Australia, but more nearly outside Australia. What valid reason has been given for not attempting to do what we must admit would be a proper thing if it could be successfully done <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> What fair reason is there for opposing a proposition which has for its object the maintenance of the purity and character of the Australian wines ? We do not want, when we are selling our wines, to give half potato spirit and half the juice of the grape. 1 hope that the Minister will relent, but if not I trust that a sufficient number of honorable members will be found in this Chamber to carry the amendment. Whether we succeed or fail, this will not be the last that will be heard upon this question. I directed the attention of the Minister the other day to the course which was adopted by the American Congress in relation to this matter. I pointed out that very careful, full, and complete measures had been taken in order to compel the maintenance of the purity of American wines. I have invited the Minister to consider those points when he brings down his Tariff proposals. If he does not adopt them, I shall do my utmost to secure their adoption in some shape or form. I hope that the Minister will agree to the taking &#39;of a step that will be of immense assistance to an industry which, if properly fostered - not from the standpoint of protection or freetrade, but from the point of view of the encouragement of our primary producers - will do much to lift Australia out of many difficulties. </para>

                        <para>- I was sorry to hear the opening remarks of the honorable and learned member for Indi. They were entirely undeserved. The honorable and learned member said that, in connexion with this matter, I was forgetting my duty to Australia as a Minister, and was advocating the interests of the State to which I belong. Nothing of the sort ! Such a statement is entirely unwarranted. There is not the shadow of a foundation for it. I never dreamed of such a thing. I venture to think that if the position were properly analyzed, it would be found to be a very different one. In South Australia we have little reason to fortify our wines. We turn out as pure a wine as does any part of Australia, and there is no State in the Commonwealth which indulges less in fortification. Frequent reference has been made to the use of potato spirit. I do not believe that there is a single dram of potato spirit used in South Australia for the purpose of fortification. </para>

                        <para>- I have not heard of it. The Government are desirous of doing whatever they can for the purpose of insuring pure wine. We brought in a Bill providing that no spirit under 50 degrees above proof should be used for the purposes of fortification. That meant that nothing but pure spirit was to be used. That standard was reduced at the instigation of the very gentlemen who are now seeking to influence the committee &#39;in another direction. They said - &#34;Provide this, and there will be a market for our &#39; off&#39; wines.&#34; Now it is said that this &#34;off&#34; wine will be used to distil spirit. That statement has been printed with all openness in the public press. These facts stand out plainly and refute utterly the suggestion which the honorable and learned member for Indi indulged in at my expense. I say let us have pure wine. I am sorry that the standard has been reduced. It has been reduced at the instigation of the vine-growers. As regards other spirits, let us provide, if the committee choose, for a higher test. I shall be only too glad to raise the standard to 50 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- The wine-growers are often too lazy to distil fully. They can re-distil if they choose. It is a question of want of effort, just as very often the necessity arises for the fortification by spirit because the wine is not allowed to properly ferment. It has been suggested that the Government are inconsistent in advocating certain restrictions in the Customs Bill and in opposing them here. There is no inconsistency whatever. What is the position <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Under nearly all Customs Acts there are various prohibitions and limitations as regards goods to be imported. We proceeded on those lines. We did what was usual under the circumstances. To-day we are asked to insert a clause which was never before found in any Distillation Act in Australia. </para>

                <para class="block">The words of the honorable member for Echuca only a few moments ago are an abundant justification of the conduct of the Government. That honorable member thanked the Government for the courtesy they had shown in recommitting the Bill, and properly so. It was a very unusual course to pursue, but as there was a reasonable division of opinion upon this matter it was one that we took. How does that statement agree with the suggestion that more consideration is . being given to State than to Australian interests in dealing with this question ? When I rose first I put it that the provision proposed was not wanted. Honorable members cannot show me a line or word in this Bill which provides for the fortification of wine with potato spirit or with other than wine spirit. I uttered no word of complaint about <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gresswell.</inline> I know his ability, and admire his capacity, but he did not read the Bill or he would never have been guilty of saying what he has said. He has listened too readily to the mistaken view which many outside hold. His opinion has been caught from the tone of the debate rather than from a close study of the Bill itself. He thought that it contained some provision for the use of potato spirit for the fortification of our wines. </para>

                        <para>- If the Bill stands as it is, it is impossible to say that that clause either provides for or permits of it. It was suggested by the honorable and learned member for Corinella that I ought to alter the position of that clause, but I do not think that I ought. As was pointed out by him if it were intended to give a clause of that sort a general application, it would have to be removed to another part of the Bill. The only clause to be found in this Bill in connexion with the fortification of wines is one providing that spirits distilled by vignerons from wine, may be used for the fortification of wine. Under such circumstances to contend that there is provision made for the use of potato spirit is simply ridiculous. What the honorable member for Echuca now seeks to provide is, that even when spirits have been cleared, and the wines and spirits are his own, the vigneron shall not be allowed to use other than wine spirit for the purpose of fortification. Such a proposal is altogether beyond our powers and beyond our rights. </para>

                        <para>- There is no room for getting away from the proposition which I first put. Seeing that the provision made for the fortification of wine within the four corners of the Bill has reference only to wine spirit, we do not want any proposal of the nature submitted. The wine spirit used does not constitute one-tenth of the quantity of spirit which is distilled from general distilleries. The proposal of the honorable member for Echuca does not simply seek to prohibit the use of potato spirit, but it declares that no spirit produced from barley, malt, molasses, or anything else save wine, is to be used for the purposes of fortification. I think that honorable members are attempting to provide for a great deal more than they can provide for, and that the clause should be allowed to remain unaltered. </para>

                    <para>- So far as I can obtain the opinions, through the press and in other ways, of persons interested in the wine industry in South Australia, they are similar to those which have been advanced largely by honorable members representing the State of Victoria - that it is better for the fortification of wine to use spirit distilled from grapes than spirit distilled from potatoes. I do not think that the question is one with which we have anything to do, and I do not want an Act to be passed by the Commonwealth Parliament during its first session which will contain a number of provisions that are <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> I am sure, however, that, from the fourth clause of this Bill onwards, there are a. number of provisions in it which will not stand the test of a Supreme Court action. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to try to make it better by adding a wrong provision to that which is wrong already. Another reason for not accepting the amendment is that its acceptance may possibly diminish the inclination of the State authorities to deal with the subject. Requests made by persons to the State Governments that the matter should be dealt with, may be met by the statement that the Commonwealth Parliament has dealt with it, and, until there is an authoritative decision by the Supreme Court, the hands of the State Governments are tied. </para>

                    <para>- I need hardly say that I did not intend to hurt the feelings of the Minister by the observations which I made, but I felt a little bit nettled by some of the remarks which he made regarding the State to which I have the honor to belong. heard him use what seemed to me to be sarcastic terms in reference to the efforts of the State of Victoria to maintain the purity of its wines - which efforts, we are told by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gresswell,</inline> have been largely successful - and even in reference to the verbiage of the Act of the State legislature. It seemed to me, further, that a certain amount of State feeling had been imported into the consideration of this matter, and I endeavoured to repel it. I am sure that we all believe that the right honorable gentleman is trying his best to do his duty ; but, at the same time, it is my duty, whenever I have reason to believe that he is unwittingly being drawn aside, to call attention to the fact. </para>

                    <para>- I would like to know the views of the Minister with regard to this amendment. When we passed this clause we thought it right to exclude absolutely from this country, which is largely a butter-producing country, oleomargarine, margarine, or any similar substitute for butter. The proposed amendment would admit of these articles being brought here if they are coloured and branded as prescribed. What might be done afterwards is not clear. There might be some difficulty as to the colour, but the brands might be absolutely removed, </para>

                        <para>- My views are just the same as ever, namely, that we ought to keep all these articles out, but when it comes to a question of branding the goods and making them of a particular colour, I think we may make all the necessary provisions to safeguard our producers. We might prescribe black as the colour and a broad arrow as the brand, and I do not think that there will be much difficulty in dealing with the matter. </para>

                    (South Australia).- This provision seeks to put upon the list of prohibited imports mineral oils and mineral spirits under restrictions to be declared by proclamation. I would ask the Minister to insert a limitation restricting the right of proscription to oils that flash at 200 degrees or under. I believe that lubricating oils have a flashing point of 350 or 400 degrees, and there is no reason why we should proscribe their importation. I would suggest that we should insert after the word &#34;spirits,&#34; &#34;flashing at a temperature of less than 200 degrees.&#34;

                        <para>- I do not think that this is a subject that we should attempt to settle in this clause. I should have preferred to leave it as this House sent it to the Senate, because we gave special powers to proscribe subject to conditions and limitations, and it was intended to exercise those powers to meet such cases as those to which the honorable and learned member has called attention. Now special attention has been drawn to these particular articles, and the amendment amounts almost to a suggestion that we should issue a proclamation with respect to them, as I think we would have done. I hope, however, that no hard and fast lines will be laid down, either as to our power or as to the particular test by which we shall be guided. </para>

I think that in all Acts where the term is used special directions are given as to how the oil is to be tested, and it would be very desirable to bring all the States into unison. At present there is a variety of standards throughout the States, and unless we deal with this matter specifically in this portion of the Customs Bill, these varying standards will continue to be observed, so that oil which is admitted into one State will not be admitted into another, and pass freely between the States after admission. The object of the State legislation is to protect their people from danger, and that object will be frustrated unless some general Commonwealth regulation is observed. </para>

                    <para>- Some persons interested in the importation of tea, while not objecting to any provision to secure its purity, consider that much delay would be caused by this new provision. If it is an officer of Customs who is to make the examination the delay will be considerable, and his decision will not be of much value unless he is an expert ; and it is suggested that provision should be made for examination by an expert appointed by the Minister, and, further, that opportunity of appeal to experts should be given, as in clause 152, in regard to the settlement of values. An officer of Customs may be anybody, with or without expert knowledge, and he has to send the sample to art analyst, whereas an expert could, in nine cases out of ten, decide the question at once. If the analyst declares that it is a prohibited import, the Customs stand still, holding the tea, requiring the importer to take any action at law to prove that the tea was not what it was supposed to be. The Customs authorities would have the regulation of the method of the suggested appeal, and the request is a reasonable one, which would assist business without any danger of the importation of improper tea. </para>

                    (Indi).- The amendment in regard to inferior tea is a very proper one, and I drew attention to the necessity for some such provision when the Bill was before this Chamber. In England, and, I believe, in every State of Australia, provisions of the kind inserted by the Senate have been passed into law, and are regarded as absolutely necessary. Otherwise the Minister would often find himself helpless. If a cargo of tea were brought to some port the Minister would be thoroughly convinced on the reports of the officers that it was exhausted or unfit for human use, and yet he would be told that if he ventured to destroy the cargo the importers would bring an action. After the tea had been destroyed a volume of evidence might be brought forward, and the State mulcted in damages through a mistake or misunderstanding. The Minister, under such circumstances, would find himself helpless, and he ought to be put in a position which empowers him to do justice between the Commonwealth and the importer, his decision to be final. But even the new clause submitted would not put him in that desirable position, because it still leaves the matter open. If, on submission to an analyst, the tea is found to be unfit for use, or exhausted tea, notice has to be given to the importer, and he has to have an opportunity of convincing the collector that it is not a prohibited import. But what is to happen then does not appear.

                        <para>- That sub-clause provides that the owner shall be allowed fourteen days in which to satisfy the collector that the tea is not a prohibited import. But the collector would probably support his officer ; and in a dispute between the Customs and an importer, there ought to be an opportunity for settlement by an independent authority. In a much less important matter - the question of values - an appeal has been provided. Its reasonableness has been admitted by the Minister himself in introducing the measure. In clause 152 provision is made for an appeal at very little cost or delay. That clause sets out that - </para>

                <para class="block">The Customs authorities have the power of prescribing the manner of the appeal. They can fix the arrangement under which an appeal from an expert can be made. Surely, therefore, they will make an arrangement which is fair to themselves as well as to the Importer. If the importer can show that one expert has committed an error, surely no Minister of Customs will desire that there shall be destruction of his goods. A man may possibly be ruined by the destruction of his goods when there is really no reason for the adoption of that course. There is a great danger in allowing the Minister the power to say - &#34; My analyst declares that this is a prohibited import ; it as not pure, and I shall destroy it,&#34; without any right of appeal being given. </para>

                    <para>- There seem to be two important points involved here. The first is the question of the destruction of trade. I am quite sure that the Minister does not desire anything, subject to the revenue being collected, but the freest possible means of dealing with merchandise. One of the fears of certain mercantile people in dealing with this article is that if they have not an expert they may be subjected to an enormous amount of obstruction and delay. As has been pointed out by the honorable member for North Sydney, an expert would readily pass the great majority of shipments. This matter differs from the question of goods of a certain value. The idea is that a standard shall be fixed and that this class of goods shall be subject to analysis. If it does not reach that particular standard it is to be considered unfit for human consumption, and its admission is to be prohibited. At the same time no sane person would propose that samples should be taken from all consignments of tea in order to see that such tea was fit for human consumption. We want an assurance that the officer attending to the importation of the tea will be an expert. On the other hand is there any check with regard to what is the standard ? </para>

                        <para>- At the principal ports there are always skilled experts in tea - men who have spent a considerable portion of their lives in acquiring a knowledge which enables them on a cursory examination to say whether any particular sample of tea requires further examination. At the end of this clause we are taking power to prescribe the standard. If this provision be passed the position will be that the tea expert will sample as usual, and if not satisfied will send on the goods for analysis. That is the present practice, and I have known of a variety of cases in which that course has had to be adopted. To guard against the possibility of mistake, however, time is given for the party interested to bring forward any analysis which he may think fit. </para>

                <para class="block">That is practically the same wording as is adopted in regard to the question of values, which is provided for in clause 152. But there is a much greater need for some safeguard of that sort in connexion with the decision of one individual, which may possibly mean the destruction of a large quantity of goods, the loss of which may ruin the owner. I am quite sure that the Commissioner of Customs will find, when he comes to administer any Act of this sort, that in some cases there will be differences between the analytical experts. Only by taking the opinions of several experts, will he be able to come to a right conclusion. Under these circumstances, the Customs authorities have nothing to fear. The adoption of the proposed amendment will, at the same time, give some loophole for escape from what may be ruin to a man who is entirely guiltless. </para>

I found that a different analysis was given of the two samples. That is not unusual. The work of the analyst is so delicate, and so subject in many cases to atmospheric and other conditions, that this state of things is only to be expected. </para>

                        <para>- He was not right. This instance shows the liability which there is to error. It is a dangerous thing to rely entirely upon the decision of one analyst, especially where that opinion might result in the destruction of property. What objection can there be, in such a case, to an appeal? Let us take every precaution to exclude goods which ought to be excluded, but let us give some security to importers, lest they be ruined by an error. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the proposed procedure is unnecessarily complicated, would lead to want of finality, and would prevent the proper enforcement of the measure. Fourteen days are allowed to an owner for the production of certificates and all the evidence requisite for the purpose of inducing the collector to alter the decision ; the collector will not be the person who made the examination, and will have no interest in doing anything unfair. Procedure such as the honorable member wishes to provide for is not provided for in the clauses of the Bill which relate to seizure of copyrighted books or blasphemous and indecent works. I submit, however, that fair provision is made. First, there must be a suspicion on the part of the tea expert ; then a certificate from the Government analyst ; and then the party interested has every opportunity to make an appeal to the collector. I should not mind allowing an appeal to the Minister. </para>

                    (North Sydney).- My experience of Customs officials is that they will hold to their decisions at all risk, and that, when those decisions are come to upon the report of an expert, one can never move them. With regard to the suggested appeal to the Minister, the value of such a provision would depend upon the character of the gentleman in office ; but I am inclined to think that the present Minister would always support his officers. I would point out, however, that clause 152 provides that if there is a difference it may be of only 20 per cent, in a valuation - which means the paying of one-fifth more or one-fifth less duty - there may be an appeal to a board which is practically appointed by the Minister. How, then, can he deny an appeal when the decision of his officers may lead to the total destruction of goods? There can be no reason for doing so, except the determination of the Minister not to retire from his position. I would accept the suggestion of the honorable and learned member for Indi if I thought it would meet the case ; but I must conclude that it will not, and I shall, therefore, stand by the amendment.

                    <para>- The same difficulty seems to me to occur in connection with paragraph (e). It is true that the Minister will prescribe the standard of strength and purity, and the collector and. the experts will, of course, be guided by that; but then will come the question of fact as to whether the goods are actually deficient, and I would suggest that words should be inserted making the prohibition apply to any tea which in the opinion of the collector is not of the prescribed strength and purity. </para>

                    <para>- I hardly think the words suggested by the honorable and learned member for Indi are required, because if the tea does not comply with the standard, it becomes unfit for human consumption, and is a prohibited import. The facts are ascertained in the manner prescribed in the first part of the clause, which covers all that is required. The provision here simply gives us power to prescribe the standard. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but the collector of Customs would be the prosecutor, and the honorable and learned member would not like to have to prove to the satisfaction of the prosecutor that a client for whom he was acting was not guilty.We are going: away from British law altogether in saying; that one man shall decide, and that no appeal shall be allowed from his decision, as is provided in other cases of far less importance. No one has taken more active measures than I have with a view to prevent adulteration. In the New South Wales Act some of the more rigorous clauses were passed at my suggestion. There is nothing I would like to see more than the total prohibition of Adulteration, particularly where it is injurious to health, but there is no occasion to adopt the Russian system, or to be so arbitrary as to do away with all rights of appeal, and to declare that Customs officials cannot make mistakes. Under the clause as it stands, we shall be practically ignoring the law courts, although those courts were established in order to give the individual the right of appeal, and to afford him protection against mistakes that might be made by those in authority. All men whose interests may be seriously affected by the decisions of the Customs authorities should have the benefit of an appeal to the law courts, and I enter my protest against this sort of legislation. It is improper, and appears to be due to a fear on the part of the Crown that an appeal might show it to be wrong. </para>

I would suggest that After the word &#34;writing&#34; we should insert the words, &#34; pursuant to section 49.&#34; </para>

                    <para>- The view of the honorable member for Yarra is one which I also strongly took, and I am still inclined to think that the clause ought to remain. The amendment is intended, in some way, to bring pressure on ship owners in regard to the discharging of cargoes and the passing of entries. The Customs are concerned only with those entries being passed within a reasonable time, and seven days was provided in all cases, giving ample time for everything required. The amendment will give the Government of the day power, if they see fit to exercise it, to either adhere to the provision of the Bill as originally proposed, or to vary the time for the passing of entries as may be thought best in special cases. I am still of opinion that, so far as the department is concerned, uniform law has much to recommend it. </para>

                        <para>- The objection to a considerable extent comes from those who desire a shorter period fixed, and I do not recognise the strength of that objection from a Customs point of view. There seems a wish on the part of some people, by the indirect force of the Customs Bill, to bring pressure to bear of the character I referred to in regard to unshipment and the passing of entries, and, so long as the Customs are satisfied, well and good. If it had been proposed to fix within the four corners of the Bill a varying time in the various places, I should be found resisting the amendment, but seeing that the Government can make regulations, subject to Parliament, the amendment does not seem open to the same objection. If, however, it were being discussed in the first instance, I would stick to the Bill ; but the question is whether it is worth while disagreeing with an amendment which gives a great deal of power to the Government to do as it likes. </para>

                        <para>- The door would be opened to terrible evasion. When the Bill was before us rather a hard and fast proposal was made - that the goods had to be landed at the place for which they were entered, but I added a proviso to the effect that so long as the goods are accounted for to the satisfaction of. the collector, all would be well. I cannot, however, consent to the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I take it that the words were struck out by the Senate to get rid of the necessity for giving security, providing that the terms of the security had been complied with. As. has been pointed out, this provision does not help the revenue, because if the goods are exported to another port in the colony the provisions of the Customs Bill as to reimportations have to be complied with, so that drawback will not apply. But if the goods are going to San Francisco the owner is placed in the difficulty of proving that they had been landed there, and I think the words have been struck out to dispense with that obligation. </para>

                    <para>- I think the amendment is reasonable, because there are instances where it is almost impossible for the shipper to state that goods have been absolutely landed. I remember the case of a 10-ton boiler which was landed in Western Australia, and turned up ten months afterwards in Coolgardie. There was no possibility of getting any certificate except that of my own firm that the boiler had been landed, and if a 10-ton boiler can be lost smaller packages may very well go astray. It happened that in the meantime we had paid for the boiler ; and, at any rate, it did turn up again. The Minister should consider the reason why this amendment has been made before proposing to disagree with it. </para>

That security can be forfeited when there is non-compliance with the provisions of the previous clause. I would point out to the Minister, however, that it is not an effective penalty at all, inasmuch as any person can get goods exported in another person&#39;s name. As a matter of fact, any one who wished to do so could evade any liability of that sort altogether. I think that the Minister might as well omit the penalty altogether. It is not effective, and might be used harshly if it were effective. </para>

                        <para>- But we do not want to go to law unnecessarily. The mere suggestion of the exercise of this power expedites matters wonderfully.

                    <para>- I would point out that under the security already given the amount of duty that would be paid, if drawback had not been allowed, can be recovered by the Minister for Trade and Customs if the goods are allowed to remain in the Commonwealth. Where is the necessity to go beyond that? This clause denies the right of challenging the decision of the Minister. An exporter may be able to prove that the goods were landed, but the Minister may refuse to accept such proof. The effect of this provision would be to force a shipper&#39;s hands and to prevent him appealing against the decision of the Minister through a Court of Justice. </para>

                        <para>- I want to know that goods which have gone out free of duty have gone somewhere else. If goods are passed for export, and are not exported, there is great risk to the revenue. The question is, are we to search for matters which are within the knowledge of the parties themselves, or must they produce the information ? Is our only remedy to be to put the bond in suit ? It never has been so hitherto, but the two provisions have been found to work admirably and fairly. </para>

                    <para>- The amendment is necessary, because some people contend that if goods which are the produce of Australia are brought back here after they have been exported they should not be subject to duty. That, however, is not the general intention, and there must be some regulation limiting the re-introduction of goods free of duty or else our market will be liable to be disturbed in the most unexpected fashion. It is not intended that goods which are the produce of Australia should be allowed to come back here without compliance with any conditions. A case occurred where a lot of Australian goods were sent home, and because the market rose here they were brought back. </para>

                    <para>- I would like to draw attention to the fact that several new clauses have been inserted in this Bill, and that in this clause specific reference is made to section 149. That number will have to . be altered, or else reference will be made to the wrong section. As I remarked before, it is desirable in the drafting of Bills, to, as far as possible, avoid references to sections in this way, because as the Bills pass through the two Houses, the clauses become differently numbered, and unless great care is exercised the most surprising results may be brought about. This is a very important section, and I direct the attention of the Minister to it. </para>

                    (Indi). - I quite agree with this clause, but I should like to ask if the Minister has considered how it will work in practice. The power given to the Customs under this provision to elect to purchase goods at 10 per cent, in addition to their alleged value is a very proper one. According to this clause, however, the power is restricted because it must be exercised at any time before sale of the goods to a person having.no knowledge of the entry and subject as may be prescribed. I should like to know how the Customs are going to discover if the goods have been sold, and how they are going to protect themselves against an action if the goods have been sold. The Minister might consider whether he would be able to put this clause in operation.

                        <para>- If the Government are going to make any use of the power at all they will have to alter the provision in some way or other - perhaps by making the power absolute. I do not know whether there would be any objection to that, because the person who would buy goods in such a case would buy under somewhat extraordinary circumstances. It seems to me that as the clause stands the Minister would always act with a sword over his head, because he would never know, and no one is under any obligation to tell him, whether the goods are sold or not. </para>

                    (Northern Melbourne).I think a short time limit should be fixed, as it would impose on the Customs the duty of acting promptly. The effect would also be to make all persons who were asked to buy goods in great haste exercise great care, and inquire whether the period during which the Customs might exercise their option of purchase had expired. I think the suggestion of the honorable and learned member for Corinella would be the best one to adopt.

                        <para>- -We are discussing how we can best make this clause effective, whilst not interfering unnecessarily with the security to which purchasers have a right. It was pointed out that at present a bogus sale might be set up, and the whole object of the clause defeated. Various ways of meeting the difficulty were suggested. One was the striking out of the limitation altogether, so far as sales are concerned, and the other was the adoption of a period during which it should be exercised. An amendment, which I am disposed to suggest, will be not to defeat the right of sale simply on. the suggestion .that. a. &#39;person has no knowledge of the entry, but to provide that it will be necessary for that person, in order to defeat the right of purchase, to satisfy the collector that he purchased and took delivery in good faith, and without any knowledge of the entry. This is, in point of fact, to cast on the person who seeks to dispute the power of purchase, the onus of establishing that he is entitled to be called a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> purchaser. </para>

                <para class="block">That will avoid the criticism that the object of the clause is likely to be defeated by a bogus sale, and at the same time will sufficiently protect a person who has been entirely innocent and ought not to be penalized. I do not forget that in the great majority of cases, sales and purchases by importers will be made by responsible merchants, so that even if the purchaser lost his goods, he would have recourse, if the loss be occasioned by the under valuation of the entry, against a person who would be able to recoup him. </para>

                        <para>- Suppose it is a speculative purchase? Goods are often kept two or three years in anticipation of a rise in price, and there might be a rise of 50 per cent. This clause is not inserted as a penalty, but as an additional precaution in favour of a Minister, so that he may get the right duty. This is arming the Minister with an extraordinary power as against possibly an innocent importer. </para>

                        <para>- No Ministry would live who sanctioned the act of an officer in taking advantage of a rise in price to acquire goods under the circumstances. I understand that merchants generally do not care so much what they have to pay, so long as they know all have to pay alike, and honest merchants are not penalized to the advantage of those who are not so scrupulous. The clause, as I now submit it, was suggested to our consideration by a highly respected member of the Australian mercantile community, and I believe it has recommended itself to all honest traders. </para>

                    <para>- Do I understand that imported goods are to be valued irrespective of the original invoice ? Hitherto, for years, the production of the original invoice, even though the goods might be sold at much below the value, has been finally tested by the Customs at the port of destination. If a trader should happen to buy what is called a &#34;cheap line&#34; in London at much below its value, it has been the practice for many years to pay the duty on the invoice value from the port of shipment, although that invoice value may be much below the value of the goods. Do I understand that this provision is a substitution for that invoice? </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that the Minister has quite considered what the amendment means. I think that it is a very fair amendment. The clause provides that when a person claims drawback upon goods, he shall make a declaration in reference to them. He has first to declare that the goods have been exported, and then that they have not been re-landed in any part of the Commonwealth. Now, how can a merchant make a declaration that the goods have not been re-landed ? They may have been re-landed dishonestly, and he may declare that to the best of his knowledge they have not been re-landed. If it were shown in the face of such a declaration that the goods had been re-landed, the merchant would be just as liable as if he had made an absolute statement. </para>

                    <para>- If the form of expression were slightly altered, I think that the suggestion of the honorable and learned member for Parkes would be applicable. As the provision comes to us from another place, the clause reads - &#34; And have not to his knowledge been re-landed.&#34; But of course a man who is in Sydney would have no knowledge of what was going on say in Perth. He could therefore easily say, even though he had a suspicion that the goods had been re-landed in Perth, that they had not been re-landed there to his knowledge. If, on the other hand, th expression were used - &#34; To the best of his belief,&#34; the honorable and learned member&#39;s suggestion would be pertinent. I think that the amendment of the Senate goes too far. The suggestion of the honorable and learned member for Parkes does not go so far, and is not so extreme. At the least, we ought to pin down the man who makes a declaration to a statement of his actual belief. If we altered the clause to read &#34; to the best of his belief,&#34; I think that the difficulty would be met. </para>

                        <para>- The position, it seems to me, is that we allow drawback because the goods are exported. It is not sufficient when a boat leaves, bound for a certain place, that we should pay the drawback. We have a right to be satisfied that the goods have not been brought back into Australia.

                    <para>- The amendment of the Senate has evidently been intended to cover instances where a declaration may be made though the goods may have been re-landed without the knowledge of the individual making such declaration. It frequently happens that goods are actually re-landed from steamers in Melbourne itself. Sometimes goods are transferred to another steamer. It happens also that goods from homeward-bound steamers calling at Fremantle may unintentionally be landed at that port. In such cases the goods are sent on to England by a later steamer. In the meantime, the exporter would have made his declaration that the goods had not been re-landed, and would thus become liable to a penalty. </para>

Surely the exporter should be in a position to say definitely that he has carried out his obligation before he collects drawback? The honorable member for Melbourne has pointed out that in some cases men get their drawback, even though the goods have not left the country. </para>

                    SMITH (Parkes).- The case mentioned by the honorable member for Melbourne is not an ordinary one, but an extraordinary one, in which goods are taken out at an intermediate port and are omitted to be reshipped. The normal condition of things would not admit of that. When once goods have left a particular port for a destination beyond the Commonwealth, wherever they land they will again have to pay duty. Three conditions have to be complied with before drawback can be collected. First, the exporter has to declare that the goods have been exported ; secondly, that they have not been re-landed to his knowledge; and thirdly, that there is no intention to reland them. The honorable member knows very well that when once they have left a port the chief reason for taking the drawback is that the duty is not due at that port, but will have to be repaid at another port as soon as the goods are landed. If I send goods from Melbourne, and they are landed in Sydney
                    <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline>
                    to some other place, they will have to pay duty in Sydney. Therefore it is quite right that the exporter who has paid duty on them, and has then sent them out of the Commonwealth, should receive his duty back, because the moment the goods enter another port of the Commonwealth they will have to pay duty again. That is the guaranty which the Minister has that there can be no dishonesty in the matter.

The Customs officers will look at the manifest of the ship in any case, and will have received word as to what goods are passing from one port in .the Commonwealth, to another. Here there is the three-fold declaration that the goods have been taken away from the port, that to the best of the exporters knowledge they have not been relanded, and that there is no intention to re-land them. If you do not give an exporter a drawback until he can positively state that the goods have not been re-landed, either honestly or dishonestly, no man will be entitled to a refund of duty. </para>

EDWARDS (South Sydney).I do not think we should legislate in the direction of requiring a declaration which no man could honestly make, and the declaration here provided for is such a declaration, because goods are exported, and, perhaps for some reason connected with the working of the ship, or by a mistake, they are re-landed and taken on by subsequent vessels. If the words, &#34; to the best of . his belief &#34; are accepted, we shall have, as the honorable and learned member for Parkes has pointed out, a three-fold declaration, which would be such as an honest man can make, while the revenue will be sufficiently protected.

                    <para>- Some of the provisions in the measure in regard to drawbacks are framed on the lines of the provisions first introduced when drawbacks were originated, and their operation so little known that it was thought that extraordinary precautions should be taken to protect the revenue. As a matter of fact, however, there is no greater risk to the revenue when goods are shipped for export under drawback than when they are shipped for export under bond. If goods under bond are exported, what is there, to prevent them from being landed again within the Commonwealth, except the vigilance of the Customs officials % The same vigilance may be trusted to.prevent the re-landing of goods exported under drawback. But the further precaution is taken, with regard to goods exported under drawback, that the exporter is required to make the declaration that they have not been re-landed. If he declares that &#34; to his full knowledge and belief,&#34; or &#34; so far as he knows &#34; they have not been re-landed, that should be sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- In regard to goods exported under bond, there are a variety of provisions for the protection of the revenue, chief among which is the requirement of proof that they have been landed at the place to which they were intended to be exported, or are otherwise accounted for to the satisfaction of the collector. That evidence we can get at any time, and we lose no money, because no duty has been paid upon the goods. But where goods are imported under drawback, duty has been paid upon them, and we are met by a request for the repayment of it. </para>

                        <para>- Surely the exporter is in the best position to declare whether the goods have been sent out of the Commonwealth, and his right to repayment depends upon his compliance with the condition that they have been sent out of the Commonwealth. . He ought to be able to pledge his word to the two facts which constitute the foundation of his claim for repayment - that the goods have been exported, and that they have not been re-landed within the Commonwealth. I do not want to provide for any requirement which will unnecessarily harass trade. An exporter would have to wait only a little while in order to obtain advice of the arrival of the goods at the port of destination. </para>

                    <para>- The Minister may be right in arguing that the conditions should be complied with, but those conditions should be reasonable, and the only reasonable declaration to ask the exporter to make is that the goods have been exported. I have felt qualms of conscience over and over again because of the declarations I have been asked to make. I am asked to declare under which warrants and invoices duty was paid upon the sugar contained in goods I am exporting, lt is impossible for me to do that. All I can do is to go to the Custom-house with the invoices, and say - &#34; Duty was paid on the sugar under some of these invoices, but I cannot say which. Pick them out for yourselves.&#34; An exporter could not honestly swear that goods had not been re-landed within the Commonwealth, but he could swear that to. the best of his belief they had not been re-landed. The Minister says that these provisions are inserted to protect the honest from the dishonest trader ; but we have no right to require an honest trader to make a declaration which he cannot honestly make. The declaration which the exporter is to be asked to make would not be accepted as evidence in a court of law, because the court would hold that a man cannot swear to facts of which he has no knowledge. </para>

                    <para>- I suggest the addition of the words &#34; sifter proper inquiry,&#34; to meet what I understand to be the chief difficulty of the Minister - that the exporter may make the declaration, that to the best of his knowledge the goods had not been re-landed, without the smallest inquiry as to the facts. But surely it is fair to allow him to swear that &#34; to the best of his knowledge after proper inquiry&#34; the goods had not been landed ? </para>

                    (Northern Melbourne).Although I made the suggestion that is being discussed, I do not think that the amendment is so important that I should press it further, because I feel that no man could be convicted . of perjury upon the declaration that the goods, had not been. re-landed, unless it could be shown that he did not believe in the truth of that statement. I think, however, that we should be very careful as to the oath we require. If oaths are to be esteemed binding upon conscience, we should be very careful to have as few rigid oaths as possible. There are some consciences which are very tender with regard to the taking of oaths. However, I think we are spending too much time over this matter. I should like to see the words &#34; to the best of his belief &#34; inserted, but I do not think it worth while going to a division on the question of their insertion.

                    (North Sydney.) - I agree with the honorable member for Northern Melbourne that we shall be making people swear to what cannot actually be within their knowledge, and that is a bad thing in itself. As to the re-landing of these goods, what harm would be done supposing goods were shipped to England, and were shipped back again by the following steamer to Perth, and landed there under Customs supervision
                    <inline font-style="italic">1</inline>
                    In connexion with drawbacks, there is not that difference that the Minister seems to claim. The Minister seems to think that goods in connexion with which money is to be obtained from the Government are in a different position from goods upon which, at the time of export, no money is refunded. There is no difference, except that the Government have for a certain time had the use of the money paid as duty, and afterwards refunded as drawback. If a&#39; man pays duty upon certain goods, and places them in a free store, he gets drawback when he exports them; but there is really no difference between that case and the case of goods which have been in bond all the time, and regarding which no money has passed, either in the way of duty or drawback. The same precaution is taken to prevent the landing of the goods in either case, and they are under the control of the Customs in just the same way as goods in bond under clause 112. I think, therefore, that the Minister might very well accept an amendment which will prevent oaths being taken as to facts regarding which&#39; the persons taking them can have no absolute knowledge.

                    <para>- The insertion of these words would rather confuse the clause, because there is no reference in the earlier part of it to a ship having gone to any port beyond Australia. I think the clause would be better as it stands. </para>

                    <para>- I would point out to the Minister that if this amendment is agreed to, the writ of assistance will not be in accordance with what appears to be the purport of the clause as amended. The Senate propose to so amend the clause that there shall be no power to break open any premises, but the writ of assistance, as shown in the schedule, gives power to enter the premises day or night and to &#34; break open and search the same.&#34; The clause as amended does not give power to break open the premises, but only to break open any &#34;chest, trunks, or packages.&#34; There is a considerable discrepancy between the clause as amended, and the writ of assistance. </para>

                    <para>- I think that this matter requires very careful consideration. We have just passed an amendment which has the effect of modifying the Bill as it originally stood. In its original form, clause 213 provided that notice of action was to be given in all cases. The succeeding clause sets out that no evidence is to be produced at the trial but evidence of the cause of action that has been distinctly stated in the notice. By the amendment which we have just carried, power is given to a Judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court to allow the plaintiff to proceed without notice. It seems to me, therefore, that this is the proper place at which to insert words which will meet the case of leave being granted to proceed without notice. The clause with which we are now dealing provides that a defect in the notice is not to invalidate it unless the defendant is prejudiced in his defence. Yet clause 214 prevents the plaintiff from giving evidence of any cause of action except such as has been distinctly stated in the notice. That will lead to serious complications which apparently have not been foreseen. I suggest the addition of words which will give the court leave to amend the notice as it may think just, and then some words will require to be added in order to show that the succeeding clause shall not apply to a case where leave has been granted to proceed without notice. </para>

                    <para>- The striking out of these words by the Senate still leaves the clause depriving the plaintiff of a verdict, but without giving the defendant a verdict so as to allow the plaintiff, if he pleases, to be non-suited, and come again. If he is non-suited no doubt the question of costs would be against him. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that the previous amendment raises a difficulty here. At the end of clause 213 it is provided that a Judge of the Supreme Court may grant leave to a plaintiff to proceed without notice, whereas this clause provides that the plaintiff shall not be entitled to a verdict without proving on the trial that such notice has been duly served. It may be said that as there is no notice he cannot get a verdict. </para>

Indeed, I am beginning to think that the Senate is providing us. with the nucleus of an Australian navy.

                    <para>- This is a suggestion which I think we ought not to agree to into this provision in regard to forfeiture it is proposed to introduce the consideration whether any false or misleading statement has been made wilfully or otherwise. For Customs purposes it does not matter in the slightest whether a, statement has been made wilfully, so long as it has been misleading and the revenue has been defrauded. The man. who does not mislead is prejudiced by the one who does, and to indulge in a. close inquiry as to whether or not the misrepresentation was wilful would cause us to embark upon a most unsatisfactory career of speculation. The position we have laid down here is, that if anything is done which ought not to be done we should inflict a penalty, and that if it is done with intent to defraud we should increase the penalty. </para>

If it were necessary, before we could insist upon forfeiture for a false entry, invoice, declaration, answer, statement, or representation, to show that the entry, declaration, or statement had been wilfully false and misleading, we should be placed in a wrong position altogether, and we should never be able to secure a conviction. </para>

                    <para>- There is a good deal to be said in favour of the amendment of the Senate. It is evidently intended that where an error is unintentional, and no injurious consequences result, no penalties shall be inflicted. Goods may erroneously be entered as coining by a vessel other than the one they were actually conveyed by, and no injury may result to the Customs in such a case. The Minister says that he will deal with matters of that kind, and will not enforce his power of forfeiture, but there is no danger to the Customs in inserting the word &#34; wilfully.&#34; </para>

                <para class="block">That is a highly fair and proper provision. The only fault that can be raised against it is that its application is not sufficiently general. When the defendant is not liable to punishment for an indictable offence, or for an offence directly punishable by imprisonment, I think every facility ought to be given to the authorities for getting at the truth, and that we should allow the defendant to be placed in the box so that the facts may be elicited in open court. If he is innocent he has nothing to be afraid of, and if he is guilty the truth will be elicited. </para>

                        <para>- This is an alteration intended to limit the power of settling disputes, prescribing practically that they shall be heard in public. There is something to be said in favour of it, and something against it. The practice has grown up of the Minister deciding on the papers before him, at the request of the parties interested, matters involving sometimes infractions of the customs law. That is not a course which I favour altogether. It seems to me that there is good reason to object to it. The secrecy is not altogether desirable, but different practices have obtained in different States. It is proposed by the Senate to insure publicity, and I do not think it is necessary to take exception to the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I think this is on all fours with the previous decision of the committee. In the clause we have just dealt with, publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> only follows a decision by the Minister in regard to a penalty or forfeiture. I do not think it should be compulsory for an innocent trader to have the whole of his affairs published to the world. I should like to substitute the word &#34; may &#34; for the word &#34; shall &#34; in the Senate&#39;s amendment. That would leave the matter in the discretion of the Minister. </para>

                    <para>- The Government originally introduced in the Bill a procedure in accordance with the existing practice. These inquiries are not of a very formal character. They are conducted on a perusal of documents upon both sides without any formal attendance. Of course the direction here as to publication will prevent anything in the shape of hole-and-corner work. The sole question is whether or not we should require that all these cases shall be heard in public. There is a good deal to be said in favour of it, but at the same time it has its objections. </para>

                        <para>- It means that the inquiry shall be made in some place which is accessible to the public. Seeing we provide that when a decision in relation to penalties or forfeitures is arrived at, that decision must be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> I do not think there is any strong objection to the suggestion made by the honorable and learned member for Corio. Of course it is a question whether or not these cases should be privately disposed of. There are many cases, no doubt, in which publicity would work an injustice, and it would not be a bad thing to leave the matter within the discretion of the Minister.. That could be done either by accepting the Senate&#39;s amendment or by providing for a permissive public inquiry. On the whole, I think that the publication proposed is so great an innovation upon the practice hitherto existing that we shall have done all that is necessary if we require that the decision shall be published ; and that we should be going further than is desirable in. declaring in so many words that the proceedings shall be public. I am disposed to move accordingly. </para>

What the Minister has said just now as to the difference between the nature of the inquiries will not hold good, and those under the proposed new clause will have to be hold in public.

                    <para>- Under the Bill, certain provisions are made for alterations of contracts owing to alterations of the Tariff; and it appears to me that if the parties had a difference of opinion on such a question, and determined to refer it to the Minister, the latter would have no option but to act. The Minister may find himself turned into an amateur court, with a great deal of work to do he would much rather be without. I think the word &#34;shall&#34; ought to read &#34;may.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I do not know exactly what the-object of the amendment is, and I should like to hear the Minister&#39;s explanation. It appears as though the intercolonial barriers were to be a little stronger and more different than the barriers between us and the outer world ; and that surely is not what is desired. After this Bill is passed, all other Customs Acts relating to importations to Australia to all intents and . purposes cease to have effect; but by the amendment, goods transported from State to State within the two years, subject to special duty charges - the Commonwealth duties, not the State duties-are apparently to be subjected to State restrictions. </para>

It is only intended to give power by regulation to prescribe what may be necessary. We can say that certain provisions shall continue to be exercised at the borders. I looked into the matter rather closely, and am sure that for convenience, simplicity of working, and simplicity of alteration so as to provide for better arrangements from time to time, a- provision of this sort will be the best. </para>

                    (Northern Melbourne).I am glad that attention has been called to this clause. I understand exactly the view which the Minister holds. In the carrying out of that section of the Constitution relating to goods passing from State to State within two years after the imposition of uniform duties, he wants to be able to apply the State laws of Customs, if they are more convenient, and the federal law of Customs if that be more convenient, and that he shall have power to invoke either of these laws by regulation. I would suggest that if the words be left as they are they will lead to great confusion. We shall have two inconsistent Acts applying at the same time. We might as well say that a steam roller and a garden rake shall apply at the same time in the same drive. The two things will not work together simultaneously. I suggest that it would be wise to provide that the Minister may, by regulation, apply at his discretion either the State or the Federal Acts.

                    (Corinella).- There is no necessity for this vague intention which may only exist in the breast of the Minister for Trade and Customs. Is the application of this Act to any particular beer or spirits to be determined by such a condition precedent as a paragraph in a newspaper that a Minister intends to introduce a Bill dealing with beer and spirits? I ask the Minister to omit the words &#34;orare intended to be dealt with.&#34;
