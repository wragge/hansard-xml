I do not think we should adjourn beyond half-past four. </para>

                    <para>- It would be a great convenience to honorable members if they knew on what date the House would adjourn for the Christmas holidays. I am inclined to suggest that Friday, the 13th inst., would be a reasonable date to fix. If we do not adjourn then, we shall have to sit during the week immediately preceding Christmas week, and that would be very inconvenient to a number of honorable members. I can say honestly that I do not see any possible chance of the Tariff being finished before Christmas, even though the utmost expedition be used. If the Tariff cannot be passed before Christmas, there will be no sense in continuing our sittings right into the holidays. </para>

                    <para>- I have intimated on several occasions that the time at which we should ask the Houses to adjourn would depend very largely on the progress made with the Tariff. I quite join with the leader of the Opposition in the belief that it has been rendered impossible to pass the Tariff by Christmas, but if the Tariff is to be passed later than we thought it would be, the urgency of expediting public business is all the greater. My own impression is that the 13th would be too early a date on which to adjourn considering the duties. </para>

                <para>Ave have on both sides of the House, but it might be fair to allow honorable members to leave Melbourne the week before Christmas. After sitting on the Monday and Tuesday preceding the 18th inst., we might adjourn on the afternoon of that date. That would ' give honorable members a full week before Christmas, and it would be reasonable, I think, to ask them to resume their duties about the 7th or 8th. January. </para>

                    <para>Agents at Port Adelaide complain of inconvenience through the tardy way in which alterations in the Tariff are communicated to the Port Adelaide Customs officials. They desire the South Australian Customs to be put on the same footing as the Victorian, and that the officials be made aware of alterations by the time they are to take effect. Several instances have occurred in which official intimation of alterations has been received hours after they have appeared in the daily papers. The latest of these was in connexion with the decision in respect to some of the items in cottons and linens placed on the free list, which had previously paid du tj'. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think there has been any neglect in this connexion. Honorable members know that sometimes alterations are made at late hours, and therefore it is very natural that the first intimation should appear in the daily press. The practice is, even with regard to alterations made fairly late at night, to hand messages in so as to have them telegraphed at nine o'clock the next morning. I do not think that shows any laxity on our part, but at the same time probably there will be an attempt mace to insure that even this delay shall not occur before the messages regarding late alterations are placed in the hands of the Telegraph department. Honorable members will see that in the very nature of things greater diligence could hardly have been expected. </para>

                        <para>- I should like some information from the Minister for Trade and Customs with reference to a question I put to him the other day as to facilitating Customs entries - dispensing with the unusual number of entries and the multiplicity of certificates now required. I have several letters on this point from South Australia, and in one of these it is stated that if the difference in the duty were paid at the port of despatch into the interior, and the matter then ended as far as the receivers were concerned, it would be an immense help. I should, like to know whether the Minister has inquired into the matter. </para>

At the same time we have clear duties cast upon us, not only by the Customs Act, but by the Constitution Act itself, and it is necessary that' we should do everything that is required of us under these Acts. However, we are inquiring into the matter, and if we can simplify and condense, we shall be only too glad to do it. </para>

I would ask honorable members to reflect that it is necessary for the postal service to be carried on with due economy under the new conditions, and that the Government is alternately being complained of for extravagance and undue retrenchment. Complaints of both kinds are inevitable in the case of a service which is being placed on a new basis. I shall give attention to the complaint of the honorable member, which is not the only one I have received, and will confer with the Postmaster-General with a view to seeing that any necessary retrenchment is carried out without causing undue friction. </para>

I have been informed by a customs agent who does business both in Sydney and Melbourne, that the Tariff is being administered differently in the two places, and that articles upon which duty is paid in Melbourne are admitted free in Sydney, owing to the interpretation placed upon the Tariff there. This is a very serious matter for the merchants of Melbourne, and I would ask the Minister to inquire into it, with a view to securing the uniform administration of the Tariff. </para>

                    <para>- I bring the schedule of the amendments, to which the Senate has disagreed, before the committee this morning, because it is urgent that this Bill should become law as soon as possible. At the present time, there are several cases in my own department which are hung up pending the passing of this measure. The amendments to which the Senate have disagreed are unimportant, as is stated in their message. The reason for the action which has been taken by the other Chamber is that, as a result of the insertion of clause 58a, there is no necessity to retain the words, "or of the Supreme Court of a State," which appear in clauses 12 and 22; or the words, "or until the establishment of the High Court in the Supreme Court of the State," which occur in clause 14. Clause 58a deals with the whole of these matters, and I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>- I have looked through the amendments made by the Senate as well as I could, having before me only the Bill in the form in which it appeared before it was finally passed by this House. It is a pity that the Ministry did not see that a copy of the measure as finally agreed to by this House, was placed upon the files of honorable members. By comparing the various copies, however, I can see what is the point of the Senate's proposals. I have no objection to the amendments, because they substitute one clause for several references throughout the Bill. The Senate, however, has not completely done its work. It proposes to omit the words " or of the Supreme Court of a State " in some cases, but not in others, where such a course is equally necessary. However, as the retention of these words in the cases to which I refer will make no difference, I support the proposal of the Government. </para>

                    <para>- I think there is a good deal in the complaint that the system of distributing Bills is not satisfactory. It would be quite a simple matter for the Government Printer to keep Bills standing in type, and whenever an amendment is made in them to indicate it by the use of a different fount of type. If Victoria is not capable of carrying out such a work, it is high time that some of the small States taught her how to do it. Every information, and exact information should be given to honorable members when dealing with important matters. </para>

It is not even necessary to employ different type to indicate such amendments. If the amendments made by one House were enclosed between a certain form of brackets, and those made by the other branch of the Legislature were inserted between a different sort of parenthesis, honorable members would have the position clearly before them. Even if the same type were used, it would be very much easier for the officers of the House to follow the different stages of Bills. </para>

If I had entered the chamber and learned that honorable members were discussing a proposal to vote themselves £5,000 a year by way of salary, I should naturally say that it was a bewildering proposal to fix £375,000 of taxation upon the backs of the people. But I should be told that under the Constitution we had a perfect right to adopt such a proposal, and that we intended to do so no matter what arrangements had been made with the people of the country. There is no difference between the two proposals. I should like to know what honorable member would have dared to say before his constituents that he intended to vote for a proposal to impose a duty ranging from 50 per cent, to 180 per cent, on an article that the people wear. I feel some sympathy with the Prime Minister, because it seems to me that the Minister for Trade and Customs is absolutely callous and indifferent with regard to the personal honour of and to the compact made by the other Ministers with the people of the country. It might have been a good thing if the Tariff could have been proclaimed before the Union. By way of illustration, I may say that in connexion with the proposed South African federation it is suggested that there be a uniform tariff before the federation takes place. Of course, in South Africa there are only two States to make a uniform tariff, and a similar step would have been almost impossible with six States. "We have been voting duties which I consider high, ranging from 15 to 25 per cent. "What is there in the nature of this particular article that the duty should be over 100 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Is there any sense or principle in the proposal ? Is there any essential difference between tli'e manufacture of hats and the manufacture of blankets? lt will not have a nice appearance before Australia if this proposal of the Government be passed, because it is essentially making monopolies to an .extent that has not even been imagined in connexion with other items. There seems an absolute want of comprehension on the part of the Minister for Trade and Customs when he says this is not a prohibitive duty, seeing that he glories in the fact that it is going to absolutely prohibit this particular class of article. Is that " revenue without destruction <inline font-style="italic">"1</inline> I do not believe that honorable members, even on the Government side of the House, will be so lost to all sense of honour in dealing with the States, as to give a monopoly to a handful of people, in order to keep going an industry which is probably paying twice as much as an industry could be reasonably expected to pay. 1 do not believe that honorable members will let it be known to the whole world that, while we advocate moderate protection, we pick out this industry in this invidious way, and exceed the wildest dreams of 'protectionists in the United States. I should be ashamed to be a member of this House if this item were passed as it now stands. I should like to know what are the forces that have been at work. Why in the name of honesty and common-sense should we pick out this one manufactory - and I believe it is practically brought down to one particular manufactory - and give it assistance so far beyond that given to other industries ? Does it bear an appearance of honesty that Parliament should pick out hat manufacture, which is practically the business of one firm, and make the duty anything ranging from 100 per cent, to 180 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If the committee pass this duty, it will in some respects be all the better for the free-trade propaganda ; but, at the same time, I am not going to allow, if I can possibly help it, the placing on the statute-book of a duty so unjust to the whole population of Australia. I believe the Ministry are as honest and honorable as are public men in any part of the world ; but their proposal in this instance is remarkable and invidious. I can understand, from a protectionist point of view, that a little more protection may be required under some circumstances, but I do not think that any circumstances can justify a jump from 25 per cent, on clothing, and 15 per cent, on woollen goods, to such an excessive rate of protection as is now proposed. Of course, if <inline font-style="italic">i0</inline> per cent, means prohibition, the Minister can have a joke by making the duty 140 per cent. ; but in the sight of the world, which is all one in commerce, such a proceeding would be insensate folly. I throw on the committee the responsibility of passing this duty. I do not say that, from a protectionist point of view, honorable members have hitherto gone beyond . the scope of their own principles ; but such a duty as that now proposed is to be utterly condemned even by protectionists. If I were a protectionist I should hide my head with shame at this proposal, which must, I think, have emanated to a large extent from the brain 'of the Minister of Trade and Customs. Such duties have perhaps been in vogue in Victoria, but they have been condemned by every honest man. The system of composite duties is resorted to simply in order to hide what is being done; just as the test was proposed in the Alien Restriction Bill, which has, .however, received its condemnation in another Chamber. Personally I do not care; but I have some regard for the corporate honour of the House, which ought to be dear to all of us. The free-trade policy would be to let this item go, but we must have regard to the interests of the millions of people as against the thousands. I, therefore, strongly appeal to the committee to weigh most carefully what they are doing, and point out to protectionists that they are perpetrating a piece of folly which will re-act against their own policy. If free-traders can show, when hereafter fighting the battle of free-trade throughout Australia, that the protectionist system is so evil and so dishonest that its advocates will go to the extent of even 180 per cent., we shall have a powerful argument in favour of moderation. We shall be able to show that protection is a system so invidious and unfair that, once it gets its roots in the community, those who advocate it will stop at nothing in order to effect their purpose, which is prohibition, resulting in the creation of monopolies, and the sweating of the great masses of the people for the sake of the few. </para>

                    <para><inline font-style="italic">Mx.</inline>O'MALLEY (Tasmania).- No doubt much can be said on both sides of this question ; but it seems to me that the fact that a majority of Australians are always prepared to bow down to something foreign is an admission that it is worth a duty of 20s. a dozen' to make them wear Australian hats. There is a bonus in the fact that if an article is foreign, the Australians are prepared to accept it ; and it is absolutely necessary, if we want to build up industries, to have protective duties. We are very prone to imitate others, and, unfortunately, we often imitate those beneath us. Fashions were established by the lackeys of the middle ages, and the butlers of great houses, and we bow down and worship them. As regards wages, hatters in the United States earn from $15 to $25 a week, and men who, like myself, have lived in America, and associated with the business people of the country - who have visited factories, and taken part in political life - ought to know at least as much of this question as do honorable members who obtain their information from books. </para>

                    <para>Mi-. O'MALLEY.- That is a reason why we should protect our own workers, who are employed for only eight hours a day. Is it reasonable to suppose that our hat manufacturers can, without protection, compete against the manufacturers of America and of England, or against the manufacturers of Japan, where the workers are paid from 6d. to ls. a day? One of our great primary industries is the breeding of rabbits, and, as members of the Opposition are great believers in primary industries, I ask them to support the hat industry, since it uses a large number of rabbit skins. Under modern conditions our distance from England or America does not give us much protection, because when once a monster ocean steam-ship is loaded with hats, it does not cost much more to bring them here than it would cost to bring them from Tasmania, and to-day they are shipping goods from New York to Liverpool more cheaply than goods can be sent from Boston to New York. In fact, rates are becoming so low that presently a bonus will be offered to shippers. </para>

I agree with the Prime Minister that there should be no destruction of industries, and, although I am a believer in free-trade principles, I am willing to support a 30 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty on hats for the protection of the hat industry. I compliment the honorable member for Yarra upon the excellent speech he made.  His  arguments were supported by hard dry facts, and honorable members will always be pleased to hear a speech of that description. Apparently, good wages are paid in the hat industry, and' while perhaps it is fair to give it a certain amount of protection, I do not think the committee should agree to such high duties as the Government propose. </para>

                        <para>- Although I am not willing at any time to do anything that will injure an established industry, and while I am anxious to give encouragement to new industries, I cannot see my way clear to support the proposals of the Government in regard to the hat trade. So far as I have been able to ascertain, and from what I learnt when the Victorian Tariff was under revision some time ago, the chief profits of this trade go into the pockets of the distributors of Flinders-lane-; but a calculation which I have made goes to show that in regard to a certain class of hats the duties are absolutely prohibitive, and there is no such thing as competition between the importer and the manufacturer. That is a state of things which is not desirable. While I do not wish to see unfair competition, I do not want to put an end to all competition. But on hats of a value of 36s. per dozen the duties are prohibitory, because,, without taking into account freight charges and importers' and retailers' profits, they raise the price to 50s. per dozen. I may be told that hats of that class are never imported, and that as cheap and good a hat is manufactured in Victoria. But, in my opinion, we should not prevent competition from outside in that line. With regard to hats of the value of 90s. per dozen, I find that the duties increase the price to 114s. per dozen, without taking into account freights, or profits, while the rate of protection diminishes as the value of the hats increases. Therefore, upon hats of that class there is room for fair competition, and the duties are not too high. I am prepared to support duties of 30 per cent, as a maximum rate with that amount of protection, and fair conditions as to distribution. I think that the hat manufacturers of Australia, considering the large market that will be open to them, will be able to do fairly well. </para>

Judging from inquiries which I made before the introduction of the Tariff, prices of hats did not differ materially in Sydney and in Melbourne. The other clay I bought a hat in Melbourne for 10s-. 6d., which was just as good as the one for which I had paid the same price in Sydney three months previously. </para>

                            <para>- I say that, quality for quality, the two hats were equal, so far as I could judge. I do not quite agree with the Government proposals, because I think that probably a lower duty would be sufficient to meet the case of the Victorian manufacturers, and at the same time encourage into existence a number of hat factories in the neighbouring States. It must be borne in mind that if we place too high a tax on the people of the other States, they will have to pay the full amount of that duty for a considerable time, because we cannot expect that local factories will come into operation in every one of the States immediately, or that the output of the Victorian factories can be so increased as to forthwith supply the requirements of all the States. On the other hand, if we adopt a 15 or 20 per cent, duty, such as has been suggested, the reduction will be too great, and may deal too heavy a blow to existing industries, because it will permit of our mar- 1kets being flooded with the low-class shoddy goods which come from some parts of the Continent. I should prefer a small fixed duty | on the lower- class hats in order to shut them out, but 'I do not think that is practicable. and under the circumstances we might compromise matters by levying a 30 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, and abolish the fixed duty. </para>

                            <para>- I do, in this particular instance. I believe that even a small percentage of duty will make a very considerable difference in regard to the admission of the very low-priced shoddy hats, and in view of the fact that if shoddy hats are excluded, local manufacturers who use wool instead of shoddy will be able to sell a medium-priced hat at a price as low as that of the imported article, we should assist them in every way we can. </para>

                        <para>--This is an industry that requires rather a high duty, because the greater proportion of the cost of hats is represented by wages, and I am prepared to support a duty equivalent to the difference in the cost of labour here and in European countries. At the same time I cannot go the full length of the Government proposals. When I was before my constituents I told them that I would support fair protective duties for industries that were suited to our conditions, but that I would not countenance prohibition, because I believed the interests of the public were better conserved when there was healthy competition between importers and local producers. The suggestion of the honorable member for Bland appears to me to be a reasonable one. In most cases I should regard a duty of 30 per cent, as a very high one, but in the special circumstances connected with hat manufacture, I think it will afford only a fair amount of protection. Although an enormous duty has been levied upon hats in times gone by, the people of Victoria have been able to obtain locally-made hats at about the same prices that were ruling in New South Wales under free-trade for the imported article, and therefore it is not to be feared that the consumers will suffer because a comparatively high duty is imposed. </para>

                        <para>- A great deal of information has been given to us with reference to the hat manufacturers of Victoria, but whatever success may have attended them, the hat-making business has not been a great success in South Australia. The duties fixed there in the first place were heavily protective, amounting at one time to 25 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> and in some instances to a fixed duty of 15s. per dozen. But the industry did not reach the dimensions or achieve the success that was expected of it. At present there are hot a dozen men and boys employed in hat making in the whole of the State. The question now appears to be whether the people of the Commonwealth are to be supplied with the bulk of their hats by Victorian manufacturers, and in this connexion we have to consider how many men, women, and children are employed in the factories which the whole of the people of the Commonwealth are to be taxed to maintain. The rates of duty proposed by the Government seem to be inordinately high, and I am entirely in accord with the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Poynton, in his desire to abolish the fixed duty. Thirty per cent, has been suggested as a moderate <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, but that seems to me to be a very high rate. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the committee are now about to decide whether the composite duty shall be retained. It has been repeatedly stated that such a duty conceals the amount which is being paid by the consumer into revenue. I do not claim to have had a mercantile training, or to possess expert knowledge of commercial affairs, but I should like an explanation of how a fixed duty of 10s. per dozen upon hats conceals the amount which is being contributed to the revenue by the consumer. It seems to me that if we have a fixed duty of 10s. per dozen in addition toan <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate of 15 per cent., the man who purchases an imported hat must know that he is contributing lOd. towards the revenue. </para>

                            <para>- It seems perfectly clear to me that if a man buys an imported hat, upon which there is a fixed duty, he knows how much he is paying towards the revenue. But under a 15 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate I admit that he does not know what he is contributing to the revenue, because he has no knowledge of the initial cost. Surely the argument of concealment can be levelled with a great deal more force against the composite duties on account of the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> than it can be on account of the fixed rate. </para>

                        <para>- A good many pleasant things have been said about myself during the course of the Tariff debate, which have been passed by me unnoticed. I would not now refer to them, but that the acting leader of the Opposition stated last night that I had unblushingly declared that this duty was intended to be prohibitive. I did not say anything of the sort, and I am a little bit surprised at his remark. On the contrary I pointed out that a matter of £50,000 has hitherto been annually derived from the Victorian Customs duties upon hats, and that, as we proposed to materially reduce those' duties, a larger volume of imports might be expected. I do not know that I should have taken particular notice of the honorable member's statement, but when he accused me this morning of callousness to the personal honour of my colleagues, I think that he said too much. It is the duty of any person who has the right to be called a man, to be as jealous of the honour of his friends as of his own personal honour. I defy any man to say that I have ever been callous of the personal honour of my colleagues, and no such statement ought to be made in this House. Talk about my making unblushing declarations ! I venture to think that such a statement should raise a red hot burning brand of shame upon the most brazen brow, to say nothing of that of any honorable member of this House. We have had considerable discussion upon the point which is now under consideration, and the conclusion at which the Government have arrived, is that while there is a desire on the part of a very considerable majority of the committee to give good and substantial protection to the hat industry, they are not prepared to adopt the system which is here proposed - the system which has obtained in Victoria, but with which the other States are not yet familiar. Under all the circumstances we do not propose to quarrel with the wish of the committee in this respect, but we do intend to ask them to give effect to whatever may be necessary for the purpose of affording substantial protection to this particular industry. We think that that protection should not be less than 30 per cent. We propose to move accordingly, and trust to secure the acceptance of our proposal by this committee and by Parliament. It has been pointed out that in regard to certain industries which compete with imported goods, Victoria considerably excels New South Wales, notwithstanding her lesser population. The figures given by <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> show that whilst New South Wales employs only 22,000 people in industries which compete with imported goods, Victoria employs 34,000, or 50 per cent. more. </para>

                            <para>- They are counted similarly in both cases by the New South Wales statistician, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan.</inline> This fact must naturally awake our gravest consideration. Here we find an industry typical of those in which Victoria excels, and in regard to which the position may" be put - " Victoria first, New South Wales nowhere." The hat industry does not exist to any practical purpose in New outh Wales. On the other hand, in Victoria 25 factories have been established, which provide employment for nearly 1,000 people - men and women. When we reflect that the Victorian policy has established an industry which provides practically direct employment for 1,000 people, I venture to think we are afforded a striking illustration of the wisdom of that policy. </para>

                            <para>- We are going for the Victorian policy of maintaining this industry. We are going for the policy of continuing in our midst an industry which is worth preservation. We intend as fairly as we can to prevent the destruction of an industry which is a credit to the State in which it is found. At the same time we are not going for the Victorian policy in the sense in which the honorable member for North Sydney used the term. We do not propose the Victorian rate of duty. The honorable member knows that the Victorian duty was 30s. per dozen. Our proposal was for 10s. per dozen and 15percent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> Applying the varying rates to the consideration of a particular case - for example,, to Italian hats which have recently been largely imported at something approximating 5s. each - the position is that under our Tariff the amount to be collected, would be ls. 7d. only, or 33 per cent., whilst under the Victorian Tariff it would be 2s. 6d., or 50 per cent., a difference of nearly1s. The Victorian rate in that case would be 50 per cent. in excess of that which we proposed. Under these circumstances whilst we intend to encourage a native industry which is deserving of encouragement, we are not going to the length to which Victorians have gone in this direction, and therefore the jibe of the honorable member for North Sydney is altogether undeserved. I should like also to point out that the rates which we are proposing are not nearly so high as those which obtain in America. There the rates are to an extent graduated according to the value of the article, but the range of rates is from 2 dollars and 20 per cent. per dozen to 7 dollars and 20 per cent. per dozen. Thus it is very clear that our proposals, though devised for the proper protection of this industry, fall far short as regards the amount of the duty to be collected, of the duties which previously operated in Victoria, and do not approach the American rates. We have heard gloomy forebodings from the free-traders concerning the disastrous results to the consumer, the wage earner, and everybody else, which would follow the establishment, of an industry by means of protection. Here we have a most striking illustration of the fallacy of all these prophecies. As regards the consumer, we find that he gets as good and as cheap goods in Victoria as can be obtained in any part of the world, whilst as regards the wage-earner, the wages are as high as those to be found in any industry in Australia, and, at the same time, the happiest relations exist between employers and men. On the other hand, where there might be, and otherwise would be 700 people unemployed, we have those people earning the means of subsistence not only for themselves, but for all who happen to be dependent upon them, . supporting other industries, and distributing their wages for the public good in the various channels of daily life. We have the further fact that it is unnecessary for Victoria to import to any considerable extent, £50,000 covering that branch of trade. But New South Wales has to send something like £220,000 out of the country for the purpose of importing hats and caps to meet the daily wants of the people. The general principles of protection and free-trade are illustrated in this particular case, which eloquently proves that protection is good for the consumer, the worker, and the country generally, and that the hat industry is a credit to the State of Victoria. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Sir WILLIAM</inline>McMILLAN (Wentworth). - I look far beyond party in this matter, and I tender my thanks to those honorable members who have assisted the Opposition in bringing about the present position. Without that assistance there would have been a great blot on the national Tariff of Australia, and I congratulate the committee and the Government that this fearful thing has not been perpetrated by an intelligent body of men. A sort of Eldorado has been made of a protected hat factory, or perhaps more than one factory ; but we can make an Eldorado of any particular industry if the great bulk of the people put their hands in their pockets and decide that it should be conducted under such conditions that big wages, big profits, and happy conditions shall prevail. The happy conditions in the particular factory under notice have been created simply by dipping into the pockets of the masses of the people. </para>

                            <para>- It is just as well that the honorable member should explain, because honorable members on the Government side have had to restrain themselves considerably when they have been called ignorant robbers, possessing no knowledge of economics or commercial life. I really think the honorable member for Wentworth does not know what he says in regard to some of these duties, and it is because he is better than his theory that I respect him as I do. I believe that the alteration which is to be made will result in a reduction of wages, lessen the number of hands employed, find be generally prejudicial to this excellent industry. The items on which the duties were reduced yesterday have already had a detrimental effect. In the item under discussion we have to compete with India and with China, and yet honorable members advocate low duties in the interests of the workers of those alien countries. I am confident a mistake is being made, but I take the best duty I can get in the interests' of my native country. </para>

Why could not the Minister be fair to New South Wales for once <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> '' I have been here for nine months now, and I never heard him say a word in favour of that State. He is always quoting figures to show her position in a false light.. But the theory held by the people of that State is that industries should be allowed to take their natural course, and that they are most profitable when they spring up under natural conditions. They do not set themselves to compete with every known industry in the world, whether it be profitable or not. Our I production per head of population is <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> more than that of Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- That is another gibe at New South Wales. With the right honorable and learned gentleman it is Victoria from one end of the week to the other. Why does he not show a federal spirit, and remember that there are other States in the union? The people of New South Wales have reasoned the matter out, they have had experience of both policies, and they have deliberately chosen to discard protection. They know that free-trade has stood them in good stead. While Victoria has been coddling her industries, the people of New South Wales have competed successfully with the whole world, and have gained much national wealth by the interchange of commodities native to the soil. I do not wish to do any injury to the hat-making industry of Victoria. I have the best feelings towards that industry, and I consider, from the samples I have seen, that it turns out a good article. I believe, however, that those engaged in it would do well under more natural conditions. </para>

                            <para>- In all protectionist countries, such as Russia, Japan, China, and Germany, we find that wages are low. In Germany, where their industries are under the aegis of the State, and have been fostered and protected by means of high duties, there are now more than 500,000 artisans out of employment who do" not know where to turn for relief. Such shocking examples of the results of protection should give us pause. I think that the hat industry could get along without 'a specific duty, and with a moderate <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, and I am glad that the Government have determined to sacrifice the proposed specific duty. I hope some consideration will be given to those who have to wear hats as well as to those who have to make them. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Melbourne Ports said that we could not prove that the consumer in Victoria was any worse off in the matter of the price he had to pay for his hats than people in other States. I shall be able to show the contrary. The honorable member also expressed his surprise that labour members should endeavour to reduce the duties. I am not surprised at anything the honorable member says, because he is a protectionist run mad - in fact a prohibitionist. If the honorable member were placed in conditions such as the men whom I represent in Western Queensland find themselves in, he would be a more rabid freetrader than even I am. I ask why we should penalize 4,000,000 of people throughout the Commonwealth for the sake of bolstering up a few industries in Melbourne. Melbourne is not the Commonwealth, and although I am going to support the Government on this occasion I am not going to allow the honorable member to my Father Confessor. The Minister for Trade and Customs referred to the men engaged in the hat industry as niggers and Chinamen, but I throw the statement back in his teeth, and tell him that none of my countrymen are niggers or Chinamen. There is a great struggle for existence in the old country, and consequently wages are lower there than here ; otherwise I would not be in Australia. Referring to the statement of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, that hats are as cheap in Victoria as in the other States, I have figures here which show that hats sold in Sydney at 8s. cost 10s. in Melbourne, and I know from my own experience that hats for which11s. are charged in Melbourne can be bought for 6s. 6d. in Sydney. I bought a hat for the latter price at Messrs. David Jones and Co.'s shop in Sydney, after having been asked11s. for one of similar quality in Melbourne. A hat which costs 10s. 6d. in Sydney is priced at 13s. in Melbourne, and1s. 6d. hats in Sydney cost. 1s.11d. in Melbourne. If hats can be produced in Victoria as cheaply and of as good quality as those which are imported, why do not the Victorian manufacturers send their goods to New South Wales and compete in the open market with the imported article <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I do not wish to see Australians exposed to the competition of cheap German and Italian goods, but we must treat the consumer fairly. He is carrying the whole of the taxation of the Commonwealth, and the desire apparently is to tax everything he eats and everything he wears, and then to expose him to the sneers and jeers of everybody. The Victorian hat makers are not satisfied with selling their goods as homemade articles, but try to deceive the consumer by representing them as being made in England. In 1892 the Customhouse detectives seized 150 dozen Victorian made hats for bearing brands " Best London make, <inline font-style="italic">&amp;c."</inline> The Treasurer, then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Turner, accepted the excuse that the brands referred to the leathers, and allowed the stock of deceptive leathers to be used. Having escaped prosecution, the Denton Company at once gave notice of their intention to reduce wages. This information is to be found in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 1st, 16th, and 20th February, 1892. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member1 for Yarra was in the possession of special information this subject owing to his experience in the 'United Kingdom, in America, "and in 'Victoria; :and' was specially qualified to enlighten 'the House as* to 'the conditions of the trade. He stated the case from a protectionist point of view in a temperate and- reasonable way, and he must have greatly assisted honorable members in coming to a conclusion. Through the instrumentality of the honorable member I have had 'the-pleasure Of visiting the Denton Hat Mills on "two- occasions, and I1 have come to the conclusion that the establishment' is a great credit  to Victoria. The works are extensive, 'and the' Conditions under which' the operatives work areas satisfactory as it impossible 'to make them. .The 'factory has' the advantage of 'first-class 'management, 'and if the industry is, as 'has 'been -stated, -suited 'to 'Our conditions, 'it certainly ought to have been able to hold its own. I do not -wish to 'give a vote 'that might inflict an 'injury 'upon a deserving industry, and-one which- promises to' become-so-sound, as 'to be able 'to withstand the competition bf the 'world. Exception -has been- taken to "the -statement that' the trend of protection is to 'give a Special preference ' to certain favoured individuals who are -interested in manufactures, to the 'detriment of thu general consumer. In reply to that contention, 'the 'honorable' member for Melbourne Ports urges 'that, whilst in connexion with this: industry in Victoria a high1 protective duty has hitherto been operating, the people Of' this State have1 been able to purchase as good an article at as low a price as have the people of free-trade New South Wales, That may be so, or it may n6t. The honorable member' fOr 'Maranoa contends that it is not so. His statement is ' very definite and- specific. He - says that "from personal experience he can testify that the 'New "South Wales- consum'er has an advantage over' the consumer of Victoria. My objection to granting this special preference te the manufacturer is -that' it places him in the position of being -able to- claim a higher percentage upon' the 'articles which' he" manufactures, and at the same time does not prevent him from grinding his operatives down :to the lowest possible conditions. In the <inline font-style="italic">-Age</inline> of 22nd October last, a letter- appeared, -signed by <inline font-weight="bold">"Senator ' Sir 'Frederick</inline> "Sargood, dealing with -the incidence of 'this Tariff in its relation 'to hats. The writer points out that' the' proposed' 'duty of 10s. per dozen, plus 15 pier cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> means an im- post upon a class of hats which are' invoiced from England at '8s. '6d. per dozen of 134 percent. Upon hats costing lis. per dozen the : rate is 1 equivalent to 107 per cent., whereas upon a line valued 'at 34s. per dozen, 'it is only -46' per cent. Upon men's felt' hats, -at 20s.' per dozen, the rate represents 64 per cent., whilst upon a superior class of goods the duty charged is equivalent to only <inline font-style="italic">37</inline> per cent. Upon' boys' woollen and felt hats invoiced from England at. 6s. per dozen, the protection (imposed under this Tariff amounts to 183 per cent.,. and upon hats costing 6s. 6d., 9s., l1s., and 18s. per dozen, the rate charged is respectively 170per cent., 128per cent., 107 per cent., and 72 per cent. Coming 'to female felt- hats, I find that upon those invoiced at8s.6d.per dozen, the duty represents 134 per cent., whilst. upon lines valued at 9s. 6d., 10s.6d.,and 21s. per dozen, the rate imposed is respectively 122 per cent., 112 per cent., and 64 per cent. The Treasurer objects to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty pure and simple on the ground that it will exclude the better class of goods, owing to the very high duty which would have. to be paid upon them. But I would point out that this proposal makes the heaviest charges fall upon those hats which are. worn by the poorer classes of the community. For this reason, I take exception to the . proposals of the Government. I hold that if any special favour is to be shown it should be extended to the working classes. I am pleased to know that the Government have seen the . wisdom of. departing; from. their original proposal to the extent of abandoning the fixed duty and proposing in its stead a.30per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate. The latter proposal is certainly a more reasonable' one. In this connexion I would point out that in New Zealand, under a 25 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, the industry has made substantial progress - progress which compares very favourably with that which it has made in Victoria under a protection ranging from 61 to 400 . per cent. Whilst congratulating the Government. upon having become more reasonable, I . hope that they will see their way clear to. adopt, the New Zealand rate of 25 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- As one . who believes in the general principles . of freetrade, but who is prepared to support the amended proposal, I think it necessary to say one or two -words. . I. regret that occasionally it has been thought - necessary by . honorable members from New '.South Wales to import into the 'debate expressions which may be construed as more or less derogatory to industries which exist in Victoria ; but that, I. am persuaded, is not: really intentional, . but merely owing to the heat of debate. Though I sit on this side of the chamber, and recognise the wider . interests. of the citizens of the Commonwealth, I cannot forget that I represent the State. of Victoria. The hat industry, which has been . nurtured under. exceptionally favorable conditions, is . one of which we in Victoria are proud. The manufacturers . pay excellent wages, and the conditions under - which the industry is conducted , are (favorable to the health of those employed, while those who have embarked their capital get a substantial reward. I . am , not . one who believes that either a. manufacturer . or, an importer,, or, any one engaged in any. industry, is not entitled to receive just and . adequate compensation for his labour or for the capital invested. </para>

                            <para>- I am not aware that there is. any very serious charge laid on the consumer. I was very much impressed with the straightforward, practical address given by the honorable member for Yarra,, and it was my privilege to hear all that was said by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports ; and when honorable members, with such long practical experience, lay before . the committee detailed information, they will always receive . and deserve the attention which was paid to : those honorable members. I shall always be diffident in speaking on any subject of which I have no practical -knowledge ; but there has been an important departure in the consideration of this item. Had the Government persevered in their intention to fix a composite duty I should have been compelled to vote, against them ; . but I congratulate them on having made a compromise, which I sincerely hope honorable members will unanimously accept. My reasons for expressing 'that opinion are based on some figures which have, been prepared for me, and which show that hats , invoiced at 10s. per dozen would, under the original . proposal of the Government, , pay11s. 6d. in duty, whereas under the old Victorian Tariff they paid 24s. per dozen. Hats invoiced at 20s. a dozen under the original proposal would pay 13s. ; at 30s. . a dozen, 14s. 6d. ;.and at 40s. a dozen, 16s., as against the Victorian Tariff , of 24s. in each case. It will thus be seen that even the original, proposal of the Government meant a considerable reduction on the Victorian Tariff. I understand that the average value of the hats , which are imported in any quantity is about 60s. per dozen, the composite duty on which would have been 19s., as against 30s. under the Victorian Tariff. The composite duty in the last case means 31 per cent. ; but now the Government have proposed a compromise which, under all the circumstances, I am prepared to accept in view of the peculiar conditions of this trade. Special attention has been called to the varying fashions in hats. </para>

                            <para>- Then I will say that the Government see that the public interest will not be endangered by the reduction of duties. Why, then, were we asked to support such a high duty? So far we have never gone beyond 25 per cent, on manufacturing lines, and it is wrong to single out a special class of industry, and consent, merely as a matter of compromise, to a higher duty. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has himself pointed out that 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, would prevent imported hats coming into competition with local manufacturers. </para>

                            <para>- Even supposing the honorable member uttered that statement by mistake, still the committee ought not to be called on to pass this extra duty in view of the assertion that, in New South Wales, hats similar to those manufactured in Victoria cannot be purchased for the same price as in the latter State. I will accept that statement, and believe that the hat company in Victoria is so patriotic that it prefers to sell hats here at a less price than could be got for them in New South Wales. But if that be the case no duty whatever is needed. We are told that this company always pays the best wages and never takes advantage of the duty ; but the present directors may disappear at any moment and be succeeded by others who may not be guided by the same scrupulous business habits. What is to prevent them, the moment the duty is passed by Parliament, from increasing the price of their hats up to the amount at which other hats can come into competition ' with theirs ? It is perfectly clear that there could be no objection to their taking such an advantage of the duty as business men. Under these circumstances the hat-makers could easily form themselves into a trust, sell their produce perhaps 5 per cent, below what could be obtained for imported hats, and pocket the difference of 25 per cent. There are 16,000 operatives in the clothing . and similar trades throughout the Commonwealth, and the amount of duty we have given them is only 25 per cent. Why, then, should we hand over to an industry which employs only 1,350 hands, 2S0 of whom are in New South Wales, so high a duty as 30 per cent? The Government have already come down from their original proposal, and as we have beaten them so far it would be a mistake to give up the fight without endeavoring to further reduce the duty. It is said that 30 per cent. is a compromise. It is a compromise as between the prohibitionists and the protectionists, but it is no compromise as between the protectionists of Victoria and the free-traders of the rest of the Commonwealth. Let us look at the question from a revenue point of view. It will be found that a duty which would bring in the maximum of revenue with the minimum of inconvenience and lessened consumption, would be about 15 per cent. on some articles, and not more than 5 to 10 per cent. on others. In this case the duty might run up to 15 per cent. without unduly lessening consumption. But we are now asked to impose a duty of double that amount. Therefore, before the duty is agreed to we ought at all events to have some arguments advanced as to why a special exemption should be made in favour of a hat company, thus extorting taxes from the people. </para>

                        <para>- The reason why this duty is fixed at 30 per cent. is that all reductions are a matter of degree. In the past we have made reductions on former protectionist duties of from 10 to 20 per cent. In this case we are making a reduction of from 50 to 100 per cent. on the amount of the previous duty. It would be a mistake to lay down a hard and fast rule. Each case should be considered on its merits. Considering that in the case of the hat trade so large a reduction is being made, the committee might agree to 30 per cent. Some fears have been expressed about the formation of a trust. I" hope that with the larger market that will be opened up, in consequence of the establishment of the Commonwealth, hat factories will be established in all the States. If that be done, there will be no danger of a trust. One great drawback at present is that traders cannot go to the factory and purchase hats. The whole produce of the factory has to pass through one or two firms, which control the article and thus prevent competition. Last night I said I would support a duty of 25 per cent., but the difference of 5 per cent. between that and what is now proposed, is' not' worth quarrelling about. I shall therefore vote for the duty of 30 per cent. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SYDNEY</inline>SMITH (Macquarie).While I am pleased at the moderation which has been displayed by the protectionists in assisting us to bring about this reduction, I regret that we have not been able to still further reduce the duty. The hat manufacturers of Victoria have had the benefit of very heavy protection for many years, and claim to have established their industry on a sound basis, and in view of the fact that they have the raw material ready to their hands, they should be in a position to carry on successfully without high protection. If the Government had succeeded in their first proposal, a very heavy tax would have been inflicted on the people of the Commonwealth, and particularly on the poorer classes, because the duty would have represented an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> impost of about 150 or 160 per cent. on the goods they use, as contrasted with a duty of from 50 to 70 per cent. on the better class of goods. I am sorry that the Government have not seen their way to place this duty on the same footing as the duty on woollen goods, but I suppose we must be thankful for small mercies. </para>

                            <para>- One of the principal objections to a fixed duty in connexion with the line we have just disposed of was that it would apply to fully ten different lines of goods of widely varying values, and that a fixed duty could not be equitably adjusted. I quite admit that that objection does not apply with the same force to dress hats, although there are two or three shades of value even in them. There is no necessity, however, to depart from the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> principle in this case. I approve of fixed duties only where it is very difficult, to arrive at the true value of an article, and where an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty would probably offer premiums- to fraud. The <inline font-style="italic">ad-valorem</inline> principle is- clearly the best' to apply" to' Hats of' all classes; arid: I would therefore ask-the Government to fix what' they- consider 'a proper 'ad <inline font-style="italic">valorem</inline> duty for this line, and adopt it1 as a' matter of' symmetry. </para>

A proposal was made to induce the duty from- 20s. to 10s-., and a 10s. rate was adopted. A large number of 'members - a very large minority, if not" a majority - thought the duty' should be fixed at 15s., and1 one honorable member, who was quite within his rights,- moved an amendment to that effect in a form similar to that- now suggested' by the honor-1 able and learned . member for  Werriwa; We - used our influence with the honorable member I refer fro, to prevent' him.'from proposing: his-' amendment, because we' thought that if such a course' were adopted -it would open up the re-discussion of a large 'number of. other items -in a  similar- way; and probably lead to'great confusion. Under these circumstances-- I trust that- the' honorable member for Werriwa1 will not proceed in' the way he has indicated. </para>

                        <para>- It is a question whether these articles ought not to be free. The canvas from which tents and tarpaulins are made has by a previous decision of the committee been put on the free list ; and I think that most, if not all, used in New South Wales are made within the State. It would be just as reasonable to call the hemming of a handkerchief an industry as to impose a protective duty under this heading. Why should we pretend that protection is required when it is not ? We have to consider the people in the interior of the country where tents and tarpaulins are necessary for the purpose of covering men and goods. As there is involved no manufacturing process worth talking about, and we have made the raw material free, we should not stultify ourselves by imposing a duty here. I move - </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the amendment is necessary, because for years past these small bags have been made in the country without any duty. But, apart from that, there is some danger in the form of the amendment. It would interfere with the export of flour. Why do we not put a duty upon ore bags? Simply because it would interfere with the producers of ore, and increase the cost of their product in the markets of the world. The same objection applies to a duty on 50-lb. flour bags. Certainly bags of that description should be exempt. Then, further, " 3 bushels " is rather a vague term. It would mean rather a large bag, and would include a number of bags which the honorable member for Bland does not wish, to include. It is likewise a mistake to use the word "sacks," which is always applied to large-sized bags. So that even if the amendment is to be adopted, the wording should be altered. </para>

                        <para>- This matter requires careful consideration. If a certain line of calico bags are made here just as cheaply as they can be imported, and the proposal will not add to the cost of producing the article placed in the bags, I fail to see that there is any need for the amendment. On the other hand, if it is going to prevent the importation of bags and to add to the producer's expenses, it will be an additional burden upon the farmers. As to the smaller sized bags, I would point out that there is a general movement amongst the farmers of New South Wales to reduce the size of the bags in which they bag their wheat. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. RONALD</inline>(Southern Melbourne).The point has been raised as to whether the proposed duty will affect the farmer. I do not think it will. I also think that the amendment should include hessian bags, which are locally manufactured. There are some 500 workers in the industry in Victoria. They have had a measure of protection hitherto, and if it is withdrawn, there is a danger of them ceasing to make bags. To leave out hessian bags would be a blow to the local industry. A duty would not hurt the farmer, but would fall upon the milling, sugar-making, and salt industries, which are already protected. With the exemption of bunnies struck out, and with protection extended to hessians, the amendment would be satisfactory. Our workers cannot compete with the 9d. a week labour of India. There is also the point that the imported bags to a large extent come from the plague-stricken districts of the East, and it is highly desirable that we should not have our meat and flour wrapped in materials so produced. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt that a duty on hessians would affect the farmer very much. In both Victoria and New South Wales the question of handling grain at a cheaper rate is engaging a good deal of attention, and the decision at present lies between the erection of grain elevators and the adoption of the Californian system of using small 100-lb. bags. As far as I have been able to follow the discussion on the matter, I feel very strongly that 100-lb. bags will probably be adopted here. The Americans have been using elevators in the Eastern States for many years, and as they have not adopted them in California, there is no doubt good reason for supposing that where wheat has to be conveyed . long distances by sea the use of small bags has distinct advantages. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member quite misunderstands the amendment. It is not intended to subject to duty any material that is likely to be used for making wheat bags. The proposal, is limited entirely to cotton bags, such as are used for flour and oatmeal and similar products. A number of women and. children are engaged in this bag-making industry throughout the various States, and I do not think 10 per cent. would be too much protection to give them. It would not lead to any great increase in the price of the article, because 7-lb. cotton bags with the name of the purchaser printed on them and ready for use are sold for 71/2d. per dozen. </para>

                        <para>- I think that flour bags even smaller than 50-lb. bags might be exempted, because there is a strong tendency towards the use of smaller bags for the shipment of flour. If we can export flour instead of wheat it will be very much better for us, because we shall provide additional employment for our people. Therefore we should do nothing to add to the. cost: of exportation. </para>

                            <para>- It has already been agreed to in connexion with " narcotics " and: " stimulants-. " The regulation' would; of course, provide that the cloth must not be used for any other purpose. Otherwise. I do not think that a sufficient description can be given to the cloth to identify it. If the honorable member for. Bland has no objection, the Government would prefer to put the amendment in the form I' have indicated. The result of such a provision would be that the cloth: would not be admitted upon the terms laid down in the Tariff, unless the Customs authorities were placed in a position to see that it was used for the purpose for. which it was imported. </para>

Surely, when the rate of duty to be paid depends upon the purpose to which the cloth is to be put; the Customs officials. ought to have some means of seeing that it is used for the purpose for which it is intended to be used. </para>

                        <para>- I think that these articles should be placed upon the free list. They are the raw materials of waterproof manufacturers-. They cannot be manufactured for other purposes indeed they cannot be manufactured in any of the States of the Commonwealth. If we impose a duty of10 per cent. upon them, as a natural corollary the rate upon the finished. article must also be increased. That means that the price of waterproof cloth will be increased to the consumer, and it must be remembered that waterproof coats are in general use throughout the community. If we impose a duty of 10 per cent. upon, the raw; materials used in. the manufacture of waterproof clothing, and follow up our action by levying a 25 per cent, rate upon the manufactured garment, the consumer will have to pay the additional 15 per cent. As these articles cannot be made here - and I have seen a letter from one of the Ballarat mills, stating that they cannot: - why should we tax the raw materials, and thus increase the cost of waterproof goods throughout the Commonwealth ? 1 </para>

                            <para>- At the present time most of these articles are dutiable at 15 per cent. We did propose to impose a duty of 20 per cent, upon the india rubber cloth. The garments made from that cloth will be dutiable at 25 per cent. This is an industry which provides a certain amount of work, though, perhaps, not a large amount. Probably in time it will become a large industry. After getting further information from the honorable member for Bland and others, we thought that we had hardly allowed a fair margin between the duty imposed upon the material out of which the article has to be made and the duty upon the article itself. We desire to give a 10 per cent, margin. That means allowing the imported cloth to come in at 15 per cent., instead of 20 cent. If we impose a duty of 15 per cent, upon the raw materials, we shall be doing an injustice to the manufacturers of the cloth. At the same time there is no reason why we should allow the raw materials to come in free, and give the manufacturers a 15 per cent, protection. The honorable member for Flinders would give 10 per cent, protection to the makers of the cloth, and 15 per cent, to the manufacturers of the garment. If we admit the raw materials free we shall be throwing away a certain amount of revenue, because these articles are imported. But if we levy a duty of 10 per cent, upon the raw materials, of 15 per cent, upon the cloth, and of 25 per cent, upon the made-up article, we shall be allowing a fair margin between the three. The honorable member for Bland has suggested that we might admit the raw materials at a lower rate, subject to departmental regulation. I think that it is absolutely necessary for us to adopt that course. Certainly we are not going to allow these goods, to be imported and used for purposes other than those for which they were intended. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. RONALD</inline>(Southern Melbourne).I think that the proposal of the Government is a very fair compromise. This industry is a very flourishing one. Already there is one factory established in our midst which has invested £50,000 in the venture. It employs a large number of hands, and to my mind a fair margin of protection should be extended to it. One could have wished that the Treasurer had proposed a differential duty of 10 per cent., but in order to avoid complications I hope that the suggestion of the honorable member for Bland will be accepted. </para>
                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMSON</inline>(North Sydney).- The question of admitting the raw material subject to departmental regulation has been referred to, but according to my recollection we have not yet passed anything subject to such regulations. Honorable members have yet to determine to what extent they will allow the Tariff to go through containing such large powers as those suggested. It has been said that the exemption contained ' under the * heading of " narcotics and stimulants " is subject to departmental regulation. It was understood that exemptions were to be taken at the end of each division, but they have not been put to the committee until this or the previous item. There seems to be no need for the words " pursuant to departmental by-laws," because if the material is said to be used for the manufacture of waterproofs, the Customs authorities can insist on any proof they consider necessary. </para>

                        <para>- I am not sure that this item ought not to be free. We differentiate simply in order to get raw material as cheaply as. possible for what we consider Australian industries, and there is little good in unearthing this article from the 15 per cent. category unless we make it absolutely free. I am always against these exemptions if they can possibly be avoided, because they offer tremendous inducements to fraud. </para>

                        <para>- By way of an illustration of the general difficulties under the Tariff, I should like to say that as to linings, which we have decided shall be free, the Customs authorities have laid it down that they shall be free only " when suitable for no other purpose." That was not what we provided in committee, and, as a matter of fact, all linings may be suitable for other purposes. I have heard of a lining, like stiff open gauze, and another lining which was close and more pliable, the latter of which was admitted free, while the former was regarded as possibly suitable for boys' shirting, and consequently was charged duty. </para>

                    <para>Mr.KENNEDY (Moira).- The term " bran bag"covers the class of bag required "for bran and similar produce. The term asked to be included by the honorable member for Bland, namely,"potato and onion bags." 'would include that class of bag. The 'term "'gunny" is a class of hessian, which comes in made up, and may enter into competition with the cotton bag, which is used for meal and similar classes of produce. There is always considerable trouble in distinguishing between gunny and hessian. The proposal of the honorable member for Bland covers everything that is intended "to be included in the word "gunny." </para>
