                    <para>- I wish to ask the Minister for Home Affairs to consider&#39; whether he can see his way to allow country postal officials to have their quarters free. In many cases the officials - not only postmasters, but also postmistresses - are actually taking care of Government property, and I think in fixing the rent attaching to the buildings that circumstance should be taken into consideration. I have an amendment which I do not wish to press&#39;; but, at the same time, I would like to know whether the honorable gentleman feels disposed to consider the question, or to entertain an amendment allowing free rent to these officers in certain cases. </para>

                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BATCHELOR</inline>(South Australia).I wanted to raise the same question. In some of the States practically all the postmasters, from the Deputy Postmaster downwards, are allowed free residence. What I would like to know from the Minister is whether clause 51, under which any officer taken over by the Commonwealth will preserve all his existing and accruing rights, will be construed to cover the use of tho buildings for residential purposes. In South Australia the officers have had this right for .many years, and, .unless that right is continued,&#39; there will be a distinct drop in their salaries. I believe the principle of the clause .is quite right - that where the use of buildings is allowed free for residential purposes, a fair rent should be allowed for them, in order to place all the officers on the same .footing. </para>

                    <para>- In the case .of Victoria then there will be no difficulty, but -in the case of some other States the rent is not added to the salary : .it is entirely apart from the salary. If the privilege is to be taken away from these postmasters, some of their existing rights will- bc taken away ; and if it is not taken away in. some of the States the officers will be having their quarters free while in others they will be paying for them. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to support the suggestion . made by the honorable member for Cowper. In .the past a great deal of hardship .has- occurred to numbers of -public servants who are compelled by regulation .to reside in quarters which have .been provided for them. In many instances the quarters have been totally unsuitable to the requirements of their families, which have had to be divided, the. men being compelled to remain on the premises in order to protect Government property. Sometimes they have hod to add, at their own expense, to .the . accommodation provided in .order .that their families might remain. It would bc. a good thing if the Government were to follow the practice adopted by .banking companies and so regulate .transfers and removals as to accord with the accommodation at the disposal of the State. The Government could, on the other hand, do away altogether with charging for rent. If a .man. is compelled by reason of the Government&#39;s necessity - as in the case of a postmaster, who- has to protect valuable property - to reside on the premises, he should not be penalised in any shape or&#39; form, but should rather receive more consideration seeing that, in addition to his ordinary duties, he acts as custodian of Government property. I .quite agree with the .latter part of the clause, which provides that in calculating for any purpose the rate of salary, the amount deducted as rent shall be taken into account. We have had cases in Victoria - and I think the honorable member for Gippsland will bear me out - where claims have been made for pensions based on the rate of salary paid in addition to the amount deducted for rent ; although these claims have been resisted by the State. As I said, I. agree with .the latter part of the clause,- but I would .like to see every consideration given to those employes of the State who, for purely departmental- reasons, are compelled to reside in. quarters provided for them in buildings used by the State. </para>

                    <para>- I do not disagree with the principle of the clause, but I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to a state of affairs that has arisen in New South Wales, under a somewhat similar position, and to ask- him to endeavour to provide against that under the Commonwealth. In New South Wales the rent charged .for th e building is liable to fluctuation according to. the salary a man .gets, without any alteration in the accommodation provided. In some cases - say for instance, the case of a school teacher - the.salary has been increased because of .the large attendance at the school, and the Government have promptly mulcted the officer in an extra amount for rent. Tho proper -way would be to fix a fair rent, and a fair rent only, for the accommodation provided for the officer. I would . like the Minister to say whether it would not be possible to definitely provide that .the commissioner, who under the clause .has the fixing of the rent, should be guided by .the .fair rental value of the building, and that there should be no consideration of the salary. In other respects I do not see much objection to the clause. The suggestion of the honorable .member for Cowper would, it seems to me, be awkward in sofar as it involves .a comparison between the positions of two officers, one having a residence provided and another not having it. The one who had no residence provided would, while getting the same salary, have to provide a residence for himself and pay rent to a private individual. It. would not be fair to create any such distinction as that, and therefore I think it only proper that the salary and the&#39; rental should be regarded as distinct. Where I disagree with the clause is that there is no provision that the rent charged shall be a fair rent as against the value of the building for residential purposes. </para>

                    <para>- I should like the Minister to give me one piece of information in regard to this clause. The clause says &#34; If an officer is allowed to use for the purpose of residence the whole or part &#34; of a Government building, rent shall be charged. Does that mean that only where an officer has a choice and uses the building it has to be charged, or does it extend to cases where lie is compelled to use the building <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The clause when it comes to be administered may receive either one construction or the other, and we ought to make up our minds at once whether it is to apply universally. If the clause is to apply universally, the word &#34;allowed&#34; may raise some difficulty. It may be said on the one side or the other, that an officer had chosen to use the building, or that the clause ought not to be applied where there was compulsion. The Minister might take a note of the point, and consider whether he intends the clause to apply universally. If he does intend the clause to apply universally, I would suggest that he use other words. </para>

                    <para>- My reading of the clause is, that it is optional on the part of the Governor-General whether there shall be a charge made. The clause uses the word &#34;may,&#34; and I can imagine a number of cases where there ought not to be any charge made. The conditions of service rendered to a State or the Federal Government are such that some consideration should be shown in this connexion. Take the case of lighthouse-keepers. </para>

                    <para>. - The object of the clause is to have uniformity as far as possible. But I admit the provision may be used in such a manner as to cause hardship in the case of light-house keepers just now referred to. In some States light-house . keepers are charged rent, and in other States they are . not charged. I understand that in New South Wales they are. not charged, while in Victoria they are. There . are cases where postmasters reside in the post-office, possibly pretty good buildings, for which a high rent is charged where really there should be a low rent. The clause is, therefore, made elastic, and not compulsory, the matter being left in the hands of the commissioner. I am not, however, much wedded to this clause. </para>

                        <para>- The clause reads - &#34; And the- amount of such sum shall, be fixed by the commissioner or by officers specially or generally appointed by the commissioner.&#34; The intention is to make the clause elastic, but the words used do not seem to me to be the best. It would be better, if we retain the clause, to substitute the words &#34;If an officer occupies for the purpose of residence,&#34; &#38;c., instead of &#34;is allowed to use.&#34; The present words might be construed&#39; to mean quite the opposite of what is intended. It does not matter under, what conditions an officer occupies premises ; so long as he resides there, it should be for the commissioner or | the Governor-General to deal with the 1 question of rent. But there is power in the Bill to deal with .this, and I do not care whether or not the clause is left in. In computing the salaries of officers the commissioner, the permanent head, and the Governor-General can take into consideration the residences occupied in Government buildings. I suggest that the clause be altered in the direction I have just indicated. I think that will meet the case, and then the provision will remain sufficiently elastic to permit of light-house keepers not being charged. But it has to be remembered that in computing pensions some trouble has arisen in the past in considering the question whether the rental ought to be included. We want to get rid of that trouble. We wish to have no doubt about it in the future. That seems to be the only reason for the insertion of this clause. I move - </para>

There has been too great a fluctuation and not enough of system, so that civil servants very properly complain that they do not know where they stand in regard to these rents. We ought to have something definite, it seems to me, so that the Minister or the commissioner should not have an entirely free discretion in regard to this matter. </para>

                    <para>- I suggest that these words would create further difficulties instead of easing the situation, because there fire some premises built on a palatial scale in which an officer is expected to reside, and the insertion of the words proposed by the honorable member for Bland really mean that a fair rental value is to be the basis of the valuation. The words &#34; not exceeding &#34; must be read with the other words in the clause, and must be taken to mean something beyond what the other words by themselves would convey. We have it provided that the rental must be a fair and reasonable sum, and it is now proposed that the terms fair and reasonable should be governed by some other consideration. Therefore, we shall be making the lot of the civil servants heavier than before, because many of them are compelled to live in buildings erected in a princely style, and if they are valued upon their rental value, the servants residing in them will be mulcted in an extremely high rental. </para>

                    <para>- I presume the Minister in charge of the Bill has looked into the meaning of the clause if amended as proposed. In Victoria there has been a great deal of difficulty arising over the question of charging rent for quarters. Before the present practice was put into force, the officers&#39; salaries were based on a lesser amount than would have been the case if they had not been charged rent, and it was found that their pension rights were computed on the amount, of the salary alone, without any consideration being given to the amount charged for rent. When the Public Service Board were appointed, in order to cure this anomaly they added the value of the rent to the salary in most cases - I am told it was not done universally&#39; - in order that both might be taken into consideration in computing an officer&#39;s pension or retiring allowance. This was done with the concurrence and at the request of the officers occupying the quarters; but some officers took legal opinion years. afterwards, and were told that the Government could not legally charge them rent for quarters which they were compulsorily occupying. They brought actions against the Government, and some of the judges upheld their view, and I believe there is an: appeal pending now. It is, therefore, necessary in dealing with this matter to see that justice is done all round. </para>

                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HUME</inline>COOK (Bourke).- Quite a number of cases arose in Victoria in which the Government were prepared, in calculating the pensions, to take into consideration the amount charged for rent, but would make no allowance at all for the sum deducted for rations or fuel. Of course, both these items, fuel and rations, and rent, were deducted from the salary, but if the officer had not been living on the Government premises there would have been no deduction on account of rent ; and if he had not received the rations that the Government insisted upon his taking, no deduction would have been made from his salary for rations. </para>

                        <para>- I should say so. Under ordinary circumstances, what applied to the service prior to the transfer will apply still, and lest that may be so I think that it ought to be made clear that civil servants are to have an allowance made for any rations or fuel that they may be charged for. I believe that the men in the defence forces and those that are employed at light-houses and so on are now being charged so much for fuel and food in just the same way as before the transfer took place, and if that is so, they ought to be protected by the amendment I now suggest. If it is not so, there is no necessity for the amendment. </para>

My point was whether, in the event of - an officer having these privileges free now, on its being intimated to him, under the provision of this clause, that he will have to pay certain rent for the premises he is occupying, the amount so charged will be added to his salary. It seems to me that in no other way can we preserve existing rights, and unless I am assured on this point I shall have to vote against the clause. </para>

                        <para>- If all Members of Parliament had the same influence as the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, it would probably be a good thing to extend the provision as he suggests. But we do not all occupy the honorable member&#39;s predominant position in this House and in the estimation of all good democrats around those ports, the trade of which he desires to restrict. If honorable members wish to include Members of Parliament- there is nothing to prevent their making; a further amendment: Judging .from the high record attained by Parliaments, in the past, I feel sure that no Member of Parliament will ever&#39; use his position for the purpose of advancing his relations or acquaintances in the service of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BATCHELOR</inline>(South Australia.)I am quite as prepared to vote for this amendment as to prevent Ministers of State, as well as the commissioner and chief officers from appointing their relatives. But I do not believe in putting a barrier in the way of the appointment of any person, from the mere fact of his being connected by blood or marriage with any officer. If the officer is not to be trusted he should not be there. We might as reasonably go further and provide that no relative by blood or marriage of any civil servant should be appointed,. The principle of the proposal seems to be the-&#39; assumption that the chief officers, or the men whom we are going, to place in positions in which they are supposed to do justice all around without fear or favour, will be men who will place their own relatives in offices of the service. </para>

                    <para>- I intend to vote against the clause. The more we attempt to amend - such a provision the more difficulties we create. We have already had a <inline font-style="italic">reductio ad-</inline><inline font-style="italic">absurdum</inline> with regard to Members of Parliament and the appointment of &#39; &#39;their relatives- to the public service. In the&#39;1 past; whenever nepotism and political influence have been exerted, it has&#39; been done, not by Members of&#39; Parliament for&#39; those related to them in blood, but in behalf of their friends or those who have been useful to them politically. If nepotism were limited to relatives of Members of Parliament, or of Ministers, there would be very little to complain about. As a rule, so far as I am able to judge, the exercise&#39; of this kind of influence comes from a sort of weakness on the part of&#39; Members of Parliament in .assisting, not their own relatives, but their more persistent friends. Appointments are very well safeguarded already by the provisions&#39; relating to the permanent head &#39;and the commissioner upon whom the responsibility should rest. Inasmuch as we cannot make regulations to deal with every case, I would allow appointment to rest on the particular merits of each case. </para>

                <para class="block">I think these words only embarrass the operation of the clause. The unfitness may not be permanent and yet may make it quite necessary that the officer should be transferred to some other position. As the clause stands there is no alternative. Such officers must go out of the service. It may very often happen that an officer may prove to be unfit to discharge the duties of the position in which he happens to be owing to misfortune, and yet may be capable of rendering good service in some other capacity. I think it would be wise to leave out this question of permanent character, because in the service if it is only incapacity for a year it is sufficiently serious to lead to some alteration. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to call attention to the case of certain civil servants who are incapacitated in the exercise of their official duties. Take, for example, the case of telegraph operators. We know that such men are liable to be affected by telegraphic paralysis. They would be quite capable of filling other positions, such as the office of postmaster, and it would be a great hardship to compel them to retire as incapacitated. I think the amendment ought to take the form of providing that where men have been incapacitated owing to the nature of their official duties, but are capable of fulfilling other duties in the service, they shall not be called upon to retire. </para>

                    <para>- Last week the question whether- public servants, who frequently refuse or- neglect to pay their debts, should not- be dealt with in some way, was brought up by the honorable- and learned member for Corio. A division was taken on the amendment moved by that honorable and learned member, and it was negatived. However, members expressed their sympathy with the object sought to be attained, but disagreed with the wording of the proposed amendment, as they deemed it too inquisitorial in- its nature. I have drafted a new- sub-clause to deal with the subject, which could follow after clause 1. </para>

                    <para>- Perhaps before the honorable member moves his amendment, I may be permitted to-make a remark as to sub-clause (1). The object of this sub-clause, I think, we are all in favour- of, but&#39; cases may arise under it which would require consideration. Of&#39; course we associate with indictment and conviction some criminal act, but my right honorable and learned friend knows that it is possible that a man may be convicted for a thing which is not in the nature of a criminal offence. It is a difficulty which might arise, most rarely perhaps, but the matter is one which, I think, ought to be considered. There may be other cases of this class, and I confess- it is difficult to suggest a proper amendment. I shall not propose an amendment, but I simply ask that- the Government will consider the&#39; matter; and, if it can be so dealt with, will endeavour to draw a line between acts which are in their nature criminal acts and acts which are not of that nature. </para>

My right honorable and learned friend knows that under&#39; the law of New South Wales, for instance, and in some of the other States, a man may be convicted of&#39; manslaughter, while the offence will be really so trivial that the Judge will, decline to pass sentence. In a case of that kind it would be absurd to talk of taking away a man&#39;s livelihood; In some of these cases the offence may really be an accident. </para>

When this Bill was being discussed in committee&#39; a few nights ago, the honorable and learned member for Corio moved an amendment to the effect&#39; that any person who frequently neglected or refused to pay his debts should be liable to dismissal from the public &#39;service. -Here is an amendment providing, for exactly &#39;the same class of offence. I call attention to Standing Order No. 223, which states that a motion contradictory of a previous decision of the committee shall not be entertained in the same committee.&#39; I therefore submit that this amendment is out of order. </para>

The words the honorable and learned member for Corio proposed to insert were &#34; of frequently neglecting to pay his debts.&#34; I take it this is altogether a different thing. The other amendment provided for a certain amount of inquisitiveness into a man&#39;? affairs, while this provides simply that if a man does not pay his debts the matter may be reported to the commissioner, who may inflict such punishment as is deserved. </para>

                    <para>- There is one very dangerous element in this proposed addition. It begins by saying &#34; If any officer shall be sued in any court.&#34; A man may be persecuted by all sorts of worthless people simply for the purpose of humiliating him by compelling him to give an account of the circumstances of a quarrel or dispute. If the honorable member would begin his sub-clause with the words, &#34; if any officer shall have a verdict recorded against him in any court for debt,&#34; and further down take out the words &#34; and the result of the suit,&#34; I would not object. </para>

                    <para>- I am not quite sure whether this is the right place to insert this provision. Clause 40, which I hope will be reconsidered, deals with offences of various kinds which, once an officer is charged with them, are made the&#39; subject of inquiry by the Board. I would suggest to the honorable member for Echuca - I am in sympathy with his object, although I do not think I can quite agree with the words he has used- that it would be better to allow this matter to be rediscussed on the reconsideration of clause 40. </para>

                        <para>- I think it would be far better to leave it as other offences by civil servants are left when they are lodged to be inquired into. Too much arbitrary power is here given to an officer, who may or may not take a proper view of the circumstances of the case. I think it would be better to leave this matter, if it is considered an offence at all, to be put in clause 40 on reconsideration. </para>

                    <para>- I do not like this clause at all. I am of the same opinion as the honorable member for Tasmania. I believe the mode adopted by the Government of paying monthly, especially minor servants, is largely the cause of a great deal of the trouble that arises. I am afraid that the lower paid officers would be the greater sufferers under the provision. While I am as anxious as any honorable member can be that public servants should pay their debts, 1 do not think the amendment in its present form would serve the object which we have in view, and it might operate very harshly. </para>

                    <para>- I am sure the honorable member for Echuca wishes to do nothing harsh in the matter, but I feel no doubt that the result of the sub-clause, if passed in its proper form, would be exceedingly harsh. It would be inquisitorial-, and it would be setting up what perhaps is worse than anything else - a new tribunal. Ordinary offences come under clause 40, and there an officer has the right to have a preliminary inquiry - he has the right to be sent to a board, and we hope that there will be a right of representation on that board. But this amendment creates a short and summary method which gives a limited power to a particular individual, the permanent head, to inquire into an unfortunate officer&#39;s past life. It has to appear to the permanent head that the man is in debt either by carelessness, extravagance, or dishonesty, which presupposes an inquiry, and then the case has to go before the commissioner who is to have the power to inflict such punishment as is in his opinion deserved, it may be from suspension in one sense to suspension in another sense, from all that appears in the sub-clause. I do put to my honorable friend the desirability of dealing with this matter on the recommittal of clause 40. I think he will then be able to secure recognition of the principle which he wishes to adopt without any inconsistency between the various parts of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member must be very stubborn. I think there should be a clause something like this inserted, because we all know from practical experience that although the majority of public officers will not do anything that will be reprehensible, there will be cases with which the commissioner and the permanent head should be able to deal. Perhaps this provision is a little too drastic, and if it is proceeded with now I propose to suggest the omission of certain words near the end, and simply to give power to reprimand, fine, or recommend to the Governor-General for dismissal. </para>

Sub-clause (2) of clause 56 deals with the question of debt, but it provides what shall be done in the case of a man who becomes insolvent either voluntarily or otherwise. By bringing the proposed sub-clause in before sub-clause (2) we shall deal with the matter at a stage before a man becomes insolvent, and if inserted, the provision might be the means of preventing him from becoming insolvent. </para>

                        <para>- This House can do no more worthy thing than set before our public servants, and, through the latter, before the people of the colony, the necessity of paying their debts - that credit is considered undesirable, and debt a disgrace, if incurred through extravagance, recklessness, or dishonesty. In the Bill we are making provision that every man who enters the Government service shall have a living wage, which is supposed to be what a man can live comfortably on, according to his position in life. With a living wage there is no excuse, under ordinary circumstances, for a man getting into debt. Of course there may, in the case of every man, be exceptional circumstances, such as those of sickness, by which a man may be compelled to incur debt against his will ; but if the facts of such cases are made known to the permanent head, he will immediately do justice, and no action whatever will be taken against the officer. I believe the suggested provision would benefit officers and their families, and set a good example to the people of the Commonwealth. It would certainly benefit the tradesmen ; and the honorable member for Corio, who has had great experience in the matter, told us last week of various cases he had known of most glaring dishonesty on the part of public servants in this connexion. This clause is by no means directed to the lower grades of the public service, because extravagance, dishonesty and carelessness generally are found just as much amongst officers in higher positions. In regard to the penalty, I propose to omit in the last line of the proposed new sub-clause the words &#34;in his opinion is deserved,&#34; and to insert in lieu thereof &#34;such punishment as may be prescribed.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I am going to propose an amendment which I think will be better than the one just suggested. I have already suggested that instead of providing that all this inquiry shall take place when a man is sued - which would put him in the hands of any one who had a dislike for him, or who wanted to persecute or humiliate him - the clause should provide only for cases in which a verdict is recorded against the officer. I would suggest that the provision read as follows : - </para>

                        <para>- I have not mentioned the clause, because clauses sometimes get transposed, and the number is lost. I much prefer the amendment I have submitted to placing despotic power in the hands of one or two gentlemen, who, however well disposed, would be able to disrate or dismiss an officer. The power given by the clause suggested includes dismissals, disrating, reprimands, and cautions- everything that is in the hands of a board of inquiry. I certainly object to such a power being given in the way proposed, and I shall have to vote against the clause. If a matter is so serious as to merit its being placed in this Bill and being made the subject of inquiry - as to whether a man has incurred a debt recklessly, extravagantly, or dishonestly - it is not too much to say we should have the tribunal fixed . by statute, in which the officer involved may be represented in the way it is intended, before he is branded for life. If it is not a serious matter, it ought not to be in the Bill at all ; but if it is serious, the man has a right to inquiry by a board. If the word &#34; dishonesty &#34; is used, as it is in this clause, no one can say it is a light matter. No one can say that if the commissioner or the permanent head is to decide that an officer has been guilty of dishonesty, it is such a light matter that the officer is not entitled to inquiry by a board. I object to the kind of tribunal suggested, and I shall vote against the clause in its present form. </para>

A man might have a verdict recorded against him under very innocent circumstances for a small amount, and yet it is suggested that this tribunal shall in all cases be called upon to investigate. As some of the offences under the clause would be of a very trivial character, I would suggest that there is no reason why we should use a steam hammer to crack a nut, which, after all, is what the honorable member&#39;s amendment proposes to do. I would suggest, as a way of getting over the difficulty, that the latter part of the new sub-clause should run in this way - </para>

                        <para>- I know that the power is there, but we have to direct attention to it. I want to provide, instead of having to employ a board of inquiry in all cases, a simpler method for dealing with trivial cases. I wish to give the commissioner the option of saying whether he will deal summarily with a case, or whether he will direct that it should be inquired into as is provided for in clause 40. We have to trust the commissioner, and where he deals summarily with a public, servant, it may merely mean disrating or the imposition of a fine. There is no need in such trivial cases to call a board of inquiry into existence, probably with a solicitor on either side, and to incur a great deal of expense. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. REID</inline>(East Sydney). - I am sure that we all appreciate the object which the honorable and learned &#39; member for Parkes has in view. It is a very good one. But I would point out that the more we create special procedure for matters of this sort, the more likely are we to cast upon the authorities under this Act a number of duties and inquiries which may go very far away from the real object of a Public Service Act. It strikes me that clause 40 includes as an offence &#34;disgraceful or improper conduct.&#34; No one wishes to enter into the private concerns of public servants, who are entitled to the ordinary privileges enjoyed by other British subjects, except in very gross cases. Many men, -through misfortune or through the extravagance of those for whom they are responsible, may find themselves in the very painful position of being unable to pay their&#39; debts. In such circumstances it may not be a reflection upon their morality or honesty. It is not until such matters rise to the importance of an offence within the meaning of &#34; improper conduct &#34; that &#39;the authorities of the public service should have anything to do with them. If a man in the management of his private affairs is guilty of what may be called &#34;improper conduct,&#34; then I quite admit that he may have to be brought before the authorities u under the Act. But the machinery is already created under which he can be so brought. May I also suggest that punishment is. not the best way of paying debts. We may punish a man, and yet leave his creditors in a worse position than they previously were. The real object of making use of such powers as are proposed to be given under this Bill is that the head of the department, having had an offence brought under his notice by a creditor, or creditors, of a public servant, should use his influence with that public servant to induce him to avoid the penalties that are likely to follow from his being found guilty of improper conduct. The object really is to induce him to make some arrangement with his creditors. I submit to my honorable friend who is in charge of the Bill that he has already provided, under clause 40, for &#34; disgraceful or improper conduct.&#34; I think that the honorable gentleman has fully provided for the only sort of case which we ought to provide for, namely, a gross case, and one which reflects on the moral character or honesty of a public officer. All the necessary machinery for dealing with such an offence has been provided. But I think that jurisdiction would rarely have to be exercised, because the object of the department woxild.be to secure a peaceful and satisfactory settlement. I quite appreciate the object of the honorable and learned member for Parkes ; but I think that it is already covered by the wording of the Bill. I think we may. be doing more harm than good if we go too far in the direction that has been suggested. </para>

On the other hand, the honorable and learned member for Parkes might well introduce this provision in clause 40, which, as has been pointed out, provides all the machinery necessary for dealing with such cases. Sub-clause (2) of clause 40 provides that &#34; any officer charged with the commission of an offence may in the case of minor offences against discipline be reprimanded or cautioned by the chief officer or by any officer prescribed as having power to suspend officers.&#34; Further on it is provided that in graver offences the chief officer, if he chooses, may direct an inquiry to be made. That is the right place for the honorable member to introduce the provision which he now proposes. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CROUCH</inline>(Corio). - When this matter came up under clause 40 - although it was pointed out that the amendment -which was then, proposed related, not to dismissals, but only to such powers of reprimanding or of fining an officer as it was thought would meet the offence committed - the committee decided that neglect on the part of a public officer to pay his debts- - which is a weaker form of offence than that suggested to-day - should not be included as an offence. Now, honorable&#39; members are told that we should have inserted this provision in clause 40. There has been such a body of opinion outside in regard to the proposal which the committee rejected the other day, that now a stiffer form of offence is proposed. I think that this provision should have been inserted in clause 40. I shall take every opportunity - if it cannot be introduced here - to secure its insertion in that clause upon its recommittal. We are dealing with a class of officers who are specially protected by law. They have their wages specially protected - because the King cannot be garnisheed - and we should certainly&#34; see that <inline font-style="italic">they</inline> pay their debts like other people. </para>

                        <para>- I hope after the discussion that has taken place the honorable member will allow the matter to stand over. I shall be quite prepared to reconsider and recommit clause 40 with a view to inserting words that will harmonize better with that clause than the one now being considered. I am not quite sure that clause 40 would not almost meet the case now, but a very few words by way of amendment&#39; would certainly serve the honorable member&#39;s purpose. </para>

I should like to know whether we are in a position to pass an Act which will compel an officer of a State court to make a report. </para>

                    <para>- Possibly the expression in the Bill is a little peremptory. I have no doubt as to our power in the matter, but at the same time it might be better if another expression were used. There is no doubt that the intention of this clause is one that will be readily fallen in with by the court. It gives them an additional opportunity &#177;o see that, justice is meted out. The language is taken from a local Act, but I will reconsider the point raised by the honorable member. </para>

                    <para>- This clause and the three following clauses deal with the question of leave of absence and holidays, and it will be seen that there are no less than five different ways in which leave - may be granted. The annual leave may he granted by the chief officer ; sick leave is to be granted by the chief officer, the permanent head and the Minister, and extended sick leave is to be granted by the Governor-General. Leave without pay requires the sanction of the permanent head and the Governor, and furlough requires the permission of the commissioner and the Governor-General. These five methods appear to be rather cumbrous, and I would suggest that the whole of the clauses should be taken into consideration or postponed with a view to some simpler method being devised for dealing with the whole matter. Let us take a case in point. An officer might obtain three weeks&#39; leave of absence, which might be granted by the chief officer as a matter of course. At the end of the three weeks he might find that he could not get back in time, and might want one day&#39;s extra leave. This would require the consent of the permanent head and the Governor-General. In the meantime something might happen, such as a sudden illness or a broken leg, and the granting of an additional day&#39;s leave would require the consent of the chief officer, the permanent head, and the Minister. I do not see how these cumbrous methods are to be obviated, but I hope the Ministry will take the whole matter into consideration with a view to making some improvement. Either the chief officer or the permanent head, particularly the latter, might be out of the State, and inaccessible for the purpose of giving the consent required under this clause. </para>

                    <para>- Is it intended that without an Executive minute the Minister may grant twelve months&#39; leave of absence ? If so, that is a new provision in Australia, I believe. The almost universal custom when leave is granted for so long a period is that it goes through the Executive Council. The clause says &#34;the Minister in cases of illness or other pressing necessity may grant such extended leave, not exceeding twelve months.&#34; That is quite out of harmony with the general scope of such Bills, which places such leave within the power of the Governor-General in Council. It will be more in harmony with the other clauses to make such a provision here. I do not, however, want to raise any difficulty by compelling the M inister to put an application for a small leave of absence before the Governor-General in Council. We might make the clause read &#34; not exceeding three months,&#34; instead of twelve months. That would leave the Minister an elastic power in regard to three months ; and so far as further leave was concerned the matter should go before the Executive Council. </para>

                    <para>- I think the point raised by the honorable member for Gippsland should be fairly considered. As we are now amending clause 59, it may be that there will be fifteen months leave of absence granted, and that ought to be clearly stated. Of course, the leave may be granted upon terms ; but in the other case the officer gets no pay, and he has also to lose his time. </para>

                    <para>- In sub-clause (3), it appears to me that power is taken to extend leave of absence as an equivalent for duties performed in extraordinary circumstances. In a number of the States this power has been very much abused, to the detriment of those employed in minor departments. As a result of the recent festivities, a large number of men who worked many hours overtime are being impelled to take days off - not days that would suit them, but days that suit their departments - as an equivalent for very hard and good work performed overtime. I think this power very much abused. I would ask the Minister what he means by this particular clause, and how he proposes it should be applied. I quite understand that in cases where officers are stationed in remote places it might be useful ; but I do not think it should be applied in the regular way as an equivalent for the payment of overtime. </para>

                        <para>- Supposing an officer takes twelve months&#39; leave for his private business, and at the same time during his absence conducts some inquiries for the Government, in reference possibly to important matters, it would be very hard in such a case to deduct the time from his service to the country. He might really be rendering very important service. The case might be met by adding to the sub-clause the words - </para>

                </continue>
                <para>Unless the Governor-General, on the recommendation of the commissioner, specially directs that such leave shall count as service. That would leave it open to the Governor-General in such a case as I mention not to cut the service off. Such cases often happen under State governments. I have known occasions, and they may happen again, where an officer gets leave on private business, and in the course of that time renders important public service. We should leave it in the power of the Government at any rate to leave his service unbroken in s-ch a case; but the clause, as it stands, leaves the Government no discretion, and he might have to lose a year&#39;s service. My suggestion is to meet only exceptional cases, but I think it is worth while to consider it. I will not press it if the Minister does not wish it. </para>

                        <para>- It is a very difficult thing to refuse them. I think the case referred to might be met in the way I have suggested. If an officer goes away and we wish him to do anything while he is on leave we can give him a gratuity for doing the special work. I do not feel strongly on the subject, but I think the difficulty could be met in the way I suggest. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with the Minister. I think exceptional cases might be dealt with very well by means of a gratuity. The injustice of making a general rule that time of absence shall count in the service, is evident when we recollect that other officers are standing by their governmental work and doing their duty. It sometimes happens that a man gets leave that he may have an opportunity of bettering his position outside, and if his place is being kept warm until he gets back, he surely cannot object to have other officers who have been serving all the time while he has been on leave progressing while he is standing still in the matter of service. I think the clause provides a fair and just solution of the difficulty. </para>

                    <para>- I point out that the clause does not contemplate a fixed period of leave of absence. It says &#34; not exceeding twelve months,&#34; and that is an expression with which the expressions &#34;of which six months may be on full pay, and six months may be on half-pay,&#34; will not fit. Why not say &#34;half&#34;? </para>

                    <para>- I do not think the suggestion of the right honorable and learned member will meet the case. An officer might take nine months&#39; leave and we might give him four and a half months on full pay and four and a half months on half-pay. We want to give him the right to get six months&#39; holiday if he so desires on full pay and to come back at the end of the time and go to work again on full pay from that moment. But if he wishes to take twelve months&#39; leave he can get either six months on half-pay or any portion of it on half-pay and return to his work on full pay. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to let the Senate deal with it. I think it is all right as it is. I do not think that where an officer had served twenty years and wanted leave for twelve months or six months, there would be the slightest objection, if he were a good man, to allow him off - in fact, I would look upon it as a claim ; but if he could not afford to stay away twelve months, he could take eight months&#39; leave, of which two would be on half-pay, and come back and resume his full salary. I hope the committee will let the matter rest. I have no doubt that the legal gentlemen in the Senate, if there is any legal disability, will amend the clause with the greatest facility. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest that it should be altered. It says that every officer may be granted on another occasion a holiday instead of the public holiday on which he was compelled to work. The words &#34; may be granted if practicable&#34; in sub-clause (5) may be interpreted in all sorts of ways by&#39; the permanent head. It practically means that, unless it suits the department, a man will not get a holiday, and very often it will not suit the department that lie shall. Surely the Commonwealth can arrange that an officer shall get these holidays in lieu of public holidays where the state of business compels him to work on those holidays. </para>

                    <para>- I took a note of the very point to which the last speaker has drawn attention. I think the provision in sub-clause (5) is very dangerous, and what he has pointed out is perfectly true. Weeks of leave are due to officers in this State which they will never be able to get. They have been compelled to work on special holidays and even on regular holidays, and they are not allowed extra pay, although it is in the nature of extra service, nor have they been granted substituted holidays. What an officer ought to get is extra pay for this service. It is like Sunday work. What ought to be done is to make the latter part of sub-clause (5) read in this way- </para>

                <para class="block">I am not wedded to the second proposition, but I am particularly desirous of seeing the first carried. The only satisfactory way to deal with officers is to pay extra money when extra service is required. If that be not done, it may be the means of getting a great deal of work out of the officers without pay, and what has happened in the State of Victoria may happen in the Commonwealth, viz., that weeks of leave may be owing to civil servants who cannot get it. I do not move an amendment, because some other better suggestion may be made. </para>

                    <para>- .! presume this clause would apply to post-office officials, who form one of the largest departments taken over by the Commonwealth. In Victoria certain holidays are proclaimed, and sometimes the Minister or head of the department may require a number of the staff to remain at work. The practice in Victoria has been to despatch mails on some of these holidays, and the people of Melbourne not only get delivery ,of their letters, but also of the daily newspapers. The moil, however, is sent up county, where it arrives after 10 o&#39;clock. A certain number of the staff are required at the post-office up till 10 o&#39;clock in the morning, and a certain number have also to attend on the arrivals of the mails at the post-office. The mails sorted at the local office are despatched to the different outlying districts. The. people who live in the small towns and villages in those outlying dis- tricts generally get their mails delivered from small post-offices, which are very often contract post-offices. The people in the larger towns have their mails sorted at the centres, and as soon as the bags are despatched the post-offices are locked up again, and the people get neither their letters nor their daily papers, if the latter come through the post. The holiday to the employes of the post-office is of no use, seeing that a great number of them have to be at the office up to 10 o&#39;clock in the morning, and others have to attend after 6 p.m. in the evening. It is only a kind of hybrid holiday they get. They cannot leave town, and they would be much better situated if they had a certain amount of holiday added to their annual leave. I am sure the people in country districts would appreciate anything which enabled them to get their letters every day if they attended at the post-office. In the case of Good Friday, there are practically four days running when people in the country districts do not get their newspapers until they are a day old, or do not get their letters unless they are called for before 10 o&#39;clock in the morning. </para>

                    <para>- The employment of public servants during public holidays without extra pay is a very important question. The system allows holidays to accumulate, or gives the public servants leave at a time when leave is by no means convenient. It is an evil which has wept into the State service of Victoria, and I should be sorry to see it creep into the service of the Commonwealth. Surely if men do public service on public holidays they ought to be paid for it. </para>

The object of the clause? so far as I can see, is that officers in remote districts, who have to be in attendance and cannot get the proclaimed holidays, may receive some consideration, and have the time worked added to their ordinary holidays. This, I understand, is provided for in clause 59, but I should like to know that this is perfectly clear. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to do justice to the public servants, and also to the public when occasion requires. The clause provides seven statutory holidays, and then sub-clause (4) goes on to say that the Governor-General may also, by proclamation, at any time appoint in addition to these holidays any specified day or part of a day as a public holiday. Is it not desirable that the number of these public holidays, in any one year, should be limited? Numbers of people in Melbourne and other .places with which I am acquainted - Western Australia among the number - are complaining of the unnecessary number of public holidays and the closing of banks and public institutions. In Western Australia these numerous holidays lead to a considerable difficulty in the delivery of letters. People who reside in remote parts of that State, may travel 20 or 30 miles to a post-office only to find that they have to wait three or four days before it is possible to obtain a letter or get a telegram through. I admit that we ought to give public servants every possible latitude, but still the public deserve some little consideration, especially in remote parts of the States, where it may be a matter of life and death, or it may mean the loss of thousands of pounds to a man, to get a telegram through. We should provide that within certain hours on public holidays the post and telegraph offices ought to be open. It would be no hardship to keep one officer on duty, because lie could be provided with a holiday at some other time, or be paid double rate for his attendance on those clays. I suggest that no more than a certain number of days in any one year should be proclaimed public holidays. It is possible, to have too much of a good thing. In the interests of the public the Minister ought to add to the sub-clause some restriction to the number of holidays to be observed in any one year. </para>

                        <para>- The object of the sub-clause, I take it, is to deal with special cases. I presume that in the other States the same system obtains as prevails in New South Wales. I recognise that applications come in very frequently for holidays, but not for holidays throughout the whole of a State ; and these holidays and half-holidays would not apply to the whole of a State. They would be given in special cases, such as the holding of a show, or of a race meeting, and would not apply to the whole of the Commonwealth. We must have an elastic provision of this kind, otherwise we could not proclaim holidays or half-holidays in the different localities where it is desirable that we should proclaim them. Honorable members, I think, must leave this power to the discretion of the Ministry for the time being. If too many holidays are granted, there will be an outcry, and Parliament has its remedy against the Government. As regards the question of keeping open the telegraph-office, I think there is a great deal in the remarks of the honorable member for Coolgardie, but sub-clause (5) provides that &#34; the Minister of a department, or the permanent head or chief officer thereof, may require such department or any part thereof to be kept open in the public interest for the whole or any portion of .a holiday.&#34; That provision will meet the honorable member&#39;s objection. In all cases I think that the telegraph-office should be open for a certain number of hours each morning or evening, for the despatch of telegrams. That is a matter, however, that is entirely within the discretion of the Minister. With regard to the post-office, the Postmaster-General would have power to order that it should be kept open. When the department is so kept open, the officer who attends there for an hour in the morning, and an hour in the evening will be paid for that time under the provision that is suggested. I think honorable members can allow this clause to remain in its present form. Subclause (4) is taken from the Victorian Act, and sub-clause (5) from the Queensland Act. </para>

                    <para>- There is, I fear, a slight ambiguity in this clause. Provision is here made that &#34;notwithstanding that an officer has attained the age of 65 years, if the commissioner from pimento time certifies that in the interests of the public service it is desirable that such officer shall continue in the performance of the duties of his .office, or of any office in the public service, to which he may be appointed,&#34; the Governor-General may direct such officer to continue in the service. The expression &#34;continue&#34; seems to fit in with &#34;the duties of his office,&#34; but does not fit in with &#34; any office of the public service to which he may be appointed.&#34; </para>

I am aware that the Acts Interpretation Bill does make a general provision, but if it is the intention of the Government that the term for which an officer who has attained the age of 65 years may be continued in the service may be repeated, I should advise them to retain the words &#34;from time to time; &#34; as it is possible that they may find that those words govern the whole clause. </para>

I thought of adding some words providing for the notification of any vacancies that may occur, so that officers may have an opportunity of applying for such vacancies. But apparently it is the intention of the Government to make promotions first, and to notify such promotions afterwards. I think it is desirable that vacancies should be advertised, so that those in the service who think that they are eligible, may apply for them. But I do not see any such provision within the four corners of this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that it is as the honorable member for Bourke anticipates. This clause simply provides for notice being given if an office is vacated. It was represented to me to be an omission, because it was provided that all promotions, transfers, retirements, and removals of officers were to be notified. A vacancy in an office, however, was not included, and I was advised that it should be so included. I understand the honorable member desires that if an office becomes vacant, or a new office is to be created, notice should be given of it, so that applications may be made. I do not think that this would have that effect. </para>

The trouble is that that portion of the clause maybe read as being &#34;conclusive&#34; in point of law and in point of fact with regard to the appointment, promotion, or transfer of an officer. What I want to guard against is that the mere production of the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice shall not conclude the matter. I have no objection to its being conclusive that a certain thing was purported to be done, or that, in fact, it was done, leaving the legality of it an open question. </para>

Supposing that an appointment has been made- properly, but that a promotion has been made improperly, is it possible that this provision might prevent an officer from being paid even the salary to which he was entitled before being promoted ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but if this provision means only what section 83 of the Constitution Act provides for it appears to me unnecessary, and if a court should say that Parliament must have meant something more by-putting in such a provision, it would be a doubtful question how far it might come into conflict with the other portions of the Bill. I would like the Attorney-General to consider the matter. </para>

                        <para>- That is no answer to my objection, because at present no express permission is required from the State Ministers in some of the States, at any rate, and the arrangement works very well. In South Australia we go so far as to allow public servants to be members of district councils. The system works very well in the public interest. Both as members of their local governing bodies and also in the discharge of their duties as public servants the officers are able to do good work. The only question is whether acceptance of outside duties interferes with the discharge of the ordinary duties for which public servants are paid. If so, the outside duties should not be accepted, but if not, there seems to be no reason why they should not be. </para>

                    <para>- I will draw the Minister&#39;s attention to another point. The desire of the Government is probably to study frugality and save the money of the public service. In paragraph (b) it is provided that a public servant shall not hold any office in connexion with mining or any such business, and paragraph (c) says that the public servant shall not engage in any such business whether as principal or agent ; but subclause (2) authorizes public servants to engage in business in connexion with &#34; any incorporated company.&#34; There is a favorite method of losing money in mining communities, namely, by taking an interest in an unregistered mining venture. It seems to me that under this clause public servants would be forbidden to lose money in that way. I do not see any merit in losing money in a registered mining company any more than in an unregistered one. It is a common thing to put money into the development of a piece of land believed to contain minerals - to keep the prospector going for a little while. It is a very laudable object, though the keeping of the prospector going may not be the real desire of the citizen who puts in his money. Under this clause a public servant will be prevented from taking his share in a little unregistered company. Often such a concern is dignified by the name of syndicate, and the members of it pay in their own money. That is engaging in mining business, and public servants spend their money in this way, just as cheerfully as do private individuals. </para>

                    <para>- This clause raises a number of rather important questions. In private businesses, which, perhaps, are managed as strictly perhaps as the Government service, no sort of obstacle is thrown in the way of employe&#39;s putting their leisure time to some useful purpose. I have no sympathy with paid employes taking paid positions in connexion with outside bodies ; some room should be left for other people in connexion with outside work. But I see no sort of objection to a public servant being encouraged to make use of his private time by connecting himself with useful bodies. I do not wish to speak with any authority on the point, because I know there are arguments on the other side. My objection to this clause is largely to the number of words it uses for the purpose of providing that no public officer shall engage in outside business of any kind. It would be very much easier to express the meaning in a very few words. We might say simply - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Except with the express permission of the Governor-General, no officer shall undertake or continue in any employment other than that in connexion with the duties of his office or offices under the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>The numerous paragraphs of the clause are all intended to express that meaning. If the Government by inserting five paragraphs wish to leave officers free as to certain special occupations the committee ought to know it. But I do not think the Government has any such intention. If the intention really be that no public officer in the Commonwealth service shall continue in any other position whatever without the permission of the Governor-General, a very few words will express the object ; but if by defining these different paragraphs, the Government wish to leave open certain special work for public servants, we should be told so. It would save public officers much anxiety of mind if the clause were merely to provide what I have suggested. </para>

                        <para>- These provisions have not been found to work any hardship. That being the case, it is not wise to make a new departure at the present time. If any hardship has arisen, I should like to know of it, but seeing that the clause is almost word for word copied from the three Acts I have mentioned, I do not think it would be wise to alter it. </para>

The words suggested by the right honorable member would not cover all the ground. The leader of the Opposition suggests that it should be provided that a public servant shall not engage in &#34; any employment.&#34; That would not apply to a professional officer receiving fees for certain practice. </para>

                        <para>- When we say a man must not engage in any employment it may mean that he is not to be the person employed, but that he may be the agent of the person employed and get paid for the work. We ought not to alter what has worked fairly well in the laws of the States, unless we see that there is very good reason for knocking these- provisions out. As for sub-clause (b), I do not understand why the provision against engaging in outside work without permission is restricted to officers who - accept or continue or hold or discharge the duties of or be employed in a paid office in connexion with any banking, insurance, mining, mercantile, or other commercial business. </para>

                    <para>- The Attorney-General will perhaps bear in mind that in Victoria there are peculiar provisions as to companies. There are such things as proprietary companies which are to all intents and purposes partnerships under another name. It seems to me that under this provision an officer of the service could become a member of a proprietary company as it is called here - that is, an ordinary trading partnership under another name - and that the clause might be evaded in that way. </para>

I am quite agreeable that it should remain as it is, because I see the force of the argument that these provisions have been working in the different States in this form. Are we to understand that the principle is - and perhaps the Attorney-General will tell me what the real object of the clause is - that no public officer shall engage in any employment of any land except with the permission of the Governor-General ? </para>

The preliminary examination will be the best of methods, but I certainly fail to see any necessity for any limitation at all. Let the candidates come along, as many as choose to turn up, and only those who pass will be recognised. They will be registered in the order of merit, and it does not matter in the least whether there are 20, 50, or 100. I. think it will be better to throw it quite open, so that there shall be no possibility of any influence being brought to bear at the very inception of a boy&#39;s career. The lot system is utterly absurd, and that is being struck out; but no matter what method we adopt, there will be a suspicion of favoritism about it, and as this Bill is specially intended to prevent anything like favoritism, we should throw open entrance to the service to any boys who think they can pass the examination. </para>

                    <para>- I may say I rather sympathize with the view the honorable member has expressed. I quite seethe inconvenience from an official point of* view. We can see that clearly, but it is cured to some, extent by the imposition of fees. If the fees. are properly fixed there will be no expense to the public, although I admit there will be some inconvenience. I suppose, however, that the commissioners on the question of fees will be prepared to undergo any amount of inconvenience in that direction. I strongly object to the principle of limiting the opportunities of merit. The persons left on the wrong side of the fence may be absolutely the persons who would adorn the public service. This amendment, proposing to insert the words &#34;otherwise than by lot,&#34; seems to me a very ingenious way of escaping the difficulties of the argument, because we are left to imagine what heaven-born system will be devised to meet all the emergencies of the occasion. In point of fact, I am sure that my honorable friend, the Minister in charge of the Bill, will find some difficulty in mentioning to us what other plan he proposes to adopt,, and what he means by the expression &#34;otherwise than by lot.&#34; I would like to hear from the Minister what heaven-bom system will be adopted to select promising youths from all who seek admission to the service, from those who had better be thrown 011 one side as unworthy of- notice. I do not propose to speak at any length, but I am absolutely with the honorable member at present. I think we cannot deny the abstract right of any youth to compete in these examinations. No honorable member can get up and say that any youth in this State ought to be debarred from the opportunity of competing for the offices of the Commonwealth, arid yet by a vote we shall say so. We shall not get up and say so in so many words, but if we pass this clause we shall say so in a very practical way. We ought not to limit the opportunities of the youth of Australia, especially when they are subject to a fee to cover any trouble or expense which may be incurred. Unless the Minister can point out some method which seems to commend itself to our judgment, do not let us legislate in the dark in this way. We must,, to a certain extent, legislate in the dark as to details ; but do honorable members think it a detail to determine whether any youth in this continent shall be debarred from the opportunity of going up for the Commonwealth examinations? It is a matter of principle, and the spirit of our Constitution is entirely in the way of throwing open equal opportunities to aH. How pan we carry out that policy if, first of all, we limit the number ; and, secondly, accept this proposal of the Government which is not so good as the other one. The proposal of the Bill&#39; was a definite one ; we knew what the Government meant. But now we are asked1 to pass something when the Government themselves do not know what it means, and they will tell honorable members so if they are asked. We are not legislating when we get into this position. If the Government have a reason for this limitation, they ought to let us know what it is for. The subject is important enough. Surely the Attorney-General or the Minister for Home Affairs will let the committee know what proposal they intend to adopt if the lot system is to be abolished, and another manner adopted. Have they any other manner in view <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It seems to me that we are getting into a very unsatisfactory way of legislating: Although &#39; at first, no doubt, there will be a very large number of candidates, the great difficulty will be at first. It will, I admit, be a serious difficulty to grapple with at first, but it will diminish as time goes on, because those who have paid, and whose names and records are on the official books, need not be allowed to compete again. That will be a much fairer thing than  shutting out any man. We might, under that system, shut out a <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, or a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> and allow in a man like myself - and that would never do. I strongly agree -with the honorable member for South Australia, who, I believe, intends to test the feeling of the committee. Unfortunately, I have not had an opportunity of reading the discussion on this question, and I shall content myself with saying that it does not seem to me that we can accept this alteration, or, indeed the original proposal. At any rate, the Government should tell us what proposal they have in view when they propose to amend the Bill. I think it is a practical suggestion which the Minister might adopt. </para>

                    <para>- The only valid reason which can be given for limiting the number will be the existence of a roll of applicants who have passed the examination. That system of keeping a roll from year to year is a bad one. I. am a believer in frequent examinations being held for all vacancies occurring in the State&#39;s service, in order that we may get what this Bill tells us we shall get - a proper recognition of merit. We cannot get a recognition of merit if we have the old system of automatic preferment, because that is virtually what it will mean. Suppose we have 50 vacancies, and we allow 150 to compete at the examination ; and we register them in order of merit, reserving to ourselves the right to fill up any vacancies with the fifty-first and fifty-second, and so on as they stand on the register, and so on ; then we shall be debarring probably a large number of persons outside - those who were not competent by reason of age and other disabilities to compete with the others at the original examination - from having an opportunity when really their turn has come. If the Government intend, as I believe they do, to have frequent examinations, then the necessity for a limitation altogether disappears. I would like to see tine limitation eliminated. I shall vote for the amendment. </para>

Under these circumstances,&#39; I think perhaps it would be better to leave this out for the present, and if we find it is a very difficult task at any time, we can make some provision, I have no doubt, which on the basis of experience the House will accept. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HIGGINS</inline>(Northern Melbourne).I would direct attention to the fact that sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">(c)</inline> provides that the Governor-General may make regulations for facilitating the employment of women in departments, and to prescribe rates of salaries or wages for those employed other than in the clerical division. Do the Government propose by this sub-clause to give the Governor-General in Council more power over the salaries and wages of women than he has over the salaries and wages of men ? Is it proposed under this sub-clause to specially give flexibility to the rate of wages to be paid to women for the work which they perform ? In this connexion I may ask whether it. is the intention of the Government, by means of the amendment which they carried the other day in regard to the clerical division,to say that women come under the minimum then established of &#163;110. It is already provided that every officer who reaches the age of 21 years shall receive not less than &#163;110. There are two questions which I should like to ask the Minister. The first is whether he intends under this subclause to take special power for the Governor-General in Council to vary the wages given to women. </para>

                        <para>- Will the honorable member permit me ? It is not intended where women are in the general division that they should come under sub-clause (a). In reply to the second question put by the honorable member,&#34; I may say that it is intended that women employed shall come under the &#163;110 limit. I had some doubt about the matter, but I took advice upon it this morning and I am informed that women undoubtedly come under the minimum. And it is intended that they should. </para>

                        <para>- It is the Only point that I can see. If we strike out the word &#34;facilitating,&#34; it seems to the that there is no obvious reason .for retaining this subclause. It is a very grave matter of policy if it is intended that the Ministry of the day shall give preference to the employment of women. When the word &#34;facilitating&#34; is read in conjunction with the subsequent words &#34;to prescribe rates of salaries or wages,&#34; and when we remember that we already have power under sub-clause (&#171;) for determining those salaries generally, it looks as if the intention is to employ women wherever the Government have an opportunity for so doing, and to give them lower salaries or wages. That is a policy which the committee have determined shall not be adopted. I ask the Minister for Home Affairs to consider whether he will allow that sub-clause to remain in the Bill at all. We have given power to the authorities to employ men or women as necessity may dictate, and why should we put a special provision in the Bill directed to &#34; facilitating &#34; the employment of women <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I recognise that the Minister would not like sub-clause (c) to be struck out, and afterwards to find that he had some reason which did not occur to him at the moment for reinserting it. But I ask him to consider whether it is really necessary in the interests of the general community to retain a sub-clause which. points to a preference being given to the employment of women at lower rates of pay ? </para>

                        <para>- I am very pleased to hear it acknowledged that. &#163;110 is to be the minimum salary paid to public servants who have reached the age of 21 years. There is a lot more to be said, however, upon the question as to whether there ought to be any difference made between the position of males and females. What reason is there to provide that the maximum class to which a female can rise should be the fourth class ? If the amendment, which I anticipate I shall be able to carry, is agreed to, there will be no necessity for the particular reference in the last part of this sub-clause to the clerical division. </para>

                        <para>- If not, I would suggest that the words &#34; made by the Governor-General and &#34; are not necessary. In connexion with the publication of the regulations in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette,</inline> it should be provided that they should have effect from the date of first publication, unless otherwise prescribed. I do not know, however, tha.t we should say that they should have &#34;full force and effect,&#34; because that might be construed to have a wider meaning than we intend. Then I suppose that the Minister will modify the provision in the clause that such regulations shall be laid before Parliament &#34; as soon as may be&#34; so as to bring the provision in this clause into accord with what we have done in other parts of the Bill. Further, it may be well to see that the production, of a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> containing a copy of the regulations shall be sufficient evidence of the regulations having been made by the Governor-General. The clause is so drawn that, once a regulation is published, it will have the same effect as if it were a part of the Act itself. I move - </para>

The Attorney-General will recollect that previous provisions have been altered so as to make it certain that the Governor-General in Council shall not have legislative powers outside the carrying of the measure into effect. I do not know whether the Attorney-General intended to alter the very emphatic words at the end of the clause. The last paragraph should read - &#34;regulations made pursuant to this Act.&#34; We do not want to create a second legislative body in connexion with the regulations. As the clause stands it does create such a body. We may assume that any civil servant who complained of any regulation being <inline font-style="italic">ultra</inline><inline font-style="italic">vires</inline> of the Act would not go to the Privy Council, and it is not to be supposed that the Governor-General would do so.

                        <para>- They are not, but the latter part of the clause is. The point raised by the honorable and learned member for Indi is that the words &#34;shall have full force and effect &#34; are objectionable, and he proposes to add words which will mean that the regulations are only to have full force and effect if they are not in opposition to the Act itself. That would alter the words as they stand in the New South Wales Act, because there the regulations have full force and effect at once. If the honorable and learned member for Indi is right in his reference to some decision of the Privy Council, trouble would follow if the words referred to were retained, because it might be held that some of the regulations published were not in accordance with the Act, or some portion of it. This, however, is rather a matter for the members of the legal fraternity to deal with. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. REID</inline>(East Sydney). - I cannot allow the violent attack which has just been made by the Minister for Home Affairs to pass without a mild observation. There is all the difference in the world between the provisions of the New South Wales Act and this Bill, which seems to be the result of a number of intellects clashing together. The expression used in the clause is &#34; regulations purporting to be made.&#34; The object of that clearly was to prevent the courts from inquiring into the question of whether these regulations were made pursuant to this Act or not. Leaving out the words. &#34; purporting to be,&#34; the clause would read &#34; regulations made, pursuant to this Act.&#34; Then the question of whether they were made pursuant to the provisions of the Act or not would be a question of law, and would be decided by the proper tribunal. In order to make the matter more definite, Ministers have added towards the end of the clause the words &#34; and be deemed to be within the powers of this Act.&#34; In other words, these regulations might be absolutely contrary to the vital principles of the legislation, and yet no court could inquire into them. That is absolutely contrary to any principle of legislation which has been adopted in any of the State Parliaments, and I do not think we are likely to allow it an the Commonwealth Legislature. I regret that my honorable friend should have made so many references to New South Wales in this connexion, because, as he knows, New South Wales has set a very admirable example in matters of this kind. I found when my honorable friend came into power that it was hard to keep him in the traces. A large number of objectionable appointments were made. I do not want to go into that matter, however, unless the honorable member desires to challenge me. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DEAKIN</inline>(Ballarat- Attorney-General). - There is something more to be said for these provisions, strong as they may appear to be, than the right honorable and learned member has indicated. In the first place, this is not a power in regard to which Parliament need feel any alarm. These regulations are to be made by the Executive, and may be unmade by them. The Executive owes its life and holds its power subject entirely to Parliament. Honorable members have spoken of regulations made under this power over-riding an Act of Parliament, but that is a contingency not easily to be contemplated. At all events, if it were possible, it could only be done with the tacit consent, if not with the express consent, of the House. </para>

I do not recognise the slightest difference between the two Acts as regards the position of Parliament. The Executive is subject to Parliament ; the regulations can be challenged in Parliament, and this power can therefore be conferred without any apprehension. </para>

This proposal is to meet people who have no other object except that of seizing a chance to interfere with administration. This may be considered domestic legislation. It relates to the public service, and is thus akin to the domestic affairs covered by the Foreign Marriages Act. If honorable members do not desire to take this step however, we, having laid before them the excellent precedent in English legislation, will at least have the credit of having suggested the shortest and best manner of making regulations. </para>

                        <para>- When I moved my amendment in this clause I had in my mind just the railway service. Since then I have found that there are several other brandies of Government employes who would be excluded, and the object is to give every one of the Government employes who are &#39; not merely temporarily employed an opportunity of being eligible in case of a selection for the purpose of filling up any appointment that might have to be made. I am not, of course, wedded to my amendment if any other words can be suggested to effect the purpose in view. I had moved, when we postponed this clause, the insertion of the words &#34; or railways,&#34; and that certainly would have covered the objection I raised, but the honorable member for North Sydney referred to some other important branches of employes under the New South Wales Government who would be excluded even though the . words &#34; or railways &#34; were inserted. What we want to do is to cover the whole of the employes other than temporary employes, so that every one in the employ of any State may be eligible for the purpose of being selected, if suitable, for a position to be filled. If we do not do that we shall place them at a disadvantage, because they will not be eligible, while under one provision of this Bill a foreigner, and even one who is not naturalized, may be employed. We want to get over this difficulty. I know the Minister in charge of the Bill is anxious to help us, and if only some of the legal members will give us assistance in this important matter, if they will devote as much time to it as they have devoted to some smaller matters, I have no doubt that we shall be able to achieve our purpose. </para>

I do not see by what means, without a long schedule, we could bring in other departments connected with Government in an indirect way in the different States. I think the best way would be simply to put in a reference to railway employes, and leave the others to the discretion of the commissioner. </para>

                        <para>- If that is so what has been suggested will not cover the case. But speaking broadly they are in the service of the State, and that being so it seemed to me that the omission of the word &#34; public &#34; would cover the whole case. However, we want to get at the wages men, and to do that we ought to omit the word &#34; salaried.&#34; </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BRUCE</inline>SMITH (Parkes).- The Minister for Home Affairs says that he knows me of old, but I also know him of old, and I noticed that he &#39; was reading something and not attending to the amendment. While the honorable gentleman was dozing, it was proposed that instead of limiting this clause to salaried officers, men receiving wages in the Railway department should have an opportunity of being lifted into -these better positions. That proposal has been affirmed, so that the Minister is too late and will have to .recommit the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I can only tell honorable members that it is very doubtful whether it would be held ultimately that a man engaged from week to week was a temporary hand, not in a technical, but in a practical sense. I do nob wish to bring that about, and I am now moving only in order to carry out to the necessary logical. . conclusion the amendment the honorable member sought to make in this clause. If the honorable gentleman chooses to allow the words &#34; not being of a temporary or casual character &#34; to remain in the Bill, he will, in my opinion, run a great risk of not being able to get wages men in under this comprehensive measure. </para>

                    <para>- There &#39; is a great deal in the remarks made by the honorable and learned member for Parkes. The object of the clause is to enable people who have already passed an examination and established their qualifications, to pass into the public service of the Commonwealth without further examination. But we are legislating without any knowledge of what the Railways Commissioners do. There are boys, permanent hands, in the railway service at 5s. a week, who have passed no examination ; and by bringing in the Railway department, without any knowledge of what the commissioners consider permanent, or of the qualifications of the employes in the lower grades, we absolutely do away with the need for examination iri the public service at all. We have shown that there is an easier road, without examination, through the Railways Commissioners, and, in my opinion, the committee are proposing to do more than is intended. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. REID</inline>(East Sydney). - I am sorry that the Minister for Home Affairs should take the honorable and learned member for Parkes up in such terms, because the Opposition, throughout the whole passage of this Bill, have scrupulously allowed Government supporters to manipulate it from beginning to end, and have interfered as little, as possible. I have had an opportunity of looking at the Bill as altered, and I say that with the original type, the italics, the ruled lines and the black letters, it will take us some time to know where we are. The Bill resembles nothing so much as a zebra. Look at this page, with all its alterations - that is the sort of thing it has come to ! After the Minister has allowed the Bill to be manipulated on every page in so remarkable a manner that it is twice its original bulk, it is too bad that the honorable and learned member for Parkes should rise and address the Minister for Home Affairs in the way he has. I sympathize with the Minister, and I think the amendment a mistaken one. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad of that, and I have no doubt it is a wonderful Bill by this time. Speaking seriously, I think the Minister is right on this occasion, because in the railway service of New South Wales no man is taken to be a casual hand who is on the fixed establishment. We . do not wish to open this door to all the nondescripts and hangers-on of the public service of Australia. Under the circumstances, although I entirely differ from the Minister as to the suspiciousness of the situation, I still think the honorable gentleman is right, and even at the eleventh hour I will stand bv him on the last line. . . <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Sir WILLIAM</inline> LYNE. - I am much obliged to the right honorable and learned member for East Sydney for the nice little speech he has made. He talks about the Bill having been manipulated. If he had looked carefully through it, or if he had been here while it was being dealt with, he would have seen that it has been very little manipulated. I have attempted during the passage of the Bill to meet any reasonable suggestion by any member, of the committee. </para>

                        <para>- It is the light honorable and learned member who should look at the Bill. I have looked at it and he has not. The amendment of the honorable and learned member for Parkes would bring in every man who is employed during the wool season for a week, a fortnight, or three weeks, and place them side by side with men who are recognised as being permanently employed in the railway service. I do not object to the proposal as applied to permanent hands, though paid weekly or monthly. The Railways Commissioners know perfectly well who are to be considered, upon the general service, though they may be paid weekly. Such men have a right to be considered, and so far I accepted the amendment. But I am not going to accept an amendment which will allow every one to come in who may be casually employed by the Railways Commissioners for a week, a fortnight, or a month. I do not think that the latter is the intention of the committee, and I shall certainly fight against the proposal. </para>

                    <para>- I can only say I am very well satisfied with the alterations, made in the Bill, because they are alterations which I suggested in my second reading speech. I pointed out at that time that the Minister, in introducing the Bill to the House, had taken occasion to draw attention to the Public Service Act of New South Wales, and had told the House how badly that Act had worked, but that he had neglected to point out how successful was the Act under which the commissioners managed the railway service of that State. I then said I desired to see the Bill put into such a shape that the whole Commonwealth Public Service would come under a commissioner instead of being left in the hands and at the mercy of the Ministry, who might at some future day wish to use it for their own purposes. My amendment would not have been suggested, but for the fact that the committee had really affirmed the principle of giving power to the people who had the opportunity of choosing the officers who should occupy these positions, that not only men in salaried offices, but those receiving wages should be eligible for them. I want honorable members to notice that this clause does not provide . that these men shall have these positions, but simply that they shall be eligible for them, and that those who have the choice of officers for any particular position in a higher walk of the service shall be able to make a selection from them. &#39; The </para>
                </talk.start></continue><para class="block">Minister for Home Affairs seems to be very warm about a very little, because my proposal is merely that all men in the railway service who are in receipt of wages, whether they be temporary or permanent hands, shall be eligible for a position in the Commonwealth service without examination. If a man upon weekly wages is eligible, there surely cannot be any objection to a temporary hand being eligible. All that my proposal does is to give a wider choice. I do not wish to press the amendment, and if the committee are not favorable to it, I shall not divide upon it, but shall be contented to have it decided upon the voices. The effect of my amendment is to widen the choice but not to widen the claims of the men who are to be chosen. </para><para>Mi-. McCAY (Corinella).- The honorable and learned member for Parkes apparently forgets that in the railway service there are men working side by side, some of whom are on the permanent staff with accruing rights, whilst others are only employed temporarily or casually. The object of this clause, as I understand it, is to declare that persons in State employment who are permanent hands, and who might, but for this provision, have been prevented from coming into the Commonwealth employment shall be eligible for such employment. But why the casual hands of the railway service should be given a preference over other casual hands I cannot understand. It is to the Commonwealth&#39;s advantage very often to take over from a State men who are familiar with the duties which the Commonwealth want to have performed. </para>

                    <para>- May I draw attention to the fact that up to the present time the committee have not included in this clause the railway services of the States ? All that my amendment did was to give persons in the general division of the State services the right to come into the Commonwealth service in the same way as the salaried officers may come in. We have not yet adopted the proposal of the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> in regard to railway servants, and until that is done it is idle to talk about it. We have merely provided that persons in the general division of the State services shall have equal rights to those of the salaried division.- </para>

                <para class="block">Railway department to consider all new appointees as probationers for six months, after which, when their appointments are confirmed, they are considered as permanent hands irrespective of whether they are on wages or salary. In Queensland - and I believe in the other States - there are railway officers doing post and telegraph work. These include station-masters, as well as night officers who are on wages, but who are in charge of stations during the time that the station-master is off duty. I presume that in the Post and Telegraph department we shall not be able to provide a separate Commonwealth officer to take charge of each of these stations. We shall necessarily have to employ railway officers to discharge the duties which they are discharging at the present time. And inasmuch as they will have to discharge those duties, they will become members of the Commonwealth Public Service. It would lead to no end of confusion with the various Railway departments if we insisted upon these men coming up in the ordinary way for examination, lt would necessitate the shifting of a large number of men from place to place. There are both salaried men and wages men, who are considered permanent employes, not only in the Railway department, but in other departments of the State services. So far as I can see, the words which the honorable and learned member for Parkes wishes to have omitted from the clause are in proper order. A casual hand, as the term is generally understood, is a man who is taken on - as the Minister for Home Affairs very properly said - in the busy season when there is a rush of wool or stock to the railways, and when additional men are required to cope with the traffic. </para>

That clause provides that officers transferred from the service of a State to the service of the Commonwealth, shall preserve all their existing and accruing rights, and their service in the Commonwealth shall count as a continuation of any rights to a pension, which they may have had in the service of a State. Clause 29 refers only to salaried officers, but if the railway men are to be eligible for transfer they ought to be treated at least as liberally as the salaried officers. </para>

In most States where there are pensions, the officers have to pay a deduction from their salaries of so much per cent. A man who has been transferred from the New South Wales service - say since the 1st of January last to the service of the Commonwealth - who has been paying -i per cent, for fifteen years in order to get his pension in New South Wales, becomes entitled the very moment he is so transferred to receive all the advantages which he enjoyed in New South Wales, without the slightest provision being made to compel him to pay towards the benefits which he is to get. </para>

                    <para>. - I am afraid that honorable members are losing sight of the- real meaning and intended operation of this provision. The clauses of the Bill follow the lines laid down in the legislation of the States, and provide for the recruiting of our public service mainly from among the very young members of the community, who will enter by on examination, in which there will be no limitation of the number of candidates, and must then win their way upwards. The number drawn from the service of any State will be infinitesimal. Those who are now in the State services entered young, have grown older in the service, and have probably increased their earnings, and there will be perhaps half-a-dozen appointments in a year to be divided; amongst them. all. </para>

Whether these positions are thrown open to all the public servants of the States or to the whole world, if. the provisions of the Bill are carried out, almost all the vacancies in ou&#62;r public service will be filled by candidates who enter at the bottom, after passing the examination. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DEAKIN</inline>(Ballarat - Attorney-General). - Because it is absolutely necessary. A mon in the general division of the public service of a State will enter the general division of the public service of die Commonwealth ; and so with the clerical and professional divisions. It would not do to put a labourer, who was in the general division of the public service of a State, into the clerical division of the public service of the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. REID</inline>(East Sydney).- I do not think it is necessary to make this amendment. If the Governor - General - which means the Ministry - has good reasons for taking a man from a certain division of the public service of a State, and j&#62;utting him into another division of the public service of the Commonwealth, why should he not do so ? For instance, -a man who is in the clerical division of the railway service of a State, might be a splendid mechanical engineer, and might be required for the professional division of the Commonwealth service. Why should the Commonwealth Government be compelled to place him in the clerical division ? </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. REID</inline>(East Sydney).- After very careful analysis of the earlier parts of this clause, we decided to vary the phrase &#34;public service &#34; by adding certain other words, and yet it is now proposed to again build up the clause by means of a proviso on the old lines, leaving out the railway and other servants. We have amended the term &#34;public service&#34; by making it read &#34; public, railway, or other services,&#34; but the proviso speaks only of the public service, and this term, taken in conjunction with the different phrase at the beginning of the clause, will absolutely exclude any one in the railway or other services of the State from the benefits of the proviso.

I want to know why talented men in the railway or other services of the State, who are brought within the operation of the clause in the earlier part, should be excluded from the benefit of being possible appointees to the administrative division. Is that privilege to be reserved for the apostles of federation ; if so, I can understand it, as there are none of them in the railway service. </para>

                        <para>- This part of the Bill was postponed in consequence of an amendment moved by the honorable member for Bourke, for the purpose of instituting a system of State insurance. I promised the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. V.</inline> L. Solomon, to obtain what information I could from the best sources as to what was likely to be the outcome of the proposed course of action. I have applied to the various insurance companies for information, but from the replies I have obtained up to the present time it would appear that the managers require to consult their various boards of directors before they can furnish what I desire. I have, however, obtained from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton,</inline> the Victorian Government Statist, who has also consulted the officers of his department upon the matter, certain information which I will communicate to the committee. That information, as far as it goes, shows that it would not be judicious at the present time to adopt the amendment of the honorable member for Bourke. It was stated the other night that in New Zealand a system of State insurance has been instituted, but I find that New Zealand did not start her system of State insurance in the way it is proposed it should be started in the Commonwealth. A good many years ago New Zealand started a system of insurance which was general, and not for the public service. About eight years ago they extended it to the public service, but at the present time they only have 290 policies which have been taken out by members of the public service. </para>

At the age of 16 the gross premium the public servant would have to pay on an insurance of &#163;100 is &#163;1 17s. 2d. per annum. At the age of 20 he would have to pay &#163;2 2s. 10d., and at the age of 25 he would have to pay &#163;2 10s.1d. A public servant who started insuring at the age of 25 years would, by paying &#163;2 10s.1d. annually for 25 years, only be entitled to receive &#163;19 per annum as a life annuity. That seems to me to be ridiculous. </para>

An officer of the service would have to pay &#163;20 per annum for 35 years to get an annuity of &#163;152 per annum.

                        <para>- I was at first inclined to support the honorable member&#39;s proposal but, after conversation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton,</inline> I feel that if we are going to deal with this matter, we must do so in some broader way than would be possible in this particular Bill. In New Zealand, as I explained just now, they have an accumulated sum of money on general assurance of &#163;10,000,000. Of that large assurance, however, there are only 290 policies taken out by civil servants. That matter has, therefore, to be put on one side so far as the proposal now before us is concerned. In this particular case it would only apply to officers who are in certain positions and they would not number more than from 800 to i,500. Even if all came in we could not base any calculation upon accumulated funds. </para>

                <para>SirWILLIAM LYNE.- No. But if it were easier for the public service to do so, they would certainly assure with the Government. The report shows very clearly that they do not do so. I would suggest to the honorable member that he should allow the provision to go as it is. </para>
                <para class="block">I have had a conversation with my colleagues on this subject to-day, and I can assure the committee that we will take into consideration at an early date the question of State insurance in some such way as it has been introduced in New South Wales. I think the honorable member&#39;s proposal would break down, and we should possibly get in that state into which we have fallen in New South Wales, where public servants have paid for a great many years 4 pei- cent, of their salaries to the superannuation fund. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Penton</inline> informs me that it would take 8 per cent, to put the superannuation fund in a sound condition. Therefore we cannot consider this proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I particularly asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Penton</inline> for his opinion regarding the New South Wales superannuation fund. He gave me a report upon it written in 1885, and it is on that report that I say that, even if the New South Wales fund had not been loaded through the railway service and other retrenchments, or supposed retrenchments, 4 per cent, could not pay what it was intended should be paid under the Superannuation Act. It would take 8 per cent, of the salaries of the assured &#39; to keep the fund solvent. Under these circumstances, and in view of this report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton</inline> - who is, I think, the proper and the strongest man in the Victorian public service for me to go to in order to obtain information on this subject - I feel that I cannot agree at the present time to the honorable member&#39;s amendment. If he were to read this report right through he would see that it is not practicable to carry out his project with any success in the way he proposes, and that it might in the end do a very serious injury. What the honorable member intends and wishes is, I take it, that there should be a Government assurance to deal, not only with the public service, but with any and every class of general assurance.  His  present proposal, however, would either break down or it would break the officers down. They would have to pay &#163;20 per annum for 35 years in order to be entitled to an annuity of &#163;152 on reaching 60 years of age. I do not think that is a very large annuity, but &#163;20 a year is a very large sum to pay in order to secure it. </para>

                        <para>- He would have to increase it in proportion. He would have to pay up to &#163;40 or &#163;50 a year in some cases as his salary increased. I take it that this scheme should apply more- particularly to the lower paid men, because officers receiving higher salaries perhaps do not require to be husbanded to the same extent as the poorer men. It will be seen that the poorer paid servant cannot afford - unless we are going to give him a higher salary to enable him to do so - to pay &#163;20 a year for so many years in order to secure an annuity of &#163;152. </para>

                        <para>- For eight years so far as the insurance of civil servants is concerned. Many men will be taken over from the State services who are already provided for. We cannot expect them to go into this assurance. Only the boys will take advantage of it, and though perhaps it will no&#39;t be so small in eight years&#39; time as it is in New Zealand, because of the number of civil servants, it will be proportionately small. </para>

                        <para>- I had a Bill drafted in New South Wales, and asked my then colleague there, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr&#39;. Wise,</inline> to take charge of it dealing with this matter, as affecting New South Wales. First of all I think that the companies we allow our officers to be insured in should be inspected by a public actuary. I went even further than that, and proposed that every insurance, company in New South Wales - and I would be prepared to say now in the Australian colonies - should be subject to inspection and . report by a Government actuary. I hope, if my colleagues agree, within a very short time to bring in a Bill with that view. The Bill I drafted in New South Wales might be made to serve the purpose. </para>

                        <para>- I would deal with everything connected with the societies.. It might not be possible to value the securities every year, because they would extend so far over the continent of Australia, but it would be possible to value all the principal securities, and to get a sufficient idea of their value to allow the actuary to report as to whether he considered the companies solvent or not, within the first year from his appointment. I wish again to say that I have been discussing this matter with my colleagues to-day, and they are much inclined to bring in a measure to deal generally with assurance by the State. </para>

                        <para>- It appears to be rather a lengthy document, but until we have accurate information on the subject I do not think we should accept right off the statements of the statistician of Victoria. There are other men of equal if not greater qualifications prepared to submit a scheme which would, no doubt, come into line -with what we want, and would assist in a &#39;very large way in a proposal for State life assurance, being brought down in the sense in which we outlined it the other night. The chief objections the Minister raises against the proposition are, first of all, the very limited number of civil servants affected by the proposal, from 800 to l,-500 he asserts. There would, therefore, he thinks, be no chance of the fund earning anything like returns, such as would be the case in outside mutual provident societies, or even provident societies. The answer to that is rather difficult to find, but if a new company was starting in the State of Victoria they would not start with even 1,500 certain proposals. The method of procedure, I understand, would be that they would have to give a guarantee to the Government of &#163;5,000 in cash before they could start business at all, and they- would have no guarantee of any number of clients to begin with. They would have to adopt just such business methods as they could in order to secure policy holders. The difference between tha ordinary company, therefore, and a Commonwealth is, that we should start with 1,500 persons, all young persons, who would be called in assurance phraseology &#34;good lives,&#34; for they would have to pass a medical examination, and other tests, so that they would be acceptable to ordinary assurance offices. To that extent we would be ahead of any assurance society starting with fresh business in the . State of Victoria. The chief point I made the other evening, and I repeat it now, is that the servants desire not so much that they shall get more for the money they invest in the policy of assurance, as that they shall be satisfied that what they contract for shall, be forthcoming. We compel the servants to assure their lives, and that being so we have a right to guarantee to them that what they are assured for they shall receive. We make it compulsory that- these persons shall assure their lives, and the obligation upon us ought to be to see to it that what we have insisted upon on .their part shall be carried out just as faithfully on our part. That is what I am informed by a number whom I have consulted, and they have not been few in the last few days. They say they are not so particular about getting the same profits and returns as ordinary mutual companies outside could give them, as they are about the certainty of receiving what they contract to receive, under their terms of entry into the State service. So that these questions of earnings, averages, the small numbers at the beginning of a life assurance society - for that is what it amounts to - ought not really to affect the deliberations of the committee. If we desire, and that seems to be the desire, to institute a system of assurance for the servants of the Commonwealth, I think it is incumbent upon us to see that they are guaranteed what we say they ought to receive at the time their policies fall due. Apropos of this I desire to point out that the Government recognise that principle ; because in clause 49 of this Bill they state that where a servant cannot get his life assured in -any good company the Government will undertake to make provision for the payment to him of some gratuity, or something of that kind, when the time arrives for him to retire from the service. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the honorable member for that interjection. I had not quite seen the point. It is one which ought to be made. I say that the Government have already recognised the principle of assuring persons who cannot get assurance with outside societies. Further than that, what is the proposal of the Minister <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> In answer to a question by the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Malley,</inline> he said that the various societies of Australia ought to be inspected, their accounts, examined most carefully, and certified to by competent accountants provided <inline font-style="italic">hy</inline> the Commonwealth. Further than that it is proposed that there shall be a certain number of companies named in the schedule of this Bill, which shall be called &#34;prescribed companies.&#34; What does that- mean ? If it means anything at all it is intended to convey to the servants of the Commonwealth that the societies or companies which are named are practically guaranteed by the Government. If it does not mean that it means nothing, and there is no use in naming them. If it does mean that, we may just as well begin our own society, assure our own servants, and take our own &#34; risks. If we are to guarantee outside assurance societies we will be taking on a much larger contract than I think&#39; this Parliament would care to take on. For my part, I am not prepared to guarantee the policies of servants in outside assurance companies. I should want to know something more of their methods, of the valuation of their securities, and things of that kind, and upon what they base their calculations. I have heard it asserted, and I have no reason to doubt the truth of the assertion, that one of the large assurance societies in this city wrote down the value of its assets in one year by a quarter of a million owing to land speculations. What I propose is that nothing of that kind shall take place in connexion with the Commonwealth assurance system. The funds should be invested very much along the lines prescribed by the New Zealand State Life Assurance department, where they are limited to municipal securities, State debentures, and investments of that kind. It will be found, if they are invested in stock of that kind, it will mean a shade more than 3 per cent., which is said to be the basis on which the ordinary societies now conduct their business. </para>

                        <para>- Not exactly ; but the major portion of them do, and I think it should be so in this case. I believe it will be found that, so far from the civil servants finding fault with the limited amount of bonuses they are likely to receive under this System, they will be delighted with the security of the proposal, and will not quarrel with the less bonuses paid to them. Then as to the question of annuities, we have been informed that in order to receive an annuity of &#163;152 a, man will require to pay for 35 years &#163;20 a year. The sum of &#163;152 a year is very much less than the ordinary bonus which is being paid under the State Acts. Any number of men will be very glad indeed to get &#163;60, &#163;70, or &#163;80 a year, and they will not require to pay anything like &#163;20 a year to get that sum ; a very much less sum will suffice. The other point made by the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, by way of interjection, was that the salaries of these men will go on increasing under the schedule provided in the Bill, and the amount of &#163;20 a year to a man with a salary of &#163;300 or &#163;400 is practically nothing at all. It may be very much to a man who is receiving a salary of &#163;110 or &#163;120; but when a man is receiving a salary of &#163;180, &#163;200, or &#163;300, up to the larger amounts which are provided, a sum of &#163;20 is practically of very little moment indeed. He will probably assure for an amount at death which will -cover a premium of that amount and not hurt him at all. However, in discussing the question at this stage I feel, somewhat in a difficulty. We have not any actuarial calculations to go upon. We do not know for a certainty what it will take to give a man a given annuity at a certain age on the payment of a certain sum per year. We do not know either whether the Government has really made up its mind or not to institute a State </para>

As briefly as possible in the time at my disposal I have endeavoured to answer, at very short notice and with very scant information, the objections raised by the Minister. Other honorable members have probably noticed other points, and before I consent to a withdrawal of the proposal I think it is only fair to all who are interested in the question that some expression of opinion shall be heard from them, that is in default of a specified assurance from the Government that it will at a later stage introduce a Life Assurance department for the Commonwealth.

                    <para>- Some honorable member said the other evening that this measure was not one in which we should introduce provisions for a superannuation, fund. It seems to -me, however, that any civil service Bill whatever would be entirely imperfect without satisfactory provision for the superannuation of the public servants. It is our duty to see that the superannuation arrangement is arrived at in the most satisfactory way, and in the way likely to secure the greatest measure of advantage and security to the various servants of the Commonwealth. The principle that this forms a part of a public service enactment is found in the fact that we have two clauses in the Bill dealing with it - one providing that the civil servant shall compulsorily assure their lives in insurance offices, and the other, as some honorable member has pointed out, providing that those lives which are not likely to be assured outside shall be assured by the Government. I say the Government should take the whole matter of superannuation into their own hands. Let the work be done by the Commonwealth, and it would be well done if the Commonwealth subsidized and built up a superannuation fund which would give security to public servants. </para>

                        <para>- As &#39; the honorable and learned member says, it would eventually recoup itself, and the losses in the earlier years would be infinitesimal. As I suggested, by way of interjection, the payments would go on increasing at so much per cent, with the increases in the salaries of the civil servants. There would be very few losses in&#39; the earlier years, and a fund would be accumulated which, subsidized by the Government, would amply meet occasions when -expenditure would be demanded. I feel so strongly on this matter that, although I om very much against the extension of this insurance system to outside business - to the Government becoming an insurance office for those outside its own service - rather than lose the principle I would vote for a more extended system. But it is only because I feel that the Government ought to be the assurer of their own servants, that I would go that length. I hope, however, we will agree that it is sufficient to make the Commonwealth Government the assuring body, the body responsible for the building up of a superannuation fund which shall meet all the requirements of the future, and assure the comfortable retirement of its servants at the end of their working days. </para>

I would point out to the Minister for Home Affairs that he has an opportunity of seeing how men who are experts in finance and who have similar bodies of men under their control act in a matter of this kind. Take banking institutions - <inline font-style="italic">r</inline> for instance, the National Bank of Australasia, which is an institution with a large number of employes all over Australia. Does that bank force its servants into private assurance companies ? Not at all. The bank management has established a provident fund for its employes. </para>

Bankers are men who understand finance and are acquainted with figures. The Commonwealth stands in almost precisely the same position as a bank of this character, because the number of new servants the Commonwealth will have for many years to come will not exceed the number employed by some of the great banking institutions of Australia. The Minister tells us that we cannot afford to enter on this scheme ; but in clause 49 he recognises the principle of Commonwealth insurance, inasmuch, as he absolutely proposes to throw into the hands of private companies all the good and sound lives, while every public servant, whose state of health is not good enough to enable him to pass for private assurance, or who cannot pass without five years&#39; loading, is to be taken under the <inline font-style="italic">cegis</inline> of the Commonwealth and provided with a pension. The Minister takes the derelicts of the service and rejects the sound lives. </para>

                        <para>- Then let the Government take all the public servants, with all their savings. If the Minister can make it profitable to pay these derelicts, as I may call them, pensions out of the fund, surely he can make it more profitable to arrange for pensions to men of sound health. The Minister admits the solidity of the argument which has been advanced, that if civil servants be compelled to&#39; assure in a private company, they must be guaranteed the solvency of that company. That is unquestionably what will, happen if the Government compel civil servants to assure outside. How possibly can we,&#39; as I asked a few nights ago, ascertain the solvency of any of the assurance companies without making a periodical valuation of their assets. The Minister speaks of actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation is all very well so far as it goes, but it is no guide to a public servant or any body else who wants to assure in a company, and to be perfectly sure- that it is solvent and sound. The only way to arrive at a decision about that is to have a periodical valuation of the assets of insurance companies. </para>

                        <para>- I do not quite agree with the honorable member that the accounts of these private societies will have to be investigated,&#39; anyway. There is a good old maxim that the buyer should beware, and. you cannot always keep a fool from losing his money. If people who are under no compulsion to assure, except that compulsion exercised by the persuasiveness of the eloquent member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Malley,</inline> chose to assure in those societies let them see that their investment is a sound one. We have heard a &#39; good deal during this debate of the superior power of these societies to earn money over a Government institution. But let us see what they have earned during the past twelve months. The best society - the Australian Mutual Provident - earned 4-55 per cent., and going down the list of eleven others we find one - -the Colonial Mutual - whose earnings were as low as 3-90 per cent. Others earned less than 4 per cent. The average earnings of the whole twelve societies is 4 -4 7 percent. These figures are for the year 1900, and they represent a decrease on the earnings for 1899, which were 4-58 per cent., and for 1S98 when the earnings were 4&#39;53 per cent. Now I contend that if a State department of insurance or a superannuation fund did not have the necessary property and security to earn a large amount of money, the economical management would more than counterbalance that disadvantage, because in some of these societies - such as the Temperance and General - the expenditure in proportion to their total revenue represents 36&#39;88 per cent. Upon these grounds, I think that at this late hour of the night the Minister in charge of the Bill would do well to postpone the consideration of this clause in order that the committee may have additional information upon the subject. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BATCHELOR</inline>(South Australia).I would&#39; like to put it to the Minister that under this Bill we compel all our public servants to insure their lives with societies which are approved of by the Government. In the event of one of these societies not being able to meet its obligations&#39;, what will happen ? As a matter of fact we know quite well that the Minister would bring clown a proposal that we should pay over the amount involved to the public servants, whom we compelled to insure, in order that the engagements entered into should be fulfilled. We would not allow our public servants to suffer owing to the inability of one of these companies to meet its engagements. I am quite sure that the Minister for Home Affairs will admit that that is probably&#39; what would be done. Thus, whether we declare in the Bill or not that we guarantee these insurance companies, as a matter of fact they will be guaranteed by this compact, and seeing that we are going* to guarantee the solvency of those societies which are approved by the Government, and in which we compel our public servants to insure, we might just as well enter upon the whole business ourselves. If we are to take no profits, and to suffer all the losses, it would be a far wiser policy for us to require public servants to insure with the Government, and then we should know at the outset the extent of our liabilities. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is assuming that, of course. But we are dealing with annuities which are proposed to be paid 20, 30, or 40 years hence, and whilst any society may be perfectly sound to-day, we do not know what position it will be in half a century hence, so that the approval of to-day is no sort of guarantee as to its solvency at all. Seeing that the Government will have to shoulder all losses, they might just as well go in for the business themselves, even if there is some loss involved at first. It would be better for us to subsidize it straight out and thus put the business upon a sound footing. Let us begin this life insurance on a small scale with our own public servants, whom we compel to insure. I believe it will be to the interests of life insurance generally if that is done. It may possibly lead to a general policy of State life insurance. I think that the Minister, for Home Affairs is asking a great deal too much when he requests the honorable member for Bourke to forego this small proposal in favour of some general scheme, which may, or may not, be introduced by the Government. If the Minister had declared that it was part of the Government policy to introduce some general scheme, then he would have had some grounds .for expecting the honorable member to withdraw his amendment. But the Minister is not in a position to tell us that. We have here an opportunity of trying this experiment - though it is not really an experiment - so far as the Commonwealth officers are concerned, and <inline font-style="italic">J</inline> think that the committee would do well to carry this amendment to-night. </para>

                    <para>- After listening to the debate upon life insurance, I am more in favour of the Commonwealth taking that matter in hand than ever. My experience in the railway service of the Queensland Government in 1889 and 1890, leads me to say that we are going to get into exactly the same mess as the railway employes of that State got into when the Commissioner of Railways came out to assume charge of the railways. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathieson</inline> was going to manage the Queensland railways upon commercial lines. What he intended to do was to make all railway employes insure in different companies, which he thought were financially sound. He did not take into consideration the fact of whether the people to be insured thought that they were in that position. The Minister in charge of this Bill has said exactly the same thing. The Government are to guarantee the insurance of certain civil servants with those companies which the Commonwealth Government are to select. If the Government are . to guarantee the societies at all, why should not the Commonwealth itself become the guarantors&#39;! If we are to- give different companies the cream of the service for insurance and the Commonwealth is to take all the deadheads, there may be 50 or 60 per cent, of deadheads when they come to be medically examined. I know that that was the case in the railway service of Queensland. Because certain individuals failed to pass the medical examination there, what was the result ? These men who were competent to do the work in which they were engaged, who had been carrying it on for years before the Railways Commissioner assumed control, were discharged and turned out to do the best they could, whilst others whom the insurance companies would take were drafted into the ser- vice in their stead. The same thing may be repeated here. A man may have some trivial hereditary complaint which would cause an insurance company to decline to insure him. What would then happen ? The Government would not care to take the risk. It is all very well to tl row oneself upon the Government, but it will generally be found that Governments are as soulless when we come to the point as syndicates. </para>

The honorable member has thrown himself upon Governments and they have thrown him over at the last moment. I am quite satisfied that if we are going to start a scheme of life insurance at all, we cannot do better than tackle it now. The honorable member for Bourke made a point of the fact that when a new insurance company starts in Victoria all it has to do is to place &#163;5,000 in the hands of the Government as an evidence of its <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline> What is to hinder the Minister for Home Affairs from putting &#163;15,000 or &#163;20,000 as a nucleus to the fund which it is proposed to establish, and as it pays itself, from drawing it out and paying it back <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Nothing at all <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The sooner a start is made the better for all of us. The Minister said that it is eight years since the compulsory clauses in connexion with State life insurance were introduced in New Zealand. What has been the effect <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> There have been only 290 insurances effected. If the Commonwealth cannot stand that number of insurances during eight years, it is certainly very poor indeed. I hope the honorable &#34;member will not withdraw his amendment, which will have my warm support. </para>

                    <para>- The report which has been put before the committee to-night by the Minister for Home Affairs, has not been perused by honorable members, and I think the honorable gentleman fell into error when he said that the system of State life insurance .had been in existence in New Zealand for eight years at the time that report was prepared. He tells us that there were only 280 public servants in New Zealand who had insured up till the end of 1S99. But I would point out that, at that time, life insurance had only been in existence in the colony referred to, for six years. The Act was passed in 1893, and the Minister said that the figures which he gave were for 1S99. </para>

                        <para>- Clause 49 provides that where an- officer is unable to insure his life a deduction shall . be made at prescribed intervals from his salary, and such deductions shall be invested by the commissioner for the benefit of such officer. Life insurance companies, do not pay out more than they receive. To say that the Government cannot undertake this work is to urge that private companies which are a part of the community, can do better work than the whole community. The matter of State life insurance was not mentioned in the Governor-General&#39;s speech, and I think there is no hope of anything being done under a separate Bill in that direction, either during this session or the next. If we can start such a scheme as is suggested in connexion with this Bill it will be a step in the right direction. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HIGGINS</inline>(Northern Melbourne).- I should have a strong sympathy with the Minister in his desire to postpone the consideration of this matter, so that it might be dealt with in another Bill, if I felt there was any big monetary responsibility to be added to the Government. I should hesitate to saddle the Treasury and the country with what might possibly be a big burden, ever! though it might be- for a good purpose. But when one looks at the cost, it will be &#39; seen that for years it will be a very small matter indeed. The provisions for insurance will only apply to new appointees. Consequently, we are taking by implication the full burden of these new insurances, and we may as well take the benefit of them too. Surely it is clear to those who understand parliamentary life and operations that if we pass a law compelling public servants to insure in certain approved companies, and any one of these companies fail, the cry will be raised that Parliament, having forced these people to insure in that company, should go to their assistance. We are, therefore, practically guaranteeing the stability of these companies, and as the Government are taking upon themselves that liability, they might as well accept the money which will be payable in premiums. The proposal in the Bill is to make the Government an agent to obtain business for certain insurance companies. Will these companies give them 60 per cent, of the first premiums, or any other concession? </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I do not see why the Government should compel their employes to insure with certain companies and. practically stand behind these companies, and get nothing at all for doing so. I think it is time that we looked at this matter from a business stand-point. We are told that we must be commercial, and we are determined to be as brutally commercial as we can in this instance. Surely, if companies like the National Banking Company and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company compel their employes to insure in their own concerns, they must find it a good business policy. The Minister was under a mistake when he said that the New Zealand system was not compulsory. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that the New South Wales superannuation fund can be regarded as a criterion in this matter. That fund was started in 1S84, and, almost immediately afterwards, officers who had contributed practically nothing to it were retired and allowed to draw pensions from it. It was never placed upon a sound basis, and it was treated unfairly by the action of the Government of the day in getting rid of its liabilities by charging against the fund payments which should have been made from the consolidated revenue. With regard to the New Zealand Government insurance system we have this remarkable fact - that although its business is confined to New Zealand, while other Australasian insurance offices do business all over Australia, and some of them in New Zealand as well, it stands second on the list so far as the amount of business transacted is concerned, in regard to lowness of expenses, and, I believe, in regard to the general average of interest earned, the Australian Mutual Provident Society coming first. The Bill requires the public servants of the Commonwealth to insure with any of a number of societies, presumably Australasian, and the State must either practically guarantee the solvency of these companies, in which case it might as well take over the whole business itself, or the public servants must run the risk of losing all they put in through the breaking down of a company perhaps 20 years hence. No matter what system the Government adopt as to valuation, there is always that danger in commercially-managed concerns. As bearing that out, I might point to the fact that the twelve life societies doing business in Australia have a total liability of about &#163;30,000,000. Against these liabilities, they have about &#163;6,000,000 of liquid assets, that is, cash in hand, Government securities, municipal debentures, and other securities which could be easily realized, whilst the non - liquid securities amount to &#163;24,000,000, of which &#163;14,000,000 is invested on mortgage. Then we find that . between &#163;3,000,000 and &#163;4,000,000 is invested in freehold and leasehold properties, a very large proportion of this item being represented by foreclosed properties. The probability is that the majority of these are non-interest producing, otherwise they would not have been foreclosed upon, because, if they had been worth the money advanced, the chances are that the original owners would have retained them. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The point I wish to urge is that it is utterly impossible for an outsider or for the Government, without such a close investigation as would involve a considerable expenditure, to arrive at any sound conclusion as to the value of the assets stated in the books. We know that &#39;in many cases there has been such a writing-down of these items as to cause very grave doubt indeed as to whether the reports of the actuaries should have been acted on at all, for the reason that&#39; they have necessarily had to take the figures submitted to them by the directors of the various, societies, as to the value of the assets. They can easily arrive at the amount of the liabilities, but the worth of the assets is only ascertainable by an investigation such as the actuaries have no possible chance of engaging upon. So that it seems to me that we are asking our civil servants to engage with societies about the solvency of which they know nothing, and can know nothing. I have reason to believe, as a layman, that several of the societies doing business here are perfectly solvent, and, still speaking as a layman, I have my doubts about others - but I would not care to be put on my oath about that. </para>

                        <para>- I might be prepared to do that. In any case it is impossible to be perfectly certain as to the solvency of some of the societies, and whilst societies which are doing an immense amount of business may be able to carry on for many years and apparently with success, there is no less certainty about the aftermath to come. It may be that just at the very time when the youths now coming into the federal service will require to fall back on their policies, there will be a special risk of some of these societies collapsing, and of the Government after all having to pay the piper. In connexion with the New Zealand Life Insurance department, I should like to draw attention to the interest earned and the low expenses rate. The department is in open competition with the other life offices, and they have to incur all the expense of getting new business, which, in the present days of cut-throat competition between life insurance societies, is very heavy indeed. Still they show the good return that has been spoken of. I am convinced that we should adopt the amendment of the honorable member for </para>

                <para class="block">Bourke. Although for some time there would not be a great deal of business, we should be starting on the right track. Another point that requires emphasizing is that any society which would propose to cater for the public service under this Bill would require to project a totally new table. The societies could not go to work on any existing table and meet the requirements of this clause. That means for each of the societies projecting a new table altogether, and we have no guarantee as to the premiums they would exact. It is all very well to put before us <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fen</inline> ton&#39;s estimate of what the civil service would have to pay on the basis of 3 per cent, interest to secure a certain annuity ; but we do not know what the various companies would ask. &#34;We could easily ascertain! what the companies would require upon their ordinary insurance tables, but with regard to the new kind of insurance we can form 1 no estimate at all. In consequence of that we may find <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton&#39;s</inline> figures to be of little use, for the reason that the companies may be more expensive than the figures put forward by the Minister for Home Affairs warrant us in believing. Under all these circumstances, I hope the honorable member for Bourke will not withdraw his amendment, and that the committee will ask the Government to assume responsibility for the comparatively small number of new civil servants who are to be brought under this scheme. As pointed out by the honorable aud learned member for Northern Melbourne, most of these new members of the service will be young and healthy lads, who need not be expected to be a charge upon any fund for a considerable number of years, during which time there will be plenty of opportunity to prepare a scheme  which will give some reasonable security, and will also enable the State to insure the economical management of the business. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. RONALD</inline>(Southern Melbourne).There is one point that has not yet been made with regard to the alternative to the Commonwealth adopting some system of State assurance for its employes. That is, that the Government will necessarily have to put its <inline font-style="italic">imprimatur</inline> upon certain societies. That means that serious injury will be done to others. It will be far better for the Commonwealth Government  to do the business  itself. I hope the Government will see their way to accept the proposal. It is certainly a much larger thing than some people would be apt. to suppose, and I can&#39; well understand the Government feeling a disinclination to enter upon it.  But it will be the better policy in the long run. We can include our own marine and fire insurance as well. I trust the committee will affirm the principle, and that we shall have a definite promise from the Government that the matter will be dealt with in a proper way. With that the committee will probably be satisfied. </para>

                    <para>- I rather regret that this discussion has simply traversed one line, and that the question seems to have been limited to the matter of State life assurance. In my opinion no Public Service Bill is complete that does not provide for the superannuation of public servants. Even if the amendment of the honorable member for Bourke were lost, I should have to move a further amendment which would have the effect of favouring the introduction of a superannuation scheme. Personally, I should prefer to see the life assurance principle adopted by the Government at once with regard to the public service ; but failing that, I should certainly like the Government to introduce a superannuation scheme, which would place those who leave the service of the State after years of faithful work beyond penury. In cases of death I should like the Government to take steps which would provide for the widows and children of members of the public service. I have already alluded to the South Australian scheme, which, however, only provides for life assurance indirectly. It provides that after a member, or a subscriber, as he is called, has paid into the fund for a certain number of years, he shall be permitted to withdraw two-thirds of the whole premiums which he has paid during the time he has been a subscriber. In addition to that, it provides that if a subscriber should die within or - after five years&#39; membership, his family shall draw a certain allowance - his widow during the term of her life, and, if she should die, the children, until the youngest has reached the age of eighteen years. That is not a matter of theory, but has been in practice in South Australia for ten years, and has worked admirably. In the beginning it was necessary that the Government should guarantee the fund, but so successful has it been that not one shilling of guarantee has been called up. The fund has given such satisfaction that I understand that it is the intention of the South Australian Legislature to apply it to the whole public service. At present it is limited to the Education department. The payments for male members of the service amount to &#163;4, &#163;8, &#163;12, or &#163;16 per annum, whilst women pay &#163;3, &#163;6, &#163;9, and &#163;12 per annum. The scheme provides something more substantial than the Minister told us <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton</inline> was prepared to guarantee for the members of the federal Public Service. It provides that after five years&#39; membership the superannuation allowance of a member who pays for five years shall be &#163;52 per annum, and in case of death the widow will receive &#163;26 per annum. The superannuation allowance of a man who pays for ten years is &#163;65 6s. Sd., while the widow receives &#163;31 18s. 2d. After 20 years&#39; payments the superannuation allowance is &#163;92 per annum, and the allowance to the widow &#163;43 14s. 7d. After 38 years, which is the maximum, the amount of superannuation allowance paid is &#163;140 per annum, while the widow receives &#163;65 per annum. This is more than the Minister for Home Affairs told the committee would be provided in the scheme furnished to him by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton.</inline> I would submit to the committee that we know nothing as to the basis of this scheme, which is not worthy of consideration at this juncture. This is such an important matter that I sincerely hope the Government will allow progress to be reported so that it may lie further considered to-morrow. There is no more important principle contained in the Bill than that of providing for those who render faithful and loyal service to the State. I am totally against ths payment of pensions and always have been, but I am strongly in favour of men being afforded facilities for j&#62;utting by something for the time when they will have to retire from the service or for their widows and families in the case of their death. </para>

If the Government do propose to make that new departure, then there cannot be any possible objection to the proposal before the committee, because it is the most earnest way of showing that the committee are in harmony with the Government in this matter of public policy. If the Government have not made up their minds I can quite understand them wishing the matter to stand in the form in which it is in the Bill. It might have some weight with the committee if the Government were to let us know what their position is. I understand that it has been held out to honorable members who are in favour of the adoption of this line of enterprise by the Commonwealth that such a system will be introduced by the Government. I do not know whether that statement represents a decision the Cabinet has arrived at, or whether it is merely one of those playful little statements that are put forward by Ministers in committee in order to expedite the passage of measures. </para>

                    <para>. - The position of the Government, if necessary, may be very clearly defined. It is &#34; impossible for the Government - favorably inclined as they are to such a proposal as is contained in the amendment - to promise to carry it out at the present time without, every inquiry, because its effects upon the financial system of the Commonwealth can not yet be gauged. They are engaged in making inquiries. They look favorably upon the idea of carrying out this system of insurance in a general way, but it cannot be said for a moment that they enter into an engagement or a promise to do it now, for the simple reason that they wish honorable members to hold their hands, as the Government are holding theirs, until &#39; they know their ground better than they do at present. Such reports as we have been able to obtain indicate the necessity for caution. There are many things upon the desirability of which the Government may be at one with honorable members, but this may not be the time to do them. Further inquiry is necessary in this case as in others. I might add that it will not be advantageous nor will it help any such system as is desired, if an amendment of this kind is carried. If &#62; the proposal were implanted in this Bill without any other machinery to sustain it, and without due inquiry as to its effects upon the financial position of the Commonwealth, it might still be necessary for the Government to bring in further legislation on the subject rather than find themselves committed by the committee to something which could not be carried out without public danger. We ask the committee to sustain us in our attitude of caution. Notwithstanding that we look favorably upon the proposal, it would be premature now to lay down as a definite policy something which in the financial necessities of the Commonwealth might cripple it in making its proper returns to the States. </para>

                        <para>- I should have thought that Ministers would have arrived at the position of having sufficient knowledge now as to whether they consider such a system a sound one or not, because the details of the system can .be administered so as to save the Commonwealth from any of those losses to which the Prime Minister has referred. His statement simply comes to this, that Ministers are still seeking further light upon the subject. Their intimation, therefore, carries no value whatever. It is a sort of intimation that- any man can make who really knows nothing about the matter in hand. I feel that this question,, by experience &#34; in the Australasian colonies, has come to a point at which the Ministry might fairly be expected to make up their minds to this extent : Given a wise system, such as this Ministry is so competent to frame, and carrying out this system in : 11)101)el way, such as this Ministry is so fit to do, is it an advisable thing to do as a matter of public policy? The honorable member who moved the amendment assumed that we had arrived at such a stage of knowledge on this &#39;matter, that, subject to a wise system in detail, the principle could be decided upon now. I have not the slightest hesitation in thinking that the Government might fairly have accepted this amendment, because it is absolutely within their power to fix the details so that there shall, be no financial catastrophe. It would really be a confession of imbecility on the part of Ministers to say that given the principle it is impossible for the financial advisers of the Government to cany out that principle without exposing the Commonwealth to financial disaster. In my opinion the matter is left by Ministers in a very unsatisfactory state. At the same time I should be very sorry to see the committee act in any sudden manner in connexion with this proposal. It might perhaps prejudice the prospects of this proposition if honorable members were to endeavour to drive the Government in any way, they being most amenable, as far as I can see, to all the suggestions that have been made from all quarters. As these matters have been dealt with in such a friendly and accommodating spirit from the beginning to the end of our proceedings, we should endeavour as far as possible not to put the Government in any false position. Under these circumstances I am inclined, as long as the Government behave in this most reasonable manner, to support them. I must congratulate the Government, in reference to this Bill, upon the admirable spirit of subjection which they have shown to all suggestions coming from all quarters. </para>

                        <para>- &#34;Well, if the spirit of compliance was more marked when 1&#34; was away than it has been daring the present sitting - I should not like to say anything unkind - but it seems to me that every one has been at the helm during the present sitting besides the two Ministers at the table. If there was anything more mixed than that I am sorry I was not present, because this is a new method of conducting responsible Government. However, I think it would be ungracious to force the Government in this matter after the statement they have made, and perhaps the honorable member should not press his amendment at this particular stage, but should give the Government some time in order to complete their education on this subject when possibly some result may come of it. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ISAACS</inline>(Indi). - I am one of those who view most favorably such a proposal as that made by the honorable member for Bourke. I am desirous of seeing the State in some shape or form take up the duty imposed on it in this amendment. I find the Government extremely sympathetic to the proposal, but regarding themselves, as they are bound to do, not only as a committee of this House, but as trustees for the Commonwealth and its finances, they are taking up, in my opinion, a proper position when they say they are not going to commit the Commonwealth to this proposal without full and fair information. When we have before us the example of New South Wales and the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton,</inline> I think that if the Government are making an error at all they are making it on the right side, as they are not going to leap first and look afterwards. Whatever may be said by the leader of the Opposition, he comes to the same conclusion as the Government upon the question. He is in the same position, and to all intents and purposes he supports the view taken by the Government that they should not commit themselves to this until further information is available. I look upon it in this way - if it were my own affair, and I were as favorably disposed to it as I am disposed to such a scheme being adopted on behalf of the State, I should hesitate very much before I embarked on such an enterprise in the present state of knowledge upon the subject. I should want more investigation. We have the promise of the Government that, as soon as they can, they will bring forward proposals which will enable Parliament to discuss the matter in a large spirit. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;MALLEY</inline>(Tasmania).- I am pleased to hear such a splendid debate on the insurance question. . I am glad also to hear the Prime Minister declare that the Government have a great insurance scheme in the process of incubation. I do hope things will go on all right in time. I would ask my honorable friend, the member for Bourke, to amend his amendment so as to provide for a complete system of State insurance. Then I may be the Minister for Insurance. There is no doubt that there are a great many insurance experts in this House, and we can all get jobs as insurance actuaries, because we know all about it. I heard my honorable and learned friend, the member for Northern Melbourne, talk about 60 per cent. I have been doing business for many years, and it is very trying to hear a lawyer talking about percentages. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind. They may get &#163;1 per &#163;100. The man who gets 60 per cent, is an emperor of insurance. You can get a lawyer for a few pounds, and then you will get another lawyer, like our right honorable and learned friend across the way, or like the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who do not go for any small percentage. I remember that one time in Columbia, on the Brazos river, in Texas, there were four fat farmers and four hungry lawyers. They went along for two or three years, and there were then four fat lawyers and four hungry farmers. What I want to impress on my honorable friends is that lawyers should never talk about percentages. Mind you, I have the greatest sympathy for them. They are the friends of humanity, because when we are in trouble they get us out - and get our families in. Another point on which I would like to have a word is this : Whether we are to &#34;start an insurance company or not we must establish in the Commonwealth a department of insurance, and we must bring the insurance companies under absolute State control. We( must say to every man and woman in the Commonwealth, who invest their money with the societies for the benefit of their children, that they are protected. Honorable members will see how simple it is. All we have to do is to have a department such as they have in the State of Massachusetts. I would not think of suggesting to a British community something which they have not in existence somewhere else, because you do nothing that your fathers have not done before. I have the greatest respect for you as a progressive people, but you must have some custom or use for what you do. Yon do not experiment. What is the reason why Great Britain is behind in manufactures? It is not due to free-trade or protection : but it is simply because we do not get the latest machinery. We want new machinery in Australia to control insurance companies ; to bring them under State supervision, and compel them to deposit a percentage of their reserves in Commonwealth bonds, and let the Commonwealth hold those bonds if necessary as a guarantee for their servants. But are the civil servants of so much more account than other people - than the people who have to struggle, the pioneers of civilization ; the prospectors of this country, who go through all the hills and mountains seeking the wherewithal to keep the civil servants ? That is the rooster I want to pluck. Let us be sensible on this point. If honorable members carry this amendment, as the Prime Minister says, they cannot put it into execution ;. they have no data to go on. The fact is that they do not know where they are. I want to be absolutely fair, and I hope, if the honorable member ibr Bourke is going to press his amendment, he will go for a complete State department. Look at another point. What 1 said here the other night I repeat. Is it fair to these few civil servants that they should be paying into a Government assurance department where they will not get one cent barring the limited amount which their little premiums will be earning. </para>

                        <para>- I have heard a lot here to-night about the earnings of assurance companies. If the amount which big assurance offices have loaned on their policies is taken off, how much do they earn ? Take the very company which has been quoted - the Australian Mutual Provident Society. I do not mind giving them an advertisement, for I am a Christian. Deduct the amount which they have loaned on their policies at 5, 6, or 7 per cent, and strike an average - they earned 4a.11d. last year - and see how much they earn. Go to any of the offices and see what they earn, if honorable members think we are going to get an immense interest on Government bonds. We want to come down to hard Scotch facts, and one ounce of fact is worth 40,000,000 ideas or theories. If we are going into this business, let us go into it as a legitimate business, and put canvassers on the road and compete ; but do not let us go into it as a side-wheel steamer. This whole business reminds me of a Mississippi boat. She had a 40-horse power engine and a 90-horse power whistle and every time she started to whistle she had to stop going ; she took all her steam to whistle. </para>
