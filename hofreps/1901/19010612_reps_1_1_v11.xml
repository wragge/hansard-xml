For this reason I desire to make a personal explanation. You are perfectly aware, sir, that as a rule honorable members on being elected to the States Parliaments are called before a commission, whereupon they take the oath of allegiance. The customary proceeding is for the members to be called up. </para>

                            <para>- My reason for speaking is as follows : It was publicly announced in the newspapers that the Governor-General, on the. occasion of the opening of the Commonwealth Parliament, would swear in honorable members at a certain building at a certain time. I attended in common with other honorable members. Upon arriving at the building, in a certain chamber, a sheet of vellum with printed matter upon it was handed to me, and a pencil was given to me later on. No Bible, however, was given to me, nor did I see any Bible on the table for the use of honorable members. After a certain time had elapsed, members, including myself, were called into the presence of His Excellency the Governor-General. I attended, prepared to be sworn in. I. saw a number of honorable members sign their names on sheets of vellum before they attended. I did not do so. When I arrived with other honorable members in the room where we were to be sworn in, as I understood, I listened most attentively ; but I was never called up, as the usual custom is, and I was never asked to make and subscribe the oath of allegiance. A reference to the Commonwealth of Australia Act, section 42, will show that a member elected to this Parliament must make and subscribe the oath or affirmation of allegiance. </para>

                            - Perhaps the House will indulge me with -an opportunity 'of -saying a word upon this -subject, -as the action of those who conducted the proceedings at the opening of the Commonwealth Parliament seems to be misunderstood. The -sheets of vellum to which the honorable member referred were intended . to be collected afterwards, and- to 'form the . roll of the House. The vellum sheets had no connexion with the oath except that they -contained the member's "testimony that 'he had 'taken the oath, and were to be accepted as that testimony. It: was not necessary for the 'honorable member for Tasmania to be called -up. An honorable member can call . his Maker to witness' that he is loyal to his Sovereign, without being called to any . particular place.

If the honorable member for Tasmania,

                            assures this House that . he did not go through that form, and did not utter those words, and did not kiss the book, he is not properly 'here, and he is liable to be fined so' many pounds a . day for being here. On the other hand, if he did what was expected of . -him, and 'that which all other honorable members willingly did, then, on that condition only had he any power to make the statement he has just made. I take it, that if the honorable member is of opinion that he did not repeat the form of words, and did not kiss the book, then you, sir, -will in that case, and any other of the same complexion, very gladly swear the honorable member . now. In order that everything may be done decently, and in -order-and let the honorable member take my assurance that I say this with perfect courtesy-

                    <para>. - There is a saving in connexion with this salary which renders it unnecessary to ask for any money at present. The Clerk of the House of Representatives, or the gentleman acting as Clerk, is the gentleman who has been the .Clerk of the Parliaments in the Legislative Council of Victoria., and in that connexion he was receiving a salary of £1,200 a year. He is at present, 1 understand, on leave of absence from the Parliament of Victoria, which renders it unnecessary to give him a permanent appointment here at the present moment. He is acting as Clerk of the House of Representatives. His remuneration during his leave of absence, which extends to July 31, will be at the rate of his salary from the Victorian Government, and until July 31, therefore, there is no question of money for this House to consider, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline> makes no demand. </para>

                        <para>- Because he makes no demand ; and I think perhaps that the general consent of honorable members will be obtained to the course which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline> is taking, although he is taking it very, generously. After July 31, if he receives leave of absence without pay, he will be allotted the same salary as the Clerk of the Parliaments - namely, £900 a year. In about two years - having already served. 40 years some time this year, but being under 60 years of age - he will be ripe for retirement from the service of Victoria upon.-a pension. " If the intervening service can be arranged with the Government of Victoria, and he can obtain leave of absence, it is intended to retain <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline> with a view to his permanent  appointment on such an arrangement as can be made. After he has received his retiring allowance, he is content to have his emolument reduced by such an amount as will enable him to be in the same position by adding together his retiring allowance and any salary that may be allotted to him. take it that in this proposal lie is behaving in a very fair and honorable spirit towards this House. He might have done better ; but at the same time it is my duty to put the position before honorable members, and to ask the House to let the matter stand as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline> wishes. I think the House will consent to that, and will also say that the Commonwealth has made a very advantageous arrangement. </para>

                    (Kennedy).- I think that the salary set down for the Clerk Assistant - namely, £750 - is too much, as is also the amount, £600, which is provided for the Second Clerk Assistant. I must enter my protest against these large salaries being paid. I am not, however," going to move for any reduction. I was defeated last night in my endeavours, and I therefore content myself with entering my protest against these very high salaries being paid at the present time.

                    (Hunter- Minister for External Affairs). - I would like to point out to the honorable member that1 the salary of the Clerk Assistant in the Senate has been set down at £750, and it is scarcely to be expected that this House would allot its own corresponding officer a less salary. There is a considerable percentage more of work to be done in this House ; and whilst it has been thought consistent with the position of the Senate that its officers should be treated as they have been, the argument becomes all the stronger for treating our officers at least on the same grade. As for the Second Clerk Assistant, whose salary is set down at £600 per annum, I may say that the officer filling the position had been 14 years in the service of the Western Australian Government, and had for a large number of years performed the duties of Clerk in the Legislative Assembly there with very great skill and ability. The salary allotted to him for his services to this House is only £100 a year more than he received in Western Australia.

                    <para>- As one of the few who voted in favour of a reduction in the salaries of officers in the Senate, I wish to say at this stage that I did so because I considered that the rate of their remuneration ought to be differentiated, somewhat from the pay that is accorded to the officers in the House of Representatives. I wish to explain, in view of the possibility of divisions in connexion with these salaries, that I shall vote in favour of' their being continued at the figures indicated here. I believe the salaries provided constitute a fair medium between the policy of economy and of efficiency, and on that account I simply wish to make clear my position, voting as I did for reductions last night, that I am prepared to support the figures submitted in connexion with the House of Representatives' officials. </para>

                    H. GROOM (Darling Downs).I would like to ask the Prime Minister whether some arrangement cannot be made with regard to the printing of honorable members' speeches, so that proof copies may be supplied to them on the day after they have been delivered

                    there three times a week. Let us suppose that the House meets on Tuesday. On the Wednesday afternoon, when the House again meets, every honorable member is supplied with a proof copy of his speeches of the previous day for revision and for the correction of any mistakes. The revised proofs have to be supplied to the principal shorthand writer before ten o'clock that evening. On the same evening honorable members are supplied with a revised edition of
                    <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                    containing a complete report of Tuesday's proceedings. I think I am justified in saying that one honorable member has shown me a
                    <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline>
                    proof of his speech, and it has conveyed quite a different meaning from what the honorable member intended. In fact, the point which the speaker desired to make has been completely lost. Whether this .is owing to honorable members speaking in a low tone of voice I do not know. However, I think the practice I have indicated is a good one. We have found it exceedingly useful in Queensland, and I think honorable members would find it useful here. I ask the Prime Minister whether or not that could be done
                    <inline font-style="italic">1</inline>
                    It need not add very materially, to the expense. I would also like to say that' I see nothing in this estimate with regard to the printing of

                        <para>- I am quite sure that every care is taken. I know that I have sometimes convicted myself - when I read the- reports, which I am sure have- been- very often correct - of- having said something in the heat of debate which was almost the reverse of what I intended- to convey. I think that happens to- everybody. We- are all subject to. that failing. . With reference to. the request of- the honorable- member for Darling Downs;. I wish to say that the mechanical appliances at the service of the Government Printer do- not admit of that course being' taken- at the- present. This Government has caused to- be ordered' some extra machinery for the purpose of meeting the demands1 upon the- Government Printer for Commonwealth printing; such- as- the printing of parliamentary papers and debates. Unfortunately that machinery has not yet arrived, and in the meantime the work that has fallen upon the department of the Government Printer is very heavy; because it comprises the whole of our- work, in addition to that of- the State- of Victoria, and the present appliances do not serve to meet it. If it could be overcome by the engagement of additional hands that course would be followed at once: But there- is not the machinery for the additional hands until' the machinery that we- ordered! when- the Cabinet was sitting-in Sydney arrives. The machinery has not arrived', notwithstanding that we expedited it as much as possible. In the meantime; the- machinery at the disposal of the Government Printer' is insufficient to- enable us- to put daily proof ' copies of their speeches into the hands of honorable members. The matter will be considered as soon- as the machinery arrives. I quite' admit the convenience to honorable members of that course: There is a- difference; no-doubt, between- the practice in Queensland and our practice; because I understand that in Queensland the newspapers- sometimes- print the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports. Doubtless, that would be a very handy thing to do here, but we have no assurance that the newspapers of Melbourne would do it. I would like- to give honorable members this assurance, that the parliamentary reporting staff is- working as hard as it can ; indeed, it has already been found absolutely necessary to ask for the services of an additional reporter. If there has been any slight defect so far as we have gone; it has been, perhaps, due to the fact that I did not foresee the very large bulk of work that would fall upon the shoulders of the reporting staff. I am now taking steps to remedy that defect as- soon- as possible. </para>

                    <para>- May I ask for a little' information on this- question'? The- right honorable and learned member is no doubt aware that in England there is no-Hansard staff, the reporting- of the debates of the House of Commons having always been -contracted for Hansard, from whose name; all parliamentary reports derive their title, became- a limited- company. I should like to know if the- Cabinet, before deciding- to- engage a staff of official reporters; had before- them- a comparison between the- cost of the system- which is adopted by the- House of- Commons- and the system which we- have- adopted here. The importance of my question is this. Most people- who- have studied our Constitution believe' that when- we- have settled down to- our work our- sessions wilt not occupy more than- two or three months of the year. </para>

                        <para>- Not only has there been bad work, and in some cases- absolutely sweated work, but, in addition to- that, the results have not commended themselves to the heads of the departments concerned. The English Government, after an experience of the contract system; extending over the last 40 or 50 years, have recently expended nearly £40,000- in the. erection of plant to do the printing for the Post-office department. ' It would appear from this, independently of the objections which we have heard in regard to other printing done for the English Government, that the printing for the English postal departments has not been satisfactorily done by contractors. Personally, I should object to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporting being fanned out to a newspaper, or to a set of newspapers, whose proprietors might have very highly coloured political opinions, and might therefore direct that the speeches of honorable members should be condensed or mutilated. I prefer that men who, in the execution of their duty, know no politics, and who, from their very training, have acquired something of the judicial habit of mind, who take no interest in individual speeches, and merely attend to the work that is before them, should be employed. I hope that no proposal for the letting out of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporting will find acceptance with the members of this or the other Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- I do not "know why we should build up a printing establishment in Melbourne while we are in a state of transition. We have numerous printing firms in this city who could do the work, and there are men out of employment who would be glad of occupation. It seems to me that an arrangement might be made whereby the work that is now being held over might be let out to private firms, in which case I think it would be done as well and more speedily than is possible under present conditions. </para>

I ascertained from the honorable and learned gentleman that the staff is expected to report the evidence of select committees and Royal commissions in addition to reporting parliamentary debates ; but, as I have pointed out, it will be utterly impossible for a staff of seven reporters to undertake during the session any work in addition to the reporting of the debates. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but if the Prime Minister has any practical acquaintance with the work of the staff he must know that the time of the chief reporter and the second reporter is entirely occupied in checking the work of the other seven. I would suggest to the Government, not that the reporting of our debates should be farmed out - a suggestion which came from a very proper quarter - but that the House of Commons system should be adopted. We have here a staff of highly skilled and competent reporters, men who have served their time on newspapers, and who, as the honorable member for Bland remarked, have separated themselves from politics; and why should we not allow them to condense the reports of honorable members' speeches ? We know very well that honorable members will repeat their remarks, and why not allow the official reporters to report in the third person, and to condense their reports. </para>

                        <para>- If you turn up the reports of the speeches made in the House of Commons you will find that, with the rare exception of a Cabinet Minister, speakers are not reported in the first person ; and why should not our speeches be reported in the third person ? I have taken at random, from the library, the House of Commons reports for the period extending from the 17th July to the 6th August, 1896, which comprises sixteen- working days. In the House of Commons, it must be remembered, there are nearly 700 members. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt three or four sometimes speak at once, as they do here. The record for those sixteen working days is contained in 1,755 pages ; whereas our record for six working days - because on the 9th and 10th May practically nothing was done - fills up 568 pages, the size of the pages and the character of the type being substantially the same in each case. Those facts furnish a strong argument for departing from the usual custom, by allowing the official reporters to report in the third person, and to use their own discretion in the matter of condensation. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the practice would make the reading of the debates an easier matter for the public, and would result in considerable economy. Apart from the reporting, the expense of printing continual repetitions is very considerable. I do not expect that my views will be accepted by the Government, but I respectfully submit that, as they find themselves obliged to appoint additional reporters, and as the resources of the printing-office cannot keep pace with the requirements of this House and the requirements of the State Parliament, my suggestion might be taken into account. </para>

I wish to see the present system retained, because I think that the reporting should be absolutely within the control of Parliament. I do not know if the honorable member for Coolgardie has ever had to fight an election after he has sat as a Member of Parliament; but if so, I feel sure he will recollect that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is the safeguard of the man who has been in Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I can understand that an honorable member who is ashamed of some action he has taken in Parliament may wish that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> might be burned; but where a straightforward member - such as the Victorian representatives - has to work hard night and day against an unscrupulous opposition, it is only from the official records of the Parliamentary debates that he can provide himself with weapons to disarm and disable his adversary. At the same time I am opposed to the condensation of the speeches by the official reporters. The honorable member for Coolgardie has drawn attention to the fact that some 560 pages have been consumed - in what ? In reporting one of the most educative debates that has ever taken place in this 'State. </para>

Honorable members, I am sure, appreciate the demands which have been made upon them by constituents for copies - of course, free ones - of the numbers in which this debate is contained. These copies are desired, not only because of whatever historical value may attach to them, bub mainly because of the speeches they contain on the momentous question of the probable fiscal arrangements of the Commonwealth,, including the speech of the honorable member himself. </para>

                    (Hunter- Minister for External Affairs). - In reply to the question of the honorable and learned member for Parkes, I would say that the Government were perfectly aware that all the. printing of the English House of Commons is done by contract ; but we were also aware that in England there is no basis for a. comparison between the contract system and the carrying out of such! work as the printing of debates by the. Government, because in England all Government printing is done by contract,, although there are persons who are styled " Printers to His Majesty." I do not think the experiment of having printing done by . Government employees has been tried in Great Britain. It is foreign to the manner in which business is carried on there to have the Government and parliamentary printing done otherwise than under the contract system. But we had a local basis, of comparison, and we knew that, in Australia, to get the work done by contract would cost more than to get it done by the Government Printing Office in Melbourne or Sydney, . or -where the Federal Government happened to have printing to do. We find that we are getting our work done by the Government Printing Office of "Victoria as efficiently as the machinery at the disposal of the office will allow, and at reasonable rates, because we are charged only the cost of labour and material - there are no profit charges. When, the machinery which is on the water comes to hand, the cost, I am informed, will be still further reduced. As to the suggestion that the official reporters should condense honorable members speeches-

                        <para>- The time which this debate has occupied is sufficient evidence that if speeches were condensed a debate might easily be started by what I might, for shortness, term a condensed member, which would need all the condensing powers of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff to bring within reasonable limits, and which, when condensed, would not compensate for the time it had occupied. Honorable members desire their speeches to be reported fully, because they receive a number of copies and wish to enjoy the privilege of sending reports of what they have said to their principal constituents to enable them to see that they are doing their duty. </para>

                        <para>- No, it is not administering to their vanity at the public expense, because the course involves a considerable saving of public time in this House, which otherwise would be wasted in. discussion. There i s another reason - the condensation is done by the press, and very often in the wrong place. If an honorable member wishes to set himself right with his constituents, by means of an official report, he should have a reasonable opportunity of doing so. The honorable member for Coolgardie has alluded to the length of the reports for the present session. I am sorry for that. There is a process of condensation conducted by parliamentary reporters themselves, which takes place when honorable members repeat themselves. But I happen to know from the head of the reporting staff that that process was not possible in connexion with the Address in Reply. The process of condensation could not possibly have been applied to the recent debates ; because while some honorable members may have repeated the arguments used by others, which is inseparable from the conduct of parliamentary debate, the speeches of members generally were devoid of self -repetition. It became incumbent, therefore, upon the parliamentary reporting staff, this being the first debate of the Parliament, and conducting our work as we were under the exceptional circumstances connected with the inauguration of the new Parliament, to give a full report of the proceedings. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member must allow me to have my little joke. It may not be necessary hereafter to report the speeches of honorable members at such full length as in the first debate. It may be possible to condense a little more. If that be so, honorable members may rest assured that the parliamentary reporting staff will do it, because the operation will save them much time and labour, if it be only in the taking of a few less notes. The gentleman at the head of the reporting staff has had to work very hard recently, because he had to organize a new staff under fresh and exceptional circumstances. There is in this organization a system of check note taking and revision which entails very long hours of duty upon the principal and second shorthand writers. Unless this system were adopted, however, I am sure that honorable members would soon express considerable discontent with the reports. </para>

                        <para>- There is no attack, I know, except that an honorable member has said that the meaning of some phrase in a speech had been somewhat misconceived. I have had some experience of parliamentary reporting. For four years, while Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, I controlled the parliamentary reporting staff there ; and, speaking from that experience, I may say that I am quite satisfied with the way in which this work is being done here. If it is found that some condensation can take place without injury to the speeches of honorable members, that will be clone. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear it. A great many honorable members have told me that they have never seen or experienced better reporting than has been done in connexion with this Parliament. Speaking for myself, <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> have had many years' practical experience of reporting, and J can say the reporting of the proceedings of this House has been exceedingly good, and that the staff must be an extremely capable one. In this connexion 1 should like to suggest to the right honorable and learned gentleman at the head of the Government whether, seeing that we have a good staff, we could not later on do with less of the check note taking, and rely to some greater extent upon the more capable men upon the staff. A check note is necessary only so long as a chief is not sure of his staff, but having ascertained that the staff is capable of doing its work, this check note taking might be decreased. Can the. right honorable and learned gentleman inform the committee what is the character of the new machinery which has been ordered ? I wish to know whether it is the linotype machinery or not1? </para>

                    <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard.</inline>
                    The honorable member must recollect, however, that in connexion with the proceedings of the I
                </para>
                <para class="block">House of Commons, the great London dailies make it . a point to rival each other in publishing reports of the speeches of leading statesman. Consequently so much attention is not there paid to <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard.</inline> With regard to condensing the reports, the honorable member with his experience of the press should know perfectly well- that one of the rarest qualities in pressmen is ability to condense in such a way as. to give satisfaction to the speakers whom they report. I say this as a newspaper proprietor of 40 years' experience. Perhaps the very point which the speaker himself thinks might be condensed the condenser despises, while he severely condenses a point which the speaker regards as being of great consequence. I do not say that reporters do this wilfully or perversely. The practice the honorable member has recommended was tried in Queensland, and gave the greatest dissatisfaction, until the House unanimously decided that when the Speaker was in the Chair every speech of every honorable member should be reported in the first person, and that when the House went into committee, the reporter himself should condense in the way he thought necessary. That practice has given great satisfaction. Another thing about which I wish to make a remark is that I do not despise the usefulness of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> It is a mistake to suppose that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is not read. In 1897 I travelled over 1,800 miles of the back-blocks of Queensland, and there was scarcely a place to which I went where I did not find <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The reason for that was that we give every facility in Queensland for its circulation. The reports are issued three times a week, and honorable members can buy them for three shillings a hundred and send them to their constituents. If any local member is misrepresented in the newspapers that he does not support, or that do not support him, a reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is his only remedy. By means of it he can place his views properly before his constituents. I speak from a large experience as to the usefulness of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> not merely as a historical record of the proceedings of Parliament, but as a safety-valve for honorable members who wish to satisfy their constituents that they are doing what they conceive to be right. An honorable member behind me has suggested that honorable members should be supplied with a larger number of copies than twelve. I do not know whether that is a matter of arrangement between honorable members and the Government. In Queensland we supply every member with twelve copies, and if he wants more he can buy them for three shillings a hundred from the Government Printing Office. Here, however, <inline font-style="italic">Mansard</inline> is issued once a week and is consequently a bulky volume to send through the post. I wish also to say that in what I stated earlier in this discussion I had no wish to cast any reflection on any member of the <inline font-style="italic">Mansard</inline> staff. I know what the difficulties of reporting are, and I quite agree that the speeches of honorable members as far as this Chamber is concerned have been extremely well reported. I was not speaking personally in what I said, but the matter was brought under my notice by the observations of another honorable member. </para>

I have never suggested that any alteration should be made in the practice adopted by the Commonwealth Government, but what I wanted to know was whether the gentleman who has decided upon following the practice of New South Wales had really gone into the figures and ascertained that that was the cheaper method.

                        <para>- I believe the other method is in use in South Australia, and what I wanted to know was whether the question had been inquired into. I knew that in suggesting a contract I should touch a raw spot on the left side of the seat I occupy ; but I am prepared to do that, because I know that when those honorable gentlemen buy their- clothes and other things they take care to adopt the principle of contract in order to know what they are to pay. We' have not yet in this House arrived at the conclusion that we will set aside the principle of contract where we can save a certain amount of money to the public. I judge from what the Prime Minister has said that these figures have not been gone into, and that it is now too late to do so. But at the same time, 1 should have liked to know what is the relative cost of the two systems. Although honorable members may say that the contract system does not succeed in the House of Commons, my opinion is that with ' all the experience of the House of Commons we may take it for granted that so long as they continue a system, whether it applies to <inline font-style="italic">Mansard</inline> reporting or anything else, it answers the purpose of the highest Legislature in the world. I should have liked to have- some comparison made between the cost of the reporting staff and the printing as incurred in England at the present time and the cost of our own production. I take it that the comparison has never been gone into, and that therefore the information I seek is not forthcoming. </para>

                        <para>- That is possible. I do not think my honorable friend the member for Gippsland gets his clothes as cheaply as he can without regard to other considerations ; in fact, I am sure he does not. In regard to printing for the House of Commons, I am in communication with, a number of people in London, in my capacity as secretary to the Anti-Sweating League, and one of the complaints made in regard to printing work in England is as to the printing of <inline font-style="italic">Mansard</inline> and other publications for the Government. Just recently, at the instigation of the London Typographical Society, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Burns undertook to bring under the notice of the British Government the fact that their printing was done under conditions that were a disgrace to them. I therefore hope that the Government will not think of adopting the contract system. </para>

                        <para>- I would hardly like to say that the reports are politically coloured, but where junior reporters are permitted under a contract to condense the reports of speeches of members it is possible that some of those reporters may have their favorite members, whom they report more fully than they do other members who are not favorites. Without any reflection on either of tine daily papers in Adelaide who publish these reports, I say distinctly that in the opinion of a. very large number of members of the South Australian Legislature the system adopted is not satisfactory. </para>

                        <para>- There is one point, however, which, although it is not included exactly under this item, has a great deal to do with reports of the proceedings of the Federal Parliament. It has been the subject of some comment in the other States, in South Australia particularly, that the reports of the proceedings of the Federal Parliament as telegraphed to the newspapers are extremely brief. On looking into the question and inquiring from newspaper proprietors and others connected with the press, I find that the reason for these skimpy reports of the debates in the most important Parliament of Australia is that the Post and Telegraph department has not given sufficiently liberal terms for the telegraphing of reports. I do not know how honorable members who represent New South Wales, Western Australia, or Tasmania feel on this question, or what the character of the telegraphic reports given in their daily press may be. </para>

                        <para>- But <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> do know that so far as South Australia is concerned the people and the press complain that the lack of reasonable terms for telegraphing rather fuller reports leads to very little interest indeed being taken in the proceedings of this Parliament. Most honorable members will admit that that is not what we desire. I would ask the Prime Minister to give his especial attention - I do not know who represents this particular department - to the question, whether it is not advisable, in the interests of federation, that the fullest opportunity should be given to the press of the different States to have the reports telegraphed on the most liberal terms. I ask the Prime Minister to call the attention of the Postmaster-General to the question. </para>

I, like others, have sometimes found it useful to travel round with <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in my company in order to refute incorrect allegations. Sometimes that is a successful method, and sometimes it is not. But what I wish to draw attention to is the interjection of the Prime Minister in regard to members correcting proofs of their speeches. I should like to hear it determined that members should not be allowed to correct their speeches. I have found frequently, as no doubt many honorable members have, that if I make an appeal to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in confirmation of an allegation as to what I really have said on any given occasion, especially if one happens to be on the unpopular side, it is said by one's opponents, " Oh, yes, we all know that you members correct your speeches and make them suit you." That is an improper charge to make against a member ; but such charges are made, and in some quarters are believed. I have always made a point - and no doubt many other honorable members do the same - of never correcting proofs of my speeches reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> whether they happen to be quite correct or not, because I feel it better to be able to say that the speech was as the reporter had taken it down, irrespective of any correction or alteration on my part, and not to correct what may not amount to very important errors after all. It would be a good thing if the public could know that we trusted entirely to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff to report our speeches  uncondensed.  I certainly do not believe in the condensing system, because it means an omission system. AVe all know that when we are defining our position  on difficult questions upon which various opinions are held by the public, the refinements are sometimes very carefully thought out and elaborated, and are perhaps almost too fine for the apprehension of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporter in the necessarily hasty manner in which he has to take his notes. Condensation would be injurious, and it is condensation of which, as a rule, we complain when we complain of the reports in the press. I do not think the press deliberately put into a man's mouth words he does not say ; but, in condensing, the 2'eporter may accidentally omit something, and thus considerably alter the general effect of the speech as compared with the report. I trust, therefore, that we shall have <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> undiluted and unaltered by honorable members, and if the public can be made to understand that there is a rule in connexion with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff that the speeches shall go through with all their imperfections, if there be any, untouched by honorable members, it will be found an advantage to have the public apprehension on the point made thoroughly clear. </para>

                    <para>- In my opinion the money to be expended on <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> would be a great waste if the remarks 1 have heard from honorable members are to be taken as a criterion of what we have to read in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Apart from that, the suggestion made by the honorable member for South Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Solomon)</inline> is one to which the Prime Minister might give a considerable amount of attention. lt is well known that very little interest is, as a rule, taken in the proceedings of Parliament unless on a great public occasion when some motion arouses a considerable amount of public attention. More especially is it useless to spend money on <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> if the reports are going to be laid by ; and if the Prime Minister can see his way to assist the press in the various States by cheapening the rates for telegraphic messages, that would be a move in the right direction. I would like to point out to honorable members the position Tasmania occupies. At the present time, members for Tasmania are empowered to send telegrams cm all lines belonging to the Commonwealth ; but unfortunately for Tasmania there is a cable connecting that State with the mainland, and members for Tasmania have to pay the cost of their telegrams over the cable whether the telegrams be on public business or not. I make no complaint on the point, because I am quite prepared to pay for my own telegrams, but constituents in Tasmania are naturally desirous of hearing what their representatives are doing, even if those representatives think it right to be sworn in a second time. I therefore trust that the Prime Minister or the Postmaster-General will endeavour to see that telegrams to Tasmania are sent at a reduced rate for the public prints.' </para>

                    (Echuca).- It is the duty of honorable members in discussing these Estimates to guard not only against extravagance, but also against undue parsimony. Under this division there is one of the hardest cases of any officer who has been in the employ of the Victorian Government. I refer to the clerk, who is also librarian; and I make these remarks because there are so many honorable members from other States who do not know the circumstances of the case. This gentleman has been 22 years in the service of the Government of Victoria, and has filled his present position for some fifteen or sixteen years, during which time he has not received any increment whatever; his salary now being the same as when he took the position, namely £200 a year. He has a family growing around him, and the duties of his position, are of a very responsible character. He has to enter up all the letters, and is also assistant librarian, being one of the best librarians in the State of Victoria. He is a linguist and has an excellent education. His case was' brought before the late Victorian Government of which the member for Gippsland was chief, and of which I was a member. The then Treasurer,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shiels,</inline>
                    who was, I think, one of the hardest men ever in the Treasury out of whom to get money, was so struck by the unfairness with which this officer had been treated that he gave him a bonus of £100. Had that Government remained in office, and this officer in the service of the State, I know they would have increased his salary materially. But a change has taken place, and the officer is put down in the Estimates at the same rate of remuneration he lias received for the last fifteen or. sixteen years. We desire to give fair play all round. I am strongly in favour of economy, but at the same time I am a strong advocate of fair play, and I earnestly commend the case of this officer to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer as one deserving of additional consideration, and when the Estimates are brought down I trust it will be reconsidered, and that he will be paid something like a fair amount for the work which he does. He has to be here early-

From inquiries I have made, I think that this gentleman is not sufficiently well treated. It may be that his salary will have to be dealt with by the State Government, as the library officers are, to use a familiar phrase, being " borrowed " by the Federal Ministry. But, in whatever way it has to be done, I will take the matter into special consideration, and see that this gentleman is more justly treated.

The section proceeds - -Any officer who is at the establishment of the Commonwealth in the public service of a State, and who is by consent of the Government of the State with the advice of the Executive Council thereof, transferred to the public service of the Commonwealth, shall have the same rights as if he had been an officer of a department transferred to the Commonwealth, and were retained in the service of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para class="block">There the rights of the officer are guarded and sustained ; but I do not find anything further in regard to the apportionment of the liability for the pension. The section does not go on, as it does in the preceding part, to state in what proportion ' the pension shall be divided between the State in which the officer formerly served and the Commonwealth in whose service he has entered lately. If it be correct that there is this difficulty, as I am inclined to think there is, it behoves the Government to be very careful how they take over officers other than officers of transferred departments, lest there may be some serious question arising in the future as to how their pensions are to be provided. I draw attention to the point because it seems necessary to do so. </para>

                    <para>- With regard to the heading "Books and Bookbinding," under "contingencies,"! would like to know from the Prime Minister what arrangement has been made about buying new books for the library. I see that an. amount of £100 is set down for this purpose. Does that amount refer to books to be provided for the library by the Commonwealth Government ? In the past it has been the custom of the State Parliament to spend so much a year iri the purchase of books. I believe the Treasurer can tell us the exact amount. </para>

I am now engaged in obtaining confidential suggestions from gentlemen, who are experts on this subject as to the formation of a parliamentary library, for the Commonwealth. When I get their answers I shall proceed to appoint a board or committee to make a report on the subject, and I take it that these answers will give me considerable guidance as to the manner in which I shall proceed.

                        <para>- Not for that purpose, because it relates to such serious matters as the collection of old records relating to the foundation of Australia and the foundation of the Commonwealth. As to the system which it is proper to adopt in a library, the advice of gentlemen experienced in the management of libraries is very valuable. At present we are dealing only with a vote up till 30th June. It will be expended by the Library Committee, and under the arrangement which is to prevail between Victoria and the Commonwealth, matters of this kind will pursue the ordinary course which we found in existence when we came here. At the same time, it is not intended to add materially to the Victorian library by handing over the books purchased to the State of Victoria. Any confusion of that kind will be avoided as far as possible. </para>

                        <para>- If we buy any books and pay for them we mean to adhere to them, but of course there are sundry magazines and things of that kind bought, which will continue to be purchased in the usual course. We need not trouble very much about them, because they represent a mere trifle. As to the future, the honorable member will see that the course I am taking has not had too much relation to the Victorian Parliamentary Library ; it will have more relation to the proper way in which the library for the Commonwealth capital shall be founded. We shall simply carry on the Victorian library in the way it has been carried on of late years, without unnecessary expense, and without parting with anything that we buy. I have looked into the point raised by the honorable and learned member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse.</inline> It seems to me that the final part of the section does provide sufficiently for the cases mentioned. The transferred officers of whom the honorable and learned member speaks are not. officers such as the librarian. We are not taking over these latter officers, but are merely " borrowing " them for the present. There is no library at the Exhibition-building, and it is easy therefore for the State Government to let us have their services at the present time. The discussion of what may be done in the future may well be left for a little while. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- I partly expected that answer from the Prime Minister. There is one case in which' an officer has been taken from a State who is not an officer of a transferred department, and there may be other cases. There is one case from Tasmania, although I am not aware that the officer in question is entitled to a pension. There may be other cases, however, where officers in the civil service of a State who are looked upon as likely to make good officers of the Commonwealth will be taken over, and the point that have suggested should therefore be taken into serious consideration.

There will be some little further charge, therefore ; but it will not be of a very serious character.

                    <para>- I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question. Is the House to understand that the Federal Parlia ment will make provision to keep the library up in exactly the same way as if it were in the hands of the State Parliament <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The reason I ask is that it might be argued that the books, after being- bought, become first the property of the Federal Parliament, and subsequently the property of the State Parliament of Victoria. I think that the House will agree with me that, since we have the use of the library for the time being, the Federal Parliament can well afford to keep it up to date. </para>

                        <para>- As I have already explained, the library will be kept up as has been customary in the past, and when the time comes for this Parliament to move elsewhere, if we have ordered books which make matters more complete in the ordinary sense of providing for a library, I have no doubt that an arrangement can be come to with the Victorian Government, who will want the books which we have collected, while we shall not want them in our library. </para>

                    (Melbourne Ports). - I should like to bring under the notice of the Government the amount of work that has been done, and the great amount of overtime that has been worked by the librarian, the clerk, and the messenger. Honorable members will agree with me that the Victorian staff have done their best to make tilings comfortable for us, and they have had to work a great deal longer than has been usual. I would therefore like the Treasurer to make a note of these services, and to grant them some reward for the extra labour and attention which their duties have demanded.

                <para class="block">While I admit that it is a proper thing that the Vice-President of the Executive Council should have a private secretary, I do not see why a mere amanuensis should be paid £400 per annum. It seems to me that an. ordinary clerk who had a knowledge of shorthand and typewriting could do the work excellently. A little further on, the salary of £450 per annum is provided for the private secretary to the Prime Minister. I contend that these salaries are too high for private secretaries, and that £250 a year would be ample. </para>

                    <para>- I think this is a convenient opportunity to again ask the Ministry to make some statement of policy in regard to the appointment as Members of the Executive Council of gentlemen who are not Ministers of State. It seems to me that the scope of our federal duties did not justify the appointment of two honorary Executive Councillors to do Ministerial work. The scope of our delegated duties is exceedingly small, and if honorable members look through the list of the subjects referred to us - which has been called our 39 articles - they will see that after a few years we shall be looking round for work, and that, unless we follow the example of America and amplify the Constitution by taking to ourselves powers which, no doubt, many of the States will be unwilling to concede to us, we shall not have much to do. At the start, seven Ministers of State would have been ample to do the work of the Commonwealth. If seven are not enough, I ask how it was that so conscientious a man as the Minister for Home Affairs - a man who, if duty was to be done, would certainly face it - could retain the position of Premier of New South Wales for two and a half months after accepting his present position, at a time when, in addition to the enormous duties which.no doubt fall upon him, there was the organization of his department to undertake. Really, the honorable member's action shows that there is too little rather than too much for Ministers to do. In. England the Cabinet is sometimes limited to twelve members, and Lord Beaconsfield in the busiest times did not appoint more than twelve Cabinet Ministers. </para>

                        <para>- That is beside the question. Perhaps I am touching up the honorable and learned member's democratic instincts a bit. Lord Beaconsfield considered that seventeen or eighteen Cabinet Ministers were too many, and he was con- tent to have a dozen. ' I know that in England the under-secretaries often do the work in the House of Commons that is done by the principal secretaries in the House of Lords. But one must remember that the Ministers of the British Empire have an immense amount to do. The Imperial concerns of England, apart from the internal, affairs of the United Kingdom, require an immense amount of care, and the expenditure of an immense amount of time on the part of Ministers. I ask honorable members, however, if they do not consider that seven Ministers of State are ample for the- discharge of the comparatively meagre administrative functions which fall to the lot of the Cabinet in the beginning of the life of the Australian Commonwealth. Take the position of Minister for Defence, for example. The administration of the services which have been handed over to him by the States was usually combined in the States with the administration of some other department, and although we may have extended the geographical area of his control we have not proportionately increased his duties. After the perhaps somewhat arduous work of preliminary organization, the Minister for Defence will occupy a somewhat ornamental position, and it might be, perhaps, amalgamated with the Department of the Post-office. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I have dragged in the Minister for Defence because I think it is open to question whether the duties devolving upon him might not be amalgamated with those of some other Minister, as, for instance, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, whose office is now under consideration. I ask the Ministry to explain why under these circumstances they appointed two honorary Executive Councillors. Was it because they were unable otherwise to soothe the injured feelings of Tasmania, having to some extent ignored that State in the selection of Ministers ; or was it that the work of the Senate required the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline><inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Personally, I think that five Ministers for the House of Representatives and two Ministers for the Senate would have been enough, and if an allotment of offices had been made which would have permitted of that arrangement, we should not hear the complaints which are now being made by the Senate that the great bulk of the Bills of the session are being introduced in this House, and that very few Bills are being presented there. If two Ministers of State were in the Senate, the Bills dealing with the departments of which they had charge would have to be presented there. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but I shall be loyal to the Constitution which has been accepted by the people of Australia, under which the Members of the Senate are elected upon the same franchise as ourselves, and are given practically co-ordinate powers in the initiation of all legislation except such as concerns money matters. We must deal with facts as they are, and as they have been indorsed by the people. What the Ministry should have done was to apportion two Ministers of State to the Senate and five to this House. We do not want the Ministerial benches in this Chamber to be too full. We have now six Ministers sitting upon them. We have also an unofficial Minister in the person of the Government Whip, whose appointment was not necessary in a small Parliament like ours. </para>

As the bulk of us were political innocents, who had never been in office before, we had, perhaps, to take the example of other Governments for temporary guidance until we could recast the whole system. Why were extra Ministers appointed - was it because work was required of them, or because the Prime Minister had to apportion at least one Executive Councillor to each State?

                    <para>- I think my honorable and learned friend, the member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> might have taken up the time of the committee to better purpose than upon the points he has raised. Any one who is not well acquainted with the work conducted in the Senate, and who is not aware of the importance of the leadership of that House, will find ample reason for the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor,</inline> if he goes into the Senate Chamber and looks for himself: The object of obtaining <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor's</inline> services - which do not cost the country a penny beyond his allowance as an ordinary member of the Senate - was to endeavour to strengthen the administration by procuring the best talent in the country to assist in its deliberations not only for the sake of the Ministry, but for. the benefit of Australia. That is an ample answer. It often happens - and no doubt we shall be subject to this treatment in our own case - that honorable members are very angry with political processes which have prevailed in other States, because they are not 'used to them in the States from which they come. Honorable members who have experience of the working of politics in Victoria will remember that it has been a frequent practice to appoint several unpaid Ministers, or honorary Executive Councillors, as members of Cabinets. They have been of material assistance to various Governments, and have also in a large measure helped members of the Administration in cases where there has been stress in the working of the departments. The fact is that this is a system by means of which a great deal of talent is obtained - and obtained in a manner satisfactory to any one who is afflicted with a crane for cheapness. </para>

                        <para>- None whatever. In the case of the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> Fysh, we were in this position: We had seven portfolios to allot. It was not possible fairly to allot two portfolios to New South Wales, and not to allot two to Victoria, which approaches New South Wales in population, and is a most important State. There were then only three portfolios left, and there were four other States. Four into three will not go. We could not have three-fourths of a Minister for each State. What we did, however, was to ask my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> Fysh to assist us as a Minister without portfolio. The time may come when Parliament, in its wisdom, may think that another portfolio is justifiable; but, until that time arrives, we could not appoint an eighth Minister with a portfolio. We had no power to do so. But we felt ourselves entitled, if not morally bound, to secure some representative of Tasmania in the Cabinet, if we constitutionally could do so, in order that administrative matters relating to that State might not be decided without a Tasmanian Minister having a voice in the decision. If that could be done constitutionally it was a very desirable thing to do ; and as to the constitutionality we are perfectly satisfied. </para>

                        <para>- She did more than ask. My right honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon has said that if the honorable and learned leader of the Opposition had been Prime Minister, Tasmania would have had a portfolio allotted to her - which was a pretty broad complaint against me. My answer to what has been said is that I have taken a constitutional course. The honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> is quite incorrect in saying Ministers are so numerous that they will be looking round for work to do. There is quite enough for them to do. It is true that the bulk of the organizing work in the early part of our history as a Commonwealth necessarily fell upon the Prime Minister. Furthermore, in the case of my honorable friend the Minister for Home Affairs, I must point out that he was Premier of New South Wales at the time he accepted office in the Cabinet, and had considerable difficulties to solve before he could get clear of his position at the head of the Government of that State. In the meantime, during two and a half months, some of the work of his department, owing to the stress of his labours, before severing his connexion with the Premiership of New South Wales, fell upon other shoulders. That, however, does not give my honorable and learned friend the right to say that Ministers are looking round for work to do, and that there is not enough work for the number of portfolios held. In the case of the Minister for Defence, probably the honorable and learned member has based his calculations upon the size of the . Defence department of South Australia, without taking into account the defences of the whole coast of Australia. Had he taken that into account he would have seen that an amount of work which would justify a separate department in South Australia would more than justify it for the Commonwealth. It is justified by the fact that the Commonwealth will have the administration of the defence affairs of six States, which work will be at least six times as great as the defence affairs of any one State. </para>

                        <para>- I have had to administer the Defence department of New South Wales, and can say that in order to administer it properly the work ought to take many hours a week, which time, indeed, I gave to it. But if a department is allowed to run itself, as some departments have been permitted to do in some places, the public interest is not conserved. Parliament should see that that does not take place in connexion with the departments of the Commonwealth. As to the work of the gentleman designated as private secretary to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I think there is some foundation for the complaint that he should not be classed as a private secretary. Nor can he be classed as a clerk, because his duties are totally different from those of a clerk. </para>

                        <para>- No, it is rather parallel to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran</inline> in New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran</inline> was allowed to retain the right of private practice. He received £200 a year, and the exercise of his right of private practice was worth considerably more than another £200. And his work in connexion with the Legislative Council was not nearly so heavy as will be the work in connexion with the Senate. To describe the position correctly would take some time, but the duties of this officer - calling him secretary instead of private secretary - are as follows. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has no department, but he is one of the two Executive Councillors who represent the Government in the Senate. The work of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Flannery</inline> has mostly to do with the conduct of the business of the Senate, just as the private secretary to the leader of this House has a great deal to do with the duties of his chief in connexion with the proceedings of the House of Representatives. It is not that there is any great bulk of correspondence in connexion with the Vice-Presidency of the Executive Council, as there is in my own case. The positions are different in many respects. The duties of the representative of the Government in the Senate are not such as to require a clerk, or even such as a clerk could perform. The Vice-President is in charge of Government business in the Senate, and if he happens to be absent for a while, the duty falls, upon the Postmaster-General. The secretary to the Vice-President is responsible to his official chief for assisting in the examination of all Government Bills introduced into the Senate. Although he is not a draftsman, he must be acquainted with the terms of these Bills, and he has the duties of suggestion and comment which fall to the lot of all such officers. They are not clerical duties, but they take a considerable amount of brain power for their adequate discharge. This officer has also to revise Bills coming to the Senate from the House of Representatives, in order to see whether any amendments are required ; and he also has to see whether his chief will require the support of constitutional authorities - and it is. often the case in the working of a new Constitution, that frequent references have to be made to the legal authorities of other countries as points of law arise. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member is anticipating me. Wherever there are amendments made in Bills this officer has to go through them with the greatest care. He has to see also that the drafting is correct, because the parliamentary draftsman will have his hands full of work, and it is to the public advantage that in the drafting of Bills regard should be paid to the relations of the two Houses, and that no incongruities should occur. It would be better to describe this officer as the secretary to the leader of the Government in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- He has not been in a similar position to this before, because there are not many positions in which he could acquire such experience. As to the work he has been doing, I do not wish to indulge in any extravagant eulogy, or I may call down upon myself such condemnation as was evoked by my praises of a permanent officer last night. But he has done his duty with competence and to the satisfaction of his chief. There are many points of procedure which are suitable to other Chambers of Legislature, but which are unsuitable under our Constitution. This is particularly the case in regard to the Senate, which has a popular origin, and with regard to which, therefore, different procedure is necessitated from that required in regard to other representative Chambers. All these are matters which must occupy the attention of an officer of this kind, and I know from the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the work is being done with perfect efficiency. </para>

                        <para>- No. The- position of secretary' to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, must be held by one who is acquainted with legal questions. The qualifications of this officer are that he has taken the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws in the University of Sydney. He won the Allen scholarship in constitutional law in 1890, and in 1892 he won the University gold medal. He has been called to the New South Wales bar, where he has been in active practice. The salary attaching to a similar position in New South Wales has been £250, but the duties there are not nearly so onerous as they will be here. In addition to that, the gentleman who occupies the position there has the right of private practice, which will not be allowed here. </para>

It seems preposterous to ask the committee to pass an item of £400 a year for a young man who may be a very estimable young man - I have nothing whatever to say against him, because I do not know him - and I cannot understand the Government putting this sort of proposal before the committee.

They must have been attempting to make a' living at the bar for some time, and this particular gentleman could not have been successful. He would not come here and take £400 a year after six years at the bar if he had any practice worth talking of. </para>

                        <para>- I beg to differ from the Prime Minister. During one period, anyhow, of the term when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran</inline> was acting as private secretary or secretary to the 'Vice-President of the Council in Sydney he had work of a more trying character than is ever likely to fall to the share of 'the man who takes up a similar position in the Commonwealth. At that time in Sydney we were fighting over a variety of local issues, which practically meant all night sittings month after month. The general average of the sessions in Sydney for years has been somewhere about seven or eight months in the year. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman was in opposition, which, no doubt makes considerable difference. In my view the position will be fully met by the payment of a salary of £250 per annum. That is a very liberal salary, and the list of duties which the Premier has just read' should not impress honorable members too strongly, for the reason that a large proportion should be performed by the Ministers themselves. One or other of the Ministers should go through the Bills that are sent to the other Chamber. I do not say the Ministers in this House should do that, but I presume that in regard to important alterations the whole Cabinet will consider amendments made in this Chamber before they are sent to the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister for Home Affairs will see that his argument does not apply. For some considerable time these positions have been held temporarily, and we were told that no permanent appointments were to be made, ls there any reason why these appointments should be made' permanent now ? It would be a great deal better to leave the Public Service Board to settle them. </para>

                    <para>- I had no intention of speaking on this question, but it is exceedingly refreshing and interesting to notice that the whole of the complaint comes from the State from whence these appointments have been made. I was afraid that some of the new appointments might possibly come from 'Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is, wrong. I am merely trying to point out that in my judgment the Government have made exceedingly few appointments. I trust that the important business of the House will be proceeded with, and that we shall give the Government credit for taking very little advantage of opportunities which fall to the lot of very few men.  </para>

                    MCMILLAN (Wentworth). - The Government are themselves to blame for the manner in which they have put this matter before the House. It is the " red rag" of the private' secretary that has given rise to a great deal of this debate. So far as I can see, the duties of the position are not the duties of a private secretary at all, and the question we have to decide - and we must in matters of this kind take the word of the responsible Minister, more or less - is whether this office is necessary. If the work has to be done, it must be done by somebody ; and, therefore, there is not much difference between bringing in an officer from some branch of the public service to do it, and hiding him under some other name and form, and not putting him down under the right head. It seems to me that we must pass this vote of £400 or knock the whole thing out altogether. Certainly, if this public officer has to review Bills, and do a large amount of professional work, we cannot expect to get him for a salary under £400 a year. We might attract a man by a salary of £400 a year - even a practising barrister - but it does not follow that we should attract him by a salary of £250. There is always a limit to which we must go, and I think that if we can attract a professional man fit £400 for this work, that amount is not too much.

                    <para>- I am not disposed to go to the length of voting for a reduction of this item. At the same time, I join with those who have suggested to the Prime Minister that appointments should be made temporarily to this and similar positions. My own opinion is good that the office could be dispensed with altogether. Of course we are commencing, a new Parliament, and the members of the Government should be the best judges; but I certainly would advise them to make appointments of this kind, which so far as this State is concerned are entirely new, merely temporarily. I think that in the State Parliament, where we have ten or twelve different departments to administer, the work connected with the different brandies of the Legislature is quite as large and a good deal larger in volume than it should be, in the Federal Parliament. The Federal Parliament has only a comparatively limited range of subjects to deal with, and I do not think it would be wise at this stage to make these new appointments permanent. The Govern1 ment may find it necessary, for the purpose of getting the machinery of the Commonwealth into working order, to get temporary assistance in several directions, and I would be the last to cavil at any necessary expenditure of that kind, but in the interests of true economy we should not create new positions and make them permanent, before we are thoroughly satisfied by a considerable experience that they are necessary offices. </para>

                        <para>- That shows that practically the same amount as is now proposed was then carried in New South Wales. May I say, in answer to the honorable member for Bland, that because he has heard a recapitulation of a list of the duties assigned to this gentleman, he is not to suppose that the entire discharge of those duties rests upon his shoulders. I need scarcely say that £400 a year, or three times that amount, would not enable us to retain the services of a man in whom we could place such absolute trust. But. if the honorable member will consider for a moment, I think he will follow in the same line of thought as that just expressed by the honorable member for Gippsland. That honorable gentleman has looked at the schedule of the business set apart for the Federal Parliament in the Constitution, and has measured it with the unlimited range of legislation belonging to the State Parliament. Then he has said that within the narrow limits prescribed for the Federal Parliament surely there 'must be less business to be done. </para>

                        <para>- That is owing to the cheerful support which we have received from honorable members who have assisted us to practise economy. At the present time we are confronted, even with regard to the simplest matters, by the difficulty to which my honorable and learned colleague alluded, of having to satisfy the House that the course followed, and which perhaps has been sanctioned in some one State previously, is as good as the course followed in the other live States. Of course honorable members all believe that the course followed in the particular State from which they come is necessarily the best course. Then, owing to the range of subjects with which we have to deal, we are obliged to turn to six sets of statutes and six sets of practices. "We have to consider the operation of measures over a very much wider area, and altogether the work involves so many difficulties that the amount of research preliminary to action that is cast upon Ministers is infinitely greater than anything which we have been accustomed in the past. The purpose of this officer is to act as junior to his leader, whether that leader happens to be the Postmaster-General or the Vice President of the Executive Council. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware whether or not he has a private secretary. If he has, I presume that the office will appear on the Estimates. If the Postmaster-General has a private secretary, it is no new appointment, and such an officer does not deal with the parliamentary side of the honorable gentleman's duties. This particular officer is employed entirely in connexion with the parliamentary duties to be discharged by the representatives of the Government in the Senate. These representatives have no easy task. The Postmaster-General has a department ' which may well absorb the whole 24 hours of his day, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council also has more than enough to do in attending to his parliamentary duties. Honorable members know that we meet at an hour which deprives Ministers of a considerable part of the afternoon, in which they have been accustomed to transact business in State politics. We have to meet early, under fresh conditions, to face intricate problems, and to mark out new paths. All this requires such an amount of research, that unless we have men who can " devil " for us - to use a legal expression - men who can look up points that seem to be worthy of consideration, the work devolving upon Ministers would be quite beyond their powers of performance. This work of inquiry, research, and investigation can be done in such a way under a -Minister's direction as to relieve him of a very great burden. The time of the Postmaster-General is thoroughly occupied. Most honorable members know the work of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. Although he occupies an honorary position, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor</inline> works as hard as does any one in charge of a large department. I know of my own personal knowledge that he has found his time and his resources altogether inadequate, and that he has .been greatly dependent on the gentleman who has been acting as Ids secretary. I know from the Bills that have been returned to me, and the problems submitted to me in notes upon them, that there has been a large amount of work to be done which it was impossible for the Vice President of the Executive Council to do himself. </para>

                        <para>- I beg the honorable member's pardon. As regards the matter of expenditure, I can assure the honorable member for Bland that there is really work to be done at present in connexion with legislation that is before us which it is quite impossible for Ministers to do without the assistance of some such officer as the one under discussion. It is true that the salary is small,but that is because the gentleman holding the position is young appears to have had a brilliant university career, and it is only a young man whose services could be obtained for £400. He takes the position not so much for the salary, but for the invaluable experience which he can gain. Here we are at the beginning of what will afterwards become a federal system of jurisprudence. The training that a man occupying this position will get will enable him to return to his profession all the better equipped for his experience. I can quite understand, therefore, that he should sacrifice a portion of his income for the advantages thus conferred. This question is incidentally related to several others to come before the committee. We have heard something about extravagance. I am conscious of no extravagance or of any step towards it. Extravagance is a term that we might spread over anything. When the Scotchman said, "Bang went sax pence" after two hours' city visiting, he thought that was extravagance. But extravagance is entirely a relative matter, and surely should be judged by the quantity and quality of the work done, but especially by its quality. The work done during the next year or two will be of the first importance. An officer of this kind, capable and energetic as he appears to be- </para>

                        <para>- I will not. The work of some such officer for the next few years seems to be absolutely indispensable. I can only add that, so far as the legal work of the Government is concerned, it is being attempted by an utterly inadequate force. The task cast upon us will lead to a break-down of some of the staff if it continues in its present intensity. Such an officer as the one under discussion has been able to render most" efficient assistance. He has been chosen' by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who knows and trusts him, and those who know the Minister will consider that a very good guarantee of the officer's ability. The sum set apart is certainly no over-payment for the work which is being done and which remains to be clone. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HIGGINS</inline>
                    (Northern Melbourne).I understand that a definite amendment has been moved by the honorable member for Bland ; but I sincerely hope that he will not put the House to a division oh the question, as that would be going in a false direction, in regard to this appointment. At the same time, I think the Government might and ought to discreetly heed the warning which comes from all sides of the House, that these appointments ought not even to appear to be permanent. I suggested yesterday that some undertaking of this sort should be given, and, although there was no response from the Ministry I see that the idea has been taken up. The more I think over the matter the more I feel that the gentlemen who in the first stress of the work of the Federal Government are giving Parliament their help, should know that it does not follow that they will be public servants of the Commonwealth all their lives, or, at all events, will remain in the groove in which they are now placed. The fact is that we are cutting our coat before we know how much cloth we have. We are arranging for officers before we know what offices are required. I think "that we should go cautiously. We ought to feel that within a year or two the conditions will be changed, and it may well be that officers who appear to be essential now will not be essential then. From what I have gathered, the intention of the Ministry seems to be to have a highly-trained gentleman, possessing legal knowledge, to give the Vice-President of the Executive Council the benefit of his skill and assistance; and £400 a year is little enough to pay such a gentleman. I do not think any one who possesses the necessary skill and training could be got to do the work for less than £400 a year. At the same time, there may be force in the contention that if the duties of the Vice-President of the Executive Council were being performed by one of the Ministers of State there would be no need for this officer. If that is so, it would- seem that in appointing him we are to some extent evading the provisions of the Constitution, which distinctly provides that there shall be only seven paid Ministers of State, and limits the aggregate amount of their salaries to £12,000 a year. A. great deal of force is thus lent to the protest which has been made by the Opposition against the action of the Government in creating more Ministers than the Constitution provides for.

                    <para>- I know of no State Parliament where there is a corresponding office, and I cannot see why there should be need for the office in connexion with this Parliament. 1 think that the Government has made a vast gain in securing a man like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> as leader of the Senate. He is a man whom I always feel inclined to vote with, whether he be right or wrong, and I should be disposed to assume that he is light until I had very good reason for knowing him to be wrong. But, while I am anxious that the leader of the Senate should be given all the assistance he requires, I do not think that the Government are entitled to presume upon the willingness of honorable members in this respect by making a permanent appointment. So far as I can see at the present time, the Government have no power to make a contract of a permanent character with any public servant, because I think that the ordinary rule of law, that every public servant holds office at the will of the Crown unless some Act of Parliament provides that he is to hold office permanently, applies to all their appointments. If that view of the law is correct, I hope that Ministers will not compromise Parliament by entering into a contract which they will afterwards tell us they are morally bound to fulfill. I have no acquaintance with the gentleman who has been appointed to assist the Vice-President, though I am sure the Minister himself would select a good man. I feel that in an office of this sort it is requisite that the person appointed should be the personal friend and confidant of the Minister whom he serves. </para>

                        <para>- That is very true : and all these things must be considered. There is" no position in which it is so important that there shall be full confidence between a chief and his assistant as a position of this sort. I understand that the officer who has been appointed is not a private secretary, but a gentleman who, although he cannot speak in the Senate, will help the Vice-President to conduct the business of that House by preparing Bills for him, considering amendments, and generally making himself useful in putting matters of legislation into order. It is, therefore, extremely important that there should be full confidence between the Minister and his secretary. I hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will be allowed to obtain this assistance. To reduce the proposed salary from £400 per annum to £250 would be futile. I would rather see the item struck out altogether. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. But until it is known whether the position should be made a permanent one, the officer appointed, though a temporary officer, should not necessarily have to retire with the Minister who placed him in his position. I think we should avoid sill appointments of that sort. In reply to the eloquent speech of the Attorney-General, I would say that while, in my opinion, he made out a good case for this appointment, and for the salary paid, I cannot agree with his statement that the members of this House who raised the cry of economy are doing so merely because the Ministry are making appointments to which they have not been accustomed in their own States. That is not so: ' While we recognise that at the inception of the Commonwealth there must be a vast amount of work for Ministers to do, and that they may therefore require a great deal of assistance both clerical and professional, we do not wish to hamper the Commonwealth with permanent officers whose services will become less and less necessary, and perhaps altogether unnecessary, as time goes on. We wish it to be clearly understood that, in our opinion, unless there is good evidence that a position must be a permanent one it shall be filled, temporarily, to meet the emergencies of the moment. </para>

We ought, therefore, either to omit the word " private," or the officer should be styled " Secretary to the representative of the Government in the Senate.'"'

If the work requires to be done, this officer is not sufficiently paid for the work he is called upon to perform. He is doing the work of a parliamentary draftsman. Under such circumstances he should be put in a similar position or should at any rate be a sort of under-secretary to that officer, so that the Parliament may have his services permanently.

                        <para>- This raises a question which, small as it is at the present stage, is of more importance to the Commonwealth than the mere appointment of a private secretary to the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I am of opinion that the only persons connected with the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth who should go out of office at the time of a change of Ministry are the Ministers themselves. It may be said-" You are a nice man to support a Ministry, if you oppose them on a matter like this." But we are not supporters in the sense that Lord Melbourne desired to have parliamentary supporters, when he said that his followers should support the Ministry when they were wrong, because it was then that support was most desired. We are here to see that things are done properly. It may be regarded as most ridiculous to say that this appointment is a sample of the spoils system; but small as it is in quantity it is spoils system in quality and character. We do not want that in connexion with the Commonwealth of Australia. Other federal unions have suffered too much from this cause for us to permit it here. If we permit this small evil in this case it will be used as an argument by those who do not feel strongly on the question of having no coloured population in Australia. They will say that the coloured population evil is a very small one here and there, I say emphatically that if Ministers want to have private secretaries who are to hold office only so long as the Ministers themselves hold office, let them have private secretaries by all means, but let them, pay them, as private citizens would, out of their own pockets. But to have political appointments which are to be rewards distributed by members who may become Ministers, means the introduction of a state of affairs that may be made a precedent for scores of other objectionable appointments. The trail of the Governor-General in Council and the Ministry is over the whole of the Public Service Bill which has been circulated, and we are getting a preliminary whiff of it even before the measure comes up for discussion. If I have an opportunity I shall vote against this office, not because I do not think it is a desirable office - at present I think it is, although it may be unnecessary hereafter - nor because I fancy it can be done without merely "because we have done without it in the State of Victoria. In New South Wales I am informed there has been such an office, and 1 do not draw the conclusion from its absence in Victoria, or the presence of it in New South Wales, that it is undesirable. We must consider the matter apart from whether or not the office exists in other States. I believe that in the present difficult circumstances of the Commonwealth, and in view of the fact that some time or other, owing to the elastic words of the Constitution, differences of opinion may arise with another place as regards Money Bills and matters of that kind, it is desirable that we should have officers watching our Bills, so to speak, to see that they do not contain anything to cause unnecessary friction. There is also a great deal to be done in collating the practices of the various States, so as to arrive at procedure which will be acceptable to the people generally. But appointments by men who are not politically responsible to the people, who should have the final control of all political appointments, are not, in my opinion, regular. A private secretary, who does not sit in Parliament, is quite as important, apparently - according to the description we have had from the Prime Minister - as the Under-Secretary to a Minister of State. In England Ministers of State have their own private secretaries, and pay their salaries. .Let a Minister , of State , of Australia who wants to have a private secretary also pay him. No man who holds office only so long as his chief holds office can detach himself from political considerations. It would be more than human for any mau to do so. Consequently the holders of such offices will have political complexions, and that is very objectionable.' I shall vote against this, and three or four other similar appointments. I do not think that Australia will permit any attempt, even on so infinitesimal a scale, to introduce the spoils system here. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope honorable members will pause before they strike out this item. There may be a' great deal in what the honorable member for Corinella has said as to the general principles of employing private secretaries j but looking to the description of work that has to be done by this officer, I think £400 will not be ill spent if Parliament gets the services of such an officer as has been described. There is no doubt that a little more attention given to the details of drafting, and to carefully overlooking the progress of Bills in all their stages, is well worth paying for. I think £400 a year is little enough to pay for such services in connexion with the passage of Bills through the Senate. I hope that, from that point of view, we shall preserve this item, and that it will not be reduced, even if we alter the wording of the Estimates so as to retain the services of the officer permanently. It will, be well to recognise the wisdom of having permanent officers of this character. </para>

                    <para>- As one who has had a little experience in the Legislative Council of Victoria I feel that an appointment of this kind is very desirable. I am sure the work of the Legislative Council would have been better done in many instances if there had been such an officer attached to it. I was not aware that there was such an officer in New South Wales, but I can quite understand the work there being better done in consequence. With regard to the permanency of the appointment I am a little doubtful, because at present it is not known what the decision of Parliament upon the Public Service Bill will be. I certainly do not favour this officer giving up his appointment when the Minister goes out of office. I am entirely opposed to that principle. I object to the spoils system. I favour the view of some of those honorable members who spoke earlier in the debate. If the Government will tell us distinctly that the appointment will be made permanent, and that the Public Service Board will have some voice in regard to it, I shall .be satisfied. That is to say, the tenure of the appointment should be subject to whatever Parliament decides in regard to the Public Service Bill, and should not be held at the will of a Minister of the day. Certainly, £250 a year will not be anything like sufficient for the work that will require to be done. You could not get any man of any worth at all to continue in an appointment of this kind at such pay. I shall vote against the amendment, but I should like to have ah assurance from the Government that the appointment will be made permanent. </para>

                        <para>- That clears the ground considerably. It will enable us to deal with the question which has been raised as to the personal character of some of the appointments. If there is a thing we may pride ourselves on in Australia - I am sure of it in Victoria, and I believe it is so in the rest of the States - it is that members of the public service always show their loyalty to the Ministry for the time being, under whom they have to serve. I think that position ought to be strengthened and not weakened. If we find any gentleman, however able, however skilled, however experienced he is, in the position that his salary from the country depends upon his retaining a particular political chief, we may be perfectly sure that his first care will be for himself : and we cannot expect the same disinterested service we have been accustomed to receive.

                    <para>- I desire to have your ruling, sir, as to the practice to be followed when the question is put and a division is to be taken. As I understand the position at the present time, the ques-tion is put before the division, and it may be decided on the voices. In the event of a division being called for, the bells are rung but the question is not again put, notwithstanding that a number of members may be absent from the chamber when the question was first put. They come into the chamber when the bells are rung, and then the question goes to a division without being again stated to the House after the doors are locked. I simply wish to know your ruling upon this matter in order that when some critical division occurs we may know exactly the position which we occupy, and thus avoid any conflict of opinion as to what course should be pursued when any strong feeling is exhibited. </para>

                    <para>- I think that a proper consideration of this division may clear the air a good deal with regard to certain matters. I take it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that I can refer generally to the items. It is rather curious to note, -when we take the different salaries under this heading, the position of the officer who is called the private secretary. We have here a secretary at £800 per annum, a chief clerk at ±'600, and then comes a private secretary at £450, the next clerk receiving £250. It seems to me that the duties of these officers ought to he stated to some extent. With regard to the private secretary, it seems to me that he ought to be a permanent official of the service. I agree' with the honorable member who said that there was no analogy between the position, of a private secretary here and that of a private secretary to an English Minister. The private secretary to an English Minister is really a private secretary, and is paid out of the Minister's own pocket. </para>

                        <para>- That is a system that has arisen out of the character of English administration. A great many of these private secretaries are men who afterwards develop into politicians or diplomatists, and it is often looked upon as a training ground for men of that kind. What I desire to point out, however, is the disproportionate salary of the private secretary in this Estimate. It is well for us to understand what this private secretary is. I take it that he is either purely an amanuensis to the Prime Minister - that he is only a private secretary - or that besides being an amanuensis he gets through a certain amount of work which is practically done by somebody officially and permanently connected with the department. AVe would not be justified in paying a salary of £450 to any man as a pure amanuensis or shorthand writer to the Prime Minister. On the other hand, it seems to me, probably because I have never had the luxury of a private secretary myself, that the position of the Prime Minister is different from the position of any other Minister of the Crown. He has a great many duties arising out of that position which do not come under the category of another Minister's work. But it seems to me that the position enunciated here to-night is a sound one, and that we should not countenance the bringing in of outside people to the public service of the country who are not doing purely private work, not even the work of an amanuensis, but who are doing the same work as an ordinary officer of the department would do. Alter all, this is a public work, and there are certain things connected with all public work of a private and confidential character, and I do not think that we should for one moment allow the principle that friends of Ministers should be introduced into the public service, be given a certain standing in that service, and be initiated, as they must in the nature of things, to a great many matters of government which belong to the people and are not the right of any private individual. Therefore, I think we ought at any rate to have a complete explanation from my right honorable and learned friend the head of the Government with regard to the status and work of this particular person. We are now initiating a new system, and it is better, if this thing is the right thing, that we should understand exactly what we are doing. </para>

                        <para>-If this private secretary is not part and parcel of the department, as I think he really is, the other salaries are of a very moderate character outside of the question of salary that will be referred to by others. I do not wish to refer to the matter of the secretary, because I think at these early stages of the Commonwealth Government we must trust largely to the wisdom and common sense of the Executive in making appointments, either of a temporary or permanent character. Some honorable members have spoken to-night as if this House could make appointments. We can make no appointments. The Executive makes the appointments, and unless there is something flagrantly wrong about those appointments it is of no use dragging the names of individuals before this House. </para>

                        <para>-No; that is a different thing altogether. I repeat that unless there is something flagrantly wrong - something of sufficient importance to warrant the challenging of the Government and its <inline font-style="italic">bona fides - ,</inline> we ought not to drag in the names of individuals. We ought to take for granted, unless some principle has been misapplied, that the proper individual has been selected to take the position that we create, and for which we find the money. I do not think there is any analogy between the position of the gentleman, who I believe has been ' appointed - because it is evident it is going to be brought up - and. the question of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan's</inline> appointment. I do think, as I said to my right honorable friend during the debate upon the Address in Reply, that it is not quite fair to put this question of the public service as he put it. The Prime Minister said on, that occasion that the . Government retains absolutely its light to go wherever it likes, although it may consider the public services of Australia. I say that the thing should be the other way round. The Government should exhaust the public services of Australia. In the spirit of the very Bill which they have brought in, and which is now on the table of the House, there is a direction that they must exhaust those public services, and it is only after having done so that they may reasonably be expected to make an outside appointment. I do not think that I have anything further to say, but we may save a great deal of time afterwards by laying down at this stage of the debate the principles which shall guide us. </para>

                        <para>- The Acts Interpretation Bill, which we have recently had before us, was such a success in the matter of definition that I am rather chary about giving the honorable and learned member an answer. According to the Prime Minister, a private secretary is a gentleman who will have such confidential relations with his chief in regard to matters of policy that it is not desirable that two successive Prime Ministers should have the same private secretary. But my view is that in a department like this, any officer to whom the Commonwealth pays a salary should be an officer permanently employed in the department, who will not have to look for the continuance of his salary to the continuance in office of the Minister who may be his chief . Whatever view may be taken of the duties of a private secretary, or however much he may be in the confidence of his chief, his tenure of office should not be absolutely dependent upon his chief's tenure of office, or even possibly dependent upon it. The private secretary should feel that it is his duty to serve the Minister for the time being, and that he has no political object to serve. But, if a man knows that when his chief goes he must go too, his mind cannot help taking a political cast. Small as the matter may be, it seems to me that a great and important principle is involved, and I should not be surprised to hear that there were differences of opinion in the Cabinet upon the subject, just as there are differences of opinion in this Chamber. The fact that the salary allotted to the private secretary is so much greater than the salaries allotted to the other clerks in the department - with the exception of the Under-Secretary and the Chief Clerk, who are administrators rather than clerks - shows that his position is a different one from that of the other clerks, and I hold that it is in the interests of the Commonwealth that he should be a permanent member of the public service, subject to the same rules, having the same tenure of office, and enjoying the same rights and privileges as any other member of the service. </para>

                        <para>- No other clerk in this department is to receive £450 per annum, and I take it that these Estimates forecast the probable strength of the department for some little time to come, though no doubt it will grow as the work of the Commonwealth expands and increases. If this gentleman is not to be private secretary to successive Prime Ministers, and is still to remain in the public service, ask if it is proposed that he shall be taken from a position where the duties are regarded as worth £450 per annum, and for which it is presumed he has special qualifications, and put into the- position of an ordinary clerk, for which the salary of £250 per annum, is considered sufficient ; while a clerk who, up to the time of the change of Ministry, has been considered worth only- £250 per annum is suddenly discovered by the new political head of the department to be worth £450 per annum, and promoted to the position of private secretary. </para>

The objection I take is that this, officer depends for his continuance in this particular office, if not for the continuance of his salary, upon the political existence of his chief, and, however the position may be justified, the fact remains that under those circumstances he is a political officer who is being paid as a member of the Commonwealth Public Service. This must be a permanent office, whether the person who fills it be permanently appointed or not. </para>

                        <para>- These excuses are all very well as examples of special pleading, but they do not affect the real issue. 1 venture to say that these Estimates very accurately foreshadow the permanent yearly Estimates. Can any of us doubt that the office of Private Secretary to the Prime Minister will and must continue ? Is there any doubt that if these Estimates are passed we shall find 'the same items and the same questions to discuss when the ordinary Estimates of the year come before us ? The fact that there are only eighteen days to be provided for does not affect the principle upon which the Estimates have been framed, and upon which the appointments should be considered. If the private secretary's tenure of office depends upon the tenure of office of the Prime Minister, I have nothing but the heartiest good wishes for him'; but if the Minister tells us that when he goes out of office - and we know that all Ministries must die sooner or later- </para>

                        <para>- I hope that it will be a, long time, in coming in the case of this Ministry, but I want the Prime Minister to give us the assurance that his continuance in office will not affect the continuance in office of his private secretary, and that when his successor comes into office the position of a private secretary will be considered quite apart from political considerations. I regard this as an essential matter, and the Prime Minister must give us that assurance before he can satisfy the doubts and. scruples of honorable members. I think that we are entitled to the assurance now, and should not be asked to wait until the ordinary Estimates for the year are before us. However clear an understanding may be arrived at that the first action we take shall not prejudice any future action, we know that it will prejudice it; and the longer any state of affairs is permitted to continue in existence, the more difficult it will be to interfere with it. If we have the assurance that political changes will not be allowed to affect the position of this officer, our difficulties will be resolved, but unless we get that assurance, I shall feel bound to vote against the item, although I believe that a private secretary to the Prime Minister is necessary for the proper administration of the affairs of the department. </para>

                    <para>- In discussing this matter, I do not wish to confuse the officer with the office, and I do not intend to discuss the question whether the officer appointed is or is not capable. The question with which I would deal is whether the creation of the office is warranted. The honorable member for Wentworth has asked the Prime Minister for a definition of the duties of a private secretary. So far we are not seised of it. Last night I thought that the appointment was an excrescence on the Estimates. The only answer that was received was that a private secretary to the Prime Minister is essential, because confidential matters will arise between the Prime Minister and his secretary; and I understood the right honorable and learned gentleman to say that he would take care that when he left office his private secretary would leave with him. </para>

                        <para>- The arguments with regard to a guarantee to the Prime Minister's private secretary would equally well apply to the Clerk of the Executive Council. It is well known that the Clerk of the Executive Council obtains information of the most confidential character ; but we have never known that information to be divulged by such an officer. There is, therefore, very little in that contention. The point is whether there is any necessity for the office at all. I could have understood it if the Prime Minister had had a third clerk in his department, who could have acted in a confidential capacity towards the right honorable and learned gentleman." We can learn something from the experience of other States. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes for years carried on the business of the Government of New South Wales without a private secretary. The same thing occurred in the case of the honorable member for Wentworth, and also in the instance of the leader of the Opposition. It was only when the present Secretary for Home Affairs became Premier of New South Wales that there was thought to be any necessity for the appointment of a private secretary. </para>

                        <para>- If the functions -of a. private secretary to the Prime Minister have regard to his relations with his constituency it is the duty of the right honorable and learned gentleman to pay that secretary out of his own pocket. If the private secretary's duties are to carry out the orders of his chief in private matters the Prime Minister should pay him. A definition is absolutely necessary in order that honorable members may understand the situation. If the duties of the private secretary are such as could be carried out by a third clerk, there is no reason for giving him the title of private secretary, which merely misleads honorable members. If, however, the relations of that officer are of a political char: deter, and his services are employed for purposes of organization and for obtaining information on behalf of the Ministry, then his relationship with the Prime Minister is. purely of a private character, and his salary should be paid out of the pocket of the head of the Government. The same is the case if the private secretary is simply the confidant of the Prime Minister. If, however, he is a departmental officer, and his services are for the general use of the Commonwealth, he is absolutely required, and "we should be told so. He will then be under the control of the Public Service Board ; but at the same time I cannot see how the Public Service Board can exercise any authority over him. They will not know what is required of him, and will have no direct guide to his duties in appointing any one to the office. On the whole I do not see any necessity for voting for the item. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear it. I readily accept the assurance of my honorable friend ; but, whoever said it, the remark will apply in the same way, and without any unnecessary resentment I may say that those who know my public career in New South Wales are aware that I have absolutely never been a party to placing any relation of mine in the public service. There is not one relation of mine in the public service, and I have never been a party to placing any public servant in any position because he was my friend. There are those who, believing this to be a fair practice in the game of political warfare, have complained of me because they thought that while the general won the battle the camp followers had none of the spoils. I wish to dispel the idea that I am capable of asking any one to come into the public service, and of planting him there behind the back of Parliament, simply because he happens to be a friend of mine. But, on the other hand, I may say this : that I am not going to be a lunatic. I am not one of those who think that the proper means of constituting a public . service is to fill it with your enemies. Those who think that the appointments of a Ministry are challengeable unless they are made from those very persons who were banded on the other side, will not find a champion in me. I take it that this is a fair way of putting the question. I have not, under any circumstances, appointed any person to the public service on the bare ground that that person was a friend of mine. But I do confess to this : that if there were individuals having equal claims, or where, perhaps, there was a person who had a stronger and better claim than any one else, I have taken greater- pleasure in appointing him to an office if he was a friend of mine. And so would any one else. Nothing more than this has occurred with regard to any appointment with which I have been connected. Honorable members can confirm me in this : that some gentlemen have been appointed to offices whose political views were certainly not in accord with mine on the question which is, perhaps, to be the principal one for settlement by this House, namely, the fiscal question. I have made this a principle. I have endeavoured honestly, to the best of my ability, to conserve Commonwealth interests in this respect, and to choose amongst those whose capacity I knew. That is the extent to which I have gone, and no further ; and I am sure there is a sufficient number of honorable members in this House who will accept that assurance just as it is given. The honorable member for Wentworth has remarked that in England the circumstances are different. They are different. I am not going for a moment to compare as identical the circumstances which exist, except by way of a relative comparison. Ministers of State in England have in some cases four or five private secretaries, among whom are generally two who are paid from the public funds. There are also generally one Or two private secretaries who are students of politics, and who assist in the kind of work which has to be conducted by a Minister. The work- of a Minister in England is not purely departmental and administrative, and private secretaries in this position are enabled to obtain experience in political life, as has been pointed out by the honorable member for Wentworth. In addition to that, there are 'in England political under-secretaries who represent the Government in each House of Parliament. These go out of office with the Ministry, although of course only those are Cabinet Ministers who are the heads of departments, whilst the others, though they are parliamentary officers, only act in a subordinate capacity. </para>

                        <para>- I am pointing to that as one of the facts which check the strain of Ministerial labour in England. There is also this to be considered, that Ministers in England do not have to perform a number of duties that fall upon Ministers in Australia. Not only are the subjects embraced within the range of government much more numerous in Australia, not only do our Ministers deal with social problems which bring them in contact with the people to a very much larger degree than in England, but Ministers in Australia are constantly subject - not improperly, perhaps - to have their work interrupted by interviews with deputations and Members of Parliament to a degree that is not thought of in England. The reason is that in England Ministers of .State are believed to be so engrossed in the work of their departments that they ought not to be interrupted, and have not time to attend to other work. A Minister of this Commonwealth, it is true, has less to do with petty departmental details and more with matters of policy, than have Ministers of any of the States in Australia. It ought to lie so.. But nevertheless they are consulted to a great extent by Members of Parliament and by deputations. Furthermore, the interests of honorable members lead us to fix. the hour of meeting for this House at 2.30 in the afternoon, so that all, the time that is available for Ministers for the discharge of their work is the morning. Notwithstanding that, their accessibility- - of which I do not complain - prevents them from attending during the whole of the morning to their departmental work. Consequently their opportunities are reduced to the smallest dimensions. . It is a very good thing to recollect these facts, and that Ministers here not only have to conduct the affairs of their departments, but to receive Ministers and deputations courteously, as I hope they always do. In addition to that, in the case of the Prime Minister there is a large amount of correspondence, which need not be described to honorable members simply because they must know that it exists. What is the position set up ? How can a Prime Minister do without a private secretary ? Let it be recollected that whenever work does not belong specifically to any department it is shot on to the Prime Minister, whether it is done by interview or by letter, and it is a happy thing that a large portion of it is done by letter. What happens ? If I were to attempt myself to deal with the correspondence which falls on me as Prime Minister - correspondence which cannot be exactly classified because some of it is private, some semi-private, and some semi-official - I should fail in the task, and you would not have your Government administered. This position is so different from that of any other position you can imagine in the service of the Government, that if I did not have the services of a private secretary allowed me, I should be so seriously hampered that I should have to consider whether I could do the work. And I do not intend to pretend to do my work for the Commonwealth unless I do it efficiently. I want to make that perfectly clear, and I hope honorable members understand me, because I wish to say it in the most friendly spirit - that unless some officer of the kind is allowed, and in some such way as now, I do not know how I can do the work. </para>

                        <para>- I know that with the patience which distinguishes my honorable friend he will wait a minute or two when I will tell him. Having described the position set up, I wish to point out that a very great amount of business naturally falls on the Prime Minister in the attempt to organize a new Constitution and to give it legislative effect. There is, in addition, a large amount of correspondence which falls on a Prime Minister, simply because those who address it to him do not know to which department to send it, owing to the fact that it does not properly belong to any department. These people exercise a right discretion in addressing the Prime Minister, but a lot of the correspondence takes time to mature, and there may be an interchange of several letters for some time before it is in a fit condition to be referred to any department of the State. Then the gentleman who holds this position under me will have in any case to conduct a large portion of my correspondence, because having only the morning, as other Ministers have, for the whole of the work which falls on me outside Parliament, it would be a total absurdity to suppose I could deal with a mass of correspondence, while it would be equally absurd to say it could be sent to a department, seeing that it is not departmental. A large portion of the correspondence no doubt is private, and struggle with it as I may, I have to invoke the assistance of this gentleman. I suppose anybody who holds my present Ministerial office would fall into public contempt if he did not use some promptitude in answering correspondence. That involves a degree of confidence between the Prime Minister and his secretary, which the Prime Minister cannot be supposed to repose, as suggested last night, in a fifth class clerk. In addition there are a large number of letters which are, and, must be semi-official ; and although these are not departmental, as already explained, still they have reference to public affairs, and they are dealt with by the private secretary, or whatever we call him, when I cannot attend to them, which is nearly always. </para>

                        <para>- He may be called confidential secretary; I will accept any name which enables me to have the services of the officer in the way I wish. I have no desire to flinch from any criticism. Instead of flinching from criticism I welcome it. But I will, as far as I am concerned, speak frankly to honorable members, and tell them the position ; and if they choose then to deprive me of services without which I cannot get on, I shall know what to think of them. It is suggested that this gentleman does not do my private business. That business I have to negotiate in such time as the House leaves me, which is about five minutes a day. But there is a large amount of correspondence which is called private secretary's correspondence, and which, 'though it does not deal with any such question as a man's relation with his banker, or anything of that sort, has to do with matters which cannot be called public, and which are confidential. These are .matters it would be absurd to expect a clerk to do, unless a clerk can be obtained with qualifications such as I have never yet seen possessed by one. The services are needed of a man who has a certain amount of tact, who is 'himself able to conduct "this kind of correspondence in the way you would conduct it yourself, not in a rude or brusque way, but as becomes any one acting for a Minister of State. As my right honorable friend the Treasurer has just reminded me, this gentleman has repeatedly to interview people for me. Why ? Because, if I .had 'to see them myself, I should not be able to conduct the business of the House at all. Then again, where business has to be transacted between myself and other Ministers - which business cannot be done by taking departmental men away from their work - this gentleman has to arrange for appointments and so forth.. The conduct of this business cannot be compassed by simply minuting on departmental papers ; and in other ways there is a lot of work I want clone, but which I cannot take away departmental officers to do. To go back to my text, there is, as I was saying, a large amount of semi-official correspondence which has reference to matters of the most vital importance ; and honorable members will very well understand that in a department such as that of External Affairs, there are matters constantly passing a vast deal more confidential than it is customary to pass through departmental sources.. T do not press this, argument - I have almost said too much - on gentlemen so very well versed in public affairs as are two or three honorable members. I see. opposite. </para>

                    - It could be done by the Under-Secretary. I am glad the honorable member mentioned the point, because the gentleman whom I now propose as under-secretary, if I can have him - we call one officer a secretary -because the responsible officer is called under-secretary - and other gentlemen were doing this and other work, and the pressure became such that I had to make a choice. I told this gentleman that he must take the work of secretary or undersecretary - whichever honorable members like to call it - because I saw this other work could not continue to be piled on him, making him busy day and night. As an ordinary thing, I am working with this gentleman up till midnight when the House is not sitting. I have to have assistance, which I can get only in a particular way, in order to cover a large area of undetermined ground, none of which is departmental, and part of. which is private and part semi-official. It rests on this simply : I cannot promise to efficiently conduct the business of the' House and the country unless allowed an officer of the kind. It is asked why I do not pay him myself.

But, in the meantime, while we leave things on their present basis, I. have to go on with the work and carry it out efficiently, and I do not think I ought to be called on under the circumstances to pay a private secretary out of funds which are already, in the opinion of a majority of the committee, inadequate for the purpose without that payment.

                        <para>- No. There is already more than one correspondence clerk in the department. Call him secretary to the Prime Minister if you like - I care not what is the denomination - but I must have this work done, and I must appeal to the House - it is not often I take such a strong course - to back me up in this, because I am quite confident that whoever is my successor will need such assistance. Some one has said something about the qualifications of the gentleman last under discussion, but I do not think I need enter into that question in the present case, except to say that the gentleman at present concerned has received far higher remuneration as acting-professor in the University in Tasmania. He was, until he gave up the position for this appointment lecturer on the law of property at the University of Sydney, and acted as examiner in jurisprudence and international law in that university. I will say one word more, to be frank. He belongs to the hated class of lawyers. I will only say on this topic that lawyers are very much misunderstood if they are called a corrupt class of the community. The fact is that there are among lawyers corrupt men, just as, God wot ! there are corrupt men everywhere else. The study of the law never made a man corrupt, but the study of the law has helped many a man already corrupt to be a greater nuisance to his neighbours. That is an absolute fact. If a man is naturally dishonest, his weapons of dishonesty are increased by learning something his neighbours do not know. But we must be just all round, and say that it is equally true of other callings and professions. Let us be fair to one another. When I asked this gentleman to take this appointment, as I have already explained, at a less, salary than he had been receiving for the last responsible work he had undertaken, I told him he need not count on this as a permanent appointment. I said, "I do not know that my successor will wish to have you ; a lot of the work is absolutely confidential, and it is inseparable that it should be so, and different Ministers have different views as to the man who possesses their confidence." </para>

                        <para>- Confidence in regard to the Commonwealth ; but, as the honorable member knows, if a man becomes your private secretary, you are apt to repose a great deal of confidence in him, while your, successor may not like a man in whom you have imposed personal confidence. It is inseparable that this personal " confidence should exist, and it is inseparable from that condition, that a successor may not desire to have the holder of your personal confidence. So far' as that is concerned, a gentleman of the qualifications of this one might very well look forward, if he chose to remain in the service, to have an equivalent appointment if he were not continued in his present position, and a Public Service Commissioner took what might appear to be a correct view of his duty. I have not said a word to this gentleman to cause him to think that this is a temporary appointment in the sense that he must go out with me, but I thought it a matter of honour to open his eyes to the prospect that he must not count on this as a permanent appointment, and I did so in. order that he might not enter the service of the Minister, or the Government, under a misapprehension. I thought that an honorable way in winch to treat him, and I expect, in that respect, as in others, to be sustained by the committee. </para>

                    <para>- I do not object at all to the Prime Minister having a private secretary, but on the plan which he has just put before the committee, it would seem that the granting to the Prime Minister of a private secretary amounts to a gradual filling of the public service, or a section of it, with gentlemen who at one time or another have been private secretaries to the different Prime Ministers who will fill the office during the next twelve or fifteen years. The right honorable and learned gentleman says that the probability is that the Public Service Commissioner who knew his duty would place the gentleman who is to be private secretary to the present Prime Minister somewhere in the public service, at an equivalent salary. </para>

                        <para>- That is an innocent misrepresentation, no doubt. It conveys the impression that what I meant was that this gentleman might be shovelled out of his position and put in another one in the public service simply because the succeeding Prime Minister did not want him. What I meant was that a gentleman of his qualifications - without vaunting them too much - would be quite fit for an equivalent position somewhere else in the public service. If he wished to continue in the service, and the Prime Minister wished to have for himself another public servant in the position, then it would be perfectly possible for the Public Service Commissioner to find that place for- him to which his abilities entitled him. I do not want to bs constantly interrupting my honorable friend, but I think that he placed too harsh a construction on what I have said. </para>

                        <para>- But we are considering now whether we should create the precedent of appointing private secretaries who are practically apart from the public service. I maintain that they should be of the public service. They should be officers picked at the Minister's discretion from the officers available, but they should be permanent officers of the service. Certainly the same man might not always be chosen to take the position, but I know that the private secretary of one Minister in the last administration but one in New South Wales was afterwards the private secretary of another Minister in the succeeding administration, and he was a very capable and trustworthy man in every respect. I believe he is now private secretary to another Minister in the Federal Government. There was an instance where two successive Ministers with different policies chose the same man because of his general fitness for the work. There was no attempt to run him out of the service as soon as the Minister who had appointed him had left. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. We should not take up the position which the Prime Minister thinks is a proper one, namely, that the Minister should be followed out of office by his private secretary. Apart from that, I do not consider that it is necessary to grant the. sum of £450 per year for the work that has to be performed by the private secretary of the Prime Minister or of any other Minister. It does not . seem to rae that the abilities required in the office justify the payment of such a large sum, and though I will not vote for the abolition of the office, I will vote for the reduction of the amount to not more than £250. I think all that is required can certainly be obtained for that sum, and the person to act as private secretary could be obtained from the officers already in the State services. But I want to move an amendment in relation to the first item in this subdivision. This item relates to the appointment of which I spoke yesterday afternoon - that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt. I desire only to say with respect to that suggested appointment that I quite agree with the view put forward by the honorable member for Wentworth that the House cannot expect to make appointments of this character. I quite agree with that, but I say that the House has a right to insist that a certain line of policy shall be followed in respect to such appointments. Without canvassing the qualifications of the individual particularly affected, I think that we can lay down that a certain policy shall be' followed with regard to all appointments where important work has to be carried out by the appointee. That line of policy, it seems to me, was well put by the honorable member for Wentworth when he said that the various State services should be exhausted in the search for experienced and capable men before the Government fall back upon men who may be capable but who undoubtedly have had no experience. That is the stand I take up in regard to this matter. I say that in this instance the State services were not exhausted. So far as I can glean, there was no attempt made to gather particulars of the qualifications of men in the various State services who might have been willing to take up a position of this importance. I do not know that any applications were invited from men in the existing services. My view is borne out by a chance remark which the Prime Minister made a little while ago. I wrote it down at the time, and it was to the effect that amongst those whose capacity he knew the right honorable and learned gentleman had appointed the man with most capacity. I ask why should the selection of a man to fill one of the most important offices in the service of the Commonwealth - that of permanent head of the Department of External Affairs, the largest and most important administration of all - be limited to those who happen to have the acquaintance of the Prime Minister <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The right honorable gentleman does not embrace amongst his acquaintances all the capable men and all the men with experience in the different States, and yet from the right honorable and learned gentleman himself we have practically had an admission that no opportunity was given to officers in the State services to make application for this important, onerous, and high position. On that ground alone I think that we have cause for complaint. I would just like to correct an apparent error into which the Prime Minister fell yesterday afternoon, in assuming that I had instituted a comparison between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran.</inline> I made no such comparison. I merely stated' that I did not object to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran's</inline> appointment, because it was practically a legal appointment. The work that he has to do is-, of &#60;x legal character, connected with the Attorney-General's Department. He will not have an extensive staff to organize, and he will be concerned with work in which' he has had a lot of experience, namely, that of drafting Bills for submission <inline font-style="italic">toParliament.</inline> But if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran</inline> had been appointed to a position such as that to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> has been appointed, I should have* raised exactly the same objection. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran</inline> has not had the experience to justify his selection for such an important position in preference to men who have had the experience, and who, in all probability, possess equal ability to discharge the duties.. I do not wish to detain the House at any great length, because I went into the matter last evening fairly fully. But I desire to test the feeling of honorable members as to whether they approve of mu. appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> - leaving Ins personality aside altogether - in preference to adopting the course of inviting applications from-, capable men throughout the various States, for this position. I take the ground that the Commonwealth is not likely to be so well served by the appointment of an inexperienced man as it would be if an experienced man were first given an opportunity of taking up the position. I move, with a view of testing the feeling of the House on the subject - </para>

It was said, and said more than once, last evening by the honorable member for Bland, that the gentleman who holds this office, and to whom he now very properly says no reference should be made by name was named Hunt, and that he had left the public service of New South Wales because there was retrenchment going on - that, he had resigned rather than be retrenched.

                        <para>- I perfectly understood that, and that was the sense in which I used the word " retrenched." The facts are these. He was offered an increase on his former salary. Whilst there was retrenchment going, on, there were also increases offered to deserving officers. The increase offered to him after his services did not seem to meet with his views, and he resigned, receiving three months' leave on full pay, with an allowance of £60 in addition, having made up his mind to retire about September in that year, in order to study for the bar. He resigned because the regulations for the admission of barristers, then in force, provided that no student at law could, during his studentship, be a clerk in a Government office. </para>

                    <para>- I propose to speak to the item which has given rise to the debate rather than to the amendment which has been moved. I regard myself as having been charged, so far as one voice and one vote can have effect, to see that proper economy is exercised in the expenditure of public money, and that the patronage necessarily at the disposal of the first Ministry of the Commonwealth is equitably and justly distributed. I am one of those who believe- that it is false economy to give inadequate remuneration for necessary services, and that if you require good, capable, brainy men you must pay them well. The man who has been tied down to an office by long years of experience usually gets into a groove from which it may be difficult to move him. So far as the distribution of patronage is concerned, 1 have felt that the Ministers have been compelled more or less to associate with themselves - because of the peculiarity of their individual positions - nien who were personally known to them, and whose habits and training suited their individual requirements. I could have hoped and wished that the ordinary processes of appointment which have been suggested might have been adopted, and that the positions might have been considered open to the members of the public service of the various States ; because I believe that in the public service of the States there are men of sufficient capacity and ability to fill any of them. But the Ministry have had to undertake the arrangement and organization of. new departments,.and unless we are prepared to accept the explanation which the Prime Minister has made to us, we must do what I cannot regard in any other light than the passing of a vote of want of confidence upon them. I am disposed to believe that they have done the best they could under the circumstances. In my opinion, the Prime Minister has made a perfectly straightforward statement as to the need for the appointment of these various officers, and has given adequate justification for the existence of their offices. I have no knowledge of the qualifications of the gentleman who has been appointed to the office which is now under the consideration of the committee ; but we have the distinct, clear, and emphatic statement of the Prime Minister that he is eminently and specially qualified for the position. The right honorable gentleman has practically said to the committee - "I know no other man who could so adequately and completely fill, the position as the gentleman, whom I' have appointed." I accept that assurance, although I regret that the Ministry have not given the public officers of the various States an opportunity to secure these lucrative and responsible positions. I hope, however, that the arrangement whereby a private secretary is to retire with the Minister whom he serves will not receive the sanction of this- committee. It is a practice which is foreign to the departmental arrangements of the States, and it is not a desirable one to introduce. The practice in the States has been to select from among the officers of a department one who is qualified to act as private secretary to the Minister at the head of it. Of course, a Minister must have as his private secretary some one whose habits and manners are congenial to him, and with whom he can have confidential relations. It is absurd . to suppose that any cut and dried official could come into confidential contact with a Minister. But notwithstanding the explanation which has been given, I do not understand whether the gentlemen who have been, or who will be, appointed are to come under the provisions of the Public Service Bill which we shall soon have to consider. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that Ministers will see that there is a very general feeling among honorable members against the creation of positions of this kind, and I think that it will be overcome if it is understood that these appointments are only provisional, and will not be made permanent until they have been considered by the authority which will be appointed by the Public Service Bill to control the Public Service of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that the Prime Minister desires to deal seriously with this question, because it affects a very large number of public servants in a very serious way. Our desire is to support the Government in the appointments which they have made, and I am prepared to accept the assurance of the Ministry that all these appointments are necessary. Honorable members are quite unaware at the present time what work has to be done by the various departments ; but I understood the Prime Minister to say that it was his intention to make these appointments only provisional, leaving, it to the authority to be created under the Public Service Bill to determine what appointments shall be permanent. That arrangement, I think, would be satisfactory to the majority of honorable members, and if it is made, I. shall have nothing more to say. I wish only to say that I desire to give a loyal support to the Government on this question. The Prime Minister has said that he requires this assistance, and so far as my vote goes he will receive it. I believe that unusual demands are made on the Prime Minister at the present time. He has special departments to organize, and very difficult work to carry through. The work will be inefficiently done unless the Prime Minister and the various Ministers in charge of other departments receive necessary assistance. I do not think economy is to be secured by cutting down necessary assistance, or by paying salaries such as will not attract the best and brainiest men, who are most necessary in this important point in the history of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to make a certain point clear. It would be an impossibility to leave all appointments to the Public Service Board. There must in the meantime be a public service for the Commonwealth, and gentlemen who have relinquished their positions in private professions or in the public service of the States must not be subjected to the suggested strain upon them. I spoke unthinkingly when I gave such an assurance, but after talking the matter over with the Treasurer, I must ask the indulgence of the House in regard to it. It would never do to say that these appointments must necessarily be made by the Public Service Board, under an Act which will provide, in regard to certain appointments, that they may begin with £40 a year. We could not have drawn men from a public service of a State, or from other positions, unless, in regard to the terms of employment, they could rely on the honour of this Commonwealth.Where I found, in such a case, that it was necessary for the honour of the Commonwealth that an appointment should be treated in a certain way, I did not hesitate to make the appointment in that way. I must, of course, take the responsibility of any appointments I have made. </para>

                    (Kooyong).- No one in this House will desire less than that honorable treatment should be meted out to every one who has been transferred from any other position to the service of this Commonwealth. If the Prime Minister or any of his Ministers have committed themselves to any of these gentlemen, I hope that the arrangements which have been made with them will be honorably respected. I am perfectly satisfied that the Prime Minister and the Cabinet will see that engagements honorably made are sustained.

I was not previously under that impression, and it was my intention to vote against this first item, because 1 held, I think rightly, that if we were to have a public service authority - call it board or commissioners or what you please - the appointments should be made by that authority, which should use every means in its power to obtain knowledge regarding the duties to be performed. I thought that body should fix the salaries and designate the officers. </para>

                        <para>- If the Treasurer believes that, let me tell him that, in my opinion, the Government could have got just as good men if no permanent appointments had been made. I know many able men who would have been glad to have the salary and position attached to the offices under this Government, and who were perfectly competent to carry out the duties. I refer to men who have been trained in the work that will have to be done : for gentlemen occupying these positions must have some knowledge. A mistake has been made owing to the precipitancy of the . Ministers responsible for these particular appointments. It was not necessary to snap up these officers in order to avail ourselves of their services. I believe that better men are available at the present moment. But under the circumstances I do not feel disposed to express what would virtually be a want of confidence in the Government. I regret it exceedingly, and think that I have been placed in a false position by the Government. </para>

                    <para>- I should not attempt to add to this debate were it not that I am placed in a peculiar position by having a very long and intimate knowledge of the gentleman whose name has been brought into the debate. It seems to me that strictly speaking we should deal only with the advisability of appointing a* secretary for this department, irrespective of any particular person ; but a great many honorable members have thought fit to bring into the question the personality of the man who is known to be contemplated as the officer to fill the position. 1 have heard many remarks made concerning him, obviously by people who are not acquainted with him. If some officer from the civil service of one or other of the States is not to be appointed to this position, and if some outside man is to be brought in, I have no hesitation in saying that, having been acquainted for twenty years with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt, he is a man of very remarkable ability. So far from having been retrenched out of or dismissed from the public service of New South Wales, he used the public service - which lie was perfectly entitled to do, and as many in this House have done - as a first step to a very honorable career. He was not satisfied to live for the whole of his life as a public servant of the country, but used the service as a stepping-stone to the bar. I believe that at one time he hoped that he might even rise to a seat on the bench. He studied for years after leaving the service, at great deprivation to himself, acting as a coach to men working for the bar or going through a University career. He went to the bar of New South Wales, and did remarkably well there. I have no hesitation in saying that in taking this position in the Federal Public Service he is giving up considerable opportunities and a good outside professional income. </para>

                        <para>- I have not only known <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt casually, but professionally. He was acting with me in a very large arbitration case in New South Wales, lasting two and a half years. Acting as his senior at the bar, I had more than ordinary opportunities of discovering his abilities, and I have no hesitation in applying the word able to him - an adjective which I reserve for very rare occasions. He is a man of great intellectual capacity, wide reading, considerable logical ability, has a remarkable grasp of mind for his age, and, as I have said, he is thoroughly worthy of the position which he has been selected to fill. I say so much, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> because there are a few honorable members who cannot have been thoroughly satisfied with the statements made as to this gentleman's ability. I speak from personal knowledge ; and although I think the personality of these gentlemen should not be brought into the debate at this stage, I can say that the Commonwealth Public Service will be fortunate in getting Mi1. Atlee Hunt in a position that commands no greater salary than £S00 a year. </para>

                        <para>- The position of a number of honorable members sitting near me is, that we understood from the Prime Minister that this committee in passing the Estimates to-night, was not doing anything to confirm any of the positions which had been made - that we were doing nothing to compromise Parliament or the country in regard to expressing unreservedly our ideas at any future time regarding any of the positions that have been filled. But evidently we are not in a position to express any opinion at the present time. All we can do is follow the Government, with every confidence, tentatively. That is what I thought we were doing on a recent vote, when in response to a question put to him as to whether any claim could fairly be made by these officers to retain their positions in consequence of a vote of this committee, I understood the right ' honorable and learned gentleman to say that he would be no party co supporting any such claim. I gave my vote upon that assurance, and I know that a number of honorable members around me did the same. But now we are told that a bargain has been made, and that the honour of the Commonwealth may be at stake if these gentlemen are not retained in their positions, come what may. If a bargain has been made, and if the honour of the Commonwealth has been pledged, it must be kept ; but I feel very much embarrassed if that is so, because by that means we are deprived of what is our right and our duty. </para>

If these undertakings were given by the Government they were given by a Government that had not the support of any Parliament at all. Whatever was done ought to have been done in the most provisional manner. If the appointments have, been mad§, no doubt that action has been taken with the best intentions, and with the sole desire of advancing the interests of the Commonwealth ; but, at the same time, I feel that an error has been, made, and I am embarrassed. However, I hope that a free hand may yet be given to the House, as we were assured would be the case. If not I regret it, and I believe we should not be led further into that position than the necessities of the case demand. </para>

                    (Northern Melbourne).I feel very much in the same position as the honorable and learned member for Indi. I got the assurance from the Prime Minister that there was no contract, and would be no contract, which would bind us in the least to treat the offices or the officers as permanent j because they are two distinct things. I- was strongly inclined to give the Government absolute credit in this matter, and since they felt the appointment to be essentia], to let them have it and treat it as provisional, leaving experience to show whether or not the office ought to be permanent. We do not know what the conditions- are to be. We do not know what the department will require, and I object to the creation of a permanent office until the proper authority, the board or commissioners, have gone into the question and seen what officers are required. I voted on the previous occasion in favour of the Government in regard to the matter ; but I shall be bound to vote in favour of not having this appointment made if the question be pressed to a division, though I should like to help the Government to have the services of this gentleman, of whose capabilities no one has any doubt, and to help them to have a gentleman handy to give any help they want. I object to the creation of permanent offices at thé inception of the Commonwealth, until we find by some experience what officers will be required. This is not so much a question of the officer as a question of. the office. It is not so much a question of this particular office, which I think will be permanent, as a question of other offices which are very much in the same position. For instance, I am not. sure that the office of secretary to the Vice-President of the Council will be permanent.

                    <para>- There apparently has been some misapprehension with regard to this matter. But when the Government made- these appointments, they were practically forced to do so. They had to make the appointments at once, or at any rate they had to make some appointments at once. Surely we cannot be told that the Prime Minister, to obtain his principal officers, should have hunted round the State departments and borrowed officers temporarily. He had to make appointments,. which, practically, if the officers showed ability and fitness for the positions, would be permanent appointments. That was what was done, and if we look at the number of these appointments </para>

                        <para>- No, they have not. We would not make any permanent appointment until we had the confidence of the House, until after the Address in Reply had been agreed to. But these gentlemen might be found to be excess officers, and that seems to be the difficulty some honorable members see. Honorable members say that while the appointments may be necessary now because of the press of work, they may not be necessary in three or four years. That is dealt with in the Public Service Bill itself. It is provided in clause 8 : - </para>

                <para class="block">Surely that is sufficient protection. The provision is that if officers are in excess in any department <inline font-style="italic">they</inline> may be transferred to some other department where their services can be utilized, and where they are required ; but if it be found they are in excess in their department, power is also reserved by the Bill- and no doubt the power will be given by the House - to the Government of the day, to call on them to retire. As these gentlemen are not appointed with any pension rights, they may be called upon to retire without compensation. Surely this meets the difficulty "felt by the honorable member for Northern Melbourne and the honorable member for Indi. These honorable members feel that these . officers may possibly in a few months or a few years be found to be excess officers ; but if they are found to be so, there is ample power in the Bill to remove them. </para>

                    that the explanation of the Treasurer does not meet my difficulty. I opposed theFegan appointment upon the one ground amongst others that for such a position the State departments should have been drawn on for a suitable man before any attempt was made to fill the appointment from outside sources. Had that been done, the difficulty, which is placing the Ministry in an awkward position now as to the permanence of the appointments, might have been overcome. It is absurd to say the State Governments would not have been perfectly ready to give the chance of promotion to any suitable officer in their service - to allow their services to be used for a given period until the Commonwealth Parliament confirmed the appointment, and to undertake to replace him in his office if the Government did not see fit to give the. confirmation.

                    would have been a small matter for all the State Governments. This is only another evidence of the justice of what lias been advocated on behalf of the public services of the States - namely, not that the selection should have been made from those services, but that the Commonwealth Government should have gone there if competent officers were there to be had. But presuming, as we must presume, that such competent officers are available in those services - I do not mean the heads of State departments, but officers who, owing to circumstances, have not reached the heads - if the suggestion had been acted upon the difficulty would have been overcome. I do not say that the difficulties connected with the appointment are at all what they were in the Fegan case ; but this objection was one I raised to the appointment, and I must follow my objection by my vote on this occasion. I would point out to the Ministry what an amiable and considerate Opposition they have. This amendment, if it be anything at all, is a motion of censure, and, if it be carried, .must be accepted as such by the Government.

                    <para>- The honorable gentleman is right, because this is not a motion for the reduction of the remuneration of the office. It has been expressly declared by the honorable member for Bland, who moved the amendment, that it is a reflection on the appointment made by the Ministry ; and if the amendment be carried no Government could continue to hold office in the face of such a reflection. Strange to say, the amendment has come from a supporter of the Government, and I only say again that the Ministry have reason to thank the Opposition for their consideration. </para>

                    <para>- I am somewhat puzzled as to what attitude to take in respect tot this matter. A few moments ago we had a statement from the Prime Minister that these appointments were to be subjected to review by the Public Service Board when appointed. Within five minutes the right honorable gentleman found that he had to explain to, I think, the member for Kennedy that he had made a mistake, and that the Government were distinctly pledged, and the honour of the Commonwealth was distinctly pledged, to maintain in their position many of those officers on the ground that they had in some instances relinquished positions either in other States or in their various businesses. Subsequently to that we have the Treasurer getting up again and taking up the position which was first taken by the Prime Minister, but changed in a moment - the position that the appointments are only temporary, and subject to the review of the Public Service Board when appointed. </para>

                        <para>- Precisely ; I followed very closely both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. But if the honour of the Commonwealth is involved in these appointments, are we to consider that if the appointments are found to be unnecessary in a few years time, it will be a mere matter of having to find other positions in some other branch of the Commonwealth service for those gentlemen ? If that be so we immediately revive the_ question of the necessity of economy in our federal appointments. What we on this side of the House - or some of us, at any rate - would like to know from the Treasurer is the exact attitude the Government intend to take in regard to these appointments. AVe would like the Prime- Minister or the Treasurer to say at once whether the Government intend to stick to those gentlemen whom they have appointed and who have left other positions to take those federal appointments. </para>

                    MCMILLAN (Wentworth). - I must say that any honorable member - at least I may speak for myself - who has listened to this debate cannot help feeling that an entirely new issue has been sprung on us during the last hour. In the first place, the honorable member who has moved what is practically a vote of censure - for that is what it amounts to - intended to do it, because he considered that the appointment to this position should be made out of the public services of Australia, and not given to a gentleman who, while he was in the public service at one time, has not been so for several years. Since then a certain number of gentlemen, principally from the other side, have laid down the principle that the Government gave in some way or other a distinct pledge that no appointment would be made by them of a permanent character. I did understand in all fairness - because, after all, I think we are here to deal fairly with every public question, no matter on what side of the House we may be - that when certain appointments were bruited abroad some months ago, it was said, and very properly said, that until the Government had become constitutionally a Government or Ministry by a vote of confidence in this House, they were not justified in making any permanent appointment. That has been absolutely adhered to. The only thing I regret to-night is the uncertain voice of the Government. They have practically pledged themselves to these gentlemen, and there is no use shilly-shallying over it by any subterfuge regarding the question whether the commissioner, under a Bill which may or may not be passed, will interfere with these appointments. These appointments are made, and I must say, although it may appear to be against the interests of my own side, dealing particularly with this question, that I do not see how the Government of the Commonwealth could have been carried on without certain permanent appointments being made. Furthermore, on the very principle that we have laid down that these gentlemen should be taken, if possible, from the public services of the States, I ask how could we take them from the public services of the States unless they had first resigned their positions in those services

                        <para>- I can quite understand their being borrowed during the first few months, and until this Ministry had a proper mandate after a vote of this House. But I must say that this is a new phase of the question, and I do not intend for one moment to be led away by it. The question that was really before this House, and which was raised by the motion of the honorable member .for Bland, was simply that this gentleman did not belong to any branch of the public service of Australia when the appointment was made. Now I would like to deal entirely with the principle involved. I have previously said that I believed that the Prime Minister in making the appointment should first have exhausted the public services of the States, and then if he could not get a suitable man in those services, he was perfectly free to go outside of them. </para>

                        <para>- It comes to this after all : that if we are to have an Executive Government - and we must have an Executive Government - then we must trust that Executive Government. We lay down these general rules for the Prime Minister, but we must trust to his unfettered judgment with regard to the carrying of them out. At the same time, if we find that he has been recreant to that policy, that an absolutely incapable or dishonest person, or a person whose antecedents . unfit him for the position, has been appointed, if we find that we have any flagrant charge against any individual, upon which we can lay a charge against the Government, I should be the first to take up that position in this House. But -although there may be something reprehensible in this appointment, although we feel that it might have been better and safer for the Prime Minister to take some one from the Public Service, I fail to see, taking -the abilities of this man, and the circumstances surrounding his case, into consideration, that we can make out any indictment sufficient to justify us in absolutely passing a vote of censure upon that appointment. In the position I occupy, acting as I do for a gentleman who I am sorry is not in his place, I say that, although I see a certain movement on the other side of the House, I do not think it would be right for me to sink my principles and my feelings in order to snatch a victory. </para>

                    <para>- No one objects to the honorable member for Wentworth sinking his feelings upon this occasion, and nobody who knows him expects' that he would do otherwise. But I hope that he will not object to some of us expressing our 'feelings upon a matter of this kind. I may say at once that I share the opinion of the honorable member for Bland, who moved this amendment. I do so for several reasons. I think that this House has never had presented a greater spectacle of a divided Ministry, or a Ministry which does not seem to know its own mind, than has been exhibited to-night in this Chamber. We were told the other evening by th Attorney-General that no appointments had been made to -the public service. We were told by the Prime Minister this evening that the Ministry was going to submit these appointments for the review of the Public Service Commissioner when appointed.. Within ten minutes the right honorable and learned gentleman, the leader of the Government, was again upon his feet saying that he had made a mistake, that the Government were going to make these appointments, and were bound to stick to them. How are we to know definitely the opinions df the Ministry on any subject if that is the way they are going to talk? I venture to say that the Government ought to have felt more sure of their ground than to talk in the way they did. Either the appointments are good or they are not. If they are good, why do not the Ministry say definitely that they made those appointments and would stick to them ? That would be the manly and straightforward course to take. It was left, however, for some one to be told last night that the Government were not -going to make these appointments definitely, and then gradually and tortuously we have been informed that the Government were committed to these gentlemen and -would make the appointments permanent. Regarding the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt,</inline> I place that in exactly the same category as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Fegan's appointment. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Fegan's  appointment was a political one, and as such received the strong reprobation of the whole continent, equally so is the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Atlee</inline> Hunt a political one. We in ' New 'South Wale know well the reason for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt's</inline> appointment. It is of no use beating about the bush. We know that what led the Prime Minister to turn instinctively to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> had been in relations of confidence with that gentleman in connexion with the getting through of the Commonwealth Bill in the State of New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> was the secretary of the federal organization, and naturally the Prime Minister would look to a gentleman of that kind as being suitable in the first place to be his private secretary, and as being qualified and eligible to move up into the higher position now allocated to him. In regard to some of the other appointments, it seems strange that all the gentlemen who have received those appointments should have stood in the same category in relation to the federal committee in Sydney and to the Commonwealth Bill. Some honorable members on this side of the House, notably the honorable and learned member for Parkes, have been upon terms of intimacy with this gentleman. No doubt that honorable member was impressed with his ability, but it is of no use trying to .make the committee believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> is the only man fitted for the position which he now occupies. The Prime Minister knows very well that he could have put his hands on a dozen men in the public service -of New South Wales who would have eagerly sought and just as eagerly accepted such an appointment if the opportunity had been offered them. We were told by the honorable member for Laanecoorie that the same remark exactly applies to the Victorian service, and indeed to the-public services of the whole continent. These nien have a right to complain against the action of the Government in that they have given away the choice appointments - for they will prove to be the plums of the public service - without consulting or considering them in the matter at all. To-day 1 was reading a report of last night's proceedings, and I saw a little sentence which the Prime Minister let drop, relating to the public service. It was anything, it seemed to me, but of a complimentary character. The right honorable and learned gentleman went out of his way to mention that many public servants had tried to kill the Commonwealth Bill. It struck me as a peculiar utterance to come from the Prime Munster of the Commonwealth, in connexion with a discussion such as is now taking place. I shall vote with the honorable member who moved this amendment for two reasons. In the first place, I think this appointment should have been filled from the public services of the continent. I have nothing against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> personally. I know very little of him, and what little I do know is to his credit. But I do say that in the difficulties in which the Government found themselves they should have instinctively turned to the various State services to find these temporary officers, knowing that it would be an anomaly to appoint officers temporarily, and then discharge them the moment the Commonwealth was properly inaugurated. To 'hear the Prime Minister stating that these appointments will come within the purview of the Public Service ' Commissioner when appointed is a mere trifling with the question. If these officers are to be bandied about in that way it will not be fair to them. If they received these appointments at the hands of the Government, the Government will not be men if they allow the Public Service Commissioner to turn them adrift at his own sweet will. Either the appointments are right, or they are not. If the appointments are right, the Government should stick to them, believing them to have been made in perfect good faith. But in the first place I say that every means should have been exhausted to secure suitable men from the public services of the States. In the next place I shall vote against this appointment because I believe it to be a purely political one, equally a political appointment with that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan.</inline></para>

                    <para>- I will follow the -course suggested by the honorable member for Wentworth. I think that the conditions were somewhat exceptional during the last six months. There was no transferred department taken over by the Prime Minister. I find that under the Constitution, as we all know already, the appointment of officers was left in the hands - until Parliament declared to the contrary - of the Ministry for the time being. What is the Prime Minister to do <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> Acting under the provisions of the Constitution Act, he created the department of External Affairs. There was no permanent secretary to transfer, because there was no department of External Affairs to transfer, so that the right honorable member had to appoint some one to take up the duties which would otherwise have been performed by a permanent secretary. He, therefore, appointed a secretary, and we are now asked to say that, in doing so, he acted wrongly. I should like to know what any other honorable member would have done under the circumstances <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> This is . not a new office ; it is an office to which there is no analogy in any of the State departments. </para>

                        <para>- The appointment is a political one, although the services rendered were services in the cause of federation. Certainly nothing has been said to lead the House to believe that the gentleman who has been appointed is the only person who possessed the special qualifications necessary for the organisation and control of a new and important department of State. But, presumably because the antecedents in this case are - of the right character, we are asked to allow this appointment to pass unchallenged. I am certain, however, that it will be regarded by the bulk of the people of Australia as in many respects analogous to the proposed appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan,</inline> and that' they will believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan</inline> was rejected because it was considered that his antecedents unfitted him for the position. If the Ministry had consented to allow this appointment to come under the review of the tribunal to be appointed by the Public Service Bill for the administration and control of the public service, I should have been satisfied. I do not want to embarrass the Government, but I do not want to be placed in the position of justifying to some extent the practical desertion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan</inline> by acquiescing in the appointment of another gentleman under similar circumstances. </para>

                    <para>- I feel that I cannot give a silent vote on this question, though I shall not trouble the committee with many remarks. It is manifest that the carrying of the amendment would amount to the passing of a vote of censure upon the Government, and that Ministers, would resign office to-morrow. I am a friend of the Administration, although my allegiance is being put to a strain, because I do not agree with their actions in this matter, and I cannot compliment them upon the contradictory statements which have been made to-night. But I recognise that we are not to punish our friends for slight mistakes. A man may quarrel with his wife, but he does not turn her out of doors.When I first heard that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> had been appointed to this high office, I felt extremely surprised and very much annoyed, because I thought that if there was one  principle more than another by which the Federal Government should stand, it was the principle of promoting officers of the State services to positions in the Common wealth service, instead of appointing outsiders. The main objection which 1 had to the proposed appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan</inline> was, not that he was incapable, not that he had been a miner, but that he was not connected with the public service of the State. As I have said, I cannot congratulate the Government upon the many and contradictory statements which have been made to-night. It would have been better if they had said-" We have appointed these men, and we intend to stick to them." If they had said that, they would have found their friends rally round them. I think, however, that we may congratulate the Ministry upon the absence of the leader of the Opposition, because if he had been here he would have . taken full advantage of the opportunity which this appointment would have afforded him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Hunt, too, is very fortunate in having friends on the opposition side of the chamber as well as on the Government side. I have no word to say against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt,</inline> and I accept the statement of the honorable and learned member for Parkes that he is most capable, and highly worthy of the position which he holds. My objection to his appointment - and I think it is an objection which honorable members generally take - is on the ground that he was not promoted from the public service of a State. But, though I think my friends have made a mistake, I am not such a pumpkin as to vote against them on a motion such as this. </para>

                        <para>- In that case I would draw the attention of honorable members to the fact that there are three other appointments which have been made by the Government to which the same objection applies Instead of there being one appointment there are no less than four. If these things come up as isolated facts, it is very difficult indeed to challenge an Executive; but if the committee regard the matter as a whole, and say that these four appointments which have been made from outside the ' public service do not meet with our approval, inasmuch as the public services of" the States have not been searched, we shall be taking a proper course. </para>

                    <para>- 1 regret that there has been so much discussion of a very personal- character. For my own part I can see nothing to which exception can be taken in the fact that some of the gentlemen who have been appointed did active service in the cause of federation. But I quite agree with those honorable members who look to the public service as it exists as the first field from which appointments should be made. I feel that as strongly as any one can do ; and ' my vote will be largely influenced by an explanation which I hope will be made by the Prime Minister in answer to a simple question. There has been some contradiction as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt has or has not been appointed. Under the Public Service Bill now before the House it is possible for Ministers to make temporary appointments. Under clause 26, these appointments are open to revision, and under clause 27 they are open to confirmation, in the event of its being certified that no equally efficient officer can be found from inside the service. The Treasurer has said that these appointments will be open to review by the commission or board, and may be made permanent appointments. </para>

                        <para>- I have always said that the appointments so far are temporary appointments. I repeat that, as it is necessary to make matters clear. All these appointments have been made as temporary appointments, although they have been made, so far as I had anything to do with them, with the assurance that I should endeavour to make them permanent appointments when the opportunity arose. I said, however, that I could not undertake to do that until this Government had passed through the stage when its constitutional position could be challenged by the Opposition. I said that when we had passed through that stage I thought it would be the duty of the Government to make the appointments permanent. Now, a position has arisen in which I made a certain statement. That was, that I would submit these appointments, to the Public Service Commissioner. I told honorable members a few minutes ago that I made that statement inadvertently, and without having regard to the proper position of the matter. Having asked these gentlemen to take posts which involved in many cases their relinquishing their means of livelihood, I cannot consent to put them in a position in which they might be subject to the act of the Public Service Commissioner, who would be entitled to say that noone should be in the public service unless he entered at <inline font-style="italic">£i0</inline> a year. It is impossible for a self-respecting Government to take that course. It is impossible for a self respecting Parliament not to maintain a Government in a position such as we have* adopted. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the clerical staff. But there is something more to be considered than that. I have before now asserted that there is no legal obligation upon this Parliament when the next Estimates come up to prevent honorable members from taking their own course with regard to any appointments. That is what </para>

                <para class="block">I intended to refer to when I spoke of the obligation as a moral obligation. I am only asking this committee to follow the Ministry in respect of their constitutional responsibility to Parliament and to the continent of Australia. We were left in this position : that we must have some kind of a public service, and we could not have an efficient one even for the intervening time - which has been a serious and important time, largely absorbing the labours and abilities of those in the service of the Government - if we said to the gentlemen whom we employed - " You will take these as temporary appointments, and we do not think that Parliament will sustain us in what we do." We could not say such a thing as that. Every honorable member will see that. But does not the course some honorable members recommend place us in that position ? We have had to look for men whom we considered properly competent to do the work. We selected those men - rightly or wrongly. If we selected them wrongly, a vote of this House can tell us so ; and that is a vote of censure. There is no way of escaping from that conclusion, and I am the last of all Ministers to endeavor to escape from it. I fully recognise the seriousness' of the position ; I fully recognise the effect of what the honorable member for Bland has done, and I take the responsibility personally for what I have done. As Prime Minister, I am responsible for every appointment made, whether I actually had anything to do with it or not. But I say more than that - that in making appointments such as I have made, albeit they were temporary, I had to give the assurance, before I could come to terms with those gentlemen whom I considered fit to fill the positions, that in my opinion those appointments would be confirmed by Parliament. If 1 had not said that, what honorable and self-respecting man would have taken service under us ? I would ask any honorable member what honorable and self-respecting man would have taken a position in the Commonwealth service unless 1 had said that 1 believed that Parliament would follow the lead of the Government in making the appointments permanent? They have been made as temporary appointments. It does not matter to the Government - speaking with all respect - whether Parliament approves of the action they have taken or not. So far as the moral obligation of Ministers goes, they are bound to follow out what follows from the moral obligation; they are bound, when the Public Service Bill becomes law, to apply that measure to the existing public service. The Government have carried out their obligations as far as they can carry them out, but they are bound to submit these officers, as existing officers in the public service, to the consequences of the Public Service Act. It may involve a regrading of their positions, which regrading, whenever it occurs, will be final, unless the Government is prepared to take the responsibility of refusing to accept the recommendations of the Public Service Commissioner, and chooses to lay the papers on the table, and to ask for the judgment of the House, which, if given against them, will sustain the Public Service Commissioner in his position. That far I am content to go ; but as a constitutional Minister I will not leave these people in a precarious tenure of their offices, after the relinquishment of their other employments. I cannot see that that would be honorable to the country ; and I say that the public opinion of this country will sustain me in every word I am now stating. I will not submit - not because of any disrespect towards this House, but because I respect the citizens of Australia too much - to be told that a Government is not to have this little bit of authority, which carries with it consequent responsibility, in an intervening period, during the trials and troubles of which we have successfully steered the Commonwealth to some purpose. Therefore, I ask that this committee will not refuse to ratify what we have done. I shall know what to do if the committee does refuse. In respect to the officers under discussion, it is the duty of the Government to appoint them to their offices, and to make them permanent as far as the Executive can do so, leaving them after that to the operation of the Public Service Act, under which their classification and their duties can be properly assigned to them. If they are found to be excess officers, after a time of course they can be dealt with as such. They will then be removed from the public service. If, on the other hand, they are found not to be competent, they can be dealt with by being placed in other positions. But they are entitled to the impartial judgment of the Public Service Commissioner, and when that judgment has been passed, the Government also is entitled to take a certain course. The Government must submit to the judgment of this House, which judgment I will cheerfully accept. Under these circumstances, I believe honorable members will see that we are taking the only honorable and upright course, which is the one I am resolved to adopt. </para>
                <para class="block"> Mr.F. E. McLEAN (Lang).- I regret that the right honorable and learned gentle man at the head of the Government has placed the House in a position in which there must be a definite vote taken on the amendment moved by the honorable member for Bland. I had some hope that, on mature consideration, the right honorable and learned gentleman would have seen that it was the right of the committee to decide that these appointments should come under the review of the Public Service Board. I believe that the Prime Minister has shown commendable loyalty to those whom he has appointed in announcing his willingness to stand by them and by the consequences of his action. I thoroughly appreciate the spirit of loyalty he has shown in that respect. But I submit that there is an obligation to the committee as well as an obligation of loyalty to those whom the -right honorable and learned gentleman has appointed to these positions. We are laying the foundation of a great Commonwealth, and - trying to avoid a great many of the mistakes which have been made in the past. At the very foundation of the Commonwealth the committee has been asked to adopt a public service measure for the express purpose of preventing the evils of political patronage from creeping into these appointments. I admit that it was necessary for the appointments to be made, but we were persistently told in the public press that they were only provisional appointments. Not provisional in. the sense in which the right honorable and learned gentleman has now defined that term ; we were not told that they were provisional only until the Government had survived the Address in Reply. We were further told in the press that the Government .would deal with such appointments by means of the Public Service Board. </para>

                <para>Mr.F. E. McLEAN.- I do not think those "inspired paragraphs " have emanated from mendacious persons, but whether they have or not, I want to lay down very clearly the position that the right honorable gentleman could have conserved all the best interests of the Government, of Parliament, and of the Commonwealth, by having those appointments made provisionally, until such time as the Public Service Board was constituted, and enabled to review them. It is nonsense to tell the committee that gentlemen of ability and character could not be obtained to take those appointments provisionally. I have no personal objection whatever - and I say so straight away, though I differ from a great many on my own side of the House in this respect - to the gentleman whose salary is attacked. I have a very high opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt, and I do not for a moment lay down the extreme principle that these appointments should be made from the existing public services of the States. I do not go so far, but I say that when we propose to place the whole administration of the public service under a non-political commissioner, we have no right to give the prize offices into the hands of Ministers, however much we may' trust and respect them - we have no right to give them the first appointments and the most lucrative and most responsible positions to distribute before the Public Service Board is called into existence. ' The affairs of the Commonwealth could have been provisionally conducted either by officers borrowed from the States or by gentlemen provisionally appointed. I have no doubt that even the gentleman who occupies this office would have been very glad to add one more to his splendid services to the cause of federation by filling it provisionally until such time as <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> proper appointment could be made by the Public Service Board. I take up the position that we have no right as a Commonwealth at this stage to depart from the great principle that these appointments should be non-political, and we have no right to take away from the board or commission it is proposed to appoint under the Public Service BUI their most sacred and responsible functions. These appointments could even now, at the eleventh hour, be made provisional appointments, subject to ratification by the Public Service Board. From the very fact that these gentlemen were willing to take positions on the understanding that they were . provisional, until the Ministry had survived their first parliamentary ordeal, is it not probable that they would have taken the positions on the understanding that they were subject to ratification by a board to be appointed by Parliament? </para>

                        <para>- We have been led by the right honorable gentleman to understand that they took their appointments provisionally with pledges that the Government would stand by them - that they were only temporary appointments until Parliament had met and the Ministry had been placed constitutionally in office. If they took their provisional appointments on that understanding, is it unreasonable to suppose they would have taken a somewhat longer provisional appointment until the Public Service Board had been constituted, and its powers exercised? I think the right honorable gentleman is forcing many of us into the position of voting on this amendment when we would sooner not. I do not want to vote on the amendment because, as I have said before, I have a very high opinion of the gentleman whose merits have been so freely discussed. I do not think the Committee ought to be called , on to discuss the merits of these gentlemen. We are creating a Public Service Board to save the Government and Parliament the invidious task of deciding on the merits of the men who hold public offices. But we are forced into the position that we must vote on the amendment moved by the honorable member for Bland, and I will vote with the honorable member unless the Government is prepared to regard these appointments as provisional until the Public Service Board is constituted. </para>

It seems to me that until those who have objected to the appointment have some grounds showing that the Government have made a corrupt and improper appointment, we must accord to the Government our confidence in their exercise of the function that the Constitution Act vests in them. We have talked for several hours, and have not arrived at any light on the subject. All sorts of confused ideas have been put forward, but, after all, unless we can show clearly that the Government have acted improperly, we ought to give them our support. </para>

                    (Werriwa).- I understand a declaration has been made by the Premier to the effect that he regards this as a vote of censure. I have been absent from the chamber for about 25 minutes, and did not know the state of affairs, but in the meantime I thought it was merely a question as to the reduction of the salary of a particular office, and looking at this strictly as a salary for an office, I should have given my support to the Government. But the moment the Government ask us to support them because they made the appointment outside of the civil services of the various States, it becomes an entirely different matter. On looking through the list I find that no fewer than four of the appointments are altogether from outside the civil services. That is to say, the civil services of the various States have never been examined or looked into in order to obtain suitable men for the appointment. Seeing that, I have no alternative but to say that the conduct of the Government in making four appointments of the sort is entirely wrong ; and I must therefore record my vote against them.

                <para class="block">Minister's Department. The reasons which the right honorable and learned gentleman at the head of the Government gave were very cogent, but the same reasons will not apply to the other departments. It is no use "urging that there is a necessity for private secretaries on account of the confidential relations which exist between the Minister and that official, because such confidential relations have existed in the past between State Ministers and their Under-Secretaries, and these relations have terminated on the retirement of the Minister from office, and have been commenced <inline font-style="italic">de novo</inline> with a new Minister. I can see no reason therefore why we should not have a permanent officer of the civil service as secretary to the Prime Minister. The officer would be secretary to successive Prime Ministers, who would thereby benefit by the experience which the official had gained in the public service. My objection to this item will entirely vanish if we change the designation of the officer in question, so as to get rid of the personal element. We had better make the office a permanent one. Such an officer would be of great value to the succeeding Prime Ministers, and the salary provided I think is quite small. In fact the salaries payable to these high officers of the public service have rather surprised me. Ministers have been very moderate in the amounts allocated to the various offices. I move - </para>

I will not detain the House by again recounting the reasons why I do this. With regard to the qualifications of the gentleman who is likely to hold this office I will say nothing, except that in the State of Victoria there is a private secretary whom I know well, and who occupies the position of a fifth class clerk in the Public Service.

                        <para>- I am not quite sure. The gentleman I am referring to gets an annual salary of £200, and a gratuity of £35 a year for acting as private secretary. For his £200 a year he does the departmental work, and for the £35 he performs all the work incidental to the private secretaryship of one of the largest departments in the State of Victoria. Regarding his qualifications I may say that he has been a member of the public service for something like twelve years, he is a graduate of the Melbourne University, a Bachelor of Arts, and a Bachelor of Laws. He has done splendid service in consolidating our land laws, he is an expert shorthand writer, and also uses the typewriter to perfection. </para>

But I will not agree that the services which he renders to the Minister for whom he acts as private secretary are worth anything like £450 per annum. . In fact these services are put down at £35 per annum. There is another matter to which I desire to direct attention. We are told that these secretaries will be brought under the Public Service Act. But how will they be brought under that Act <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> By being exempted, I presume, from some of its provisions.

                    TURNER (Balaclava Treasurer). - It has not been my practice to rise after each honorable member has spoken, and thus have to make half a dozen speeches ; I prefer to reply to the whole discussion in one speech. No doubt" £10,000 is a considerable sum, but we all know that the occasion was an exceptional one, and that the Commonwealth Ministers were bound to let the visitors see that they were prepared to entertain their guests in a proper manner. There may have been some few hitches, but. hitches are almost unavoidable in such a large entertainment. I venture to say, however, that the opening ceremony and the concert in the evening reflected credit on those who had control of the arrangements.

                        <para>- Yes ; because the accounts have not all come in yet. So far as I know, the actual amount expended' will prove to be between £8,000 and £9,000 ; but it is impossible to estimate it exactly until all the accounts have come in. I believe that the officers who had charge of the arrangements have endeavoured to keep down the expenditure as much as possible. Not only were there the entertainments on the opening day to pay for ; the expenses of a number of persons who were here as guests of the Commonwealth are responsible for a considerable portion of the amount. </para>

                        <para>- I mean to say that if the same judgment as was shown in making the appointments in connexion with those proceedings has been shown in connexion with the appointments to the Federal Public Service, it will be a bad thing for the Commonwealth. There is not a single member who does not know this. As federal members if we were there for anything at all, we were there to take our places properly. It was our ceremony, but it was not so regarded. It was regarded as a ceremony in which one, or two, or half a dozen Ministers might exercise their favour by putting their friends in different positions from those occupied by Members of Parliament. </para>

I desire to draw the attention of Ministers to this matter, because I think that some explanation should be forthcoming. I know that I had to go about in a way that was very unpleasant indeed.

                        <para>- I expected the Ministry to appoint men who would take care that things were properly done. If the officers whom_they are appointing now pay as little care and attention to their duties, it will be a very bad thing for every one. I consider that it was the duty of the Prime. Minister, as he was there, to exercise some supervision. I desire to draw attention to the fact that in the expenditure of this large sum of money more care might have been exercised in the management of the proceedings. I know that I saw a good many men placed right at the back, though it was true that this generally happened to new men, who were supposed not to be acquainted with what was due to them. I noticed, however, that 40 or 50 personal friends or acquaintances of the Prime Minister and other Ministers had their places, 'while the wives of members were away at the back. </para>

                        <para>- Some of the Ministers well know that it took place. It was my first experience of parliamentary life ; but I knew enough of the ordinary courtesies of life to take care that attention should be drawn to it. Of course there were many expenses in connexion with a ceremony "like that which could not be avoided. "We are told that the actual expenditure may prove to be less than the amount we are being asked to vote, and of course we are glad to hear that the sum set down is not likely to be exceeded. I would not have taken any action in stinting the Government in regard to the expenditure on that occasion; and I rose simply to object to the manner in which the proceedings were conducted, and to the want of care bestowed upon them by the Prime Minister. </para>

                    B. EDWARDS (South Sydney).I am very sorry that this recrimination has taken place. After all said and done, if anything of the kind to which reference has been made did occur, it must have been through an oversight. I can only say that "it seemed to me that the ceremony was as-well managed as an affair of that magnitude could have been managed. It was a noble occasion, and it was nobly celebrated. If it happened that some lady of eminence was neglected, I am sure that it must have been through an oversight. It seemed to my personal friends and to myself that- the greatest care was taken to arrange that everybody should have his proper position. I do not think we can begrudge the expenditure in connection with the -celebration of the inauguration of the Commonwealth.

                    <para>- I should not have taken part in this discussion except to remove an impression in the mind of an honorable member who has spoken. He seemed to think that some slight had been placed upon certain honorable members sitting in the corners of the chamber in regard to the places allotted to them at the opening of the Federal Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- If there was any slight, it applied to honorable members all round the Chamber. But I do not think there was any intention to slight any honorable member. I look upon it as a matter in which the magnitude of the arrangements prevented what might otherwise have been done for the convenience of honorable members. I do not wish it to be thought for a moment that there was any slight put upon a particular class of members, whether they are called labour members or otherwise. </para>

                    <para>- I see in the details of this vote a sum of £600 for " travelling expenses, allowances, stationery, books, printing, and incidental expenses." I do not intend to say much at this stage, but I think it will be a great pity if in the conduct of our finances large sums of an incidental character are allowed to be lumped together with practically no explanation. Many honorable members have repeated time after time that the salaries allotted to Ministers are not particularly high for the onerous duties that have to be performed by them. But it would be far better to pay Ministers more and have a definite' sum set down at the end of the year, than to have a large amount put down for incidental expenses. . This item may be taken as an indication of large expenditure connected with the inauguration of the Commonwealth, but on other occasions it might include sundries for travelling expenses, incidentals, and other matters encumbering our accounts and giving no information with regard to the items of expenditure. While there are some ' sums that cannot be altogether scheduled, I trust that where details can be given they will be given in the public accounts. </para>

                        <para>- I look upon the present position as altogether abnormal. That is why I have refrained, whilst acting for the leader of the Opposition, from any nagging opposition to the Government in their first Supply Bill. I consider that we must give them a large amount of latitude on account of the exceptional and abnormal circumstances surrounding the initiation of the Commonwealth. But I think now, as I have always held in my public career, that we should criticise votes which deal with the incidentals of a Minister's office. </para>

                    <para>- I see that there is an item in this vote for a " shorthand writer and clerk at £200 per annum." I presume that he will do a great deal of work which otherwise would be done by the private secretary to the Minister. We have not yet heard what the duties of these officers are to be. I do not know whether it is necessary that the private secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs should have a legal training.. The sum of £40 per annum is to be paid to the Minister's private secretary. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. He has the highest testimonials. I may say in addition to that, that through the cast iron public service system of New South Wales this officer has not been paid as he should have been. In consequence of the exceptional circumstances under which he was employed, and the impossibility of getting him graded higher by the Public Service Board, although I desired his salary to be about £100 a year more, his salary during the last 18 months has been augmented by bonuses. This was the only way in which he could be paid, though still inadequately, for the work he did. I have no undersecretary in my department. I have had to do a great amount of work since I left the Premier's, office in New South Wales. But for this officer I should have been placed in a very awkward position. The honorable member who has raised this question cannot possibly object to an officer who stands in so good a position, and who has such experience behind him. </para>

There will be a private secretary, and a shorthand writer and clerk, in ' addition to a permanent head, at perhaps £800 a year. I beg to move -

                        <para>- We must remember that we must start the business of the Commonwealth economically in the first place, and in the second place we should not set a bad example to' the States. It is to our interest that the several States should exercise economy, because their 'financial stability will affect the Commonwealth very much indeed. As a Victorian, I have been somewhat struck by the enormous value placed upon the services of private secretaries in New South Wales. We have : been accustomed in this State to pay much less salaries to private secretaries. The private secretary to the Premier receives only £485 per annum. </para>

                        <para>- Why should this officer be considered not as worthy of his salary as two other highly paid officers of other departments whose salaries have not been attacked ? This is an officer who has worked his way up in the service in a very arduous manner. Any honorable member who has any acquaintance with him will know that he is worth .£400 a year. He is an exceedingly capable and tactful man, and has been found so judicial in his mind and temperament that many Ministers in succession have been glad to avail themselves of his services. Therefore, he is in an entirely different category from others whose salaries have been allowed to pass unchallenged, and we should be acting very churlishly and inconsistently if we made any reduction here. </para>

                        <para>- Before long they will all have them. The only thing I am surprised at is that those gentlemen who are getting £400 a year have not a large staff of clerks around them by this time. I suppose, however, that that will come later on, and we may confidently expect that within the next few months they will have large staffs to assist them in their heavy duties. We have been told that the gentleman under discussion has been treated very badly in New South Wales, so badly that it was necessary to do something for him. I do not think the Commonwealth should be regarded as a sort of benevolent asylum, and I certainly object to make it one at the present time. New South Wales should have dealt out justice to this particular officer, instead of the honorable member for Parramatta bringing him here under his wing, for us to do it. Seeing the department is determined to have an under-secretary, I am not going to vote for the reduction of this particular person's salary. Another feature of the discussion is, that while private secretaries were under discussion, and they all happened to be professional men and lawyers, we found honorable and learned members, getting up and using all their influence to back their particular men as just the men for the positions. But now, when it is an unfortunate gentleman who does not happen to belong to the profession, we do not hear a solitary word of recommendation from those legal members, although some of them have been in Parliament where he has acted for Ministers for -a large number of years. Under the circumstances I will vote against the proposed amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I am inclined to that idea, but in the meantime I would like the Treasurer to look into the matter. I do not want to delay the committee by giving details, but shall be very glad to supply these later on. I would like the Treasurer, while dealing in a fairly liberal fashion with officers appointed under these Estimates, to see that those who do the mechanical work get something like fair treatment. The amount set down to the Government Printer is certainly not large, but I presume it applies only to the 30th June. </para>

                        <para>- The question that my honorable and learned friend has raised is a most difficult one to determine. I have been trying to think what would be a fair way of dealing with the subject, but up to the present time I have not been able to come to a decision. When introducing the Estimates for the next financial year, I will be able to give a full explanation pf what may be done. It might be possible, and I have an idea it would be fair, just to take the actual expenditure at the time of the transfer, and say that anything extra on that should be considered as new expenditure. Another way is to try and pick out the various items of expenditure, but that would be difficult. I am giving the matter very careful consideration. I have had to deal with one or two matters not relating to salaries or anything like that, and when making the financial statement next, year I shall be able to lay before the House for ratification a scheme dealing with this matter in a fair and equitable manner. . </para>

                    (South Australia Minister for Trade and Customs). - The matter is one of very considerable difficulty, affecting as it does not only this department, but other departments which have been taken over from the different States. There are patent obstacles in the way of levelling down, and it' may be well supposed that no Ministry would care to undertake anything of that sort. At the same time there are difficulties in the way of levelling up. Honorable members now see both sides of the question to which the Government intend to direct attention, so that they may come to a conclusion as early as they possibly can.

Do the}' intend to collect at once, and if so, what will, be the effect as regards the collection between the States? I know that nothing amounting to a disclosure of the Tariff can be thought of. But if we follow the custom adopted in England, the moment the Tariff is declared the collection will take place. No harm can be done by telling the people of Australia what custom the Ministry intend to pursue upon the introduction of the Tariff. There will be no knowledge conveyed that would not have been conveyed to the people of Australia prior to' federation.

They would have known prior to federation what custom was to be pursued on the declaration of the duties. By telling us that, there will be no disclosure which would not have been made had federation not taken place, but at present we do not know what procedure will be followed on the introduction of the Tariff. Is the collection to take place at once, and is that act going to be interpreted by the Ministry as the imposition of duties <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If it is, it follows by consequence that intercolonial free-trade will be regarded by the Ministry- at all events, if not by the State Treasurers, as having started from the moment of the imposition of these duties. . </para>

                        <para>- The expenditure in Victoria is at a heavier rate, in addition to which this amount was occasioned chiefly by the large influx of members to new rifle clubs. There are over 20,000 members of these clubs, and this expenditure has been incurred in the purchase of ammunition and new rifles. It is paid by the State of Victoria. </para>

Under the Constitution Act we had a right to pay out of Orders in Council up till a month after the assembling of the Federal Parliament. All expenditure for transferred departments is charged against the States, so that this large expenditure is charged against and is paid' by the State of Victoria. The other expenditure is shown in a separate column. The other expenditure is distributed over the Commonwealth according to population, but this particular item is paid by the State of Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- For a period of five years - during the bookkeeping period. Mr.WATSON. - I had overlooked the bookkeeping aspect of . the question. Before sitting down I would like the right honorable gentleman who has control of this department to give the House some' idea of the policy that is going to prevail in respect of defence. Before we pass any vote of this description we ought to know generally the lines which it is proposed to follow in regard to the expenditure. In this connexion we might well be told the plan upon which the defences are to be based. I should like an intimation as to whether the Minister for Defence intends to establish - as was suggested by a question asked by an honorable ' member a few days ago - a local ammunition factory and a small arms factory under the control and owned by the Commonwealth Government. I think that two or three items of that sort require some explanation by the Minister. </para>

That Bill is being carefully prepared, and I hope that in a very few days it will be laid upon the table of the House. . In regard to a local ammunition factory, I may observe that there is already such a factory in existence near Flemington. </para>

The agreement with the company does not expire for thirteen years, I believe. I do not think there is anything to regret in regard to that, because it is a very good institution. It is a very good thing for Australia that we have a factory here for the manufacture of ammunition. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there would be any difficulty about that, if it were considered advisable. These people are generally open to do business upon terms. However, that matter is under consideration. At the present time nothing definite has been done in regard to it. There is no doubt that the supply of ammunition is one of the most important in connexion with defence, and for my own part I should be very glad to see Australia in a position to make its own ammunition. That, however, is a big order at the present time, and one to which we will have to give careful consideration. But certainly that is the goal to which I would like our efforts to be directed. </para>

It is rather interesting to find that an agreement which has thirteen years to run is to be transferred to the Commonwealth Government. </para>

The Minister has stated that the £55,000 of Victorian expenditure, which we are asked to vote, is to be spent largely in giving encouragement to rifle clubs. </para>

                    <para>- I am of the opinion that these clubs are a very important arm of our defence forces, and that to give encouragement to them will greatly improve our defences. But the concessions and consideration now given are unequal in the different States, and I would ask the Minister if it is his intention to take into consideration at an early date the advisability of equalizing the concessions which are given in regard to railway fares, the amount of ammunition provided, the price of ammunition, and soon? Of course, if the rifle clubs are to be encouraged, the encouragement should be upon the same footing in each of the States. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to ask the Minister for Defence if he will grant the same facilities to the volunteer companies which have been established on the gold-fields as are granted to the volunteer companies in Perth and in other parts of Western Australia ? I ask this question because some eighteen months ago volunteer companies were formed on the gold-fields of Western Australia, but I do not think they have yet received their uniforms ; and there has been a good deal of grumbling because their military enthusiasm and ardour has been damped by the want of that encouragement to which both the volunteers themselves and the public consider that they are entitled. I do not know if the Minister is aware that the whole of the circumstances connected with the organization of these companies, and I therefore draw his attention to the matter with a view to having them put upon the same basis as other volunteer companies in Western Australia. </para>

I do not know what the intentions of the Government are, but the matter is one which requires careful handling, because it seems to me that most of the Australians who went to the Transvaal were able to teach the English officers there the game, and it is a reasonable proposition that there is no great need for importing a red-tape officer to look after our defence forces. </para>

If the Ministry commit the Commonwealth to the payment of a certain salary, by offering the appointment to an officer at that salary, T suppose we shall have to pay the money and look pleasant ; but I think that we might ask the Ministry to" consult the House on an important matter of that kind. </para>

                    FORREST (Swan- Minister for Defence.) - I am not in a position to make- any statement in regard to the appointment of an officer to command the Commonwealth forces, except that if an officer is appointed the Government will have to arrange with him as to what salary he should receive, and will have to take the responsibility for any arrangement that is come to. The appointment will probably be for five years, because we consider that a reasonable period.

                        <para>- We shall do the best we can for the country, and I do not think that honorable members will be dissatisfied. In reply to what the honorable member for Kalgoorlie has said in reference to the volunteer corps there, I regret that there has been some delay in equipping the corps, and providing them with uniforms, and no doubt the same complaint could be made by similar bodies in other places. This is due to the want of funds. No funds were available in connexion with the appropriations of. the various States. If money had been available in Western Australia it would have been expended ; but there was no money available, and the Commonwealth Government could not expend Commonwealth money before getting our Estimates passed. If the Treasurer is as liberal in regard to the defence force as I desire that he shall be, we shall be able to carry out our promises, and I shall not forget the volunteers at Kalgoorlie, where the volunteer movement has been taken up with so much spirit, and which is a place which I desire to encourage in every way. </para>

                    <para class="block">From the commencement of this Act every officer of the..... Post and Telegraph departments shall be entitled to receive a salary equal to the highest salary then payable to an officer of corresponding position in any Australian colony - provided that that salary does not exceed £156 per annum. There are about 650 persons in the Post and Telegraph department of this State who are entitled to the benefits of that Act, but they have not yet received them. The matter has been referred to, but we have been told that the Public Service Board are considering the ' question. Some men are working for £7S, others for £90, and others for £132, when, they are entitled to get £156. It is a. peculiar tiling to me that under the same Act one officer has received an increase of £200 and another an increase of £S4r making his salary £300. Under the same Act when certain officers in the Postal department have received an increase,, the men in the lower paid branches have not. I want to know why it has not been, given. Then there are other workers in the Post-office and Telegraph department. Temporary porters are employed there at less, than the minimum that is given to the permanent hands. I think when temporary men are employed they should receive at least the minimum. These men are working for 5s. a day. They have been compelled to work for it . for the last three months. They have nob . received a half-holiday, like the permanent men. They asked for it during the visit of the Duke of Cornwall and York, but it was not granted. I think they are entitled to the half-holiday just as well as the permanent men. In the case of the temporary telegraph porters the maximum is £84. According to a section of the Act No. 1721 they are entitled to the same salary as is paid in any other State. In New South Wales the salary is considerably higher. 1 ask the Minister- - to urge tins matter on the attention of the Public Service Board, in the interests of the lower paid men in this department, and to find out exactly why they cannot receive - the increase they were entitled to by law before they were transferred. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to draw the attention of the Minister- to the fact that there is a difference in the position of the letter sorters. I understand, that in some of the States the letter sorters., are classed as clerks. In New South Wales, they are classed as unskilled labourers, and there is a feeling there that the matter should be brought before the attention of" the Postal department, and that they should! receive some favorable consideration . Again, in New South Wales a promise was made to the officers in the hot districts. Owing to the severity of the climate in the outlying districts, the officers were promised that they would receive certain allowances, but I believe they have not been paid. I would like to know from the Minister what consideration is to be given to the officers in the hot climates, and if the Federal Government have made any arrangements with the State Governments by which any allowances promised to officers in the .outlying hot districts and any emoluments to which they are entitled will be paid. </para>

                        <para>- I think there can be no doubt that an}' promise made by any of the State Governments to the officers in the departments before they were transferred will be faithfully carried out by the Commonwealth. I have no knowledge of the matters to which the honorable member for Gwydir has referred, but I shall ask my honorable colleague to have everything thoroughly inquired into, and see that whatever promises were made, are -carried out. With regard to the matters in Victoria, I am a little more familiar with the situation, as I think I had something to -do with Act No. 1721 when it was going through. I can understand why the officers have got their increases, and the men have not. The officers' increases were simple under the reclassification scheme of the Reclassification Board, and there was no difficulty. It was simply a question of fixing the men in certain positions, and the rates of pay were fixed by the report. So far as the men are concerned it is more difficult, because they are entitled to get, up to £156, the maximum rate of pay in any Australian State for a corresponding class of work. It does not follow that a man who is getting £78 is going to get up to £156. He will get whatever th corresponding' rate of pay in any other State is if it is higher than he is getting. The object of the Act was to put the men in as good a position as their fellow workers doing the same class of work in any of the States. </para>

                        <para>- Some may. I saw the details and tried to work them together, but I found it was a very hard job to make them work in and ascertain what was really the corresponding class of work. I do not know how the matter stands, but I quite agree with my honorable friend that these lower paid men should get the extra remuneration they are entitled to receive at the earliest possible moment because, no doubt they require it much more than those who are getting higher salaries. Under these circumstances, I shall urge on my honorable colleague to expedite the settlement of the question as quickly as he possibly can. </para>

                    THOMSON (North Sydney).It is hardly correct to say that the letter sorters in New South Wales are classed as unskilled labourers. They are put in the general division. At the same time I quite agree that when many of them are employed in the clerical work of the department to some considerable extent, they will have some reason to . claim to be classified as they are in Queensland as belonging to the clerical division.

                    TURNER (Balaclava Treasurer). - I am anxious to get this Bill sent away so that it will get to another place and be dealt with in time, because I am absolutely blocked ; I cannot go on paying. In addition to that I have to send warrants which I cannot sign until the Bill becomes law. For instance, to Western Australia and other far off places I have to send warrants, and then they have to be signed by the Governors, which takes some' little time. I am anxious that all should be paid as quickly as possible, and that the States especially on the 30th June should be able to get their balance back to the very hour. So far, I have been able to pay the States their balance on the very day it was due, and it is more important that it should be paid on the 30th June than at any other period of the year. Under those circumstances, I trust-that the House will help me to get the 'Bill through. With that object I move -

                        <para>-I do not think it fits in with our Constitution. There is not the slightest power in the King to enact under our Constitution. He is part of the Parliament, but he-is not in himself an exacting part. "We should not keep up the fiction which is still kept up in England, and in some of the States, of making His Majesty the enactor, and the Houses of Parliament the parties who beseech that the enactment should be passed as a consideration for supply. It does not fit in with our Constitution, and it is not necessary, and to some extent it is, or ought to be, obsolete as a form of expression. This probably will be the first Act which will be put on our statute-book. I ask whether it would not be quite safe- to put in a few prefatory words? I really think the proper thing to do would be to state that it is enacted by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Why should we put in the King as distinct from the Senate, or as distinct from the House of Representatives?' The Constitution itself delares that the King, the Senate and the House of. Representatives constitute the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and it is the Parliament of the Commonwealth that enacts. </para>

                    <para>- The ordinary parliamentary understanding is that the House which has the power of originating supply uses some form such as this which' we have adopted.It is not absolutely necessary that it should 'be in the precatory- form, as the honorable member has pointed' out- though it is a time-honoured form. But the words "and do therefore most humbly beseech your Majesty " may be left out. I have no objection to that. Notwithstanding that the King is an enacting-part of the Parliament, the House of Commons, for the preservation of its own independence, has always endeavoured to preserve the understanding that what is voted by it is a free gift to the Crown. Not that it rises out of any action of the Crown, but constitutionally it is the unsought support of -the Crown- by the Commons. That is the reason for the form that is used here. It may be an inadequate reason, but it enables it to be made known that this is the free gift of the Commons to the Crown. I do not think it would be a wise thing to depart from that;" To leave out the words I have already cited might, however, satisfy the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn.</inline></para>
