                    <para>Thatwe, the  Speaker  and members of the House nf Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament asaembled, express our deep sympathy with  His  Majesty theKing,  Her  Majesty the  Queen and the members of the Royal Family in the illness of His Majesty. We are gratified that His Majesty is recovering from his serious operation and we fervently hope that he  may  be speedily restored in health and strength. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Honorable members, of course, are well aware of the fact that  His  Majesty's health has given rise to anxiety and that he recently underwent an operation. The last advice which is available about  His  Majesty's condition indicates that he is continuing to gain strength, and there is a feeling of substantial optimism about his relatively speedy recovery. Not only is this Parliament concerned with  His  Majesty's health, but we have also had much in mind the possible effect of his illness upon his projected visit to this country. I think, therefore, that I should say tp the House that in the middle of June last, after having had some discussions with the Prime Minister of New Zealand, I communicated through the proper channels to  His  Majesty an expression of our view on that matter. Honorable members may be interested to know the terms in which the matter was stated on that occasion by me, because that view still stands. The communication was as follows: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>We are, of course, conscious of the deep desire of all Australians and New Zealanders that there should be an opportunity fora direct and personal expression of our loyalty to the throne, and our deep and affectionate regard for Their Majesties and their family, but we would be distressed if we thought that  His  Majesty, felt in any woy obliged to accept unnecessary risks to his health or constrained to place undue burdens on his nervous and physical energy. Having this feelinz, both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holland</inline> and I would like  His  Majesty to reconsider the matter without any sense of commitment. Would he like even the proposed programme modified? Would he like some postponement? Would he prefer that the tour should he made by  Her  Majesty and\/or Princess Elizabeth and/or Princess Margaret? In brief, we want to help and will fall in with any arrangements that may be proposed. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I should think that that statement, which was conveyed on the 15th June of this year, would express the general opinion of all honorable members and of all the people of Australia. The present position is that until further medical advice has been obtained after future consultations, no decision will bema de upon the carrying out of the arrangements which have already been made, but I anticipate that within the next week or two we shall be in a position to know the result. In the meantime, it is, I am sure, the warm desire of everybody in the House and in the country that we convey to  His  Majesty the expression of our loyalty, affection and deep sympathy with him in his illness. </para>

                    <para>.- On behalf of the Parliamentary Labour party, which is  His  Majesty's Opposition in this Parliament, I have the honour to second the motion. I expressed the views of the Labour party on this subject during the last sessional period. It is certain that the enormous strain of the war, and the unremitting labours of  His  Majesty during that struggle, have helped to contribute to the deterioration of his health which, we hope, is only temporary. I entirely agree' with the statement by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Menzies)</inline> in which it has been made clear, not only to  His  Majesty, but also to the members of the Royal family, that the affection and loyalty of all the people in this country to the King do not depend upon personal visits, much as we desire them and would welcome them. All of us trust that  His  Majesty will long be spared in good health to continue his reign over all his subjects throughout the British Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I remind the Prime Minister that some months ago, on behalf of the Opposition, I requested that the ordinary procedure be followed in connexion with the grant by His Majesty's representative in Australia of a double dissolution of the Nineteenth Parliament under section 57 of the Constitution, and that the official papers and the advisings of the Prime Minister or his Ministers, or Government officials, to the Governor-General be placed on the table of the House because of the importance of the constitutional precedent that was involved. The Prime Minister then undertook to treat my request as a question asked upon notice, but to-day I have read in the newspapers that the request is to bo refused because otherwise the Governor-General might be embarrassed. I ask the Prime Minister whether that is a correct statement of the position. If so, will the right honorable gentleman reconsider his decision, because neither I nor any other member of the Opposition is in the slightest degree interested in anything except the assertions of fact or of constitutional law or practice that were made by responsible Ministers in the documents that passed from them, or on their behalf, to the Governor-General. It is on that basis that constitutional practice in this country is established and, without the information that I seek nobody can say what the constitutional practice is. I assure the Prime Minister that embarrassment to the Governor-General would be in no sense involved. </para>

                            <para>- I have given consideration to this matter. I agree that the communications that passed between myself and the Governor-General and between His Excellency and myself on the occasion of the request for a double dissolution and the granting of it are of first-class historic and constitutional importance. They must, therefore, be tabled at a proper time. I do not propose to table them at a time when they would give rise to discussions in which the present occupant of the position of Governor-General would be involved. </para>

During the previous sessional period, I addressed a question to the Minister on this matter and the honorable gentleman promised that he would investigate the possibility of correcting an anomaly which exists because the sum deducted by the Commonwealth from these age pensioners and paid to the State governments is in excess of the sum that the State governments claim from other inmates of the institutions.

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman has approached me upon the? matter on several occasions and has made very strong representations to me. Over a ' period of years, successive governments have allotted to an age pensioner in a State institution 35 per cent, of the age pension, and have allocated the remainder to the institution as payment for the care and maintenance of the pensioner. In Queensland, and in some institutions in other States, persons other than age pensioners receive preferential treatment because they are charged only £1 ls. a week, while pensioners are expected to pay 32s. 6d. a week. I have made a very close examination of this matter, but I am not yet in a position to announce a decision. I hope to be able to do so in the very near future. </para>

                            <para>- I ask the Minister for Social Services whether it is a fact that the Social Services Consolidation Act makes it incumbent upon an applicant for an age pension to state fully hi3 financial position for only five years previous to his application? If that is so, is the Minister aware that an age pensioner who won £5,000 in the State lottery nine years ago, when he was 72 years old, and is now penniless, was refused a full pension ? Does the Minister consider that this very old man who is now over 80 should be permanently penalized because he is unable to account for his expenditure of every penny of the £5,000 during the preceding eight years while new applicants have only to state their financial position during the five years previous to their applications? </para>

                        <para>- Can the Minister for Immigration say whether, in view of the widespread dismissals of employees of the Postmaster-General's Department and other public servants, as well as of workers on public works and hydro electricity projects, the Government will  give  consideration to re-casting its immigration policy with a view to reducing the intake of immigrants for at least  twelve  months? The workers being dismissed include thousands of Australian men and women, many of whom will not be able to find suitable employment elsewhere. Is the Minister aware that the sacking of Australian workmen on the one hand, and the ever increasing inflow of immigrants on the other, are causing bitterness and grave concern throughout Australia? </para>

                        <para>- During the parliamentary recess the Government made a thorough review of its immigration programme. An announcement has already been made by the Prime Minister following on these discussions. I can assure the honorable member that neither he, nor any of the people on behalf of whom he claims to speak in connexion with this matter, need have any fear that there will not be adequate opportunities' for employment available to any Australians who, as a result of the economic measures adopted by the Government, are no longer required in the Government service. Indeed, at the moment the Department of Labour and National Service, has more than 125,000 vacancies registered and that number docs not by any means cover the total number of vacancies in the Commonwealth. Experience has revealed that the influx of immigrants has certainly not reduced the opportunity of obtaining work in Australia. In fact the number of vacancies for work has steadily increased with the flow of immigrants. The reasons for that are fairly obvious. I can assure the honorable member that my difficulty at the moment is not to place in employment Australians who are seeking work but to deal with the myriad of requests for labour that come to the Department of Labour and National Service from people engaged in essential  industries  who have the capital equipment but have not the necessary labour. Included anions; those industries are timber mills in Western Australia, agricultural machinery work3 in many parts of the Commonwealth, the coal, steel and cement industries which are starved for labour at the present t.:me. I assure the honorable member that there are excellent openings for work at good rates of pay for  literally  tens of thousands of Australians and others who are vital to us at the present time. </para>

I do not think that it is intended to close down the Kapooka camp, certainly not in whole. I believe that there will certainly be immigrants in residence in the Wagga district at that centre. As to the Uranquinty camp, ,it is true that there is to be a transfer back to the Air Force, but I shall obtain more information on the matter and furnish an official reply to the honorable member as soon as I can. </para>

                                <para>- We are conscious of the need for additional labour in rural districts and our officers overseas have been asked to obtain as many rural workers as they can from among those who offer for selection under the various schemes now in operation. I may say that there, as here, a relatively small proportion of persons are prepared to go into rural industries and, therefore, it is not easy to find the numbers that are immediately required. With respect to the construction of immigrant hostels in country districts it has, unfortunately, been found necessary to defer for some considerable time the construction of a number of hostels which had previously been approved. I am hoping that in view of the fact that the Government has taken this decision in order to reduce the demand upon its own services in the way of capital works of this character, local government authorities and voluntary organizations in the districts concerned will themselves see what they can do to meet the position from their own resources. This has already been, done in a number of districts. For instance, members of the 'Colac Caledonian Society, living up to the splendid tradition of the Scot, are selecting good Scottish immigrants and are finding employers in the district to take them into their homes. I hope that that process can be carried out in other districts. My own department is trying to work out a practical scheme along those lines. </para>

                            <para>- I should like the Minister for Immigration to give me some information about the attitude that is adopted by the Government towards immigrants - many of them murderers and vicious criminals. Are such persons to be kept in Australia? If they are not to be retained here, when will they be deported ? How many of those new Australians, if any, have been deported during the last twelve months? </para>

                                <para>- Law breakers will bo found among immigrants as among any other section of the community, but, fortunately, the Government has even more complete powers to deal with immigrants than it has to deal with sections of the community. The general policy which the Government follows, and which has obtained under the Immigration Act for many years, is that an immigrant who has been convicted of an offence that is punishable with a term of imprisonment of more than twelve months becomes liable to deportation. My predecessor and I have exercised that power suitably when we felt that its exercise was proper. I have been asked how many persons have been deported for criminal offences during the last twelve months. I have here figures for the period during which this Government has been in office, and I find that I have issued 78 orders for deportation from this cause. During a comparable period, my predecessor issued 59 deportation orders. </para>

                        <para>- I have heard reports, not from Korea but from London, that the Austral:an Meteor Squadron has been grounded.. Those reports are inaccurate. Last Thursday Meteors carried out independent operations on a fighter sweep and as overhead cover for United States bombers. The Meteors are flying well. The honorable member for St. George will probably be interested to know that the Meteors are the best aircraft that the Government can buy. It is perfectly true to say that the Russian M.I.G. has a slight superiority over the Meteor in speed when flying on the level and somewhat faster still in a dive. In other respects such as manoeuvrability, rate of climb and armaments, the Meteor is better than the M.I.G. Our own airmen are accepted as being the finest fighters in the Far Eastern Air Command. The Meteors are the best aircraft that can be obtained, the Squadron is fighting fit and, so far as the Government is aware, these aeroplanes will be used for some considerable time to come. It is still premature to judge their comparative performances. </para>

                        <para>- I have received a letter from a woman who has been nine years in the service of the Postal Department. In that letter she informed me that she has received a fortnight's notice of dismissal, but that actually she has been rostered to work overtime to the very day upon  which  she is to finish work. I ask the Postmaster-General what method was adopted in his department to single out those who are to be dismissed in conformity with the Government's man to dismiss 10,000 public servants? Does he think that he will improve the service of hi= department to the public bv giving dismissal notices to people who will h.ivp to work overtime to the  day  upon which they are to cease duty? Was any special method adopted to select those who are to be dismissed from the service? Generally speaking, is it a fact that if people are dismissed from the particular section of the department in which this woman works, one of two things must happen - either the service rendered to the public will become inefficient, or an excessive amount of overtime will have to be worked by those who remain in the service ? </para>

Further, as a means of reducing the cost of home building, has the Minister given consideration to the abolition of the wasteful cost-plus system of contracting, the extension of day-labour building, and the abolition of overtime ? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman would not remember, because he was not the member for the Australian Capital Territory at the time, but shortly after this Government came into office in December, 1949, a rebate of 20 per cent. on the rents of houses which had been completed after September, 1948, was allowed. When I became the Minister for the Interior, I found that rents were assessed on the basis of 5 per cent. of the cost of a dwelling, irrespective of whether it had been erected in the 1920's, the 1930's or the 1950's. I have asked the Department of the Interior for a complete survey of the rent position, and that is now being undertaken. Finally, I point out to the honorable gentleman that the previous Labour Government instituted a five-year contract on a cost-plus system, which I cannot break. </para>

I am advised that there is simply not enough wheat available in this country to feed our poultry and pig populations and that farmers are being advised, as the only solution to the crisis, to slaughter their flocks and herds. Will the Minister take immediate steps to ascertain what relief can be effected? Can he assure the House that no wheat is being exported? "With respect to next season's crop will he investigate the desirability of permitting the pig, poultry and dairying industries to be represented when domestic and exports quotas are being allocated? </para>

I am not able to say offhand what may have happened with respect to the dismissal of departmental employees in any particular locality except that what has been done has been in conformity with the policy of the Government, which has been compelled, mainly because of lack of materials, to curtail many of its projects. For instance, it would be useless to employ a dozen carpenters on the construction of a house if sufficient roofing materials for the house could not be obtained. </para>

Is it correct, as reported in the daily newspapers during the recent referendum campaign, that photographs of audiences which he addressed were taken, and that they were used by the Commonwealth security service in adding names to the list of known Communists? If that report is correct, will he explain just what would be disclosed by such photographs which would, in the eyes of the Government and of the security service, establish that people who had previously been unsuspected were, in fact, Communists? </para>

                    <para class="block">In the view of the Opposition, the decision was hasty and ill-conceived. </para>
                    <para>Earlier this afternoon the Prime Minister, speaking in connexion with another matter altogether, stated the principle that should have been applied in this instance. He was asked a question by the honoralemember for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kekwick)</inline> about possible Government action in relation to Trans-Australia Airlines and other organizations, and he replied that he would support the fullest possible prior investigation of the facta before any Government action in relation to such bodies was attempted. Unfortunately, that principle was not applied by the right honorable gentleman when he made his decision to dismiss 10,000 public servants. The decision was announced suddenly out of a clear sky. Admittedly, the subject of inflation was, and still is, of tremendous importance, but the relationship to it of the Public Service had not been even hinted at in this House previously. There was no examination of departments before the decision was taken. No attempt was made to determine what Public Service functions were vital and what functions might be dispensed with or contracted. The huge number of 10,000 was simply taken out of the air. Then, as the Prime Minister subsequently admitted, an instruction was given to the Public Service Board to make the decision good and get rid of 10,000 employees somehow or other. I repeat that the action was hasty and ill-conceived, and I strongly suspect that it was not the action that the Prime Minister would have taken had he been left to himself. It does not seem to fit in with the views on the Public Service that he has expressed many times in the past. It seems to me as though persons other than the Prime. Minister initiated the action. </para>
                    <para>Lot us first examine the facts, aswe are so often urged to do by the Prime Minister when various subjects come before us for consideration. The </para>
                    <para class="block">Government instructed the Public Service Board to try to get rid of 10,000 employees somehow or other. And "somehow or other " is the method that has been used ! The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> mentioned an illustration of that method earlier this afternoon, when he referred to the dismissal of an officer of the Postal Department, which, I suppose, is the most efficient of all departments of the Public Service and which, probably, compares favorably with any postal organization in the world. The officer who is to be dismissed has been working overtime and is rostered for overtime work until the very moment when 3he is to be discharged. That fact demonstrates that the work upon which she is engaged still has to be performed. The truth is that the blow has fallen in a completely casual and haphazard fashion, which is almost accidental to the purpose of checking inflation. </para>
                    <para>The action of the Government in sending an instruction to the Public Service Board was quite contrary to the spirit of the Public Service Act. The Public Service Board, with the appropriate Ministers, is responsible for appointments to the Public Service. The Menzies Government, during its first twelve months of office, increased the number of public servants by not less than 7,500. 1 do not criticize it for that action. Every appointment was examined by the head of the department concerned and by the Public Service Board. I presume that in many instances there was a degree of ministerial responsibility at some stage. Does- it not follow that this order for the dismissal of 10,000 public servants is, of itself, a form of censure of the past conduct of Ministers, departmental heads or the Public Service Board ? </para>
                    <para>It is clear from the decision that was announced to the press and from the written statement that the Prime Minister issued to the Public Service associations that no regard is to be had to the necessity to continue the functions of branches of the Public Service. The figure of 10,000 was hit upon in the way that I have suggested. It was chosen because 10,000 is a nice round number. The Prime Minister stated in a letter that the number of dismissals was to be " of the order of 10,000 "' a s a means to cure inflation. It might be more or it might be less. When decisions are made in that slapdash way by a Cabinet that has panicked because of an increase of the basic wage by 13s. a week and that is seeking to make some kind of gesture to public opinion which has criticized it for its inaction in relation to inflation, it is certain that there will be many cases of manifest injustice. They cannot be avoided. </para>
                    <para>Absurd results have occurred. Let me inform the House of one example that has been brought to my attention by the honorable member for the Australian Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. R. Fraser).</inline> The Department of Works and Housing issued dismissal notices to carpenters and other tradesmen who were employed in Canberra upon house construction under the day-labour system. Some of the men were also handed notices which told them that they could secure jobs with building contractors in Canberra. Thorn contractors are building houses for the Government under cost-plus contracts. Departmental officers have visited costplus contractors and have asked them if they can employ men who are dismissed by the Department of Works and  Housing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor,</inline> the Director of Works in Canberra, has stated publicly that houses built by day-labour in Canberra are constructed more quickly and cheaply than are houses built under the cost-plus system, and are better houses. That is not surprising in view of the faults of the cost-plus system. The farcical aspect of the matter is that men who were building houses for the Government by direct labour will still be building houses for the Government, but will no longer be on the Government's pay-roll directly. The effect of the dismissals upon the day-labour system in Canberra will be bad, because the efficiency of day-labour workers depends upon them working as a team. The team spirit is  being destroyed. Men will work with less efficiency, and houses will take longer and cost more to build. The effect of the dismissals will be, not to combat inflation but to accentuate it. There will be no saving at all. The cut will be a mythical cut. The building force employed directly by the Government in Canberra is being reduced from 1,S95 to 3,663. That will interfere seriously with the development of this city. </para>
                    <para>The most striking examples of the operation of the Government's decision are to be found in the Postal Department. I. believe that from 3,500 to 4,000 employees of the department are to be dismissed, including technical staff such as linemen. That will give rise to a very serious situation. In Devonport, Tasmania, there are over 300 outstanding applications for the installation of telephones, but eleven linemen employed in Devonport have been dismissed. Until action was taken by the Postal Workers Union, New Australians were being retained by the department in preference to Tasmanians. That procedure was eventually changed, but it is an example of what can happen when a government sets out to do something under an illprepared system. This Government is asking the world to look at what it has done to arrest inflation by dismissing 10,000 employees from a great public service. Eighty employees have been dismissed from the export-import section of the Department of Trade and Customs. </para>

                    <para>What is happening in the Postal Department is typical of the procedure throughout the Public Service. What is the attitude of the Postmaster-General to this matter? During the last sessional period, he imposed an enormous " slug " upon the Australian people in order to increase and extend the facilities offered by his department. He said that there were then over 100,000 outstanding applications for telephones. He stated that the curtailment of facilities that would be the alternative to an increase of post and telegraph rates would necessitate the dismissal of thousands of specially trained men, and that he would not be a party for a moment to that proposition. He said - </para>

                    <para>I am told that even wardsmen employed in repatriation hospitals have been dis missed. I could give many other examples of anomalies and injustices. I say that) as a matter of urgency, the Government should retrace its steps. These dismissals will not have the effect of minimizing or arresting inflation. Although the Government has said that it believes in consulting the trade unions concerned upon matters of this kind, not one of the great public service associations was consulted upon this cut. This wrong decision is being persisted with. I do not think it is a decision that the Prime Minister, if left to himself, would ever have made. I ask the . right honorable gentleman to review the position as a matter of urgency. The Public Service of the Commonwealth is a great service, and we should not be ashamed to acknowledge that fact in this Parliament. There should bo no suggestions by certain sections of the press that the Public Service is an inefficient body. It is very efficient. I pay special tribute to the Postal Department. If the Government persists with dismissals of public servants, there will be a period of inefficiency and waste. A sense of insecurity will run from the Commonwealth Public Service to the State public services. That has already happened in the case of Victoria. It will spread like a chain reaction throughout private industry. </para>

The Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Grayndler should confer in order to reconcile their differing views. Of course, the truth 13 that this matter does not come out of a clear sky. No government would be so foolish as to make a decision of this kind suddenly. First of all, references were made to this matter at election time, as the honorable member for Grayndler so very properly points out in his question on notice. In the second place the Government, shortly after it came into office, established a special committee, consisting of the then permanent head of the Treasury, the permanent head of the Postmaster-General's Department, and a distinguished outsider, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgerald,</inline> to investigate the staffing of the various departments with a view to effecting economies. Those gentlemen did a lot of work and made a series of reports from time to time, which were considered first by sub-committees of the Cabinet and then by the Cabinet as a whole. They then went to an overlapping conference between, the Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner and the Public Service Commissioners of the various States, in order to determine whether there were jobs being done in Commonwealth departments which could effectively be done by State departments. A great deal of work was done by that overlapping committee. The reports of all these discussions were laid before the Government. In the light of all these reports we discussed the whole matter afresh with the Public Service Board and told it to make an examination to see whether any percentage reduction that was to be made could be made effectively, whether it ought to be distributed among the various departments, whether it was possible to effect it by eliminating functions of some departments, or whether, if it were impossible to eliminate any departmental functions, it would require some percentage cut in some particular department. The board made an examination of the matter and made a precise series of recommendations to the Government. A sub-committee of the Cabinet then discussed these recommendations with the  Chairman  of the Public Service Board and went into the circumstances of every department. Each Minister concerned discussed the matter with the permanent head of his own department. The report of the sub-committee of the Cabinet went before the full Cabinet, and the final result was approved. All I can say is, that if those events show that this matter came out of a clear sky, then I do not know what careful preliminary investigation is. </para>

I shall then move that the paper be printed and it will then be open fully to discussion. I indicated that to the Leader of the Opposition when I suggested to him that he should not take up time to-day by moving the adjournment. I propose to make the statement on Tuesday, and as it is obviously undesirable to have two debates on one matter, I now move - </para>

Total revenue, after taking the new proposals into account, is estimated at £1,041,500,000, which will give an estimated surplus for the year of £114,500,000.

                </subdebateinfo>
                <para>The recent steep rise in prices and costs bears witness to the acuteness of the problem of inflation. During the year ended 30th June last the " C " series index of retail prices rose by 19 per cent, and the index of wholesale prices of basic materials and foodstuffs by 27 per cent. During substantially the same period the basic wage rose by 37 per cent. This rise in prices and costs has, of course, grave social and economic consequences for many sections of the community. </para>
                <para>Inflation, however, has other serious effects beyond the rise in prices. In large part it is the cause of the misdirected enterprise, the shortages of critical materials, the ill-balanced distribution of labour and the waste of plant capacity that are hampering industry and construction to-day. For that reason it presents a special danger at a time when we are preparing against the possibility of war at short notice. We are engaged also upon an attempt to enlarge all our basic industries and services in keeping with the rapid growth of population that is now taking place. These objectives demand that our resources be concentrated upon the most essential enterprises and works instead of being dispersed over a host of less essential activities as they now are. It follows that the problem of inflation must be mastered if our defence effort and our developmental plans are to be carried through and our standards of living preserved. </para>
                <para>Most countries of the western' world are suffering from inflation, some less and some more than we are, and part of our trouble undoubtedly originates in this world movement. Higher costs of imported goods, materials and equipment work their way through into internal prices and costs. Higher export prices likewise lift the prices of exportable products used locally and, more important than this, inflate the incomes of export producers and so add to internal demand. It would be a mistake, however, to assume that all or even the main part of inflation in Australia is due to external causes. Preponderantly it is of local origin. </para>
                <para>The .essential nature of inflation lies in a disproportion between money demand for goods and productive resources on the one hand and the supply of goods and resources on the other. This disparity began in Australia when the late war began and, though masked for a period by controls, it has been growing ever since. It works itself out at one level in competition for finished goods, house-room and services of various kinds. Behind this a struggle goes on to get resources to produce more goods, to provide public facilities and to push on with the development of the country. </para>
                <para>During the war, civil production was cut back, goods were rationed, prices were pegged and labour was subject to direction. Meanwhile incomes rose and the supply of money increased, the latter chiefly because central bank credit had to be used when taxation and public loans proved insufficient to finance peak war expenditures. After the war, as controls  were eased, there began a great thrust to expand in all directions. Protected from competition by overseas shortages and levels of costs and with a market that seemed limitless, industry set out to produce any and every kind of article that would sell. Existing factories were extended and flocks of new ventures were attempted. Public authorities joined in the effort to expand with a thousand and one projects for transport, water and power supply, postal and telephone services, housing, schools and hospitals. Many of these, of course, had been deferred through the long war period and existing facilities were far behind requirements. </para>
                <para>In this process of expansion more and more income was derived from wages, salaries and profits, and this added to the strength of demand. Then, as exportprices rose, there was a further great inflow of spending power from overseas. With higher current earnings and much larger cash balances than before the war, people spent freely in all directions. </para>
                <para>Despite all that was done to expand industry, however; the rise in local output was spasmodic and uneven. Some industries which could set up plant quickly and could offer attractive work and pay soon got into full production. Other industries, and in particular the heavy industries, which take longer to expand and which for various reasons cannot readily obtain labour, lagged behind, and the shortage of their products acted as a brake on output in almost every other industry. </para>
                <para>Imported goods and materials came forward slowly in the early post-war years and it was only as industry revived in the United Kingdom and Europe, and currency troubles diminished, that the flow began to help substantially in overcoming our local problems. Even so, orders for large items of plant still take years to fulfil and now, with rearmament demands added, we are again feeling the pinch in vital supplies such as steel, tinplate, sulphur and the like. </para>
                <para>The post-war situation I have broadly outlined has thus at all stages been an unstable one. The money demand for goods has continually risen in advance of the available supply of goods, both local and imported. As a result of the effort on the part both of industry and of public authorities to overtake demand for goods and services, and make some headway with development for the future, labour and key materials have run scarce and available supplies have been too widely spread over too many activities. The fact that increasing numbers of people and an increasing amount of materials and industrial capacity must now be diverted from ordinary production for civil needs to preparation for war intensifies these difficulties. </para>
                <para>It may be that economic trends in the outside world will lead to some mitigation of the pressures under which we are now labouring. Wool prices have already fallen a long way from the peaks reached early in 1951, and capital inflow from abroad has fallen off. Meanwhile imports have continued to rise strongly and it seems likely that during 1951-52 we shall achieve a significant import surplus. On the other hand, we know that rearmament is proceeding rapidly in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Western Europe. This presages both a continued strong demand for our exports generally as well as further rises in import prices. Even at current prices wool incomes would still be above the levels we have known in earlier years. Notwithstanding such adventitious developments, it is evident that we must ourselves make a determined effort if we are to weather the storm which inflationary pressures have been brewing in this country. </para>
                <para>There are those who maintain that the solution to this problem is to freeze everything, if not immediately then by stages. On this view the Government should forbid prices and costs to rise, no matter what forces are driving them upwards. The Government rejects this idea as affording no real remedy for our present situation. </para>
                <para>Experience has established two main facts about price control - first, that it has little value to any one unless applied to all the main commodities; second, that unless costs and, in particular, wages are also controlled, price control can do little more than record cost increases. </para>
                <para>Even, however, if all prices and costs were frozen, the basic situation would not be rectified and inflation would not be conquered. The pressure of excessive demand would continue to bank up behind the framework of controls, as it did during the war, and there is no reason whatever to suppose that control of prices and costs would help- to increase production or encourage the flow of imports from abroad. On the contrary, through the great inconvenience that would be caused to industry and trade, it is more likely that production would be set back. We should have done no more than throw an illusion of stability over a situation growing rapidly more explosive. </para>
                <para>In broadest terms the main remedy for inflation consists in closing the gap between the money demand for goods and the supply of goods. As things stand, however, this is not simply a matter of equating ordinary civil needs with ordinary civil supplies. The requirements of defence must be fitted in and, indeed, given priority. Resources of man-power and materials must be made available for the services, for defence industries and for defence works. To the extent that this is done they will not be available to meet ordinary civil needs and supplies will fall short if what would otherwise be available. </para>
                <para>It is of fundamental importance that everything possible should be done to increase production in the key industries and to push on with genuinely top priority works in such basic fields as power supply and transport. Looking at the other side of the problem, however, it has to be recognized that the time has come to impose effective restraints on money demand for goods and on the indiscriminate production of less essential goods. There is no other way to limit the struggle for resources that is impeding the defence effort and the progress of basic works projects and industries. </para>
                <para>The Budget and COUNTER-INFLATIONARY Policy. </para>
                <para>By co-ordinated financial action a great deal can be done, both generally and in particular directions, to check the growth of consumption demand for goods and investment demand for resources. The </para>
                <para class="block">Government and its various agencies have already instituted some powerful measures in this field and these are being made progressively more effective. They include control of the volume of bank credit through the " special account " procedures, the advance policy instructions issued to the trading banks and control of capital issues. These measures supplement and reinforce one another. Their broad aim is to ensure that both long-term capital and working funds find their way to the more essential forms of enterprise and to assist in achieving balanced private investment at an appropriate level. </para>
                <para>In a situation like the present, however, by far the most effective action a government can take is through its budget, using that term in a broad sense. In a modern economy every individual and every organization is affected to a considerable degree by what governments do in the way of raising and spending money. For this reason the financial operations of governments can, if appropriately directed, do a great deal to redress unstable conditions developing within the economy. </para>
                <para>On the expenditure side there is the strongest possible case for eliminating every item that can possibly be dispensed with. It is of course true that large sections of governmental expenditure cannot be curtailed. . Debt charges are a good example and pensions and repatriation benefits are another. Indeed where, as in the case of pensions, people are largely or wholly dependent on government payments for their support, the Government cannot disregard the effect that rising prices are having on their position. Furthermore, where the costs of essential services rise, along with all other costs, there is no alternative but to provide for the additional expenditure involved. At the same time, there is undoubtedly great scope within the many and varied objects of public expenditure for rigorous pruning and there is still greater scope for trimming down the list of new proposals for expenditure. A time of inflation is the wrong time for starting new services to the public or for raising standards of existing services. This can better be done in times of assured peace and easy progress. </para>
                <para>Perhaps the greatest need for revision of current ideas about what is good and timely lies in the field of public works. Since the war, as I have said earlier, we have pushed on with a multitude of projects all over the country, mainly on the ground that there was a public demand for them. It has been obvious for a long time that too many jobs had been undertaken for the labour and materials available, and the absurd stage has been reached where major public projects are bidding against each other to attract key men and supplies. In the result, a number of the really vital undertakings cannot get ahead whilst nearly everywhere jobs are under-staffed and are working from hand to mouth with materials like steel or timber or cement. A further factor is, of course, the large programme of constructional defence works which must have top priority. It is quite certain that if resources were concentrated on fewer jobs - those of a really essential kind - a greater volume of work would be completed and the economy as a whole would be better for it. </para>
                <para>The Government believes firmly that under the present highly inflationary conditions total receipts should do more than cover total expenditure - they should be sufficient also to provide a substantial surplus. Modern thought on the relation of public finance to economic stability is quite clear on the point that in times of depressed trade and unemployment, governments may justifiably run into deficit and even finance some part of their needs with central bank credit, so raising the level of community spending power. It is a vital corollary of this view, however, that, in times of excessive demand and scarcity of labour, governments should draw away from the public in taxation and loans more than they spend for current purposes. In recent years such a policy has been applied in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Canada. If ever there was a situation which called for such a measure, it is surely the situation we now face in Australia. During last financial year national income rose by no less than fSOO.000.000, or 35 per cent. This deluge of additional spending power threatens to overwhelm us. What the Government proposes to do is t.n draw at least a part of it off and put it for the time being where it can do least harm. I shall have more to say on this matter at a later stage. </para>

                <para>In statements No. 4 and No. 5 issued with this speech, estimates of the main items of expenditure in 1951-52 are set out in comparison 'with actual expenditures in 1950-51, and explanatory comments are given on the items in which there are significant increases or decreases. A summary record pf the financial transactions in 1950-51 is also given in statements No. 1 and No. 2. ] do not propose to traverse this ground in detail here, but rather to review the subject of Commonwealth expenditure in a general way. With the consent of honorable members I shall incorporate these and other statements in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>
                <para>Allowing for proposed increases in  certain repatriation benefits, to which I shall refer later, total expenditure from Consolidated Revenue in 1951-52 is estimated at £927,000,000. Including expenditure on war service homes, which was financed from loan fund in 1950-51 but which is to he financed from Consolidated Revenue in 1951-52, the comparable figure, for actual expenditure in 1950-51 is £808,000,000. The estimated increase in expenditure for 1951-52 over the previous year is thus £119,000,000. These figures do not include expenditure on the primary production-self-balancing items, but do include the full transfer to the National Welfare Fund </para>
                <para>The major items on which expenditure will increase are as follows: - </para>
                <para class="block">
                    <graphic href="214331195109264_19_0.jpg" />
                </para>
                <para>In addition, expenditure from the National Welfare Fund this year, after taking account of proposals relating to pensions to which I shall refer later, is estimated at £138,000,000 as against £115,000,000 in 1950-51. The transfer from Consolidated Revenue Fund to the National Welfare Fund is estimated at £185,000,000. In accordance with the legislation governing the fund, collections of pay-roll tax are paid into the fund together with a further amount from Consolidated Revenue determined by varying a base amount of £104,000,000 according to the increase or decrease in the collections of pay-roll tax. The estimated revenue from pay-roll tax this year shows an increase of nearly 40 per cent, and the estimated transfer to the National Welfare Fund has gone up accordingly. </para>
                <para>Expenditure by the Navy, Army and Air departments in this financial year is estimated to be £52,000,000 greater than expenditure in 1950-51. Total expenditure by the Supply and Defence Production departments, which last year wore combined, is expected to increase this year by £6,000,000. This higher level of expenditure mainly reflects the expansion of the defence effort, although some part of it is, of course, attributable to increasing costs. The amount which it is proposed to transfer to the strategic  stores  and equipment reserve this year, £32,500,000, is smaller than the amount transferred in 1950-51 which was £57,000,000. The purpose of this reserve is to provide for stockpiling of vital war materials  and related expenditures. Through difficulties in getting materials, some of which are very much in demand abroad, the rate of expenditure so far has not been high. Up to the 30th June, the amount spent was about £9,000,000. The Government has, however, authorized a very large procurement programme and is doing everything possible to obtain materials and equipment. </para>
                <para>Payments to the States will increase greatly this year mainly because of the proposed payment of £33,600,000 to supplement the tax reimbursement grant. It has become obvious that the grant payable to the States under the present formula will fall considerably short of meeting their indispensable needs. Their finances are, of course, feeling the impact of rising prices and costs very strongly and under these circumstances it is clear that  they  could not maintain their essential services without further assistance from the Commonwealth. At the same time, however, it is fair to expect the States to make e reasonable effort to raise what revenue they can from their own sources, _ to economize in administration and to minimize losses on their business undertakings. </para>
                <para>The rise in the working expenditure of the post office, railways and broadcasting services is almost wholly a reflection of rising wages and salaries and costs of materials and equipment. It was to meet this position that postal, telegraph and telephone charges were increased earlier this year. The Commonwealth Railways have recently increased fares and freights for the same reason. </para>
                <para>The estimate for international development and relief shows an increase of £8,400,000 over actual expenditure lastyear primarily because of Australia's participation in the Colombo Plan. This plan is designed to promote the economic development of South and South-East Asia. Many countries within and outside the British Commonwealth are taking part and the United States of America has expressed its sympathy with the objects and its desire to help. Because of our close interest in the area, the Government has decided to contribute £31,250,000 over the six years ending June, 1P57, with an initial  contribution  of £8,750,000 foi the first year 1951-52. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Major items</inline>
                    such as I have discussed, like defence expenditure, payments to the States and business undertakings, illustrate the genera] problem of Commonwealth expenditure under present  conditions. We are pushing on urgently with a large-scale programme of defence, which at any time is a costly business. We are simultaneously confronted with sharplyrising prices and costs which affect almost every branch of the activities  and  obligations of governments in Australia to-day.
                </para>
                <para>Plainly the occasion calls for the most drastic and thoroughgoing review of public expenditure to determine what is irreducible and what is not. There ought to be a .much better public understanding of this subject. On a number of occasions I have pointed out that a very large part of Commonwealth expenditure is irreducible because it is determined either by standing contracts as in the case of debt or by moral obligations to people who have served the country in war or who are in need of social aid. Nevertheless, as I have also said before, there are some areas of expenditure in which important savings can be made or in which, despite rising costs, expenditure can at least be prevented from increasing. </para>
                <para>The Government has given special attention to three items. One is capital works and services. Like the States, the Commonwealth has a very large programme of works, some of which are of fundamental importance and each of which can in its own field be regarded as desirable. They include postal and telegraph facilities, civil aviation, the Snowy Mountains scheme, housing, and development in the territories. But also like works programmes elsewhere, these Commonwealth projects are not ail of the first order of urgency and there are a good many which can reasonably be deferred, disappointing though that may be to the sections of the community directly concerned. Accordingly, the Government has made an exhaustive review of the whole programme and it is now proposed that, including £4,100,000 to be met from Loan Fund, the total provision for capital works and services in this financial year shall be limited to £106,000,000. this figure includes <inline font-style="italic">£25,000,000</inline> for war service homes and £4,100,000 for war service land settlement. The comparable figure for total expenditure last year was £102,000,000. Thus allowing for the higher level of current costs, the volume of constructional work to be carried out this year will be smaller than in 1950-51. </para>
                <para>Subsidies are the second item which offers scope for economy. Thi3 is a muchdisputed subject. The notion that prices could be held down by paying subsidies to offset cost increases belongs to the order of ideas which sees a cure for inflation in price and cost controls. As a general policy, the Government rejects both ideas together, and it has, therefore, made a review of existing subsidies in the light of the financial position. </para>
                <para>It decided some time ago to limit the amount of subsidy payable on dairy products this year to £16,800,000. </para>
                <para>It has also decided to end the bounty on woollen goods. Wool prices have fallen considerably, and experience during the past year had in any case raised serious doubts as to whether the full benefits of the bounty were getting through to the purchasers of woollen articles. An amount of £2,200,000 has been included in the Estimates to cover claims for bounty which were outstanding at 30th June, 1951. About £600,000 more has been provided for tea subsidy than was spent last year and about £3,500,000 more for subsidy on coal. The estimated total expenditure of £33,000,000 on subsidies this year represents a saving of approximately £7,700,000 on expenditure last year. </para>
                <para>The third expenditure item which has had special consideration is that of administrative costs. Because of increasesin wages, salaries and general expenses this branch of expenditure is necessarily rising. But that is all the more reason why the Government should look to the organization of departments and eliminate anything in the nature of over-staffing or waste of resources. It also requires a critical examination of the various functions carried out by departments to determine which, if any, can he terminated or reduced in scope. After extensive preliminary investigations into this problem, the Government has directed that a reduction of 10,000 be made in the staffs of Commonwealth departments and authorities, and provision in the Estimates for administrative expenditure has been adjusted appropriately. </para>
                <para>The Government is determined to press on with all possible economies in administration, and as a further step in that direction I shall introduce shortly legislation to re-establish the Public Accounts Committee. </para>
                <para>To one branch of expenditure, however, a special set of conditions apply. The position of pensioners and their dependants has undoubtedly been affected adversely by the rise in prices and the Government has decided to increase a number of repatriation and social service benefits. </para>

                <para>It is proposed to increase the special rate war pension for totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen by £1 15s. a week and the domestic allowance payable to war widows who have one or more children, or who are 50 years of age or over, by £1 2s. a week. Service pensions are to be increased by amounts up to 10s. a week for an unmarried pensioner and up to 18s. 6d. a week for a married pensioner with a dependent child; and the pensions payable to parents of deceased ex-servicemen by amounts up to 10s. a week. These increases will become payable on the first pension pay-day after the legislation is passed. </para>
                <para>From that date also, it is proposed to increase by 7s. 6d. a week the living allowances payable to Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme trainees and to settlers under the war service land settlement scheme, and the maximum rates of re-establishment allowances for ex-servicemen engaged in farming and other occupations. The fares allowance payable to Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme trainees will also be raised from 5s. to 7s. 6d. a week. </para>
                <para>It is estimated that the additional expenditure involved in these various proposals will be £3.200,000 in a full year and £2,150,000 in 1951-52. </para>

                <para>The details of these proposals are set out in statement No. 6 on National Welfare Fund Estimates 1951-52.

                <para>There has been some speculation on the Government's intentions in regard to payment to wool-growers of certain moneys held on their behalf, and the effects that such disbursements might have. I can assure honorable members that the budget has not been framed without regard to such an obviously important matter, and fears that the budget will be undone by the need to distribute some or all of these moneys are groundless. It has already been announced that the £45,000,000 collected as part of the initial capital for a possible wool stabilization scheme will be repaid as soon as practicable, and I hope that the recipients will find it to their advantage to reinvest a major part of this large sum in Commonwealth loans. As to the larger sum which will ultimately accrue from the Joint Organization's wool disposals operations, I can only say at this juncture that the interests of wool-growing taxpayers and of the community at large combine to suggest that it would be reasonable to spread the disbursement, at least of the larger amounts, over a reasonable period of time. The exact method by which this might be achieved is currently receiving the Government's attention. </para>

                <para>In statement No. 3 issued with this speech, estimates of revenue for this financial year are compared with actual revenue for 1950-51 and explanatory comments are given. </para>
                <para>Before taking account of proposals for additional taxation, total revenue for 1951-52 is estimated at £381,500,000, of which £798,300,000 is revenue from taxation, £67,700,000 is revenue from business undertakings and £15,500,000 is revenue from other sources. Total revenue from all sources in 1950-51 was £783,600,000. These figures exclude the primary productionselfbalancing items. </para>
                <para>Expected revenue from income tax this year naturally reflects the extraordinary lift in incomes, and especially in wool incomes, which occurred during 1950-51, as well as the higher level of earnings from which instalment deductions will be made during 1951-52. At the same time, there has to be offset against income tax assessed this year on 1950-51 wool incomes an amount estimated at £98,000,000 on account of wool deductions made during 1950-51. Allowing for this factor, revenue from income tax and social services contribution on individuals and companies at existing rates is estimated at £462,000,000 in 1951-52. This is about £120,000,000 greater than revenue in 1950-51. </para>
                <para>Estimates of customs revenue allow for a further increase in the volume and value of imports compared with 1950-51. Similarly, the excise estimates provide for an expected increase in sales of beer, spirits and tobacco. </para>
                <para>A very great increase in revenue from sales tax, amounting to £24,800,000, is expected, because of the rise in prices and a likely increase in the volume of sales of both local and imported goods subject to tax. </para>
                <para>Because of increased wages and salaries and higher employment the estimate of pay-roll tax also shows a large increase of £11,300,000 over revenue in 1950-51. </para>
                <para>Revenue from the Post Office and the Commonwealth Railways this year will, of course, reflect the increases in rates and charges which have already been made. </para>
                <para>At £881,500,000 total revenue would not suffice to cover total expenditure estimated at £927,000,000, much less provide for the other needs to which I shall refer later. The Government has, therefore, decided to bring down proposals for increased taxation estimated to produce £160,000,000 in 1951-52. Bringing these proposals into account, total revenue for 1951-52 is estimated at £1,041,500,000, which, after meeting the estimated expenditure of £927,000,000, will provide a budget surplus of £114,500,000. </para>

                </subdebateinfo>
                <para>In framing its taxation proposals the Government has been concerned to ensure that they will operate as fairly as possible between the various classes of people who will pay the additional taxes, that they will have a maximum effect in curtailing the excessive demand for goods and that they will do the least possible harm to incentives to work and save. It has followed the principle that by distributing the burden of additional taxation as widely as possible it will fall with the least possible weight on particular classes of taxpayers. It has also sought to weight its various proposals so that they will fall more heavily on spendings than on earnings. I shall now give a brief explanation of each of the proposals. </para>

                </subdebateinfo>
                <para>Individual taxpayers will be called upon to pay a special levy equal to 10 per centum of assessed tax. This levy will be imposed in the assessments of income tax and social services contribution calculated at present rates on income of the current year 1951-52. Instalment deductions made at the source from salaries and wages will be increased on and from the 1st November, 1951, by 10 per cent. </para>
                <para>Correspondingly, provisional tax and contribution on taxable incomes, other than salaries or wages, will be increased. The increased provisional tax will be shown in assessments based on income derived during the year ended the 30th June, 1951. These assessments will be issued following approval by Parliament of the proposed increase. </para>
                <para>The increase in the instalment deductions from the earnings of employees will operate for only eight months of the current year. Moreover, it will not be possible to collect the full provisional tax and contribution as many taxpayers fail to lodge their returns in sufficient time to enable assessments to be made and paid before the close of the year. </para>
                <para>Hence, although the proposed change would, on the basis of current incomes, yield £38,000,000 in a full assessment year, it is estimated that extra collections in this financial year will not exceed £25,000,000. I might point out here that the concessions and adjustments made in the budget last year are estimated to have a value to taxpayers of £20,000,000 in the current year. </para>
                <para>Comparative tables are being circulated showing the tax and contribution payable on selected incomes (a) at war-time rates, <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> at current rates, and (c) at the increased rates now proposed. These tables will show that, despite the proposed increase, the new rates will be comparatively light by comparison with war-time rates. </para>
                <para>I desire also to. stress that, even with the increase now proposed, income taxes in Australia will still be much lower in every grade of income than income taxes in the United Kingdom and in New Zealand. Tables comparing the income taxes in the three countries are also being circulated to honorable members. </para>

                    review of the effects of the averaging system has disclosed a pressing need for some modification of that system. The averaging of taxable incomes for income tax rating purposes applies only in the assessments of primary producers who, broadly, pay tax on taxable incomes each year at the rate appropriate to the average of taxable incomes of the current year and the preceding four years.
                </para>
                <para>The averaging system is intended <inline font-style="italic">t'</inline> protect the taxpayers concerned against disadvantages arising from fluctuations of prices for their products and from variations of income due to seasonal conditions. The system is meant to ensure that primary producers pay approximately the same amount of tax as other taxpayers receiving the same total income during the same period in reasonably even amounts. </para>
                <para>It has always been recognized that the system has faults. For example, it operates to the advantage of the taxpayer in a year of high income when he is best abb to pay and to his disadvantage in a year of low income when he is least able to pay. </para>
                <para>Despite these disadvantages, however, the system worked reasonably well until about three years ago, when  income began  to increase steeply year by year. As a result of that rise in incomes the position has now been reached in which, if the system were to continue without modification in respect of incomes of the year ended the 30th June, 1951, taxpayers subject to averaging would have an advantage estimated at £62,000,000 in assessments on incomes of the year 1950-51 <inline font-style="italic">hy</inline> comparison with what they would  have  had to pay if averaging did not apply. About £50,000,000 of this total amount would accrue to taxpayers who had taxable incomes in excess of £4,000 in that year. </para>
                <para>On the other hand, for averaging to achieve its expected purpose in some future period when incomes are declining, the taxpayers concerned would have to be required to restore to revenue amounts equivalent to the tax advantages they have received over the past three oi four years. If incomes were to fall fat enough to make this a possibility, it is fairly obvious that the task would exceed the financial capacity of most of  the  people concerned. It seems preferable, therefore, that the system should be modified and prevailing conditions make this an opportune time to do so. </para>
                <para>The modification proposed is to confine the averaging system to that  part  of the taxable income which do°s not- exceed £*t.0Of&gt;. Where the  taxable  income is £4,000 or less and the average income less than £*.000, the present system will apply without change; </para>
                <para>Concurrently with the introduction of the  amendment  it is proposed to give taxpayers now subject to averaging the option of electing to withdraw permanently from the averaging system and to be taxed on the same basis as other taxpayers. </para>
                <para>The annual gain or loss to revenue from these proposals will vary from year to year. The gain to revenue in the present financial year is estimated to be £47,000,000. </para>

Deductions made in respect of wool sold or exported prior to that date are of course to be offset against tax liabilities of wool-growers in the current year. </para>

                <para>Increases are proposed in the taxation of company profits. At present  companies  pay a primary tax at the rate of 5s. in the £1 on the first £5,000 of taxable income and 6s. in the £1 on the balance of taxable income. In addition, public companies pay super-tax at the rate of ls. in the £1 on the excess of taxable income over £5,000 and a further tax at the rate of 2s. in the £1 on that part of the income which is not distributed as dividends to shareholders. </para>
                <para>It is proposed to impose a primary rate of 7s. in the £1 on the taxable incomes of public companies and to abolish the supertax and the undistributed income tax. Both super-tax and undistributed income tax were war-time measures. Super-tax, which was complementary to war-time (company) tax, has been continued although war-time (company) tax ceased as from June, 1946. </para>
                <para>The amalgamation of the three taxesgives effect, in principle, to a recommendation made by the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation. The interests of simplification are served by the amalgamation, and the abolition of the undistributed income tax acknowledges the principle advocated by the committee that a public company should be taxed on the profits it earns and not on the profits it retains. </para>

                </subdebateinfo>
                <para>In my last budget speech I stated that, as part of a balanced plan to bring inflationary forces under control, measures to draw off some part of abnormal profits were being considered. </para>
                <para>This statement has been interpreted in some quarters to mean that the Government proposed an excess profits tax on all forms of business profits. Clearly, however, an excess profits tax is unnecessary in the case of individuals because the graduated rates can be adjusted to draw off the desired amount in taxation. Similarly, an excess profits tax on private companies is not necessary because the individual graduated rates apply both to dividends distributed and to profits retained by those companies. Hence, to give effect to the announced intention of the Government it is necessary to find a means of dealing with the profits of public companies. </para>
                <para>The methods that might be adopted to implement the Government's intentions in regard to public companies were referred to the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation. After thoroughly examining many different plans, the committee found it impracticable to recommend a scheme in any of the recognized forms that would serve the desired purpose and, at the same time, be reasonably free from anomalies for taxpayers and difficulties of administration. In particular, the more usual forms of tax would be ineffective for a period of up to two years after the profits had been derived. </para>
                <para>In the light of the committee's reports, the Government proposes that the additional contribution to revenue by public companies shall be in the form of a special levy at the rate of 2s. in the £1. </para>
                <para>The proposed new primary rate of 7s. in the £1 and the special levy of 2s. in the £1 will commence to apply to taxable incomes derived by public companies during the year ended 30th June, 1951. </para>
                <para>By imposing these rates and abolishing the super-tax and undistributed income tax the net yield in a full assessment year will be £13,000,000 and in this financial year £10,900,000. </para>

                <para>It is proposed to retain the present primary rate of 5s. on the first £5,000 of taxable income of private companies but to increase the rate from 6s. to 7s. on the balance of taxable incomes of such companies. The 5s. rate up to £5,000 is being retained because an increase would weigh with undue severity on small private companies. The rate over £5,000 is being increased by ls. in consonance with the proposed increase in rates of taxation on individuals. This should have the effect of bringing the tax on private companies and their shareholders approximately in line with the tax on partners in comparable partnerships. </para>
                <para>The special levy of 2s. in the £1 will not be imposed on private companies. This is because the graduated rates and the special levy on shareholders' dividends, or on profits retained by private companies but deemed to be distributed, will keep the level of taxation on these profits in proper relation to the taxation of other incomes. </para>
                <para class="block">These adjustments of the rates are estimated to yield £7,300,000 in a full assessment year and £5,900,000 in this financial year. </para>

                <para>It is further proposed that every company, public or private, shall pay in this financial year an advance payment to be credited against its future tax liabilities. </para>
                <para>Since the tax payable by companies is not assessed until some months after the close of the year of income, there is, in the opinion of the Government, a clear case for some advance payment by companies of part of the tax to which the earned profits are liable. </para>
                <para>Since the system of pay-as-you-earn for wage and salary earners and collection of provisional taxation from individuals was introduced, companies have been at some advantage as regards payment. That advantage is found in companies being able to use, for long periods, the money represented by the tax due by them. In the current financial year the aggregate sum will exceed £100,000,000. </para>
                <para>There is also some inherent danger to revenue in the delayed system of company taxation. In some cases money held by large companies runs into six figures, and should misfortune overtake the company there may be total or substantial loss to revenue, notwithstanding the priority of the Crown in liquidation, which applies only as against unsecured creditors. </para>
                <para>The advance payment proposed in the case of public companies is an amount equal to 10 per cent, of the primary tax of 7s. in the £1 and the special levy of 2s. in the £1.' </para>
                <para>Private companies will be liable also for an advance payment of an amount equal to 10 per cent, of the tax at the primary rates of 5s. in the £1 on the first £5,000 of taxable 'income and 7s. in the £1 on the balance of taxable income. </para>
                <para>The advance payment of company taxes is estimated to yield £14,100,000 in a full assessment year and £11,200,000 in this financial year. </para>

                <para>As already announced, the Government proposes to discontinue the special depreciation allowance on plant on and from the 1st July, 1951. First granted in 194&amp; to encourage the replacement of plant worn out during the war years, the original arrangement permitted a deduction of 20 per cent, in the first year in addition to the ordinary depreciation allowed and the concession was to run for five years. In 1949 the concession was extended until June, 1952, and the maximum rate of deduction was increased to 40 per cent. Taxpayers could choose either the 20 per cent. or the 40 per cent. rate. Most did in fact choose the 40 per cent. rate. </para>
                <para>Since then, however, the economic situation has changed greatly and the concession has become a stimulus to excessive private investment in many directions. A similar situation has developed in the United Kingdom where the Chancellor of the Exchequer has given notice that the initial depreciation allowance must be suspended. Moreover, since the ending of the concession will merely restore the system operating before 1946 under which the full cost of plant is written off in annual deductions at normal depreciation rates, the curtailment of the period of the concession will in no way reduce the full deduction for depreciation to which taxpayers are entitled. </para>

                <para>The unimproved values of all types of land have increased very substantially over the values at which they were pegged.

In view of the increase in values generally that has taken place since this provision was put in the act in 1927, it is proposed to bring down amending legislation to extend the exemption from tax to individual share interests of not more than £200 and aggregate share interests of not more than £1,000.

                <para>Increases are proposed in broadcast listeners' licence-fees in order to meet the higher cost of maintaining the broadcasting services and facilities provided by the Government. Until a few years ago revenue from listeners' fees was sufficient to cover the cost of these services. With the development of the services and the great increase in costs of equipment and materials as well as wages and salaries, revenue from licences is falling short of expenditure by some £2,000,000 per year. The Government, therefore, has no alternative but to raise the charge to listeners. It is proposed that the licence-fee be increased to £2 in Zone 1 and £1 8s. in Zone 2. No increase will be made, however, in the fee of 10s. at present paid for licences by pensioners. Moreover, it is proposed that listeners holding more than one receiving set will no longer be required to obtain more than one licence. It is intended that the proposals shall come into effect as from the time when legislation is passed by Parliament. The additional revenue is estimated at £1,700,000 in a full year and £1,000,000 in this financial year. </para>

                <para>The total programmes submitted to the Loan Council at its meeting in August this year, including advances under the Commonwealth-State housing agreements, would have involved borrowing an aggregate amount of just over £300,000,000. The actual borrowing programme in 1950-51 was £165,000,000. </para>
                <para>In view of trends in the loan market, it was clear that nothing like the full amount of £300,000,000 could be borrowed this year on reasonable terms and conditions. It was also apparent that, whilst all the works included in the State programmes were of a useful character, they varied so considerably in relative urgency that some could be deferred for the time being without harmful consequences. On the other hand, to provide finance for the full proposals would necessarily have involved the use of central bank credit. In current circumstances, resort to such methods of finance would on all counts be thoroughly unsound and the Government has irrevocably set its face against it. </para>
                <para>After full discussion it was decided by the Loan Council to limit the total borrowing programmes for the year to £225,000,000. This represented a 25 per cent, reduction in the programmes originally put forward but an increase of 36 per cent, on the actual borrowing programmes of last year. The Commonwealth agreed to accept responsibility for ensuring that the States gained access to loan funds for their works programmes during 1951-52 up to the amount of the approved programme of £225,000,000. </para>
                <para>It is impossible at this stage to forecast what amount will be raised by public loans during the financial year, but it would seem that even the reduced programme of £225,000,000 is substantially in excess of the capacity of the loan market. To the extent that loan raisings fall short of the approved programme the Commonwealth will need to finance the balance from its own resources. </para>
                <para>Apart from the requirements of new loan money for works programmes, money is also needed for redemptions of maturing securities. It is estimated that £7,000,000 will be required in 1951-52 for the redemption of war savings certificates and savings certificates. The requirements for redemptions which may arise out of the maturing of £72,000,000 of Commonwealth and State debt in November, 1951, and April, 1952, cannot as yet be estimated. </para>

                <para>It is now possible to summarize the main elements of the financial problem which confronts the Government. </para>
                <para>First, even after the rigorous scrutiny of the expenditure estimates to which I have referred, taxation at existing rates would leave a budget gap of nearly £50,000,000. </para>
                <para>Second, there is an indisputable need to ensure that the financial operations of the Commonwealth for the year result in a substantial excess of cash receipts. This we believe to be one of the most effective counter-inflationary measures available to the Government. </para>
                <para>Third, we have a contingent Commonwealth responsibility to assist the States by filling from Commonwealth resources whatever gap may be found between the approved Loan Council programmes and actual loan raisings. Many of the State works projects for power, transport and so forth are of the highest priority both on defence and developmental grounds, and if the Commonwealth was not prepared to assist in this way the only alternatives would he a drastic interruption of really urgent works or an extensive use of central bank credit. In current circumstances neither alternative can be contemplated. </para>
                <para>It was only after the closest study of all these factors that the Government decided to bring down its proposals for increased taxation. After bringing them into account, total revenue for 1951-52 is estimated at £1,041,500,000 which, after meeting the estimated expenditure from Consolidated Revenue of £927,000,000, will provide a budget surplus of £114,500,000. </para>
                <para>It is proposed that this surplus be paid into the National Debt Sinking Fund, which will be empowered to invest some part thereof in loans raised for Commonwealth or State purposes. To the extent that these special moneys are not required for direct or indirect assistance to the Loan Council borrowing programmes, they will be available to the commission for re-purchases and redemptions of debt, including debt owing to the central bank. Separate legislation to authorize the appropriation of the surplus to the National Debt Sinking Fund will be put before Parliament. </para>

                <para>I think it is safe to assert that no member of this House will deny the seriousness of our present economic situation, or the pressing need to halt the inflationary spiral. The whirlwind of rising prices may be exhilarating for the few who can ride it out, but for many inflation can become a whirlpool which ever more rapidly engulfs their savings and ultimately their jobs. This disaster we are determined to avert. The hard facts of </para>
                <para class="block">Our current state are inescapable, and I should have been recreant to my trust had I failed to set them clearly before you. t have been equally frank in setting before you some of the measures the Government proposes to take to counter the inflationary menace. We make no apology for giving you a budget which will entail sacrifice. A government which regards itself as the trustees of the people must be prepared, when the need arises, to tell the people honestly and even bluntly what is required of them. International tension and domestic economic disturbance have now combined to produce that need. While the measures I have announced are clearly not pleasant they are clearly necessary, and in the end they will prove far less hurtful than the results of unchecked inflation. As a government, we have sufficient confidence in our fellow Australians to believe that they prefer to face their problems and that they have both the courage and the energy which are needed to bring us safely through our present dangers. </para>

            <para pgwide="yes">In the 1950-51 Budget, revenue (excluding self- balancing items) was estimated at £738,658,000. Expenditure from Consolidated Revenue was estimated at £738,268,000 thus leaving an estimated surplus of revenue over expenditure of £390,000. </para>
            <para pgwide="yes">Actual revenue for the year proved to be £783,595,000, which was £44,937,000 in excess of the Budget estimates. The revenue for the year would have exceeded total expenditure from Consolidated Revenue by £7,048,000 but for the fact that this amount was transferred to the Defence Services Strategic Stores and Equipment Reserve at the end of the financial year. The Consolidated Revenue Fund was therefore balanced in 1950-51. </para>

                <para pgwide="yes">Collections of Income Tax and Social Services Contribution exceeded the estimates by £29,958,000. One of the main factors accounting for these higher collections was the increase in the basic wage in December, 1950, granted by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. </para>
                <para pgwide="yes">In the case of the Wool Deduction, the rise in wool prices during the year was greater than anticipated and resulted in actual collections exceeding the estimate by £6,531,000.

                <para pgwide="yes">Total expenditure from Consolidated Revenue in 1950-51, amounted to £783,595,000 or £45,327,000 in excess of the estimates. </para>
                <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on Defence Services exceeded the estimate by £14,684,000. Included in this figure is the additional amount of £7,048,000 transferred at the end of the financial year to the Strategic Stores and Equipment Reserve. The remainder of the increase in Defence expenditure arose largely from purchases of aircraft and increased pay and allowances for the Services. </para>
                <para pgwide="yes">Many items of expenditure were considerably affected during the year by rising wages, salaries and costs of materials. Departmental expenditure, for example, exceeded the estimate by £3,619,000 whilst Post Office expenditure on Ordinary Services was £4,986,000 above the estimate. </para>
                <para pgwide="yes">The increase of £4,233,000 over the estimate for Capital Works and Services was due largely to increased outlay on Post Office Capital Works and Services, expenditure on which rose by £8,647,000. In the aggregate, expenditure on other Capital Works and Services did not reach the estimate. </para>
                <para pgwide="yes">The payments to the National Welfare Fund were £5,680,000 more than estimated because of increased collections of Social Services Contribution and Pay-roll Tax. </para>
                <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on Subsidies and Bounties was £4,071,000 less than estimated. Expenditure under the Wool Products Bounty was approximately £5,000,000 short of the estimate because of a decline in purchases of raw wool by Australian manufacturers. The subsidies on coal and prefabricated houses were also less than expected. These decreases as compared with the estimates were, however, partly offset by an increase of £3,700,000 in the butter subsidy which was caused by higher consumption and an increase in the guaranteed return to producers as a result of the basic wage rise in December, 1950. </para>
                <para pgwide="yes">Payments to the States were £16,827,000 more than estimated. During 1950-51 various exceptional factors (such as the December increase of approximately £1 in the basic wage) added to the financial needs of all States. To meet this situation, a Special Financial Assistance Grant of £15,000,000 was made to the States towards the end of the financial year. The other major variation from the estimates related to the Commonwealth Aid Roods payments which exceeded the estimate by £2,143,000. </para>

In addition, a balance of £13,969,000 was carried forward from the previous year, making a total of £55,827,000 available for debt redemption in 1950-51. Of this amount, £45,545,000 was expended in repurchases and redemptions in 1950-51 and the unused balance of £10,282,000 is being carried forward to the financial year 1951-52. </para>

A greater volume of imports and a generally higher level of import prices is expected in 1951-52.

The latter figure is reached after allowing for credits estimated at about £83,000,000 for Wool Deductions made in 1950-51. The substantial rise in estimated collections reflects the high level of wool and business incomes in 1950-51 and also allows for a higher level of wages and salary incomes in 1951-52.

This figure provides for credits of £15,000,000 to be allowed to pastoral companies in respect of Wool Deductions made in 1950-51. As with other income tax estimates, the increase reflects the rising level of incomes.

The higher level of collections will, it is estimated, result from the full year operation of the basic wage increase, and other basic wage adjustments, award increases, and a greater number of wage and salary earners in employment.

The estimate reflects the increase in postal charges as from 9th July, 1951, and also provides for the full year effect of the previous increase in postal charges which operated from 1st December, 1950.

                    <para class="block">It is proposed that a substantial amount of additional revenue required for the purposes of the budget shall be derived by way of increased sales tax. It is planned by these means to secure further revenue to meet the inescapable commitments of the Government. Furthermore, it is expected that the increased rates of sales tax will, in association with other steps taken by the Government, allow material and labour to be diverted to the production of goods required for defence and essential development. </para>
                    <para>It is intended, as previously announced, to increase the sales tax rates so as to raise additional revenue amounting to approximately £35,000,000 during the current financial year. In order to determine the best and most equitable means of achieving this end, the field of goods covered by the sales tax has been very comprehensively reviewed. Those who have attempted to forecast the budget have had a great deal to say about heavy taxes on luxury goods. Few would venture to lay down a definition of such goods. The fact is that there are very few classes of goods which can, without qualification, be classed as luxuries. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> is a nuisance. It follows that even if  it  were possible to effect a satisfactory segregation of luxury goods, the amount of additional revenue which would be gained from those goods alone, even at a rate of 100 per cent., would be relatively insignificant. It is inevitable, therefore, that the sales tax increases must apply to numerous classes of goods which are not regarded as luxuries. The basic needs of the people in the form of food, clothing and medicines are already exempt from sales tax. There are other classes of goods which, although they may be classifiable as essential, may be said to have varying degrees of essentiality. In announcing that certain goods regarded as being in the less essential categories are to bear higher rates of tax, I wish to make it clear that these goods are not necessarily branded by the Government as luxuries. The Government freely admits that many of them serve a very useful purpose. Nevertheless, it has been found necessary, in the light of current economic conditions, to subject them to higher rates of sales tax. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>Of the additional sales tax revenue of £35,000,000 to be raised in the current financial year, approximately one-half will be secured by increasing the general rate of sales tax from 8-J per cent, to per cent. Other goods will be subject to rates ranging from 20 per cent, to  662/3 per cent. The new maximum rate will apply to jewellery, imitation jewellery and fancy goods, cut glass and crystal, ornaments and vases, plated ware and fur garments. These goods have hitherto borne tax at the rate of 331/3 per cent. The rate of 662/3 per cent. will also apply to watches ornamented with jewels or imitation jewels, which are regarded clearly as a luxury line. Watches without such ornamentation will remain subject to the present rate of 331/3 per cent. </para>
                    <para>The rate of tax on toilet preparations and cosmetics is being raised from 331/3 per cent. to 50 per cent. There has been previous criticism of the rate of tax applied to these goods on the ground that it constitutes unfair discrimination against the feminine sections of the community. It has been urged that it is unfair to tax the toilet requisites of the ladies at a higher rate than the toilet requisites of men and particular reference has been made in this regard to the fact that razor blades and other shaving accessories have been taxed at the general rate only. In order to remove what may be regarded as unfair discrimination, it is proposed to include safety razors and razor blades, shaving brushes, shaving soaps and shaving creams in the toilet requisites which will be subject to the rate of 50 per cent. </para>
                    <para>The rate of 331/3 per cent. will be payable in respect of wireless sets, radiograms, gramophones and gramophone records, which have been, until now, taxed at the rate of 25 per cent., but musical instruments generally remain subject to tax at the present rate of 25 per cent. Equipment for sports and games, toys and associated articles which have hitherto borne tax at the general rate will also be subject to the rate of 331/3 per cent. Motor cars will be taxed at the rate of 20 per cent., instead of 10 per cent., and the rate of 20 per cent. will also apply to confectionery and ice cream, instead of the general rate. </para>
                    <para>Full details of the goods affected, and of the new rates applicable thereto, will be found in a statement which I have circulated for the information of honorable members. No change is being made in the rate of tax applicable to photographs, cameras, travelling bags, handbags, baskets and fountain pens. These goods remain subject to tax at the rate of 331/3 per cent. </para>
                    <para>The bill also contains provision for a limited range of further exemptions of a minor character. These are mainly in the form of a logical widening of existing exemptions, with the object of removing anomalies. The consequent loss of revenue will not exceed £16,000 in the current financial year. The most important of these amendments is that which extends to private hospitals conducted by non-profit organizations, the exemption from sales tax already enjoyed by public hospitals in respect of goods for their use. This concession is being allowed in conformity with a proposal to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act, upon the recommendation of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation, to allow concessional deductions in respect of gifts to such private hospitals. </para>
                    <para>Exemption is also being granted in respect of certain goods of a kind designed for the use of blind persons. These goods are Braille-writing frames, Brailleplaying cards and " talking book machines " - there are some of them in the opposite corner of the House - which are specially constructed gramophones designed to play, at a very slow speed, records of stories or books, as a substitute for reading for the blind. </para>

Similar films are now made in Australia to a limited extent, and it is proposed that they also shall be exempt from sales tax. The exemption will be limited to films which are certified by the Commonwealth Film Censor as being of an educational character, and will be subject to the further condition that the films shall not be screened for commercial purposes in theatres. Examples of the classes of films affected are those dealing with industrial processes, soil erosion and other subjects of national interest and importance. </para>

                    <para>The bill contains a provision to extend the exemption of passengers' furniture and household goods imported into Australia by persons arriving here from overseas. This exemption, which is based on a corresponding immunity from customs duty, is limited by the existing law to goods to the value of £125 a person. On and from the 8th December, 1950, the exemption from customs duty was raised to £400 a person. In view of the obvious desirability of a uniform range of exemption for the purposes of duty and sales tax, the Commissioner of Taxation sought and obtained my approval to act in anticipation of a corresponding amendment of the sales tax law on and from the 8th December, 1950. The bill now ratifies the action taken. The increase is, of course, of particular importance to the many thousands of migrants now coming to Australia with, in most instances, all their worldly goods. </para>
                    <para>Particulars of the remaining exemptions are shown in the explanatory statement which has been made available to honorable members. </para>
                    <para>In accordance with the usual practice, the amendments will operate on and from to-morrow, the 27th instant. There is, of course, much divergency of opinion as to the weight of tax which may or should be imposed in respect of various classes of goods. Not unnaturally, manufacturers of some goods are prone to consider their own interests only, and to urge that the burden be placed on the shoulders of others. My duty, and the duty of the Government, is to examine the economic situation as a whole, and, in the light of the best advice obtainable, to formulate proposals which it is considered will be in the best interests of the community generally. The necessity for increased taxation is greatly to be regretted, but the needs of the nation under present conditions must be the paramount consideration. It is in these circumstances that I commend the bill to honorable members. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to repeal the three acts which comprise the wool sales deduction legislation. Those three acts are the Wool Sales Deduction Act (No. 1) 1950, the Wool Sales Deduction Act (No. 2) 1950 and the Wool Sales Deduction (Administration) Act 1950. Honorable members will recall that the wool sales deduction legislation was introduced in the budgetary session last year. The purpose of the legislation was two-fold. First, it formed a part of the Government's plan for controlling inflationary forces. The Government was concerned about the effect which the greatly increased spending power, arising from last season's high wool prices, would have on the national economy. Secondly, the 1950-51 provisional tax based on the 1949-50 income of producers would have been quite inadequate to meet the actual tax payable on the high incomes received by wool producers during the year ended the 30th June, 1951. The wool sales deductions taken as a prepayment of income tax supplemented this provisional tax. </para>
                    <para>The Government announced at the last general election that the prepayment would be discontinued as soon as the provisional tax assessed during the year approximately equalled the tax on the income of the year. As honorable members are aware, there was a considerable decline of wool prices during the last few months of the 1950-51 wool-selling season. That downward trend has been confirmed at the sales for the current season. As a result of the reduced prices, the margin between the provisional tax and the actual amount assessed will be substantially less this year than it was in 1950-51. The Government therefore proposes that the legislation shall be repealed retrospectively as from the 1st July, 1951, and that deductions which have already been made from the proceeds of wool sold or exported on or after that date shall be refunded to producers. Provision has been made in the bill for those deductions to be refunded to producers by the Commissioner of Taxation. </para>
                    <para>The bill contains a clause which provides that the legislation which it is proposed to repeal shall continue in operation in relation to wool sold or exported prior to the 1st July, 1951. This clause is necessary to preserve the. rights and obligations of producers in relation to past transactions. By clause 2 of the bill it is proposed that the repealing act shall come into operation on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent. The provisions of that clause will enable refunds of deductions made from the proceeds of wool sold or exported since the 30th June, 1951, to be made at the earliest opportunity. Refunds will be made by cheque payable to producers to whom wool sales deduction certificates have been issued. It will not be necessary for producers to apply for refunds. </para>
                    <para>Clause 10 of the bill, which provides for the appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the amount necessary to pay refunds of deductions made since the 30th June, 1951, will facilitate the payment of refunds to producers. The bill also contains machinery provisions which will authorize the collection and recovery of amounts, due under the repealed legislation, which may not yet have been paid. </para>
                    <para>I commend the bill to honorable members. </para>

The principal goods in this category comprise gloves, electrically operated coal and stone drilling machines, hand tools of various types, glassware, chrome chemicals, phenol, medicinal preparations and hypodermic syringes. Goods included in this  proposal  on which the Tariff Board hasrecently reported, include plastic intermediate materials, synthetic resins, internal  combusion  engines, all-geared headstock lathes, electric torch cases,portable electric hand tools, alarm clocks and movements therefor, magnet winding wire, centrifuges, storage battery locomotives, mounted projection lenses, tool tips, hand hacksaw blades and various hand tools such as spirit levels, carpenters' chisels, carpenters' planes, spokeshaves, and calipers. </para>
                    <para>Excise Proposal No. 1 relates to coal, concentrated grape must, spirits used in the manufacture of medicinal preparations for use in universities and spirit used in the manufacture of grape must. An additional duty of ltd. a ton is proposed on coal. The existing rate is 6d. a ton. The additional revenue arising from the proposed increase is required in order to meet the increased cost of long service leave to miners engaged in the coal industry. These proposals remove the existing excise duty of 3d. a gallon per degree of concentration above 15 degrees Baume on grape must - concentrated grape juice. This duty was first imposed in 1930 in order to offset the loss of excise duty resulting from the use of grape must in wine production in lieu of fortifying spirits. At that time the excise duty on fortifying spirits ranged between 10s. and Ils. a proof gallon whereas the existing rate stands at the comparatively low level of 4s. a proof gallon, which does not provide any incentive for wineries to use concentrated must for the fortification of wines. Revenue collections on grape must are comparatively small, amounting to approximately £4,000 per annum, and do not, under present-day conditions, justify the expense of their collection. The industry has on several occasions requested that this excise impost be removed in order to free it from the existing restrictive provisions which require the concentration of grape must to be carried out in a licensed excise factory under official supervision.

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to increase the fee for broadcast listeners' licences, except those issued to certain classes of pensioners, to £2, and to repeal the provision in the Broadcasting Act which requires listeners to obtain additional licences at half the ordinary fee for receivers which they possess in excess of one. The fee for the pensioners' licences will remain at 10s. The reason for the bill is that, whereas for many years following the establishment of the national broadcasting service the fees received from listeners were sufficient to meet the costs incurred in the conduct of the service, a stage has now been reached where expenditure exceeds revenue by nearly £2,000,000 per annum. This state of affairs is due mainly to two factors, the first .'being the tremendous expansion of the national service and the second being the inevitable impact of the rising level of prices and wages. </para>
                    <para>In respect of the first point, the national broadcasting service has been extended year by year in accordance with a plan designed to provide a satisfactory service throughout the Commonwealth and its territories. The development which has taken place is indicated by statistics of stations in operation and total yearly transmission hours. In 1935, there were only twelve national stations in operation compared with 50 stations to-day, including short-wave services, whilst during the same period the total transmission time has been increased from 53,927 hours to 286,045 hours per annum. On the technical side, which is the responsibility of the Postal Department, these statistics have meant, to mention only a few things, the purchase of a large amount of expensive new equipment, the employment of greater numbers of skilled technical personnel, and the erection of thousands of miles of high-quality telephone channels over ever-increasing distances for the relaying of programmes. They have meant, in short, all that is involved in the provision of a national broadcasting service to a greater .and greater proportion of the Australian people, including those in the territories, so that -to-day it is estimated that over 90 per cent, of the Australian population is assured of satisfactory reception of the programmes of at least one national broadcasting station. However, in many districts, especially in rural areas, no really reliable service is being provided and plans have been made to effect improvements which will add considerably to the costs being incurred by the Postal Department on the maintenance and operation of the national broadcasting service. </para>
                    <para>Commitments of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in connection with programmes have naturally increased correspondingly, and, in addition, the commission has exerted a constant effort through the years to improve the general quality of the national programmes which, it is everywhere admitted, are to-day of a high standard. These developments have taken place in more recent times under the pressure of rapidly rising price levels. It is not astonishing, therefore, that the outlay on the national broadcasting service has long since outstripped the revenue from broadcast listeners' licences, the fee for which was fixed at £1 ls. as long ago as 1934, and was reduced to the present figure of £1 in  1940. As I have said, this fee is insufficient to meet the present-day costs of the service; and the increase contemplated in this measure is designed to ensure that the cost of the national broadcasting service shall be met from the licence-fees paid by listeners, as was intended by those who were responsible for the setting up of the Australian broadcasting system. The difficulties that confront us in this respect are not peculiar to Australia. In July, 1946, the British Government doubled its fee for a broadcast listener's licence. In a White Paper on Broadcasting Policy published at that time, it was indicated that that decision was made because of the considerable increase which had taken place in the cost of providing the broadcasting service, and that the average cost of each hour of programme was expected to be almost double the prewar level. The position in Canada was recently stated succinctly by the  chairman  of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which is the National Broadcasting Authority in Canada, when he said the national broadcasting system " is squeezed between swollen costs and stationary revenue rates ". </para>
                    <para>As I have already mentioned, the main purpose of the bill is to increase the fee for broadcast listeners' licences and to relieve listeners from the obligation of obtaining a half-fee licence for each broadcast receiver in their possession in excess of one. These changes in the licensing procedure necessitate a number of minor amendments to the existing provisions of the act relating to the grant of listeners' licences. It has, therefore, been deemed desirable to repeal the relevant sections, sections 96 to 101, and to insert in their stead new sections which repeat most of the existing provisions, appropriately amended to provide for the new conditions. Apart from that general observation, the bill requires little explanation. Its effect will be that listeners in Zone 1, which is the area within approximately 250 miles of a national broadcasting station, will pay <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> instead* of £1 for a broadcast listener's licence, and those living in the remainder of the Commonwealth and the territories will pay £1 Ss. instead of 14s. as at present. Age and invalid pensioners, widow pensioners, and persons in receipt of a " service " pension under the Repatriation Act 1920-1950, who live alone or with another person whose income does not exceed that of a pensioner, will continue to pay a fee of 10s. only, and, as is the case to-day, no fees will be charged for licences for schools or for the blind. </para>
                    <para>The present necessity for obtaining additional licences for extra receivers will be abolished. Thus a single licence will cover any number of receivers in the one family circle, and a factor which tends to complicate the licensing system both for the listener and the administration will be removed. Under this bill, existing section 100 under which sales of broadcast receivers must be notified by vendors to the Postal Department, will be omitted from the act, but the obligation will continue because a similar provision will bc inserted in the regulations made under the Broadcasting Act, which will require amendment in many respects as a result of the passing of the bill now before the House. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden),</inline> in submitting his budget, announced the Government's decisions in regard to increased social services. It is now my pleasant duty and privilege to introduce this bill to amend the Social Services Consolidation Act to give effect to those  decisions. The bill provides for increases of age, invalid and widows' pensions and of the allowances payable in  respect of  the wife and child of an invalid pensioner. It also liberalizes the means test for pensions and removes some anomalies and restrictions. As the Treasurer has announced, the increase of age and invalid pensions will be 10s. a week, which will raise the maximum pension from £2 10s. to £3 a week. I particularly invite the attention of honorable members to the fact that this will be the largest increase granted in civil pensions since old-age pensions were introduced in the year 1909. A married couple, both pensioners, will receive a total increase of £1 a week, raising their pensions from £5 to £6 a week. In addition, they have, in common with other pensioners, a free medical service and -free pharmaceutical benefits. </para>
                    <para>The allowance payable to the wife of an invalid pensioner will be increased from £1 4s. to £1 10s. a week, and the allowance which she receives for the first child under sixteen years of age will be increased from 9s. to lis. 6d. a week. In addition, child endowment of 5s. a week is payable. The total which an invalid pensioner and his wife may receive by way of pension, allowances and child endowment will thus be raised from £4 Ss. to £5 6s. 6d. a week. Endowment of 10s. a week is payable for each additional child under sixteen years of age. </para>
                    <para>Substantial increases will also be made in civilian widows' pensions. The increase will be 10s. a week for a class A widow, that is, a widow who has one or more children under sixteen years of age. This will raise her pension from £2 15s. to £3 5s. a week. In addition, of course, she receives endowment in respect of each of her children. The increase for widow pensioners in classes B and D will be 8s. a week, which will raise the pension for these classes from £2 2s. to £2 10s. a week. As honorable members are probably aware, the class B pension is payable to a widow over 50 years of age who has no child under sixteen years of age, and the class D pension is payable to a woman whose husband has been serving a term of imprisonment for at least six months, if she is over 50 years of age or has one or more children under sixteen years of age. </para>
                    <para>Ifr. <inline font-style="italic">Townley.</inline></para>
                    <para class="block">The pension payable for a class C widow will be brought into line with that for widows in classes B and D. A class C widow is one who is outside the other classes but is in necessitous circumstances, the pension in such cases is payable for not more than six months after the husband's death. </para>
                    <para>The increase of 10s. a week in pensions will automatically increase by that amount the total which a pensioner may receive by way of pension and other income under the means test. A single pensioner will be able to have a total of £4 10s. a week, composed of a pension of £3 and other income of £1 10s., whilst a married couple, both eligible for pension, will be permitted to have a total of £9 a week, composed of pensions aggregating £6 and other income totalling £3. The increased limits will benefit persons retired on superannuation who are also receiving age pensions. Whether their age pensions are at the maximum rate of £2 10s. a week or at a reduced rate, they will receive the full increase of 10s. for a single pensioner or £1 for a married couple, both of whom are eligible for pension. The. increase of 10s. in class A widows'" pensions will automatically raise the limit of pension and other income which the widow may receive under the means test from £4 5s. to £4 15s. a week, composed of a pension o£ £3 5s. and other income of £1 10s. Under another amendment, however, she will be permitted to have an additional income of 5s. a week, in respect of each dependent child under sixteen years of age, irrespective of the child endowment she receives. The limit which widow pensioners in classes B and D may receive by way of pension and other income will rise from £3 12s. to £4 a week, composed of a pension of £2 10s. and other income of £1 10s. The amendments allows additional permissible income of 5s. a week in respect of each dependent child under sixteen years of age will also apply to invalid and age pensioners with dependent children, and it will not be affected by the receipt of a child's allowance or child endowment. This liberalization of the permissible income in favour of pensioners with dependent children will afford a measure of  relief to such pensioners, or their wives, who are courageous enough to endeavour to supplement the pension and allowances by engaging in employment. </para>
                    <para>The present Government has already shown its practical sympathy for blind workers by increasing the amount that they are permitted to earn, in addition to their pensions, from £5 17s. 6d. to £8 a week. This increase was made in November last. I am pleased to say that the bill provides for a further increase of £2 in the amount that a blind pensioner may earn, which will now become £10 a week. Thus, within a year, the permissible income for blind pensioners has been raised by £4 2s. 6d. a week. A single blind pensioner will thus be permitted to have a total of £13 a week by way of pension plus earnings instead of £10 10s. as at present. A blind couple will be permitted to have earnings or other income of £10 a week between them and each will receive the full pension of £3, making a total of £16 a week between them, instead of £13 as at present. I know that this particular amendment will be welcomed by blind workers, and I am sure that it will give encouragement to all blind persons, who are physically capable, to fit themselves for occupations for which they are specially suited. This will give them a greater interest in life, whilst at the same time adding to the productive efforts of the community. </para>
                    <para>As honorable members are no doubt aware, the act imposes certain ceiling limits on the total amount that a pensioner may receive by way of war pension plus age, invalid or widow's pension. Each of these limits is increased under the bill. The ceiling for a single pensioner is increased from £3 10s. to £4 a week, and for a married couple where only one of the parties is a civil pensioner, the increase is from £5, 7s. 6d. to £5 17 s. 6d. a week. The increase of the ceiling for a married couple, where both spouses are receiving civil pensions, is from £6 10s. to £7 5s. a week. The ceiling limit for a class A widow is increased from £4 to £4 10s. a week, whilst for other classes of widows the increase is from £3 10s. to £3 15s. a week. These increases of the ceiling limits will enable all age, invalid and widow pensioners who are also receiving war pensions to benefit from the increases of age, invalid and widows' pensions provided in the bill. I furtherpoint out that the ceilings are merely limits on dual pension payments, but there is nothing to prevent a pensioner from receiving additional income from some other source to bring the total <inline font-style="italic">ot</inline> his two pensions, plus that other income, up to the appropriate limit of income plus pension. </para>
                    <para>The Government has also decided to make certain liberalizations of the means test on' property. The most important of these is the raising, by £250, of the limit of property which a person may have without being disqualified for a pension. As honorable members probably know, a person who has money or other property exceeding £750 is now disqualified from receiving an age or invalid pension. In the assessment of the value of property, the pensioiier'3 home, irrespective of its value, and his furniture and personal effects are disregarded. The bill raises the limit of £750 to £1,000. This will mean that a person will not be disqualified for an age or invalid pension under the property test unless the total of his money or property, apart from his home and personal effects, exceeds £1,000. The present scale of progressive deductions on account of property will be retained. This provides for an exemption of the first £100 and for a reduction by £1 per annum of the maximum pension for every complete £10 above £100 up to £450, and a further reduction by £2 per annum for every complete £10 above £450. </para>
                    <para>In respect of husband and wife, the act requires that the value of property of each shall be deemed to be half the total value of property owned by both of them. Consequently, under the property amendment, a married claimant will not be disqualified for pension unless the total value of the property of husband and wife exceeds £2,000, instead of £1,500 as at present. In addition, of course, the couple may own .a home without limit in value, as well as furniture and personal effects. When the value of the property of a married couple, apart from their home, is between £200 and £2,000, the pension of each of them is reduced on the same scale as for single pensioners, which is applied to half the total value of their property. As a result of the raising of the property limit, a number of people who have previously been ineligible for an age or invalid pension will become eligible for pensions up to £59 per annum. The increase by £250 of the limit of property that a person may have without disqualification for pension will also apply to widows' pensions. The limit for a class A widow will rise from £1,000 to £1,250 and the limit for widows in classes B and D will rise from £750 to £1,000. There is no specific property limit for a class C widow. </para>
                    <para>The bill also liberalizes the position under the property means test for age, invalid and widow pensioners who own life insurance policies. Honorable members will probably remember that in November of last year, the Government raised from £200 to £500 the special exemption that applies to the surrender value of life insurance policies. It is now proposed further to increase this special exemption from £500 to £750. This exemption will apply in addition to the general property exemption of £100. Thus, a pensioner who owns life insurance policies that have a surrender value of £750, or £850 will, if he has no other property, be able to receive a full pension so far as the property means test is concerned. The result will be that, in future, life insurance policies held by pensioners will have very little, if any, effect on the rate of pension. </para>
                    <para>A further liberalization of the property means test will benefit persons who have an interest in an estate known as a reversionary interest. At present, the act provides for a special exemption of £500 of the present value of such an interest. The bill raises this to £750. This exemption, of course, applies not to the amount of money that the pensioner will receive on the death of the person who has a life interest in the estate but to the present value of that amount, which, of course, is very much less. These values are calculated on an actuarial basis. Where the pensioner has no other property, the ordinary exemption of £100 applies in addition. </para>
                    <para>Many honorable members have been pressing for a long time for an amendment which, I am pleased to say, has been included in the bill. This will give to the Director-General of Social Services discretionary power to disregard the value of the whole or a part of a pensioner's property when he considers that there are special circumstances that justify such action. The Director-General already has this power in relation to widows' pensions, and it is an anomaly that he has no such power in relation to age and invalid pensions. </para>
                    <para>Cases constantly come under notice of hardship suffered by pensioners who let their homes during the war years, or because of ill health or other circumstances, and have been unable to regain possession of those homes. Under the act as it stands, there is no option but to take the capital value of the property into account under the means test, and this causes either complete loss of pension or a considerable reduction of the rate of pension. The rent that is received from the property is generally used in paying for other accommodation. To me it seems wrong, in such circumstances, that pensioners should lose their pensions as the result of a situation from which they have derived no financial benefit. The amendment will enable the Director-General to disregard the value of the property for such length of time as he considers proper, where he is satisfied that the pensioner has taken, and is still taking, all reasonable steps to obtain possession of his property for a home. </para>
                    <para>There are also instances where a pensioner sells his home and desires to use the proceeds to purchase a more suitable property for a home. In practice, the department allows the pensioner two or three months before reducing or cancelling the pension, although there is no specific authority in the act for this procedure. When the pensioner is doing everything possible to obtain a new home and is holding the money intact for that purpose, it is fair to allow the amount to be disregarded for a longer period; otherwise he is compelled to live on his capital and may have to abandon his intention to secure a new home. The amendment will enable the Director-General to deal equitably with such cases. </para>
                    <para>There will, be cases of other types the special circumstances of which will justify the Director-General using the new discretionary power. There is no likelihood of this concession being abused by pensioners. Property will not be disregarded for an indefinite period but each case will be reviewed from time to time in the light of the circumstances and on its merits. </para>
                    <para>Another amendment contained in the bill will enable a funeral benefit of £10, which is now payable towards the funeral expenses of an age or invalid pensioner, to be paid towards the funeral expenses of a person who was receiving an allowance under the Tuberculosis Act at the time of his death, but would have been eligible for an age or invalid pension if he had not been receiving the tuberculosis allowance. These allowances are the responsibility of my colleague' the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page),</inline> but the payments are made by my department. In some cases a person who has been granted a tuberculosis allowance would have applied for the invalid pension if there had been no scheme for the payment of tuberculosis allowances. In the event of his death, therefore, his relatives should not be deprived of the funeral benefit which they would have received if he had obtained an invalid pension instead of a tuberculosis allowance. </para>
                    <para>The bill also contains some amendments that liberalize the provisions of Part VIII. of the act which deals with the rehabilitation of physically handicapped persons. The chief of these is an amendment which extends from two to three years the period during which rehabilitatory treatment and vocational training may be given. At present an invalid pensioner or a person who receives a sickness benefit cannot be accepted for rehabilitation unless there are reasonable prospects of his engaging in a suitable vocation within two years. This provision limits greatly the field from which suitable candidates for rehabilitation may be recruited; it may exclude many deserving cases for whom rehabilitation is particularly desirable and it restricts the choice of calling in which training may be given. The extension of the period from two years to three years, provided for in the bill, will make the rehabilitation scheme more helpful and effective in achieving the purpose for which it was intended A further extension of the  rehabilitation  scheme is provided for in an amendment which will enable treatment and vocational training to be given to suitable persons, over 16 and under 21 years of age, who are disqualified for invalid pension because they are adequately maintained by their parents. At present, such invalids are not only disqualified for pension but also denied the benefits of the rehabilitation scheme. It is obviously desirable to restore the earning capacity of these persons, wherever possible, not only for their own sake and because of the benefit of their labour to the community, but also to prevent them from becoming permanently dependent on the Commonwealth as invalid pensioners when they reach the age of 21 years. In mentioning the provision of the act which disqualifies for pension invalids over 16 and under 21 years of. age who are adequately maintained by their parents, I think it desirable to say that the Government has made a decision to increase by £1 a week the standard amount regarded as representing adequate maintenance in these cases. The standard will be increased from £3 to £4 a week, which means that an invalid under 21 years living with his parents will not be disqualified for pension unless the income of his parents is £12 a week or more, instead of £9 as at present. An additional £2 a week of income will be allowed for each dependent child under 16 years. This liberalization does not require parliamentary approval and it will be brought into operation immediately. It will enable invalid pensions to be granted in a number of cases to persons between 16 and 21 years of age who are now disqualified under the existing standard of adequate maintenance. </para>
                    <para>The bill also provides for increases of certain payments which are made to persons who are undergoing vocational training. These trainees receive a rehabilitation allowance which is paid at the same rate as an invalid pension and is subject to the same means test. Consequently, all trainees now in receipt of a rehabilitation allowance of £2 10s. a week will receive £3 a week. "Where the trainee is married his wife's allowance of 24s. will he increased to 30s. a week. The allowance for one child under sixteen years will also be increased from 9s. to lis. 6d. a. week. In addition to the allowances mentioned, a trainee is paid a training allowance which at present is £1 a week. This allowance is to be increased under the bill to 25s. a week. Thus, a single trainee will receive a total increase in his payments of 15s. a week and a married trainee, with one or more children, will receive an increase of 23s. 6d. a week, including the increased allowances for his wife and child. The bill further provides for increases of the special .allowances paid to trainees who are required to live away from their homes for the purpose of receiving vocational training. The allowance for an unmarried trainee, which is payable for four weeks, will be increased from 15s. to £1 a week. The allowance for a married trainee who has no child Under sixteen years of age will be increased <inline font-style="italic">from 30s. to £2</inline> a week for the first four weeks, and from 15s. to £1 a week thereafter during the period of training. The living-away-from-home allowance for a married trainee, who has one or more children under sixteen years of age, will be increased from 30s. to £2 a week. In this case the allowance is payable throughout the period of training. </para>
                    <para>Another amendment in connexion with the rehabilitation scheme will enable the Department of Social Services to pay the fare of an attendant to a person who is required to travel to obtain treatment or training, to attend for medical examination or to interview the selecting panel, where a medical officer certifies that an attendant is necessary. At present fares may be paid only in respect of the person who is undergoing treatment or training. The amendment goes further and gives to the Director-General 'power to pay such an amount as he considers reasonable for the living expenses of the person undergoing or seeking rehabilitation, and for the attendant, when travelling is necessary in the circumstances mentioned. </para>
                    <para>This is not the time to speak at much length on our rehabilitation activities. Just now I can only make passing reference to what. I regard as a particularly valuable practical social service. Whether  judged  from the economic or the social viewpoint, or considered from its preventive or restorative value, or examined from a purely humanitarian aspect, this work compels both admiration and support. For the few years that this plan has been in operation some 2,700 persons, ineluding more than 1,000 invalid pensioners, have been restored to earning capacity and placed in suitable jobs. This represents a financial saving of at least £2,000,000 on pensions and allowances. It is not possible to say what the total effect on the national economy may be. The annual earnings of the rehabilitated pensioners probably exceed £500,000, and whilst contributions to revenue may be calculated, those to industry generally can only be guessed. There is no doubt that the success of the scheme to date has more than justified its introduction. </para>
                    <para>The bill contains other amendments of a minor nature. One of these extends from three to six months the period after the birth of a child during which a claim for a maternity allowance may be lodged. In addition to this extension, discretionary power will be given to the Director-General to extend the period of six months in special circumstances. Similar discretionary power will also be given to the Director-General to enable him, in special circumstances, to extend the period of six months for the lodgment of claims for child endowment without loss of arrears. </para>
                    <para>A word of explanation is necessary in regard <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> a clause in the bill that deals with the adjustment of overpayments in certain circumstances. Cases arise where a person who has received a social services pension or benefit has been overpaid, due to the receipt of income or property, or for some other reason, and that person has become entitled to some other pension or benefit under the act. Whilst adjustment could be effected by means of deductions from instalments if the original pension or benefit were continued or reinstated, this cannot be done where pension or benefit of some other type is granted. It is reasonable and necessary that such power should be provided so that Commonwealth expenditure on social services may be safeguarded. Deductions will not be made if this will cause hardship, and for this reason the Director-General is given discretionary power so that he may decide whether or not the overpayment should he recovered in this way. Deductions will not be made in such cases from a maternity allowance, child endowment or a funeral benefit. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members will be interested to learn the cost of the increases and liberalizations that are provided for in the bill. The following summary gives the cost for a full year as well as for the current financial year : - </para>
                    <para>From the information that I have given concerning the substantial increases of pensions and allowances and the various other liberalizations and concessions that are provided for in the bill, which will cost £13,500,000, I am sure that honorable members will agree that this measure is another clear indication of the sincere and practical interest of this Government in the social security of the people of Australia. That interest was made evident last year when, in its first year of office, the Menzies Government extended the child endowment scheme at a cost of £15,000,000 a year and provided increases and liberalizations of social service pensions and other benefits to the amount of £9,000,000 a year. Thus, in less than two years, the Menzies Government has increased and liberalized social service benefits to the amount of £37,500,000. </para>
                    <para>Although this may give some satisfaction to supporters of the Government and the recipients of those benefits, I must confess that I am compelled by the mounting cost of social services to lean to the view that, before very long, there must be what may well be a revolutionary approach to this problem in Australia. Some further figures will lend point to this view. The expenditure on age and invalid pensions for the year 1950-51 was £49,500,000. As a result of the increases and liberalizations for which the bill provides and the normal increase of the number of pensioners, it is estimated that the expenditure on these pensions for the year 1951-52 will reach £61,770,000, whilst the liability for a full year will rise to £65,870,000. The expenditure on widows' pensions for 1950-51 was £4,S28,000. The estimated expenditure on these pensions for 1951-52 is £5,700,000, and the liability for a full year will become £6,100,000. Thus, the annual liability for social service pensions alone will become £72,000,000. The total expenditure on social services provided under the Social Services Consolidation  Act for the year 1950-51 was £.102,592,000. The estimated expenditure on these services for the year 1951-52 is £119.450.000. Taking into account the cost of the  increases  and liberalizations for a full year, the annual liability for  social  services provided under the Consolidation Act will rise to £124,000,000. This is 31 per cent, greater than the total Commonwealth expenditure for the year 1938-39. In that year the total budget expenditure was £94,400,000, of which £16,400,000 was for social services. </para>
                    <para>The Government is being urged on every hand to abolish the means test for pensions. No one can reasonably deny that the means test imposes a penalty on thrift but, while social service pensions in this country are financed as they are to-day, they can be paid only to those who need them, and for this purpose a means test is necessary. Every increase of pensions and every liberalization adds to the cost of abolishing the means test. Honorable members will probably be amazed to know that the cost of abolishing the means test for age, invalid and widows' pensions, on the new rates provided for in the bill, would reach the huge sum of nearly £98,000,000 per annum. I give the details in the following summary : - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="214331195109264_76_50.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">Some better solution of this problem must be found and, in this regard, the Government has not been idle. The Government believes that age pensions and  some other benefits should be financed by means of a contributory scheme, under which these payments would be made as a right, without a means test. </para>
                    <para>To-day, however, we are faced with such rapidly changing economic conditions that most of the traditional methods of financing social insurance require reexamination. It is plain that the payment of a certain weekly sum for a certain fixed pension at some future point in time can effectively deal with the problem only if the value of money remains constant. Unfortunately, world experience is that currency fluctuations, not stability, are the rule. Countries with schemes of social insurance are now considerably modifying those schemes and in some cases abandoning the previous basis. The work of evolving a contributory scheme that will stand the test of modern events is long and exacting. New ideas are flooding in, all requiring detailed examination. Officers of my department have for some time past been carrying out a very thorough and comprehensive review of all social services legislation with a view to the formulation of a plan which, if accepted by the Government, would place Australian social services on a new and much more satisfactory basis. </para>
                    <para>Before concluding my remarks I wish to place on record the Government's thanks for the ready help and cooperation of the Parliamentary Draftsman and the Government Printer and their officers, and the officers of my own department, which have made it possible to produce this important bill in time for presentation to-night. </para>
                    <para>Finally, I point out that the increases provided for will become payable on the first pension pay-day after the bill becomes law. There are 347,000 age pensioners, 70,000 invalid pensioners and 42,000 widow pensioners who will be looking forward to receiving their increased pensions. In conclusion, therefore, although I welcome any constructive criticism which honorable members may desire to offer, I ask the House to cooperate with the Government in giving the bill a speedy passage through the Parliament. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to authorize the payment to the States of a grant which, together with the taxreimbursement grant payable in 1951-52 under the existing legislation, will bring the total payment  to  the States this year to £120,000,000. The precise amount payable to the States in 1951-52 under the  tax  reimbursement formula embodied in existing legislation will not be known until later this year. It is estimated, however, that the formula grant will be approximately £86,443,000. On that basis it is estimated that the grant now proposed, by way of special financial assistance to the States, will amount to £33,557,000. Last year an amount of £70,398,000 was paid to the States under the tax reimbursement formula. In addition, however, the States received two supplementary grants aggregating £20,000,000 which brought the total payment last year  to  £90,398,000. The first supplementary grant of £5,000,000 was decided upon following discussions with the Premiers in August, 1950, and the second supplementary grant, amountingto £15,000,000,  was  paid  to the  States later in the financial year under the States Grants (Special Financial Assistance) Act 1951. The latter grant was paid because of the effect of certain special factors on the State budgets - -particularly the increase of approximately  £1  made by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in the basic wage. </para>
                    <para>At the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held last month all States emphasized the deterioration of their budgetary position resulting from rapidly rising wages and prices. It was obvious that the grant of approximately  £86,443,000  payable to the States under the present formula would fall considerably short of meeting their reasonable needs. Accordingly, after considering all circumstances, the Premiers were informed that the Commonwealth would be prepared to supplement the formula grant by an amount sufficient to bring the total payment to  £120,000,000  in  1951-52.  This represents an increase of nearly  £30,000,000  over the total payment made last year, and an increase of  £33,557,000  over the amount which the tax reimbursement formula is expected to indicate this year. The grant of  £86,443,000  payable to the States this year under the tax reimbursement formula will, of course, be distributed among the States in accordance with the provisions of existing legislation. The Premiers discussed at some length the manner in which the additional amount should be distributed among the States. Some Premiers favoured distribution of this additional amount according to the formula laid down in the existing tax reimbursement legislation, whilst others favoured distribution on a population basis. The method of distribution suggested by Commonwealth representatives and incorporated in the present bill represents a compromise between the two methods advocated by the Premiers. The total payments to be made to each State in  1951-52  as a result of the legislation now proposed, compared with the total payment made to each State last year, are as follows :  - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">The payment of these grants has been recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its eighteenth report, which was tabled to-day. In arriving at the grants recommended for payment this year, the Commonwealth Grants Commission has adhered to the general principle and methods followed in previous years. For many years the commission has based its recommendations on the principle of financial needs. This principle has been expressed by the commission in the following terms :  - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Special grants are justified when a State through financial stress from any cause is unable efficiently to discharge its functions as a member of the federation and should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of the other States. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>In applying this general principle to the calculation of the grants, the commission has, as in previous years, made a thorough analysis of the finances of all the States and has compared the budgets of the claimant States with the budgets' of the three non-claimant States. In making this comparison, the commission has taken account of any significant differences in the form and content of the States' budgets, and has also made adjustments to the assessed grants to allow for differences in the standards of revenue and expenditure of the claimant and non-claimant States. As in recent years, the commission has adopted a balanced budget standard as the startingpoint for its assessment of the grants. </para>
                    <para>In its assessment of the grants, the commission has always relied on the audited budget results of the States. As these audited results are not available until some time after the close of each year, there is a time-lag of two years between the year on which the grants are assessed and the year in which the grants are paid. Thus, in the commission's eighteenth report the detailed assessment of the grants is based on the States' budget results in 1949-50. To meet this time-lag difficulty, the grants recommended by the commission in recent years have been divided into two parts. The first part of the grants is an adjusting payment which relates to the States' budget results in the year in which the grants are assessed, and the second part of the grants relates to the States' prospective needs for the year in which the grants are paid. </para>
                    <para>In the commission's latest report, the first part of the grants recommended for payment this year represents the difference between the grants now assessed for 1949-50 and the advance payments made in that year. The first part of the grants amounts this year to £522,000. The second part of the grants recommended by the commission for payment in 1951-52 is based on an estimate of what the assessed grants may prove to be when the audited results for 1951-52 become available. This portion of the grants is treated by the commission as an advance payment that will be adjusted two years hence, when the assessed grants for 1951-52 are calculated finally. The second part of the grants amounts this year to £10,000,000. Therefore, the aggregate grant recommended by the commission for payment this year is £10,552,000 or £1,653,000 less than last year. </para>
                    <para>It is important to remember that, in arriving at the special grants recommended for payment this year, the commission has taken account of the increased payments which the States expect to receive this year under the existing tax reimbursement legislation and the new legislation to provide the States with special financial assistance amounting to approximately £33,557,000. The shares of the claimant States in these increased payments in 1951-52 amount to £6,545,000. Therefore, the total net increase this year of the payments to the claimant States on account of the tax reimbursement grants, special financial assistance grants and special grants amounts to £4,892,000. Of this sum, South Australia will receive an additional £2,157,000, "Western Australia an additional £1,472,000, and Tasmania an additional £1,263,000. </para>
                    <para>The special grants recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission each year have always been adopted by successive governments, and the present Government can see no reason why the recommendations contained in the Eighteenth Report should not be adopted this year. A limited number of copies of the report is held by the  Clerk  of the House, and further copies are expected from the Government Printer shortly. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill seeks the Parliament's approval for raising and expending for war service land settlement purposes loan moneys totalling £4,125,000. The Loan Acts 1950 and 1951 authorized the raising and expending of loan moneys totalling £5,500,000 for war service land settlement. Actual expenditure to the 30th June, 1951, amounted to £3,862,000 leaving a balance of loan moneys available for war service land settlement expenditure at the beginning of the current financial year of £1,638,000. The present appropriation will provide loan moneys sufficient to meet estimated expenditure on war service land settlement of £4,125,000 in 1951-52. Thus it is proposed to carry the same balance forward at the end of the year to meet expenditure in the early months of the financialyear 1952-53. </para>
                    <para>During 1951-52 an amount of £4,125,000 will, it is estimated, be paid to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania as financial assistance for the settlement of ex-servicemen on the land. These States will use the money for acquiring, developing and improving land for subdivision into holdings for allotment to soldier settlers; also, for providing soldier settlers with working capital and finance for improvements and for the acquiring of stock, plant and equipment. In the States of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland the State Governments concerned are responsible for providing capital moneys for these purposes. </para>
                    <para>Financial assistance to all the States for non-capital expenditure on war service land settlement, including living allowances for settlers, writing down of the value of holdings, and interest and rent concessions, estimated to amount during 1951-52 to £1,600,000, will be paid by the Commonwealth from Consolidated Revenue Fund. </para>

                <para>Over the last six years the yearly advances made by the Commonwealth to the States under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement have increased from about £6,750,000 to over £21,500,000. The precise figures are as follows :  - </para>

                </para>
                <para class="block">During this same six-year period, the Parliament has approved for this purpose the raising of amounts totalling £95,000,000, leaving a balance of £10,538,000 available at the 30th June, 1951, to meet expenditure in the early months of the current financial year. The provision of £27,000,000 in this bill is designed to cover the programme for 1951-52 of £26,547,000, which was approved by the Loan Council in August last, and also to enable a balance to be carried forward at the end of June, 1952. </para>
                <para>The Commonwealth has agreed to meet the excess in the average cost of prefabricated houses imported by the States over the cost of comparable Australianbuilt houses, up to a maximum of £300 a house on 30,000 houses. The aid is limited to houses imported by the State housing authority and State public utilities. </para>
                <para>During the financial year 1950-51 approximately 3,000 prefabricated houses were imported by State authorities of which 2,066 will probably be the subject of claims for subsidy. Of these, 916 come under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. It is anticipated that during the current financial year approximately 7,000 prefabricated houses subject to subsidy will be imported, of which probably some 5,000 will come under the housing agreement. Due to delays in negotiating contracts and other factors such as lack of shipping, the scheme for the importation of prefabricated houses has not so far yielded houses to the number that was anticipated. </para>
                <para>New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland andWestern Australia are operating under the housing agreement. South Australia has not operated under the agreement. Tasmania withdrew from the agreement on the 31st August, 1950, and has since repaid all advances. </para>
                <para>To the end of June, 1951, 48,117 dwellings had been commenced under the agreement in the four States operating under the agreement; of these, 37,617 had been completed, leaving 10,500 under construction at the start of the current financial year. During the year ended the 30th June, 1951, 8,148 dwellings were completed. Of these 8,148, 3,069 or 37 per cent. were in country areas. </para>
                <para>Though rising building costs have caused the economic rents of recently completed houses to be higher than those of houses completed earlier, the provision of rent rebates has helped those persons who would face hardship in meeting their rents in full. Under the rent rebates scheme families whose incomes equal the basic wage do not have to pay more than one-fifth of their income in rent, whatever may be the economic rent of the dwelling they occupy. As the family income falls below the basic wage, or rises above it, the amount of rebate increases or decreases. </para>
                <para>Up to the 31st March last, the total of the rebates granted was £275,000. I believe that the general conditions under which houses under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement are allocated to applicants and the terras of leasehold, are well known to honorable members. </para>
                <para>Under the housing agreement any house may be sold to the tenant in occupation. It is Commonwealth policy to encourage sales, but it is the States that determine the basis of sale. Commonwealth approval is necessary only if a State desires to sell a house at below capital cost. To the 30th June, 1951, approximately 1,200 agreement dwellings had been sold to tenants, and none of these houses was sold below capital cost. Sales during the 1950-51 financial year totalled more than 750, a very much higher total than in any previous year. </para>

                <para class="block">Supply Act (No. 1) 1951 made provision for requirements for the first four months of the financial year 1951-52. The purpose of this bill is to obtain supply for a further two months to carry on the necessary normal services of the Government, other than capital services. The amount to be appropriated is £68,060,000, which may be summarized under the following heads: - </para>

                <para>Until recently, it was the practice to base the provision in the Supply Bill on the appropriations of the previous year. Under present conditions, however, this course is impracticable. Salaries have increased progressively with the rise of the cost of living, and the higher  cost  of materials has also added considerably to the requirements of departments. In consonance with the procedure instituted last year, the amounts in the present bill therefore relate to the current needs of departments as shown in the Estimates Papers for1 951-52 which I tabled to-day. The amount of £35,690,000 for defence services provides for expenditure under the Government's defence policy, including current commitments in Korea and Malaya. Except for defence requirements and an amount of £2,000,000, which has been included to meet Australia's obligations under the  Colombo </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill provides for a further appropriation of £28,031,000 to enable Commonwealth works in progress at the 30th June, 1951, to be continued pending the passing of the budget by the Parliament. Among the major items for which appropriation is sought are £6,020,000 for the Postal Department, £3,164,000 for the </para>
                    <para class="block">Department of National Development, mainly for the Joint Coal Board and the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric project, £1,540,000 for civil aviation and £1,145,000 for Commonwealth railways. A sum of £12,500,000 is included in the bill for war service homes, representing one-half of the estimated requirements for the year 1951-52.. No allowance was made for this expenditure in the earlier Supply Act, as payments were then being met from Loan Fund. The loan appropriation which authorized expenditure for the early months of this financial year will, of course, not now be utilized. </para>
                    <para>The bill provides for a further two months' expenditure on works, the figures being based approximately on the expenditure programme of £101,648,000 ineluded in the capital works Estimates for 1951-52, which are now before the Parliament. Together with the amounts provided in the Supply (Works and Services) Act (No. 1) 1951-52, this bill makes provision for the estimated requirements for six months of the current financial year. </para>
                    <para>I might mention here, as I did in my budget speech, that the Government has given the closest scrutiny to all works programmes, and has made heavy reductions on the original departmental proposals to ensure that there will be no undue competition for scarce labour and materials. In accordance with the usual practice in seeking Supply, no provision has been made in this bill for any new service. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>Several overseas construction firms have been given approval to introduce foreign workers in Australia for employment on projects of national importance, such as housing, water conservation and the provision of electrical power. The workmen, which constitute the work force of these firms, have been brought from America, France, Germany, Holland, Italy and Austria, at the expense of the contracting firm. Before approval for their entry is given, each passes through the same degree of processing as to their suitability for immigration into Australia as does any other migrant. The honorable member, in his question, specifically mentioned German workmen and inferred that they were unscreened. This is entirely false. My Department of Immigration maintains a comprehensive organization in Germany, to which any workman selected by a firm contractingin Australia is presented for immigration processing. This processing entails minute security screening by trained Australian security officers posted in Germany for the purpose. These officers have complete access to the records held by the Allied Occupation Forces and work in collaboration with the. intelligence and security services of the occupation powers. Australian doctors medically examine each applicant against a stringent medical criteria and finally trained Australian selection officers assess the suitability of the migrant for Australia. This screening, I might add, is that imposed on former displaced persons from Germany, and with additional safeguards added since the present Government took office, is identical with that of the Labour Government's immigration programme, with which the honorable member for Parkes was connected. Workmen selected for such projects are admitted to Australia under exemption from the provisions of the Immigration Act for two years. At the expiration of that period consideration will be given to the question of their remaining in Australia, provided that during the period of their probation they have demonstrated by their conduct that they are suitable for settlement here. The Government has ample powers of deportation in the event of conduct indicating unsuitability for settlement in Australia. </para>

                        <para>During the course of the Nineteenth Parliament a great deal of the Government's legislative programme was delayed because of the obstruction of the Opposition. In the Twentieth Parliament it therefore became necessary for the Government to deal with an unusually  heavy programme of urgent legislation. Because of the position into which the Government had been forced, parliamentary debate had to be limited on a number of occasions, particularly in the case of certain financial legislation which was required to be passed before the end of the financial year. In adhering to the programme thus forced upon the Government, the closure of debate was moved 33 timesbetween the 12th June and the12th July, inclusive. </para>

                            <para>Information in the possession of the Government indicates that during the period of strict enforcement of the ban on the Australian Communist party its membership fell sharply. Later when Russia entered the war as an ally, the ban was not strictly enforced so that it became possible to increase membership even though the Communist party was still nominally an illegal organization. The Communist party experienced great difficulty in combating indiscipline and desertion during the period of enforcement of the ban and has acknowledged its greater opportunities fbr growth under conditions of legality. </para>

                            <para>In June, 1940, when the Australian Communist party was banned, its membership was just over 4,000. In May, 1942, almost one year after Russia's entry into the war, its membership was approximately 7,200; In the latter part of 1942, enforcement of the illegality ban was such that the Communist party was able to conduct an open campaign to build up membership, resulting in a total strength of 16,000 in December, 1942, when the ban on the party was lifted. From this it can he seen that the increase in membership of the Communist party during the period June, 1940, to December, 1942, was made possible because of the relaxation of enforcement of the ban after Russia's entry into the war, this growth in numbers doubtless being due to the desire of many to acknowledge the part Russia was playing in the war. </para>

                            <para>No protest was made in Parliament at the lifting of the ban on the Communist party because the ban on the Communist party had for the previous eighteen monthsbeena nominal one only and the interests of Australia were at the time adequately safeguarded by defence powers then available to the Government. Moreover, the Communist party to suit its own purposes was not then, as it is now, working against the interests of Australia. With the entry of Russia iuto the war as an ally, the Australian Communist party changed its attitude to one of cooperation with the war effort and prior to the lifting of the ban officially gave certain assurances in relation to war production. Also with the lifting of the bun new regulations were issued in substitution making it an offence on the part of any one to advocate violence for the purpose of effectingany political measure whatever. </para>

These include employees in services such as the Post Office, railways, air transport, constructional works, scientific research, munition factories, &amp;c. as well as those engaged in administration. The figures refer in the main to employees on the last pay-roll of the months stated. </para>

                            <para>No record is kept of the total number of separations from Commonwealth employment. The large number and high wastage of temporary employees makes the cost of such a record excessive. While exact figures are not yet available, approximately6,000 permanent officers terminated their employment from December, 1949, to May, 1951. </para>

                            <para>The Government in re-organizing the Commonwealth Public Service set up a Cabinet sub-committee and an advisory committee to review existing functions and organization of departments. On their recommendations a number of important changes to provide a more effective grouping of functions within the departmental structure has been made. In conjunction with the re-organization of functions the Government has decided to cut Commonwealth employment by 10,000 persons and departments have already examined staffs with a view to achieving this reduction. Action has also been token to eliminate overlapping between Commonwealth and State authorities. The Commonwealth Public Service Board at all times exercises strict supervision of new staffing proposals and the enlistment of additional staffs in departments. Departmental organization is continuously reviewed by the board's staff. </para>
