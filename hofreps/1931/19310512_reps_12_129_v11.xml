                    <para>.- On  a  question of privilege, I desire to bring before the House certainstatements published in the <inline font-style="italic">South Australian Worker,</inline> a newspaper circulating throughout the Commonwealth. Those statements I regard as a grave reflection on you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and, therefore a breach of privilege. In accordance with Standing </para>

                <para>No institution ranks higher in the &gt;mind8 of British people than their Parliament. That is not to be wondered at when one realizes that Parliament, as we know it to-day, is the result of centuries of struggle by Englishmen for selfexpression and self-determination. The history of the Mother of Parliaments, the House of Commons, is the political, religious, industrial, and social history of England. Thu members of this Parliament have a duty to see that the privileges and liberties for which our ancestors fought through the centuries are not filched from us. The greatest gift in the hands of Parliament is the Speakership, If the duties and responsibilities that devolve upon a private member are great, how much greater are those of the gentleman chosen to preside over this assembly. The  Speaker  is vested with powers to enable him to discharge these duties and to preserve the dignity of his office, but unless the House will support him in all things, his power is reduced to nought. If the attack by the <inline font-style="italic">South Australian Worker</inline> were directed against you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> in your capacity as the honorable member for Hindmarsh, I would be silent, for you would be well able to deal with the offenders without the aid of this House, but it is not fitting that Parliament should permit a direct attack upon the  Speaker  of this House to pass unchallenged. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have been placed in your high office by the members of this House, and it is' our duty to help you to defend the privileges of your position. </para>

If an honorable member, with all the privileges that attach to iiia position, may not express himself in such language, how much greater is the offence when committed by persons outside this Parliament. We must remember that a blow aimed at the  Speaker  is a blow aimed at this Parliament, and even at the people who elected us to represent them. I quote again from the article - </para>

                    <para>It is pitiable to find that the Government was despicable enough to enlist the  Speaker  in its vindictive punishment. Not content with the exclusion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Alexander</inline> from the public offices the  Speaker  was induced to seclude him from Parliament House. By what right lie did so, seeing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander</inline> had not touched any documents belonging to Parliament, is a mystery . . .  His  subserviency in such a matter can lead only to degradation of office of  Speaker. </para>

                <para>I hope that the House will deal with this matter with the seriousness it merits. Every honorable member should be ready to defend the honour of the  Speaker,  but this journal, not content with attacking your official decision, proceeds to refer to one phase of your private life, and endeavours to oast ridicule on you by referring to the manner in which you read the Lord's Prayer in this chamber. I do not propose to read the whole of this attack; I have quoted sufficient to convince honorable members that action should be taken by this House to defend its  Speaker  and itself, The British sense of liberty allows every individual, whether in or outside Parliament, liberty of thought and freedom of speech; but in this article liberty has degenerated into unbridled licence, and freedom of the press into journalistic freebooting  There have been numerous cases' in which journalists have been charged with breach of privilege. In 1913 two such cases occurred in connexion with this House. On the 28th October of that year the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> moved that the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> should be brought before the bar of the House, and made to answer for certain statements that had appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> On the 13th November, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roberts,</inline> a South Australian member, moved a similar motion in respect of the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline></para>
                <para>In the 12th edition of <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> which I quote in preference to the 10th edition, because it gives the case in greater detail, a case is recorded which bears a close relation to that we are now considering. On page 82 it is reported as follows: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>On the nth February, 1774, the  Speaker  informed the House of a letter in the <inline font-style="italic">Public Advertiser</inline> newspaper addressed to him reflecting on his character and his conduct as  Speaker.  The House ordered H. S. Woodfall  the printer, to attend, and resolved that the letter was " a false, malicious and scandalous libel highly reflecting on the character of the  Speaker  of this House to the dishonour of this House and in violation to the privileges thereof ". The printer was declared to be guilty of a breach of privilege and committed to the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">There are other cases I might quote, including a notable one in Western Australia. The honorable member foi Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> will remember it well. A journalist was brought before the House for a breach of privilege, and was handed over to the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms, and remained in his custody for a considerable period. I trust that I have said enough on this subject to impress honorable members with the seriousness of the matter at issue. The  Speaker  has been carrying out to the best of his ability his duties as officer presiding over the deliberations of this House, and this newspaper has, in a most vindictive manner, attacked him. Therefore I move - </para>

                    <para>. - In seconding the motion I desire to associate myself with the statements of the honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bayley).</inline> I can conceive of nothing" which this House should more jealously guard than its privileges, and in this case a deliberate attack has been made on those privileges. I regard you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> primarily as the guardian of the privileges of this House., and in a very particular way the upholder of its authority and dignity. I regret, therefore, that a newspaper published in Australia has seen fit to depart from the recognized customs of journalism to the extent of insulting you, and, indirectly, insulting this House. "Whether a breach of privilege has been committed is for this House to determine, but in view of the facts which have been presented to the House by the mover of this motion, there can. I submit, be no escape from the conclusion that a direct affront has been offered to you as  Speaker,  and to this House in its corporate capacity. The honorable member for Oxley has pointed out that any breach of privilege by a member of this House would be easily dealt with, because it would be instantly recognized, and; immediately punished. The fact that the breach has been committed by an outsider should not render him immune from punishment. In this case, a particularly insidious attack has been made, and for that reason particular steps should be taken to punish the offender. Justification for the charge laid by the honorable member for Oxley will be found in three paragraphs of the article under discussion. In the first the editor uses these words - </para>

                            <para>- I shall answer that question on behalf of the Government. We have no official knowledge of the decision of the High Court with regard to regulations which, in our opinion, were not laid on the table in the Senate. Although that chamber professed to disallow them, the High Court's decision does not affect the power of this Government to issue regulations, and the Government will not allow the members of another place, who were not before the electors at the 1929 election, to govern this country. This Government will issue regulations as fast as the Senate may disallow them, and it will act in accordance with its powers under legislation initiated by the late Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham.</inline></para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister has kindly consented to draft a message that will be broadcast by a Canberra child to the House of Commons, whence it will be broadcast to Washington by a child from the House of Commons. The question is not so much one of selecting a child from any section of society as of choosing a child with a good carrying voice. The object of the headmaster of Telopea Park School will be to select several alternative voices for trial over the wire. Possibly there will be a child of a returned soldier among those tested. </para>

Has he given further consideration to the matter, and has the Government in prospect any proposal to amend the act in the required direction ? </para>

                            <para>- What I said was that, until the act had been amended, the policy adopted must be accepted. I further gave it as my opinion that there must be temporary employees in government departments. I am not in a position to recommend an amendment of the act to make all temporary men permanent; nor do I think that that would be practicable. Nearly all the temporary employees in the Postal Department are returned soldiers, and it would be not only absolutely futile, but also wrong, to make them permanent employees, because we already have a large surplus of permanent as well as temporary men. </para>

                <para>I have been in communication with the Acting Commissioner of Pensions, who has furnished me with a report dealing particularly with a recent announcement in the press relative to a reduction of approximately £50,000 which had been made in pensions already in force. </para>
                <para>The report points out that the reduction referred to was due to a system of reviews which had been in force in the department for a number of years. Experience had shown that the practice was in the interests both of pensioners and the department. Wherever the review disclosed that a pensioner was being overpaid,the necessary adjustment was made in conformity with the law, and the Commonwealth was thus protected against expenditure which it should not be called upon to bear. On the other hand, it was frequently found that the pensioner was eligible for payment at a higher rate than that actually in force. In such cases the pension had been increased by the department, although no application for increase had been' made by the pensioner. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the necessity for abolishing the Northern Australian Commission and giving effect to the measure as it was originally introduced into this chamber, the Government has decided to delete the provisions with respect to an advisory council which were later incorporated in it. Amendments Nos. 1 to 5 refer exclusively to the provisions relating to the appointment of an advisory council. The Government intended to provide for the appointment of an advisory council, but when the measure reached another place, the provisions relating to the appointment of such a council were rejected. This chamber then refused to accept the amendments made in another place, and ultimately managers representing both branches of the  legislature were appointed, and, after conferring, agreed to accept the bill as it left this chamber. When the report of the managers was submitted to another place, it refused to adopt it, and in order that the bill as originally introduced may become operative, the Government has decided not to press the amendments. </para>

The Government was, and is, still of the opinion that, in the development of the Northern Territory, provision must be made for a modicum of self-government for those people who are pioneering that part of Australia, such as has been granted to the people resident in the Federal Capital Territory. The Government desires to place the residents of the Northern Territory on the same basis as those of Canberra, and although it cannot at present see its way to give the people complete self-government, it was anxious to give them some control over local affairs. The other branch of the legislature has, however, seen fit to reject the Government's proposals in that respect. </para>

                        <para>- One of the reasons given is that it would cost too much if members of the council had to travel from various points in the Northern Territory to Darwin in order to attend meetings of the council. Another reason advanced was that the Advisory Council would probably be dominated by union organizers and agitators, who would be sure to secure election to it. Both reasons were, of course, mere excuses to hide the real reason why these provisions were deleted by another place. In my opinion, the large pastoralists of the Northern Territory took steps to have the provisions deleted because they feared that the small pastoralists might secure election to the Council, and that this would be detrimental to them. </para>

                        <para>- That is true. One of the principal reasons why objection has been taken to the setting up of the new advisory council is that too great power is being vested in it. The council would, for instance, have the power to make ordinances. This would mean that it would practically govern the Territory. </para>

                <para>The fear that the council would be dominated by agitators is a very real one. Earlier to-day I directed attention to reports from Darwin as to the conditions at present existing there. The town is in the hands of the communists. Although it is only a small settlement, 22 cases were listed for trial at the last criminal sessions. But from all these committals there were only two convictions, in the other cases there were either acquittals or disagreements by the jury, or the charges were withdrawn by the Crown. The communists are openly boasting that the Government is afraid to prosecute them, and the citizens of Darwin are afraid to do their duty as jurymen for fear of retaliation by these lawless persons. That state of affairs has been brought about largely, because the Minister has repeatedly interfered and meddled with the administration of justice in the Northern Territory, by quashing convictions or refusing to take action on the advice of his officers. The local hoboes have sent messages to the Minister requesting him to adopt various suggestions, and in one case a threat was made to him through a trade union in Broken Hill that certain action would be taken against him unless he upset the decision arrived at by a local officer. That kind of thing has seriously contributed towards the- disorder that prevails in Darwin today. It is not surprising, therefore, that strong objection should be taken to the setting up an advisory council clothed with the power the Government proposed to give it. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> has said that the Northern Territory is at present under the control of the communists. He admitted that there were already two advisory councils operating at the northern and southern end of the territory. Who was responsible for the appointment of those bodies? Had the people of the Northern Territory any say in the making of the appointments? In my opinion, the conference managers adopted a reasonable attitude on this matter. The honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> was one of the managers. With his intimate knowledge of Northern Territory affairs, he agreed that it would be wise to give the people a measure of self government. Why should we object to the people electing their own representatives to the proposed advisory council? The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> says that, if this is done, communists may be elected; but he appears to have forgotten that it is proposed to divide the territory into four sections for the purpose of electing this council. This would mean that the people who are developing this great territory, whether they be operating in a large or a small way, will determinewho shall represent them. Surely there is nothing wrong in that. These peopleare putting up with great inconveniencein developing this huge territory which,, in the past, has received very little attention or assistance from this Parliament. In view of the fact that the electors will be divided into four groups, it is most unlikely that communists will be in theascendency. But in any case, it is for the people to decide whether they want, or do not want, a communistic government. If Australia decided to elect a communistic government to-morrow, it would be improper for this Parliament to attempt to put any block in the way of their doing so. Probably some honorable members opposite would like to take the franchise from certain people in Australia because they returned to power a Labour Government; but the majority of the people will not agree <inline font-style="italic">to a</inline> policy of that description. Why should the people of the Northern Territory have inflicted upon them, as the controller of  their affairs, a retired commissioner of the police? </para>

                        <para>- I submit that the people should be permitted to elect their own representatives. It is true that the majority of the population in the Northern Territory is centred at Darwin... Most of the other residents are interested in cattle-raising, and they employ very little labour except aborigines, who will not have a vote under this measure. Consequently, these people, who will have the chief say in three of the four divisions, will be able to elect a pastoralist to represent them if they believe that such a man is best able to express their opinions. </para>

                <para>The representatives of another place who sat in. the conference of managers were very reasonable. At first their views were somewhat similar to those expressed by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> but after they had heard the Minister and the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> explain matters, they were of the opinion that the clause giving the people of the territory the right to elect their own administration should stand part of the bill. Actually what the honorable member for Perth fears could occur most easily under the measure in its amended form. If communism exists in the territory, it must surely find expression through the preponderating population centred at Darwin. However, the bogy of communism  with which the honorable, member has, endeavoured to frighten us is too absurd to warrant much consideration. The people of the Northern Territory are good citizens of the Commonwealth, the majority of them having gone to that remote area at the special request of those who desired, to employ them there. Another class is represented by that stalwart Australian, the prospector, a type that has done much to develop,, not only the Northern Territory, but the Commonwealth generally. During the last weekend I saw in Sydney a picture depicting the so-called pioneering efforts of a gentleman in Arnhem Land, who was supposed to have explored country previously untrodden by the white man. Flies and other pests associated with the tropics were shown as part of the hardship to which that gentleman had been subjected. As a matter of fact, prospectors searched that country for gold and valuable minerals years before he set foot in it. Yet the prospector is the type of citizen to whom the honorable member for Perth and his like object to give the right of adult franchise!  His  arguments are unworthy of a representative in this chamber. </para>
                <para>I believe that the objections that have been raised to this hill by another place are- so much humbug, talked by people who do not know the condition of the territory or the spirit that animates its. inhabitants. I remind honorable members that the quickest way to spread discontent and encourage communism is to deny to people the right to elect their own representatives or to have any say in their own government. </para>

                    <para>. - I endorse the sentiments expressed by the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan).</inline> It is rather strange that this matter should be brought up following the eulogy of the honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bayley),</inline> of the self-governing rights of the people of this country. The honorable member spoke at some length to express his feelings on the importance of the right of the people to govern themselves. At the time he was referring to an article that appeared in a South Australian newspaper which he alleged had attacked this institution, and urged that we should at all costs safeguard the privileges of popular representation and free speech, which were established after much sacrifice in the past. This bill was designed to confer on the people of the Northern Territory just those self-governing rights to which the honorable member referred; rights which are enjoyed by honorable members and those whom they represent. In the circumstances, I regret that the Minister and the Government have seen fit to accept the position that has been forced upon them by another place. It is as well that I should remind honorable members that  some of the rights and privileges enjoyed by the representatives of other parts of Australia are denied the representative of the Northern Territory in this chamber. </para>

                <para>I understand that when a conference of managers is convened, to deal with matters such as this, it is the usual custom for the opinion of both chambers to be expressed per medium of the conference managers.

It is, therefore, very strange to me that those in another place should reject the recommendations of its conference representatives. That has made a farce of the whole proceedings.

In dealing with this measure, he could not refrain from coupling with it thewritings of a certain extremist newspaper in Adelaide. The honorable member advanced a strong claim in favour of self-government, but in my opinion, he is more concerned with the doings of those men who have caused Darwin to be regarded as such a blot on the fair name of Australia, the " red " element. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> was quite right. As soon as there are any disorderly activities on the part of that element - such as occurred recently when the extremists insisted upon using the main street for their demonstrations instead of occupying more suitable spaces that could be allotted to them, and were in consequence dealt with by the law - the Minister for Home Affairs comes to their aid, and quashes any conviction. The honorable gentleman does that because the " red " element in the territory brings pressure to bear through the unions in the Minister's electorate. </para>

If the Government was really serious in its expressed desire to assist the Northern Territory, it should take steps to improve the civil amenities of Darwin. The town has no water supply; there is inadequate hospital provision, and no proper school accommodation at the Katherine, and if the Darwin jetty were improved, much unnecessary manhandling of cargo would be avoided, with a consequent decrease in the cost of commodities. However, it is apparent that the Minister and the honorable member for West Sydney are concerned only with pampering those who cause such a lot of trouble in the north. Recently special constables had to be sworn in to cope with that element, and they dealt with the extremists, but punishments were made later with a forebearance out of all proportion to what they deserved. </para>

                    <para>.  -  I associate myself with the remarks of the honorable members for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> and West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> notwithstanding what the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> has said. I am acquainted with some of the residents of the Northern Territory, and I know that they are not inferior to the people of any other part of Australia. Their representative in. this House is not a communist, but a man who is as intelligent as is any member of another place. E regret that the Minister brought this matter before us to-day, as owing to circumstances over which he has no control, the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson),</inline> is absent. I do not believe in taking from any section of the community the right to administer their own local affairs. For 30 years every proposal for advancement has been regarded by honorable members opposite, and those whom they represent, as undesirable agitation; it has been referred to in the same contemptuous terms as have been used by them to-day. It is regrettable that such remarks should be made whenever it is desired to liberalize the franchise. Even though the residents of Darwin might be disposed to elect a man holding advanced, or even extreme, views, the residents of other portions of the territory not so closely associated with industrial conditions, would not do so. But even if they did, they would have the right to do so. This Parliament has no right to dictate the class of person' who shall represent any section of the community; it is for the electors to return to Parliament, or to elect to other bodies, men to represent their views, whether others agree with those views or not. The greatest possible freedom should be given to the people in the matter of self-government. The proposal before us is to reject a decision unanimously made by the managers appointed by both Houses. I do not understand why the Minister should be willing to agree to the proposal of another place. He says that he does not wish to lose the bill. I submit that the members of another place should be made to accept the responsibility for rejecting the measure which  waB  sent on from this chamber. This House should not subordinate itself to another place. The reason advanced for not accepting the unanimous decision of the managers, namely, thai; the people of the territory would probably elect communists to represent them, will not bear investigation. It is ridiculous. I do not know the pros and cons of the matters referred to; nor do those honorable gentlemen opposite who have seen fit to make cheap gibes about the Minister having quashed the convictions of men found guilty of breaches of the law. No Minister of the Crown, irrespective of party, would quash a conviction without feeling that he had good ground for doing so. I regret that the Minister has seen fit to accept the Senate's amendments, and also that he has brought this matter before us to-day, in the absence of the honorable member for the Northern Territory. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the Minister, although as one of the managers appointed by this chamber to confer with those appointed by another place, I agreed with the decisions arrived at when the conference sat. With other honorable members, I agree, that the residents of the Northern Territory should be given representation ; but the area of the territory is so vast that it is difficult to do so. On one occasion, when Minister for Home and Territories, I was interviewed by a man from the Northern Territory who had had a three weeks' ride on horseback from his station before he reached the railhead. If the people of the Territory are to have representation on a council sitting at Darwin, much time will be lost by the elected representatives in getting to and from the council meetings. </para>

                        <para>- I have already admitted that. But the Minister has seen fit to accept the amendment of the Senate. The people of New Guinea are also crying out for representation; but it is difficult to accede to their request, as honorable members who have visited New Guinea will admit. We all agree that those of our people who are opening up new country in outlying places are entitled to representation^ and to whatever assistance we can give them. Nevertheless, in view of the Minister's acceptance of the Senate's amendment, I think that the committee would be justified in supporting him. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret that the Minister has agreed to the Senate's amendment, for it seemed to me a step in the right direction to give the people of the Northern Territory some measure of self-government. Whatever may be the position at Darwin, I have no fear that the people in the southern portion of the Northern Territory would elect any communist to represent them on the council. It has been urged that attendance at council meetings would necessitate a great amount of travelling, with consequent expense. In my opinion, that travelling, instead of being a reason for not granting self-government to the residents of the Northern Territory, is an argument in favour of self-government for them. I know that at least one of the three commissioners did a great amount of travelling, and that his visits were greatly appreciated by the people with, whom he came in contact. I cannot speak of the travelling done by the other commissioners. I understand that if we agree to the Senate's amendment we shall revert to the old system of control by two administrators, instead of one. </para>

I am entirely opposed to the dictation of the Senate in this instance, as I was to dictation by that body last year in connexion with certain arbitration proposals. I blame the Government for its weakness in accepting dictation from another place. It is only fair that the people of the Northern Territory should be given the right to determine the conditions under which they shall live; and, therefore, I shall not support the proposal of the Minister. Adult franchise is a most democratic principle and should not be denied to any section of the community. I oppose any alteration of the bill as it left this chamber, and I therefore intend to vote against the amendment inserted by another place. </para>

                    <para>:-  There seems to be a good deal of misconception still 'in the committee as to the reason for the attitude adopted by another place in respect of this measure. I am strongly in favour of the establishment of advisory councils, because in the case of a Crown colony - the Northern Territory being really in that position - the beginning of popular government is brought about as a general rule by the establishment of  such a body. But I know of no instance in which an advisory council in a Crown colony has been established upon the basis of manhood or adult franchise. Had the Government proceeded on different lines, a successful council, and one which would have been acceptable to this Parliament, might have been appointed. Under the present proposal all four members of the council may be residents of Darwin. </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing in the bill to prevent that from taking place. Another objection is that the four members of the council may be of one political colour. The Northern Territory is somewhat different from southern Australia, because it depends absolutely upon out- side capital, and if we set up in the Territory a form of government based upon adult franchise I venture to say that within two years a great deal of the capital now invested in that country will have been withdrawn and few white workers will be left there. I believe that if the Minister now submitted a proposal for the appointment in the Northern Territory of an advisory council, its members to be representative of particular interests, he would receive the support of all honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not, but the establishment in the Northern Territory of government by popular voice would be prejudicial to the introduction of capital, and it would, within a few years, entirely depopulate that country. I suggest that a proposal to appoint an advisory council of four members consisting of two representatives of the pastoral industry, one representative of the mining industry, and one representative of the workers in the Territory would be acceptable to all honorable members. I am glad that the Senate has seen fit to amend the bill as it left this chamber, and I trust that the Minister will insist upon his proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have the honorable member's explanation, because his few remarks were capable of a different construction. Nevertheless it is quite reasonable for members of another place to differ from the managers that they appoint. They have equal rights with members of this chamber in the discussion of all legislative and administrative matters; and if they think that the views of the managers appointed by them are capable of improvement they are at liberty to disagree and to vote accordingly. There is no ground for opposing the amendment made by another place. It is a distinct improvement on the bill as it left this chamber. I therefore support the proposal of the Minister. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not resent or dispute the right of another place to amend bills that originate in this chamber, but in this instance the position is somewhat different.We had reached the stage at which both chambers disagreed in respect of a proposed alteration of the law. The Constitution prescribes a method whereby both chambers may resolve their difficulties. It prescribes that each chamber shall appoint managers. In this instance, managers representative of all parties in this Parliament were appointed. They conferred together, and arrived at a reasonable arrangement to permit of the difficulties between both chambers being overcome. I require a substantial and convincing argument to be advanced before I am prepared to depart from the unanimous finding of those managers. It was open to another place to reject <inline font-style="italic">in toto,</inline> the decisions of the managers, but it did not do that. It regarded the report of the managers as if it were a further  amendment to the bill. When managers, knowing full well the views of their respective chambers, have succeeded in arriving at a unanimous decision I cannot agree to depart from it until an argument more substantial than that advanced by the other chamber is placed before us. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily. The fact that such conferences are provided for indicates that either House may accept or reject the recommendations of its managers. There are two main principles involved in the bill, and the greater principle, in the estimation of the Government, is the abolition of the North Australia Commission, and the substitution for it of the system of administration previously in vogue. The honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> said that it would be unwise to revert to the old system. All I have to say is that the adoption of the new system has not improved matters; in fact, it has made the government of the territory more costly and unwieldy than before. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is apparently confusing the semi governmental powers of the residents with the administration of the territory, which is quite a distinct matter. Advisory councils now function, both in North Australia and Central Australia. The administration is carried out partly by the North Australia Commission and partly by the Administrator. It is proposed that the administration shall be in the hands of one officer instead of three, as at present. </para>

                        <para>- It was never intended that all members of the advisory councils should be elected. The proposal to give a modicum of self-government to the people of the Northern Territory has nothing whatever to do with the administration. The advisory councils were permitted to give advice to the Administrator, who could accept or reject it as he thought fit. </para>

                <para>The Government considers it essential to abolish the North Australia Commission. This has been agreed to in another place, but the other portion of the measure relating to the advisory councils has not been accepted. While I agree that the people of the territory should have some kind of representation, the question arises whether, if the Government cannot secure the passage of the whole of the bill, it should lose the opportunity to have the more important part of it put into law. According to representations by the Public Service Board and the Auditor-General's Department, the alterations proposed under the measure would effect a saving of £8,000 a year. In the opinion of the Government, an effective and economical system of administration is proposed, but we are prepared to forgo, for the time being, the provisions relating to the advisory councils. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn),</inline> and the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> have made certain statements alleging interference on my part with the administration of justice in the Northern Territory, and I keenly resent what they have said. The honorable member for Balaclava rarely takes trouble to ascertain the facts of the cases that he discusses, but when an honorable member with a legal training, such as the honorable member for Perth, takes even greater liberties with truth, one wonders whether his legal training is comparable with that which usually distinguishes members of the profession of the law. The honorable member for Perth said that I had interfered with the course of justice at Darwin, and that, at the behest of trade unions at Broken Hill,, </para>
                <para class="block">I had released certain men. That statement is not correct, and I suggest that the honorable member should withdraw it. As a matter of fact, certain organizations at Broken Hill asked me to do something which I refused to do. I think that the honorable member should accept my assurance in the matter. Any remissions of fines or sentences granted by me in the Northern Territory have been based on a strict sense of justice. I recently took part in an election campaign in New South Wales, during which I spoke in about twenty country towns, both large and small. In no less than three instances the traffic was diverted from the main streets in which the meetings were held, and the people accepted that procedure as entirely proper; hut, on my return to Canberra, I found that, because of obstruction of traffic in the streets of Darwin, certain men had been arrested. I could not agree that that action was justified, and; therefore, I took the necessary steps to have the prosecutions withdrawn. At no time have I done anything against the best interests of justice in the territory. </para>

                            <para>- It is one of the duties that increase the revenue. Bond stores cost a good deal, and the operationof this duty has resulted in the establishment of additional bond stores. This, in turn, has led to an increase in revenue. Certain people who have not bottled in bond have paid the extra duty, and thus increased the revenue. </para>

                            <para>- Bottling in bond under customs supervision will be an additional check. " House " whisky can be a product of illicit stills, or Australian whisky, or cheap imported whisky, or a blend of all three. The only condition the hotelkeeper has to observe is to keep the whisky up to the stipulated alcoholic strength. If he puts cheap imported or illicit still whisky into a decanter and observes the standard of alcoholic strength, no action can be taken by the inspector. The recognized proprietary brands are bottled in bond under customs supervision and check samples are submitted to the health authorities. By comparison with the check samples, the inspector can determine whether the whisky in bottle is true to check sample. </para>

                            <para>- Excluding rum, at least 95 per cent, of the total spirits sold are bottled brands. The number of hotelkeepers who have a sufficient trade in their own bottled brands to require the whole time service of a bottler is very limited ; probably there are not more than 25 of them in the whole of Australia. One objection taken to the new duty is that pilfering from the cases occurs between the bond store and the hotel. It is true that a bottle of whisky can be removed from a case in a railway yard, or on a wharf, but that evil is no greater than the pillaging of casks. In Brisbane a few years ago a hole was bored in a cask on the wharf, a tap inserted, and the whole of the contents drawn off. Another practice is to shift one of the hoops, bore a hole in the cask, draw off two or three gallons of whisky, plug the hole, and knock the hoop back over it. When that is done, the consignee may never know that he has been robbed. The hotelkeeper is able to tell whether a case has been interfered with, for if the contents rattle when the case is shaken, he knows that a bottle has been removed. We shall be told that efficient inspection is being carried out by the various State Governments. Statistics prove that in some of the States there is very little supervision, whilst in others, where the number of licences is large, the inspectors are far too few <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> supervise .the trade efficiently. In New South Wales there are two liquor inspectors under the control of the Health Department. The number of victuallers' licences is approximately 2,200, and they are distributed over the whole State. In Victoria, there is one liquor inspector, controlled by the Health Department; the licences in that State are: victuallers, 1,803; grocers, 258; clubs, 122; railway refreshment rooms, 32, and steam packet, 6; a total of 2,221 retail licences, apart from wholesale licences. In Queensland the liquor inspection is a small portion of the duties of food inspectors, and, therefore, the supervision is anything but efficient. The number of victuallers' licences alone is 1,350. There are no liquor inspectors in South Australia, liquor inspecting being a portion of the duties of health inspectors, who have to supervise also milk, meat, and other foods. In that State -650 hotels are licensed. In Western Australia, the liquor inspection is in the hands of two inspectors who are under the control of the Police Department. In Tasmania, there are approximately 400 licensed victuallers, and there again the control of liquor standards is in the hands of food inspectors, and is only a small portion of their duties. The additional os. a gallon on spirits bottled out of bond will encourage the bottling of spirits under customs supervision, and will, to some extent, protect the public against imposition and fraud. </para>

                            <para>- An officer of the department is at present investigating this matter, and it has been found that there has been an increase in revenue as a result of the duty. It has also resulted in the opening of additional bond stores in which liquor is bottled under supervision. This condition will have its repercussions in other industries, in as much as the demand for bottles, cases and straw envelopes will be largely increased. Moreover, it will be the means of increasing the revenue -where importers do not take advantage of the lower rates operating under the bottling provisions. Bottling under supervision was made subject to by-law in the resolution of the 26th of March, 1931. This action was taken for the purpose of giving the department full control over bottling operations, and also to enable it to prescribe the strength of spirits which may be bottled at the lower rate of duty. It had been found that, in order to obtain the benefit of the lower rates, importers were bottling the spirits at proof and overproof, and after duty had been paid, the bottled spirit was poured back into casks, and broken down in strength before being sold to the public. As the object of the item was being defeated, the by-law provision was added to prevent importers adopting such methods. Honorable members must not overlook the fact that in the excise tariff provision is made for full control over the manufacture of spirit. For instance, Item 2 (r&gt;) provides - </para>

                            <para>- It is difficult to ascertain the actual number. Some of them are employing four or five, others three or four, and others less. The Customs Department to-day is experiencing grave difficulty in policing our excise regulations. An increasing number of persons is making whisky in the backyard, on the farm, or elsewhere. The Comptroller-General of Customs advises me that the illicit distilling of whisky is on the increase. Those who make the whisky have to get rid of it somehow, and if they are able to dispose of it to hotelkeepers who mix it with an Australian whisky or some cheap imported brand, customers who are served with it out of a decanter on the counter have no means of knowing what they are drinking. This provision requiring a higher duty to be paid unless the whisky is bottled in bond under customs supervision goes some way to meet the recommendations of the Melbourne Health Conference held under the aegis of the Bruce-Page Government. That conference recommended that the Government should forbid the sale of whisky not bottled under government supervision.

                            <para>- The honorable member knows that the British duty is much higher than the Australian duty, and now that the Government needs all the revenue it can obtain it would not be advisable to reduce this duty. I ask the committee not to agree to this proposal, nor to the proposal which will be made later to reduce the duty on imported whisky by 12s. a gallon. That proposal will be advocated on the ground that it will reduce the price of a nip of whisky by Id., and will thus encourage the drinking of more whisky. I doubt whether it will have the effect claimed for it, and it would mean a loss of £300,000 to £375,000 a year in Customs revenue. The Government cannot agree to the loss of so much revenue at the present time. </para>

                        <para>.- The proposal before the committee is that the import duty of 45s. on brandy should be increased to 50s. when the imported spirit is not bottled in bond. An amendment has been moved to revert to the original position. I. am surprised at the action of the Government, first in having proposed to increase the duty, and then in having insisted upon the increase. In the course of a debate on the Northern Territory bill this afternoon we, on this side of the House, were charged with being concerned with the big pastoral interests in the north. If ever there was a pandering to big interests in any trade, it is to be found in the Government's support of the big whisky importing interests by the imposition of this additional 5s. a gallon duty. The really big Scotch associated distillers bottle all their whisky in bond. In the propaganda which they are distributing to members at the present time they assert that they have used no influence with the Government to bring about this additional impost of 5s. I am sorry to say that that is not so. I had this case before me here in Canberra two years ago. I have no quarrel with those interests, but I feel in duty bound to state what happened. They strongly urged me to agree to an additional import duty of 5s. a gallon </para>

                    <para>On  imported whisky not bottled in bond. Obviously their object was to weaken the competition of other whisky-importing firms. This increased duty constituted a very definite penalty upon every seller of bulk whisky in Australia. This increased duty meant nothing to them, but it did penalize their competitors who imported in bulk, and paid duty on bulk. The Government has been levying an extra toll of 5s. a gallon on every importer of bulk whisky, whether a hotelkeeper or wine and spirit merchant, and has, in my opinion, brought about a change for the worse in the selling and consumption of whisky. Despite what the Minister has said, the bottling of whisky  in  bond does not necessarily guarantee its purity. We all know that the best grades of whisky in this or any other country are not sold in bottles, excepting in small quantities. Any person wishing to get the least harmful whisky possible will buy high-grade bulk whisky. We have in Australia a considerable number of old-fashioned and honorable wine and spirit merchants, who have been carrying on a wholesale trade in whisky and other spirits, selling a few gallons at a time to pastoralists and other persons who prefer to buy their whisky in bulk. Those firms are being penalized by this extra 5s. duty, and many of them are being driven out of business. This measure discriminates unfairly against those who are importing the best and purest whisky at the present time. I wish to say nothing against the proprietary whisky bottled in bond, but everybody knows that it is not really old whisky. It is relatively new and, relatively, not so good as that sold in bulk. In the interests of the wine and spirit merchants, who may be classed as the most reputable of liquor traders, and of those engaged in the sale of bulk whisky whether it be known as house whisky or otherwise, the committee should not sanction this increased duty on whisky not bottled in bond. The duty constitutes a grave interference with the liberty of the subject. It will not operate in the interests of temperance, nor will it guarantee the purity of the whisky sold. The Minister said that it would make it more difficult to dispose of illicitly distilled spirit. I cannot agree with that contention. If those who make such whisky are prepared, with the connivance of the publicans, to cheat the Customs, they will not sell the whisky in bulk, but will put it into Dewar's and Buchanan's bottles, or into those of other firms. It would be only another step for them, having broken the law in one respect, to go a little further and pass off their whisky as one of the proprietary brands. I also challenge the statement of the Minister that it is the duty of the excise officers to check all whisky sold, to see that it is true to label. Their duty is only to determine its purity and strength. </para>

                            <para>- In the various States special machinery exists for checking house whisky and other draft whisky, and the checking is done just as carefully as when the? whisky is in bottles bearing well-known labels. No guarantee of purity is provided by the imposition of this extra duty. In my opinion, the Government is going outside its proper sphere altogether, and is concerning itself with what is really one of the proper activities of the States. What business is it of the Minister to exercise supervision over the sale of spirits in hotels? There would be as much justification for Commonwealth supervision of the retail milk supply for the people of Australia. Not one reason has been advanced to justify this change, which, as I have said, has been made on the representations of the big whisky importers. Possibly it is something in the nature of a sop to them for the great increase in duties which importers of spirits have to pay on gin. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister is referring to an entirely different matter. As one reason for the change, the Minister said something about the additional employment which the new duties would provide. Figures which have been supplied to me prove the contrary condition to have arisen. One statement, relating to the number of employees engaged in the bottling and distributing of imported and other spirits in New South Wales, shows that in November, 1929, the number of employees in bond and bottling warehouses was 350, while in March of this year it was only 229. </para>

                            <para>- The figures which I have quoted show that there has been a decrease in employment since this duty was imposed. I come now to the question of revenue. Even in the prosperous years just before we began to feel the effects of the depression, the increased whisky duties did not check .the steady downward trend in revenue. It is obvious, therefore, that this increase from 45s. to 50s. will mean less revenue. Many people who approve of restrictions being imposed on the use of alcohol, will commend these higher duties on spirits. I do not propose to discuss .that aspect of the matter at this stage. The point I wish to emphasize is that these increases have been responsible for a decline in revenue, without any compensating advantage in the way of additional employment, as the Minister has suggested. Possibly there has been a slight increase from licence-fees for additional bond houses, but that is a relatively minor matter, and will not affect materially the deficit of approximately £20,000,000 for the current financial year. It is regrettable that the Government should have played right into the hands of the biggest whisky combine in the world. This particular duty strikes a definite blow at a great many traders in this country, and it will do nothing to improve the quality of the whisky consumed in Australia. On the contrary, it will limit the consumption, of the good quality draught whisky; it will restrict rather than extend employment, and will mean a substantial loss in revenue. I hope that the committee will agree to the amendment which has been  moved by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn).</inline></para>

                        <para>.- I very much regret that the Minister did not submit these new spirit duties to the Tariff Board for investigation and report. We should then have had an open inquiry, and been in a better position to judge the merits of the duty now under consideration. The circumstances surrounding the imposition of these duties on spirits arouse suspicion concerning the bona fides of many of the Government's tariff proposals. As the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> has explained, this additional duty on bottled imported whisky benefits one of the biggest combines in the world. The principle was introduced first in the excise regulations. In that form it benefited a well known Australian company in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Wren is largely interested. In the general debate on the tariff, I quoted figures showing how this discrimination between one set of distillers and another benefited particularly the Federal Distilleries Limited, and when the committee is considering the excise tariff, I shall make a more detailed examination of the proposal. The introduction of this principle in the November excise tariff of 1929 caused great consternation among publicans and wine and spirit merchants, and as a result of the agitation which followed, a circular was sent to every member of this Parliament from the Licensed Victuallers Association of Queensland, explaining how the new proposal affected its members. A little later, in another tariff schedule, this objectionable principle of discriminating in favour of the big interests to the detriment of smaller traders was extended to imported spirits. Since this attempt to distinguish between spirits bottled in bond and spirits removed from bond in bulk is not, strictly speaking, a revenue question, it should have been submitted to the Tariff Board. Had that course been taken and an investigation made, we should not have heard many of the rumours that have been in circulation during the last eighteen months with regard to this and many other items in the schedule. In its original form the duty applied to gin, whisky and brandy. Strangely enough the brandy makers did not ask for it. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that someparticularly the big brandy makers - derive some benefit from it, and naturally they are now well disposed towards this discriminating duty. Some have told me that they approve of it, but they have also said that they did not ask for it. It is interesting to note that rum, which is produced in Queensland, has been omitted from the list of spirits upon which this handicap has been imposed. The Minister has said that if we could advance any good reason why rum should be included, the Government would consider it. I am not suggesting that rum should be added to the list. I content myself with protesting against the action of the Government in requiring the smaller traders in other potable spirits imported or produced in Australia to bear the expense of this economic waste, in the interests of the bigger concerns. The principle is most objectionable. It is regrettable that all these new spirit duties were not referred to the Tariff Board for investigation and report. By failing to take this course, the Minister, I suggest, did not observe the provisions of the Tariff Board Act, which require him to refer to the board for inquiry and report any request for, among other things, new, increased or reduced duties, or the deferment of existing or proposed deferred duties. It cannotbe claimed that this duty is revenue-producing. The Minister has admitted that its effect on the revenue is trivial, the only additional revenue received from it being in respect of licensing fees for a few extra bonded stores. It is also an infringement of the spirit of the Constitution, which by section 113 lays it down that the control of alcoholic liquor is specifically reserved to the individual States. Under . the hollow pretence of imposing a revenue duty, the Government is introducing something which it professes is in the interest of the  control of liquor, but which really has the effect of helping the big interests in the trade. </para>

                    <para>This duty is especially objected to by licensed victuallers, who are not able to carry on their bottling operations as they have done in the past, with an ordinary staff during a slack period. Any bottling they now require to be done has to be carried on under bond conditions. The Minister has said that there are not more than 25 hotels that can afford to run a bonded store in which to carry on these operations. That means that practically all the liquor must be bought in bottles. Then there are the smaller merchants who do not import the big proprietary brands, but who purchase superlative quality whiskies which do not have to be advertised expensively for the purpose of effecting sales. These smaller merchants are put to very considerable expense by having to keep a bonded store. In many cases this regulation is an inducement to prepare whisky for market in such a manner as to prevent its being bottled under the best conditions. When whisky is imported, it is considerably stronger than when it is sold, and it is broken down by being diluted with a certain quantity of distilled water. To be properly broken down, that diluting process should occupy several days. The time taken in this operation does not matter very greatly when a large quantity of whisky is being handled and the bonded store is being used almost continuously. But the expense to a small merchant having a customs representative present while the whisky is being broken down is very considerable, and there is a strong inducement to bottle the whisky before it and the distilled water have been completely " married ". That alone is a severe handicap on the smaller merchant, and is one of the reasons why this form of duty recommends itself and gives a comparative benefit to those who import on a very large scale. Then again, some of the principal advocates of bottling in bond- I do not say that this applies to the Scotch combine - partially avoid expense by the use of a comparatively cheap capsule and label. Upon delivery, the whisky is poured either into a cask or into the publican's bottles, the distiller's bottles then being returned at a trifling expense. From that it will be seen that this boasted protection of the public really amounts to nothing. </para>

                            <para>- It is too expensive for small people in the cities, as well as for country people. A direct obstacle is being offered to the sale of spirit, because its cost is raised. It is an example of economic waste, resulting in the contraction of consumption. It makes the article sold more expensive, and in the long run increases unemployment. </para>

                    <para>I strongly support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn),</inline> first of all because the cost of marketing whisky, brandy and gin is increased and their consumption correspondingly reduced. In addition, a large number of people are being prevented from making a livelihood, and the revenue is being prejudicially affected. Secondly - and this is a very important point - the tendency is to increase the number of public officials. The Minister boasted about the number of new bonded stores there would be, and of the work that would be provided. Only government officials will secure employment. If it were good for the country to increase the cost of goods by adding to the number of government officials employed there might be something in it; but I do not believe that it is, and I am quite certain that the prosperity of the country will not be increased. But my greatest objection is that this duty further enriches the richest section of the trade - the big importing combines - and makes it difficult for the smaller merchants who handle some of the superlative Scotch whiskies to remain in business. Lastly, apart from what has been done on behalf of the Scotch combine, the track is covered of the particular Australian firm which derived the greatest benefit when this principle was first introduced into our excise law. I hope that the committee will accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- The amendment- has a great deal to commend it. The lowering of the standard of the alcoholic liquor distributed among the community would, undoubtedly, lead to extraordinary demoralization. But the suggestion of the Minister in that direction is not borne out by the facts. The distribution of alcoholic liquor at the present time is such that those who consume it do so with a sense of security because of the close supervision that is exercised over its distribution by the State authorities. If there were any guarantee that this was a protection to the public it would be worth while. </para>

                            <para>- I never drink  whisky.  That, however, does not imply  that  I am influenced by the big brewing  or  distributing monopolies in a way that would prevent me from applying common sense to the consideration of this question. An evil that is developing in connexion with the distribution of alcoholic liquors  in  Australia is the private " trustification " of the different factors associated with their importation and manufacture. There is little doubt that if this attitude is persisted in, the tendency will be  to  curtail the distribution in small bulk  lots.  No action of mine will place  a  handicap upon those who are- suffering inconvenience from that over-capitalization. If there is a private trust which operates tyrannically, it is that represented by the great importing and brewing monopolies in the Commonwealth. I propose to vote against the additional duty, and to support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn).</inline></para>

                        <para>.- I have been rather interested in the. discussion that has taken place on this, the first item of the tariff. It appears to me that it has given the lie direct to the whole of the election propaganda of the Labour party at the last election, and also to subsequent statements made on behalf of that party regarding what would happen when its tariff was introduced. It will be remembered that the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> stressed before numerous audiences at the last election the iniquity of the action of the Bruce-Page Government in having imposed a tax of 2s. a gallon on whisky. He assured his hearers everywhere that a Labour government would place no duty upon the food and the drink of the people, especially the working class; that liquor and tobacco would be exempt, and that any additional revenue found to be necessary would be obtained in other ways. Now the Minister has asked the committee not to reduce this duty, because the revenue would be lowered. </para>

                            <para>- The industry under discussion provides a typical instance of what has actually happened as a result of the Government's tariff proposals. In so far as the distillation of spirit is concerned, possibly 24 or 25 additional men have been provided with employment, while approximately 2,000 men who were previously engaged in the handling and distribution of spirituous liquors have been thrown out of work. It is estimated that in. New South "Wales 606 fewer persons are now engaged in the handling and distribution of spirit than was the case eighteen months ago. The Minister frequently stated that thousands of additional men would be provided with work, but the facts in this instance disclose that as a result of the higher duties imposed employment has been seriously curtailed. </para>

                    <para>I have yet to learn that this Parliament is the place in which effect should be given to the desires of commercial combines in this country. The duty now under discussion has been imposed to encourage' the bottling of spirits in bond, but it benefits only certain commercial combines, and is of absolute detriment to those engaged in the business in a small way, such as wine and spirit merchants and hotelkeepers generally. I wish to register my protest against any action which is against the interests of small men, who are as much entitled to consideration as are those engaged, in business on an extensive scale. The Minister, in making a futile attempt to justify the retention of this rate, based his argument on the necessity of only the purest liquor being made available to the public. Surely he recognizes that the purity or otherwise of spirituous or other beverages is a matter for the State authorities. It is his duty to prove that, whisky bottled out of bond is not so pure as that bottled under the supervision of excise officers, and until he can do so the committee should give those engaged in business in a small way the benefit of the doubt. I am glad to see that the amendment moved by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> is to receive support from a quarter from which we do not usually expect it. Fair play is bonny play, and I trust that a majority of the committee will support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- I was rather 'surprised that the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> who is a medical practitioner, should discuss this subject from the employment standpoint rather than from that of public health, which is of paramount importance. When I was abroad some yeai'3 ago I had the opportunity and privilege of inspecting certain British industries, including the whisky distilleries of John Power and Sons in Dublin. During my inspection, the process of distillation was fully explained to me by one of the firm's representatives, who assured me that only the best of ingredients were used, and that they were blended in the most scientific manner. I said that in such circumstances whisky should be a healthy beverage, and he informed me that it was, but it must be good. As the object of the Government in this instance is to ensure that the public shall bc supplied with a pure spirit only, the proposed duty should be adopted. In my younger days I was employed in gold-mining. During a severe epidemic of influenza the position became so serious, ten or twelve or more men falling sick daily, that I conferred with my mate, who occupied an adjoining hut, when we decided that the best preventive was whisky. We purchased a bottle, which at the time could be bought for 7s. 6d., which we shared, and we were the only two out of 400 who were not affected. . During the war, influenza, in a very severe form, was raging throughout Europe, and a conference of medical men, held in London, recommended good whisky as the best cure. From, that time whisky was ordered for those who were suffering from that complaint, but it was distinctly stipulated that the whisky must be of good quality. As the imposition of this duty is to ensure that only brandy of the best quality shall be available, and as that is the main consideration, I intend to support the duty provided in the schedule. </para>

                        <para>. - I was somewhat in doubt as to how to vote on this item, seeing that the commodity involved is a luxury, and revenue is needed, but after hearing the remarks of some honorable members, particularly to the effect that under these duties revenue has decreased, I feel that a reduction in the rates may result in higher revenue being obtained. It is extraordinary to find the Government imposing an additional 5s. per gallon on all brandy bottled out of bond upon the flimsy excuse that such an imposition will assist to protect the health of the people. Many honorable members are aware that it was once the practice of whisky consumers to travel a considerable distance to visit some sturdy old publican who retailed a particularly good whisky from bulk supplies. It is remarkable to find that the proposal of the Government in this instance operates only in the interests of big commercial combines, to which honorable members opposite were once very strongly opposed. . Apparently, the Government is entirely disregarding the interests of the smaller men. The late  President  Wilson 'once said that if big corporations contribute £50,000 towards party funds they naturally expect their interests to be safeguarded. Whose interests are being protected in this case? We have a good idea as to who were being looked after in connexion with certain excise duties. If one-half of what we have heard is correct, it is fairly clear that- </para>

As has been pointed' out, the payment of an extra 5s. a gallon purchases the privilege of poisoning the people at will; so long as the Government gets the extra 5s. a gallon, the people do not matter.

                            <para>- Then it is similar to the embargo on galvanized iron ! The committee would fail in its duty if it allowed this item to pass. For years the same amount of duty has been charged on whisky brought here in bulk; but the ordinary trader is no longer permitted to import whisky in the way that he imported it in the past. Why should he not have the same right to poison the  people as is given to the big combine ? I hope that the committeewill insist on the duty on all whisky entering Australia in bulk being the same, irrespective of the persons importing it. In view of the need for increased revenue, I am prepared to tax luxuries even more than at present; but it does appear that the big increase in the duties on spirits has decreased, rather than increased, the revenue. The Government would do well to consider a reduction of duties on spirits generally. </para>

In December, 1929, the wine and spirit section of the Brisbane Merchants Association communicated with the then Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> in regard to the duty on whisky.

                        <para>At a meeting of members of the wine and spirit section of the Brisbane Merchants Association held recently, the. special excise of duty of5s. pergallon imposed by your Government was given great consideration owing to the far-reaching effect it is going to have upon the trade generally. For instance, at present nearly every merchant in the State bottles his wines and spirits in his own store, out of bond. Under the new regulation, this proeadure will be abolished unless a merchant has his own bond. In Queensland, there are only one or two firms with their own bond - the cost of licence and customs attention being prohibitive for the average firm. Therefore they will all be compelled to either cease business or purchase their requirements in a cased condition from the distillers in the southern States. </para>
                        <para>Most of the wine and spirit houses will have to dispense with easily one-third of their present bottling staff, as it will be impossible to compete with the southern distillers, who will bottle under bond. This factor is not the only aspect to be considered. Take the following: - </para>

                            - The printers in Queensland will receive no orders for printing wine and spirit labels, as these will be supplied from Melbourne, as the goods will arrive ready for sale to the hotelkeepers.
                        </para>

                            - Neither the bottle merchants nor the local bottle works will be necessary to the wineand spirit trade if the present5s. excise impost is not repealed.
                        </para>

                            - The bottle, glassworks, and printing carters must be affected by the regulation.
                        </para>
                        <para>In fact, all trades in any way connected with the wine and spirit business must feel in a few months that this new tariff regula tion is a serious matter. It will increase unemployment, and will mean that in place of the various wine and spirit stores all employing bottling staffs, they will only be acting as distributors for the southern manufacturers. In the past, the various wholesale wine and spirit merchants have bottled in their own stores without any penalty, and our members would respectfully ask you to use your efforts so that this 5s. bottling under bond impost is removed. At present they are subject to constant inspection by the Health Department, all their wine and spirit departments being compelled to be up to requirements, and the records prove that the members of this association have honorably conducted their businesses. We feel that with your assistance, members will be able to remedy their troubles. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with the right honorable member forCowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> that this is a most extraordinary proposal, coming from a. Government which practically won the election on the promise of its campaign director in New South "Wales that no additional duties would be placed on spirits and tobacco if a Labour government were returned. The Government whichmade that promise has imposed duties so high that they have resulted in a loss of revenue to the Commonwealth as well as a loss of employment to many Australian citizens. It is time that a strong protest was made against the non-fulfilment of the promises made at election time. The Minister has not justified the retention of this duty. As has been pointed out, the Government's proposal is in the interests of certain combines in this country. </para>

                            <para>- Before the dinner adjournment I was pointing out that the Minister has failed to justify the retention of this additional duty on whisky. The honorable gentleman took up a great deal of time in explaining that the duty was imposed as a safeguard to the public health, following upon certain recommendations that were made by a commission which investigated our pure foods legislation. I .submit that that consideration does not arise in a taxation measure such as this. These additional duties are imposed not to safeguard the public health, but purely for taxation purposes, to obtain more revenue for the government of the country. It has been pointed out repeatedly by honorable members on this side of the chamber that this additional impost is distinctly in the interests of the great whisky combine, and is detrimental to those of the retailers and smaller trades people. Why should the Government manifest this great care and interest on behalf of that combine? </para>

                    <para>My only interest in this matter is  a  desire to obtain additional revenue for the country, and to provide more employment. I submit that by retaining this duty the Government will not only reduce its revenue, at  a  time when more is badly needed, but that it will also decrease employment to  a  community that is already suffering severely from unemployment as a result of the policy of this Government. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot work up any particular enthusiasm for the interests of the liquor trade. In my opinion there can be only two reasons to justify the Minister in persisting with these duties, the health of the general public, and the obtaining of additional revenue. The Minister has stated that he is acting on the recommendations of a certain health conference that was held in Melbourne some time ago, but he admitted that he was adopting only portion of those recommendations. It would be interesting to discover precisely the nature  of  the recommendations that are being adopted, and those which the honorable gentleman prefers to ignore. It is well-known that the Government is exceedingly impecunious and is looking about in all directions for additional revenue. Unfortunately, the Minister has not taken the committee into his confidence by stating how much revenue it has derived from these duties, and what are his future expectations. That information is necessary if the committee is to arrive at a reasonable conclusion in the  matter. </para>

                    <para>Some little time ago I received correspondence that had passed between the Brisbane Customs Department and  a  Queensland firm that is importing " Cairns " whisky  - a  very superior article, for which there are not many agencies in the Commonwealth. The firm concerned is in a country district, and asked that it should be allowed to' bottle this whisky, under the supervision of the police. Its request was refused by the  Customs  Department, which stated that it would be necessary to send  a  Customs officer to that country town to supervise the bottling, all expenses incurred to be paid by the firm. That, of course, was an impossible arrangement, as it would unduly increase the price of the articles </para>
                    <para>I urge the Minister to accede to the very strong representations which have been made to him in this matter by the retailers. I am aware that the Government is very desirous of making ends meet, but this is a very poor and inadequate method. It is quite evident that the Government hoped to obtain increased: revenue from this source, but from thefigures I have been able to obtain it would appear that the only result is the creation of embarrassment and unnecessary expense to the retail trade, and that no protection has been given to the whisky industry. I suggest that the Minister should make a more satisfactory reply than he has done to the criticism that has been levelled at the imposition of this duty. </para>

                        <para>. -  I support the action of the Government in this matter. When the Government assumed office it found the exchequer very short of revenue, and examined every avenue in an effort to discover ways and means to supplement its income. It very naturally turned to the Customs Department, and whisky was one of the first items chosen upon which to impose a heavy duty. It must be kept in mind that the people of Australia stand for a policy of protection. I disagree entirely with those who maintain that this additional duty is intended to bolster up the interests of the whisky combine. However, irrespective of whether that is so or not, the Government has to find revenue, and it considers the imposition of this additional 5s. a gallon on imported whisky not bottled in bond a reasonable one. </para>

                            <para>- If that is so, the logical action is to reduce the excise duty. If one or the other is done, the revenue of the country must diminish materially. Further, if the duty were reduced tomorrow a nobbier of whisky would not cost a farthing- less than it does now. An honorable member says something about Dewar's whisky. That has always been considered a very good whisky, although I am ' not a whisky connoisseur. But we have to bear in mind that spirit manufactured in Australia compares;  after maturing for a few years, more than favorably with the whiskies manufactured in Scotland. </para>

The usual brands of whisky, brandy, and rum manufactured in Australia compare favorably with the spirit obtainable in any part of the world. The Government is in need of revenue, and if this duty is removed, it will have to obtain the lost revenue from somewhere else. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware that it is impossible for every one to bottle ; but I am concerned about the revenue aspect of the subject. If this duty is removed, the retail price of a nobbler of whisky will not be reduced. It must be remembered that the duty was imposed chiefly to provide revenue. The Government was and is in urgent needof money. If the duty is removed, the loss in revenue will probably be between £20,000 and £30,000 per annum. I urge the committee to agree to the item. If subsequent experience shows that the duty inflicts an injustice on those who have no facilities for bottling whisky, the Government can review the matter. I support the item, first, because I am a protectionist; secondly, because the Government needs revenue, and, thirdly, because the removal of the impost will not cheapen the price of whisky. </para>

                        <para>.- I make a final appeal to the committee to support the amendment. The issue is simple. I cannot understand the attitude of the Government. There is no case for the imposition of this duty on the ground which the Minister has suggested, that it is necessary from a revenue point of view, as will be shown when we are debating the principal whisky item. In recent years, every time the duty on whisky has been raised, the revenue has suffered, because the consumption of whisky has been seriously reduced. The issue before us is between two parties. . One party has been described, and properly so I am afraid, as the whisky combine, though I do not use the term in a sinistersense. This party is composed of the five great Scottish whisky firms: - James Buchanan and Company Limited, John Dewar and Sons, Limited, Distillers Agency Limited, John Walker and Sons Limited, and White Horse Distillers Limited. The other party consists of small Australian business men - thousands of licensed victuallers and thousands of wine and spirit merchants throughout the country. These are the conflicting parties. The imposition of this 5s. extra duty on imported whisky not bottled in bond severely penalizes thousands of business men domiciled in Australia, and with capital invested in this country; but it confers a substantial benefit upon the big whisky combine domiciled on the other side of the world, and with all its capital there. </para>

                            <para>- But thousands of our own people have invested their money in the business here, and they are being penalized by this duty. In a great many instances, they can no longer carry on business as direct importers. It is a gross interference with the liberty of the Australian business man to say that he shall no longer import bulk whisky without incurring a penalty of 5s. per gallon. I appeal to honorable members opposite to support the amendment, because it is in the interests of thousands of Australian people who have invested all their money in Australia. Surely the interests of these should be considered in preference to the interests of the great millionaire whisky trust, the shareholders of which are all on the other side of the world. It is remarkable that this Government, of all governments, should be fighting so aggressively and pugnaciously in the interest of this millionaire concern in Great Britain, and against the interests of thousands of our own people in Australia. I know where this application came from, for it came to me from these very companies, when I was Minister for Trade and Customs. And it  came from no one else. It was never even suggested to me that the imposition of this duty would serve any other interests than those of the people who made the application. When the proposal was put to me I laughed at it, because it was so absurd. I told the applicants that it was an impossible proposition. They must have thought that I was very young, or very simple, or very new in my department to expect that I would agree to such a proposition. The choice between the conflicting interests was so obvious. Why should the great Scottish whisky firms be not only exporters from overseas, but also importers, retailers and bottlers in Australia? Why should not our own licensed victuallers and wine and spirit merchants buy whisky wholesale in Great Britain if they desire to do so? Every other retailer in this country can buy wholesale overseas. Why should not our licensed victuallers and wine and spirit merchants be permitted to. buy whisky, brandy, and gin at their discretion at the source of supply? Why should they be dependent on these five millionaire firms, and be obliged to take from them such supplies as the combine cares to dole out to them at a fixed price? The whole thing is an outrage upon Australian business interests, and it is amazing that this Government should expect even its own supporters to vote for the proposal. </para>

                            <para>- Most honorable members know that the best, purest, and least injurious whisky in this country is that which is sold here in bulk. Before the imposition of this duty a man who had £10 to spend on whisky and who placed an order with one of the wine and spirit merchants for a quantity of bulk whisky, obtained better whisky in that way than he would have done by spending the money on battled whisky. It is the ABC of the whisky trade that bulk whisky is to be preferred to bottled whisky. Everybody who knows anything about the whisky trade knows that the proprietary bottled whisky is a relatively new, though sound, whisky. If a person wants the whisky which is least harmful to the consumer, he obtains bulk whisky every time. We know very well that every reputable wine and spirit merchant established for any length of time in our country towns takes a pride in selling a good draught whisky. Such firms used to import quantities of such whisky, and retail it in small quantities to the country people as one of their specialities. In the great majority of cases, it was regarded as a very good whisky. But since the imposition of this duty, many of these firms have lost that trade, and some of them are going out of the business. </para>

He will soon discover from them that a rank injustice has been done to such firms, some of which have been in the business nearly 100 years. Such firms have been in the habit of selling bulk quantities of their particular whisky to pastoralists and others outback; but now they have to pay a duty of 5s. per gallon for the right to do this business. </para>

I am amazed that this so-called democratic Government) should have imposed this duty, which is opposed by the licensed victuallers. It is one of the most outrageous little things ever done. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker),</inline> who is interjecting, would be well advised to consider how the barleygrowers in his electorate will regard his attitude on this subject. In making insinuations against what he calls the whisky combine, he is reflecting upon the Australian distilleries, which are the principal buyers of the barley grown in his electorate. The barley-growers of Australia are keenly interested in. this subject, and the honorable member will find it difficult satisfactorily to explain his position to these producers, for he is levelling a serious indictment against them this evening. The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> when he mentions certain names in an effort to bolster up his pet theory, is using a poor form of argument. What has the name of any person to do with the 'building up of an Australian industry? Practically all imported whisky arrives in bulk. It is put into bond, and the importer may do one of two things. He may bottle it in bond under the supervision of the Customs Department, or he may bottle it out of bond in which case an additional duty of 5s. a gallon is imposed. He has then a free hand to do what he likes with the whisky. I am not imputing motives, but I say that the door is left open to him to sell whisky that is not true to label. </para>

                            <para>- That is an argument in favour of increasing the tax. In any case, the tax is a deterrent only. We do not inflict it upon the imported' so long as he is prepared to give a guarantee that the article he sells is true to label. Is not the public deserving of some consideration in this matter ? Is it not entitled, in regard to the whisky that it purchases, to the same guarantee of quality that it receives in regard to its purchases of bread, butter, or anything else! </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is wrong again. The licensed victuallers of Victoria recently passed a resolution in favour of taxing whisky bottled out of bond. They did that in the public interests. The honorable member for Henty also said that this tax imposes a hardship on the hotelkeepers in regard to the sale of house whisky. I cannot understand that argument, because statistics show that of the spirits sold in Australia about 70 per  cent.  represents single bottle sales due, no doubt, to the early closing laws, the greater part of the balance representing nobbier sales over the counter. By far the .greater proportion of these bottled spirits would be proprietary brands. About 5 per cent, would represent sales of bulk or house whisky. In view of those figures, I fail to see that any great injustice is being inflicted upon the hotelkeepers who are selling house whisky, in  consequence  of  the imposition of this taxation. I cannot understand why the honorable member should not be anxious to. protect public interests, because the public has. the right to get an article true to label whether it be butter, bread, whisky, or anything else. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker)</inline> made a moat amazing attack upon a local industrythe Australian distilleries. He, evidently, does not want this industry to be established in this country. The statistics show that an enormous quantity of barley is consumed by these distilleries; and upon making inquiries, I find that most of this barley comes from South Australia and, in particular, from the electorate of the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker).</inline> Yorke Peninsula, which is part of the electorate of Wakefield, is regarded as one of the largest barley producing areas in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member evidently agrees with me that the growers in his electorate produce most of the barley which is consumed by the Australian distilleries. Take, for instance, the Federal Distillery. That distillery, for the four years ending the 30 th April, 1,927, purchased £43,000 worth of barley, and from that date to the 30th of April, 1930, its purchases of barley amounted to £46,770. Those figures exclude the value of barley and other grain used by other distilleries operating in Australia. The honorable member for Wakefield will, in view of those statistics, agree with me that this industry is of great assistance to the barley-growers in his electorate. They are assured of a market at a time when they and other primary producers are faced with falling prices and the uncertainty of sales. The barley-growers have the best market of all - the local market - and it will be lost to them if the Australian distilleries are destroyed. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> was asked a very plain question, but he made no attempt to. answer it; in fact he strictly avoided it. He was asked how the distilleries of Australia would be adversely affected by the removal of the special duty of 5s. a gallon on whisky bottled out of bond. It is more likely that these distilleries would be assisted, because every rise in the price causes a diminution in the consumption, and the interests of the distilleries would he best served by an increased consumption. I do not suggest that the Minister would knowingly mislead the public, but he has drawn attention to a resolution of the Victorian Licensed Victuallers Association, which, if it went unexplained, would be misleading. As a result of that resolution, a federal conference of licensed victuallers was held almost immediately, and the decision of the Victorian body was repudiated. The members of the committee of the Victorian Association resigned their positions, and these were taken by other members. In reply to the statement of the Minister that the hotelkeepers favour this special duty, I may mention that I have received circulars from the Licensed Victuallers Associations of Queensland and Western Australia to the contrary effect. I have personal knowledge that the New South Wales association is strongly opposed to the duty. I also have a letter from the United Licensed Victuallers Association of theCommonwealthof Australia, dated the 29th April, 1931, and the first paragraph reads as follows: -  1 am directed by the federal committee of management of this association representing the hotelkeepers throughout Australia to urge you to record your vote against the special duty of 5s. per gallon on certain spirits (not bottled in bond) when such duty comes up for ratification in the Federal Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- This duty gives the public no protection whatever in regard to the quality of the liquor supplied. The danger to the public arises from the sale of illicitly distilled spirit. There is no likelihood of cheap deleterious spirit being brought in from abroad, since there is an import duty of 45s. a gallon. Nobody is likely to import inferior potato spirit, or "moonshine", in face of that enormous duty. All the deleterious liquor is manufactured locally in illicit stills, and the bottling of whisky in bond affords no protection against that class of spirit. The illicit stuff is disposed of largely through certain hotelkeepers, who assist in this dishonest trade. That type of hotelkeeper takes a bottle  of spirit of a proprietary line, pours out a half or a quarter of it, and fills up the bottle with illicitly distilled spirit. The fact that the bottle was originally filled and corked in bond affords no protection whatever to the public. In one respect, the special duty, together with the other high imposts, encourages illicit trading in Australia. The high charges have increased the price of whisky up to about 85s. a gallon. That is almost a prohibitive price, and it encourages the illicit distiller and the dishonest hotelkeeper who is prepared to indulge in this sly trade. If whisky were cheaper, it would not be worth while taking the risk of disposing of illicitly distilled spirit. If the owner of an illicit still sold his product at only one-third the ordinary price, he could make a large profit, because he pays no duty. </para>

                    <para>It has been claimed on behalf of the Government that this special duty will cause an increase of revenue. I understood the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> to say that he estimated that about 99 per cent, of the whisky imported into Australia was bottled in bond. If that figure is approximately correct, the amount of extra duty collected on what may be called bulk whisky is negligible, and is likely to be offset by the reduced consumption attributable to the excessive price. Before the late war, whisky of good quality was sold in bond at from 5s. to 10s. a gallon, but the present price of whisky, of about the same quality as that sold by what is called the combine, is from 32s. 6d. to 37s. 6d., a gallon. So far as I can see, there is no justification for that great increase in price, because the costs of production in Scotland are not materially higher now than they were ' before the late war. Many Scottish manufacturers who are operating outside the combine are able to sell whisky here at from 18s. to 20s. a gallon. For the most part this is good, matured spirit, because these manufacturers have not the ready turnover enjoyed by the big combine, and, on the whole, their whisky is held for a longer period than that sold by the combine. Honorable members know that practically every club and hotel of standing has its house whisky. Since bulk whisky is generally of the best quality, and most hotelkeepers pride themselves upon the quality of their house whisky, it is possible to obtain a better whisky from sources outside the combine than from within it. For these reasons the public should not be deprived of the chance of obtaining a good, wholesome whisky at a reduced rate. We should look at this matter from a broad point of view. Why should those who wish to purchase whisky be obliged to pay an extra duty on top of the present high impost? The way in which the prices of all commodities have increased in Australia is absurd. These high prices are one of the serious causes of the reduction of trade, and of the present depression. In dealing with this tariff item, as with all the others, we should act on the principle that the lower the prices at which goods can be supplied to the public, the larger will be the turnover. </para>

                        <para>.- The remarks of the Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> demand some reply. In the first place, he contended that opposition to differentiation between certain distilleries and others involved an attack upon the Australian distilling industry, to the detriment of the use of Australian barley. What I object to is differentiation between one distillery and another, and in order to make a differentiation between a distillery favoured by the Government and others, the price of Australian whisky is raised. This reduces the consumption of the article, and, therefore, reduces the sale of barley. </para>

                            <para>- That is the case today; but it was not so when this new principle was introduced. One of the effects of the special duty was to enable one of the Australian distilleries to sell out to another on very favorable terms. The Corio Distillery is not the only producer of whisky in Australia. Milne and Company and Tolley and Company, of South Australia, both produced an Australian whisky, and, before the special duty was applied, their spirit was sold over bar counters in Adelaide at 6d. a nobbier; but the effect of the duty was to raise the cost of the article so that it could not be sold at that price. That was favoring one distillery at the expense of others, and it is that to which I object. There were certain distilleries which preferred to send their whisky out in bottles. They had a very large trade, and did a lot of advertising; but there were the smaller local whisky producers who had certain trade connexions, and who supplied the hotels in their own localities at a price lower than that charged by their competitors. These manufacturers supplied a perfectly wholesome article in bulk; but since the Government has made the distinction to which I have referred, whisky is made more expensive, and the effect has been to reduce the market for Australian barley. However, we are now discussing import duties, and that is where the most serious discrimination occurs. The smaller merchants to whom I have referred are being placed at a disadvan tage in competition with the big proprietary firms. </para>

                    <para>The Minister for Markets, in view of his experience, should not have used such unsound argument as was employed by him when he quoted the resolution carried some time last year by the council of the Licensed Victuallers Association of Victoria. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> pointed out that that resolution was arrived at contrary to the wishes of the majority of the licensed victuallers of Victoria and of Australia, and consequently the members of the council had to resign. The  chairman  of that council, I am informed, was an employee of one of the distilleries that was specially favoured by this new kind of differentiation in regard to duties or an employee of one of its largest shareholders. Naturally he supported the interests of the distillery on the council, to which he was elected because of the position held by him in a hotel which the distillery or one of its shareholders owned. The fact that the resolution was afterwards rescinded, that the members who carried it resigned and that it was overruled by the Federal Council of the Licensed Victuallers Association, shows that the Minister did not display his usual astuteness in accepting it as sufficient justification for his attitude to-day. I am referring to the Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney).</inline> In his desire to assist his colleague he has acted on this occasion with an impetuosity which is rare in his case by advancing any argument, good or bad. One would hardly expect it from a man of his experience and acumen. But the arguments against the imposition all hold good. It is practically no safeguard to the public. On the contrary it makes the product more expensive, decreases the revenue, increases unemployment, reduces the market for Australian barley and favours the rich and the strong as against those who are in a small way. I feel confident that the committee will set its face against this most astonishing innovation. </para>

                            <para>- But it does not affect the local distilleries, and, as it does not achieve anything from the point of view of providing employment, I must dismiss that aspect from consideration. Then there is the question of bottling; but whatever is not bottled in bond must be bottled by the local hotelkeeper, therefore, the argument that this imposition provides extra employment also breaks down, and I can see no warrant whatever on the facts already adduced for the extra imposition. </para>

                            <para>- When the honorable member for Henty was speaking I asked him a question by way of interjection, and gathered from him that the Customs Department has a method of checking bottling by which the public is safe guarded as far as possible. In the circumstances I cannot see that any great safeguard is furnished even if the whisky is bottled in bond. The hotelkeeper who wishes to deceive the public will do so, no matter what happens. I am anxious to know what the Government's real intention is. I gather from what has been said that it believes that it is protecting the public and creating more employment, and I also believe that it is anxious" to secure more revenue. But I feel that the employment argument has been exploded, and also the idea of protection of the public. Therefore, at present, it appears to be only a matter of more revenue. References have been made to other statements in the past. I know nothing about them. I take it that the Government is honest in its endeavour to do its best in the interests of the country, but when I realize that this imposition cannot provide extra employment or protect the public, it seems to me that the whole question boils down to that of getting extra revenue. If that is so we might hear something further from the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline></para>

                        <para>. - The Minister for Trade and Customs has emphasized the desire of the Government to protect the health of the community, and has argued that a label on a bottle should be a guarantee that the contents of the bottle are true to label. In some districts a man would be a simpleton if he thought that he would get his spirit true to name because the bottle is labelled. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> holds that the Government's desire is to secure revenue; but the Government's revenue proposals were contained in schedules which were laid on the table long before this particular impost was made known. As a matter of fact the real reason for the extra impost has not been given by the Government, or, so far, by members of the Opposition. The real reason is that one distillery was in the advantageous position of being able to sell its whisky bottled, whereas the other, not having the whisky five years old, was not in a position to bottle its product, and would, therefore, be obliged to sell at 5s. a gallon more than its competitors. </para>

                            <para>- It found that it could not compete with the other distillery when this unfair imposition was put on, and it was obliged to amalgamate with it in order that it might get some advantage from this particular impost, and be in a position to market whisky in Australia in the five years that are to come. The Minister knows that the 5s. excise was put on to give a particular distillery in Australia an advantage, and not to provide the public with a whisky true to label. Any one who would use an argument similar to that with which the Minister has tried to gull the committee and the country, could justly be accused of trying to deceive the public. The whisky that is now prevented from being imported by this extra 5s. a gallon was bought by the publican or wholesale merchants. To-day the combine has the advantage. The publican who sells a whisky as his house whisky assures the public that it will get what it asks for. It is a far better guarantee than can be given by customs officers away in a bond store, seeing that the whisky bottled in bond may afterwards be put into hotel cellars, and opened by any one at any time. Many of our merchants imported their own whisky, and sold it in 2-gallon, 4-gallon, or 5- gallon kegs. It was the whisky mostly consumed in. country districts, but the trade is now to be placed in the hands of the few who have the means of bottling their whisky in bond - the combines - unless of course the people who formerly bought kegs are prepared to buy bottles subject to this extra impost. </para>

                            <para>- Absolutely. A hotelkeeper is proud of the reputation his house whisky earns for him. His custom depends to a large extent upon the reputation his whisky gains. If people want whisky in a bottle, well and good, but the imposition of this extra 5s. is not fair. It brings no increase of revenue to the Government, and its sole purpose is the one I have mentioned. It has justly deserved the ire it has aroused among the licensed victuallers of Australia. I remind the Minister that the Licensed Victuallers Association in his own State has all along protested against this imposition. I trust that the committee will not allow this favoritism to continue. It is useless for the Minister to speak about the Corio Distillery. Whatever was done in the past will not affect what is being done to-day. The Australian distilleries are all one concern to-day. This duty has not been imposed to give the public anything better than they can get without it. </para>

                            <para>- To a certain extent they are, but the Australian shareholders have an interest in the local concern. Since the Minister has tampered with these duties there has been a slackening in the trade, excise revenue has fallen, employment has been reduced, and the public have not got what they should get. In regard to the Minister's claim that this has been done to protect the public, I remind him that quite recently provision was made to allow more water to be added to whisky, probably with the intention of enabling the public to buy more water and less whisky. The Minister's excuses are not sufficient to justify an imposition which has proved detrimental to the interests of licensed victuallers, wine and spirit merchants, and the public, and would prove detrimental to the distilleries which might wish to commence operations in Australia in the future, not in association with the existing distilleries. </para>

                        <para>.- I am not at all satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> as to the good that will be done by bottling in bond. It is just as easy to empty into a cask whisky bottled in bond as it is to do so with whisky not bottled in bond. I am convinced of the honesty of the majority of hotelkeepers, and I am aware that many hotels have built up reputations for their house whisky. Customers have passed other hotels to visit those where they know they can rely on getting a good house whisky which appeals to their palates. I believe that a great hardship was done to many people, particularly wine and spirit merchants and hotelkeepers, when this imposition was made. These people are employing just as much labour as is being employed under present conditions. I do not think that therevenue is materially affected. If it is I should like to know to what extent it is. Various arguments have been advanced against the new duty, but the most amusing was the statement by the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> that this is the only country in which it has been adopted. If the new duty had any inherent merit, the novelty of it would not be an objection.  I am under the impression that no other country has a Transport Workers Act providing for the licensing of employees, but the honorable member for Warringah made no protest against that legislation on the score that it was unprecedented. Therefore, the fact that this extra duty on whisky bottled out of bond does not operate elsewhere carries no weight with me. Nevertheless, the Minister will be well advised to accept the amendment, because he can trust the inspectors employed by the State Governments to do what is necessary to protect the public. Any malpractices can be easily punished. A matter of more grave concern to both Commonwealth and State Governments is the illicit distillation of whisky. I recollect hearing of an old hotelkeeper who said that the rum he stocked was so good that if, after taking two nobblers  of it, a man would not fight his own father he was a coward! I am fairly certain that that rum was not bottled in bond. Illicit stills are in operation in many parts of the Commonwealth, and I am sure that the Minister would be very glad to be able to suppress them. There is no doubt of the harmful nature of the spirit they produce. A great friend of mine was in the Townsville Hospital for a long time in a semi-paralyzed state because of alcoholic poisoning. The doctor assured me that his condition was caused, not by the spirits ordinarily sold in reputable hotels, but by the product of illicit stills. The majority of the publicans may be trusted to do rightly by the public.  I give no credence to the statement that the new duty has led to a decrease of revenue. Owing to the depression people are less able to buy either whisky or beer, and I have been informed by an officer of the Customs Department that the consumption of beer in Australia this year is 8,000,000 gallons less than last year. I am certain that that would not have occurred in normal times. It is true, however, that people generally are becoming more temperate, and that change may be expected to be reflected in the quantity &gt; of alcoholic liquors consumed and the revenue collected from customs and excise duties. No good purpose can be served by continuing the extra duty of 5s. on spirits bottled out of bond. I am certain that the quality of the liquor sold to the public will be the same whether it is bottled in or out of bond. </para>

                        <para>. - This extra duty on spirits -bottled out of bond will not increase the volume of trade done by Australian or overseas distillers. Publicans have been accustomed to buy their spirits in bulk and bottle them on their own premises. On account of the depression many publicans in New South Wales are unable to pay their rent, and if they are deprived of the privilege of bottling their own requirements, they will be penalized, and no benefit will accrue to the public. The new impost will not lead to the distillation of more whisky or to the employment of more people; nor will it give greater protection to the public. Every State Government employs inspectors to police the liquor laws by periodically sampling the spirits sold in hotels. </para>

On that occasion he fought gallantly in the interests of the big whisky combine in Great Britain. Again, when the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> made out a good case for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the activities of the tobacco combine, the honorable member for Henty, who then occupied the position I now hold, resolutely opposed the proposal. Subsequently, the committee was appointed and made .some very helpful recommendations for restricting the operations of the combine, which the honorable member for Henty had championed. </para>

                    <para>The extra duty of 5s. a gallon on spirits bottled out of bond had yielded £15,000 additional revenue up to the 30th June, 1930. That amount, although not large, is not negligible. The duty had been imposed before I assumed control of the Trade and Customs Department, hut I stand by it because I believe it to be in the interests of the consumers, although it does not go so far as the recommendation of the Health Conference in 1927, that all spirits imported in bulk should be bottled in bond under the supervision of a customs official and should be labelled "bottled in bond by so and so ". </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> said that the duty was imposed to give one distillery an unfair advantage over another. When that suggestion first came to my notice I rang up the Corio Distillery and was informed by the manager that his firm was in favour of the extra duty of 5s. imposed on whisky bottled out of bond. He said that as his firm had to adhere to the strict excise regulations requiring all its operations to be under the supervision of a customs official, the big hotelkeeper who wanted to blend cheap imported or Australian whiskies, bottle them in his own cellars and sell them at high prices,  should be subject to the same restriction or pay a higher duty. That is a reasonable contention. It is clear, therefore, that the statement of the honorable member for Wide Bay is absolutely untrue. The honorable member for Henty asked how the wine and spirit merchant can import whisky and bottle it out of bond. The new duty will not prevent that. Many wine and spirit merchants have licensed bond stores, in which they can bottle their bulk whisky under customs supervision. Many people would prefer that there should be no testing of spirits. If a State with 2,000 licensed hotels has only two inspectors a particular hotel may be inspected only once in twelve months and, perhaps, not at all. A prominent official of the Licensed Victuallers Association of South Australia said that his hotel had not been visited by a health inspector once in three years. Probably, the same boast could be made by many other publicans. Those wine and spirit merchants who have not their own bond stores can open a casual bond for a fee of £30, plus a charge of 3s. 6d. an hour for the services of a customs officer. That can be done also by an hotelkeeper, but many of those in whose behalf honorable members opposite are speaking do not want customs supervision of what they put in their bottles. Fortunately, that is not true of the majority of hotelkeepers; most of them are of a very fine type, but black sheep are to be found in the trade as in every other section of the community. A wine and spirit merchant can open a half-time bond for a fee of £165 a year or a full-time bond - and there are many throughout Australia in which bottling could be done for hotelkeepers - for £325 a year. Twenty-four additional bonds have been opened since this duty went on. This provision ensures that the bottling is done, as it were, in broad daylight under official supervision. What is the position of hotelkeepers at places such as Sydney, Brisbane, Maryborough, Rockhampton, &amp;c, as referred to by the honorable member? It is provided that where customs officers are located, hotelkeepers may have spirit bottled in bond under customs supervision at a charge of 3s. 6d. an hour, so that no hardship is inflicted. In most cities and ports there are certain bonded warehouses which specialize  in storing spirits. With the provision in force that all spirits must be bottled in bond or pay an extra 5s. a gallon, the practice will grow up of these bond proprietors bottling their clients' spirits, thus obviating the need for the smaller importers to set up their own bonds. Ninety-five per cent, of the spirits sold are bottled brands, leaving only 5 per cent. bulk. To hear some honorable members opposite one would imagine that the greater part of the spirit sold in this country was disposed of in bulk. Such a contention is all moonshine, as is also the assertion that the best whisky is hulk whisky. Only too often importers get in a cheap line of bulk whisky, put it up in bottles,' and call it best house whisky, after having, perhaps, mixed it with some cheap Australian spirit. The number of hotelkeepers whose trade is sufficient to keep their own bottlers fully employed is very small, probably not more than 25 in the whole of Australia. Under this provision, work will be provided for more persons than will lose their employment. It has been shown that an additional £.15,000 has been collected by the Customs. Department as. a result of the duty. While this provision will not go all the way towards achieving that close supervision over the bottling of spirits that was proposed by the Health Conference in 1927, it will at least go part of the way. It will not inflict any hardship upon any section of the community. It has been stated by honorable members opposite that the new provision has resulted in a falling off in revenue. Any reduction in revenue has not been due entirely to this duty, or to any other. It may be partly due to such causes, but the sale of beer and spirits of all kinds has been affected by the depression in the same way as that of other articles. Every factory is suffering as a result of the depression, and the fact that certain persons who have been selling spirits are not employing as many workers as before is no argument against this duty. </para>

                        <para>-. - The real point at issue is not whether the purity of spirits shall be maintained ;. that is a matter for the States which have provided for it under State law, and have appointed special inspectors. What really concerns this committee is the amount of revenue which is to be returned by the imposition of the duties, and the Minister has side-stepped that issue throughout the whole of his two long speeches. He admits that there has been a falling off in consumption, but claims that it is due to the prevailing depression. Then why not meet thedepression by reducing the duty, since the public are evidently not prepared to buy at the price which this duty makesnecessary? In 1913, the duty on spirits was 14s. a gallon, and 2,251,000 gallons were imported. The duty was increased in successive stages to 17s., 20s., 25s... 27s. and 30s. In 1924-25 the quantity of spirits imported was 1,200,000 gallons, <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> falling off of over- 1,000,000 gallons. This was directly due to the increasedcustoms and excise duties, and the result was a reduction in the national revenue. It is not the duty of this Parliament, when discussing the tariff, to consider the moral aspect of the matter, or whether the country would be better off under prohibition. As I have said, our concern is therevenue, and whether the duties areequitable. It has been claimed that theimposition of high customs and exciseduties have resulted in a loss of revenue,, and further, that this duty favours the big overseas distilleries at the expense of the hotelkeepers, and wine and spirit merchants, whose money has been invested in this country. The large overseas distilleries, whose shareholders, areall on the other side of the world, are not concerned with the welfare of this country to the same extent as are the thousands of hotelkeepers who are paying Australian wages to Australian workmen. The big distilleries, it is true, are paying wages to English workers. but we hereare more concerned with the protection of Australian workmen. I appeal to the committee to vote for the reduction of this duty in the interests of Australian workers,, and to increase the customs revenue. That, after all, is the chief consideration,, and the Minister has not answered the argument advanced- in favour of it. The Minister has notanswered the claim that a reduction of duty would result in increased revenue,, and' it is revenue we want now when we are facing a deficit of £19,000&lt;,000. The- </para>

                        <para class="block">Minister has also failed to answer the statement of the honorable member for Wide Bay (Mr.Corser) that when this extra duty was first imposed the Corio Distillery was placed at a disadvantage as compared with another' distillery in that it could not market its whisky in bottles because it had not been matured for five years. Now that the two firms have amalgamated there is no reason why the duty should not be removed, but the Government will not remove it because it thinks that the reason for the imposition of the duty would then be too obvious. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable members will notice that I have reverted to the originalwording of the Customs Tariff 1921-28. During the general debate much irrelevant matter was introduced in the discussion on bottled spirits. I was sorry to hear the Minister say that be could not agree to a reduction in the duties, giving as a reason his belief that the schedule would produce a greater amount of revenue than would be obtained if the duties wore lowered by 12s. per gallon proof. An examination of the figures does not bear out the Minister's statement. All the items in this division may be regarded as luxury items. This is particularly true of the one under discussion. The moral effect on the community resulting from the consumption of alcoholic beverages does not enter into this discussion. Nondrinkers will not contribute to the revenue under these items. Figures supplied recently by the Minister show that there has been a serious and progressive decline in the consumption of imported and Australian whiskies during the last few years. The lessened spending power of the community is, to some extent responsible, but a much more important factor is the exceedingly high rate of duty imposed upon these items. It is a well-known economic fact that unduly high taxation will defeat its objective, namely to secure revenue. No one can doubt that the High rates on these items is largely responsible for the serious loss of revenue to the Government. The Ministry would be well advised torecast these duties with a view to securing the maximum amount of revenue. </para>

                        <para>During times of prosperity, such as we have experienced in the years gone by, it may have been reasonable to expect that there would not be a serious decline in consumption.

Imports have declined from 1,349,086 proof gallons five years ago to 946,523 proof gallons for the nine months ended 31st </para>
                    <para class="block">March this year. The average yearly drop is approximately one-third. I ask leave to continue my remarks. </para>
