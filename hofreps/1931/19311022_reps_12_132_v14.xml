                        <para>- For obvious constitutional reasons I could not make the definite promise that differential treatment would be accorded to any one State, but I did reply sympathetically to the request of the honorable member for Swan and others representing "Western Australia that fertilizers which could not be made in the Commonwealth should be admitted free of duty. I promised that the Government would deal with each shipment on its merits, and that requests from Western Australia would, because of its situation, receive special consideration. That was ;i3 far as any government could go. Some shipments have been admitted free of duty, and we have since received communications which indicate that they are competing with local industries. These representations are being checked by the Customs Department and when complete information is available I shall let the honorable member have it. </para>

The granting of the request of the Miners' Federation would create difficulties, because it would involve discriminating in the application of the tax between explosives used by miners and those used for other purposes. The Commissioner has been asked to endeavour to work out a plan by which an exemption or rebate may be granted. </para>

The important coal-mining industry is languishing, and on that account is deserving of every protection against the coal used by ships trading to Australia which take in at South African ports cheaply produced coal sufficient for the round trip. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is considered to be a distinct breach of existing awards, and great exception is taken to it. The deputation pointed out that the deduction from the wages of annual employees of 5s. per week to cover payment for holidays as set out in the award should be considered. It is also objected that if this breach of award were permitted, it would be competent for any employer to ration his employees on public holidays only, so that the men might be deprived of their holidays. It is not suggested that the department would deliberately do that, but it is contended that this alteration of the conditions will operate very unjustly in the case of some workers, who may be called upon to sacrifice more than others merely because public holidays occur during their period of rationing. The notice relating to furlough reads : </para>

                        <para>. - In reply to the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge),</inline> I might say that the trouble, if it can be called trouble, arose from the fact that, because of the reduced amount of work available at Garden Island and the reduced amount of money available for my department, it became necessary to dispense with the services of a number of men at Garden Island. Notices of dismissal were issued. Subsequently, representations were made to me by the unions concerned, particularly the metal trades  union. I do not say that all the unions made representations, but the majority of them did. They requested that some form of rationing be instituted at Garden Island to obviate the dismissal of men. I quite appreciate the viewpoint of the unions. They did not want their members thrown on the streets at a time when it was difficult to obtain work. We agreed to their request, and rationing was put into effect at Garden Island. Since then complaints have been made by some of the unions that the rationing is too severe. I admit that the rationing of some sections of the men at Garden Island is indeed severe, because it runs from one in three up to one in nine. The officers of my department arc themselves opposed to rationing, on the ground that it does not tend to proper efficiency in the Service. That is the general opinion of most employers, whether private or government. In this instance I agreed to the request of the organization that, instead of dismissing the men, some form of rationing should be instituted. The honorable member for Martin has referred to continuity of service. Certain of the employees, principally those engaged prior to 1924, are entitled to furlough rights, and so that rationing should not effect a break in their service, I gave instructions that the breaks due to rationing were not to interfere with furlough rights. </para>

                            <para>- I am coming to that. The point raised by the honorable member was that when an employee had a week off as a result of rationing the officers asked him to sign an application for leave of absence without pay. I am quite satisfied that there was no evil intent behind the action of the officers. They felt that questions might arise, particularly in regard to furlough rights, out of the fact that the men had had time off due to rationing, and they asked the men who were being rationed, to sign an application for leave of absence without pay. They said that that was necessary to protect both themselves and the employees concerned. That question was raised by the deputation from the Sydney Trades and Labour Council which waited on me. We went into the matter and, as a result, I could not see that there was any necessity for the men to sign an application for leave of absence. I have already issued instructions that the men are not to be called upon to sign this form when they are given one week off without pay under the rationing system. I have already said that there was no evil intent behind the action of the officers. I have had a good deal of industrial experience, and I know that men, when called upon to sign forms as they were in this case, frequently suspect that there is some evil intent behind the action of the employers. I am satisfied that the trouble is purely psychological, and I have notified the secretary of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council that the men will not be called upon to sign an application for leave of absence when they have one week off without pay, but are to be given one week's notice that they are to be rationed for a week without pay. That, I trust, will overcome the grievance of these men. </para>

                            <para>- I realize that. The next point raised by the honorable member related to annual leave privileges, and the instruction that one day must be deducted from recreation leave in respect of each 22 days of absence without pay. That matter was also raised by the deputation, and it was said that this practice had not been adopted by other public bodies. I have since made inquiries, and I find that the Sydney Harbour Trust, the State Public Works Department, and the State Metropolitan Water Board of New South Wales have a similar provision in their rationing scheme, and it is being applied generally throughout the Commonwealth Public Service. </para>

                            <para>- This provision is fair, particularly in view of the fact that we are being put to additional expense in giving effect to the request of the men that they be rationed instead of dismissed. The next point raised by the honorable member relates to public holidays, and the instruction that in the event of a public holiday occurring  during a period of rationing it must be considered as part of such period of rationing, and not be paid for or granted in any other way. We are not attempting to use this instruction unfairly, and if, as has been suggested, a number of public holidays fall within the week for which the employee is being rationed, we shall consider his case sympathetically. We work on the principle that when a man has a week off and a public holiday falls during- that week, he is not paid for it, nor is it granted to him. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing that we have done constitutes a breach of an award. Furlough is a privilege, and, as a rule, is not provided for in awards at all. No one who has entered the Service since 1924 receives furlough. It has been suggested that the practice is not operating elsewhere. Let me say that the New South Wales Railways Commissioners, who are directly under the control of the Premier of that State as Minister in charge of railways, have applied the principle that if a man has a week off and a public holiday falls during that week, he is not paid for it. This morning I got into touch with the officers of the audit branch of the Railway Department of New South Wales, who informed me that they have a specific provision to that effect. I think that the trouble arising out of the signing of application forms for leave of absence without pay has been removed. We have adopted the principle operating generally in the State departments of New South Wales, particularly the Railways Department, and also in the Commonwealth Public Service. </para>

I think that I have covered the points raised by 'the honorable member for Martin. I have given every opportunity to the unions concerned to place matters before me. I have afforded them every facility. Complications have arisen as a result of the application of rationing, a system to which my officers are opposed. But the Government is anxious to employ as many men as possible, even at part time, instead of dismissing them and throwing them on the dole, which is, unfortunately, a heavy burden upon the State Governments. I might mention that the Ironworkers Union did not favour the rationing system, because they regarded the rationing, which was one in five, as too heavy; but the other unions concerned were in favour of it. </para>

As we are likely to go into recess at the end of this week, the honorable member has taken the earliest opportunity to bring his complaint before the Government, so that some action may be taken to give relief to the employees at Garden Island. The question of privileges has again been raised. No one knows better than the Minister that the Arbitration Court, in fixing rates of wages, takes into consideration the privileges which are part of the conditions operating in government institutions. </para>

                            <para>- Even if these privileges are not definitely stated in the awards, they are taken into consideration by the court in determining the rates of pay. Therefore, regarding the question of a public holiday falling due during the week for which a man is rationed, the Minister must admit that the man concerned is entitled to consideration with respect to payment for that day, particularly in view of the fact that the number of holidays during the year affect his general rate of wage as prescribed by award. These men are already being rationed, and it must be admitted that when they have to suffer a further loss of pay on account of holidays falling in the week for which they are rationed, their home life as a result of the reduction in income is seriously affected. The minister could meet this situation without any difficulty. He could declare that the employees must receive pay for any holiday falling due during the period for which they are rationed. The next point I wish to make, though I do not bring it forward for the purpose of putting the subject into any better form, has relation to returned soldiers. The Government claims that it is always solicitous for the welfare of these men. Honorable members on the opposite side of the chamber who are returned soldiers also endeavour at. all times to see that those who were associated with them on active service receive every consideration that they deserve in industry, and particularly in industries in which the Government is concerned. I wish those honorable gentlemen to appreciate that a very large percentage of the men engaged at Garden Island to-day are returned soldiers. Here is an opportunity for these honorable members to assist them. </para>

                            <para>- One or two employees who have been working at Garden Island over a long period of years on work which, in an indirect sense at any rate, was connected with the war, such as the refitting of troopships and the like, have been kept there, but as the Minister has indicated, the great majority of the workmen now on the Island are returned soldiers. But they are trade unionists, too, and on this occasion it is on that ground, and not because they are returned soldiers, that they are submitting their claims for consideration. In all the circumstances, I ask the Minister to see that all the privileges of these men in regard to holidays, annual leave, and the like, are preserved. If existing privileges are not definitely provided for in awards, the Government should see that they are not lost to the men. </para>

                        <para>.- As the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> has referred to the returned soldier aspect of this subject, and as the Minister himself referred to me in his remarks, I wish to state clearly what transpired yesterday. Early in the afternoon I asked the Minister whether he was aware that two returned men, of 61/2 years and 91/2 years service respectively, had been served with notices of practically instant dismissal from Garden Island, while three other men who were not returned soldiers and not permanent employees had been retained. If the facts are as indicated, the whole policy of preference to returned soldiers is involved, and the returned soldier organizations wish to make a test case of it. Subsequently, when I interviewed the Minister, and put the facts before him again, he showed that he is the type of man that I thought him to be by at once giving clear and decisive instructions that the notices were not to take effect for another week, so that he might have a full opportunity of looking into the whole subject. I was satisfied with that action, but I ask the Minister to ascertain who issues these orders. The position is grave, if such notices can be issued in opposition to the policy of the Government. That is an aspect of the subject which should be investigated. </para>

(b) Total amount of bounty paid for twelve months ended the 30th June, 1931, equalled £165,009. This would not necessarily he bounty on the identical wine above-mentioned, as claims necessarily lag behind shipments. (c) There are four different rates of excise duty on spirit involved in some of these shipments, and some of it is exported direct from bond and some after being fortified with duty-paid spirit. It is impracticable to calculate the amount rebated on this particular wine. </para>

                <para>Whereas on the twenty-eighth day of July, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-one this  House  resolved that the Government of the Commonwealth be authorized to request and consent to the submission by the Government of the United Kingdom to the Parliament at Westminster of a bill for a statute containing the provisions set out in the Schedule to the Resolution, and the enactment of the said statute: </para>
                <para>And whereas it is desirable to supplement the said resolution in the manner hereinafter appearing : </para>
                <para>Now therefore this House resolves that the' Government of the  Commonwealth  be authorized to request and consent to the inclusion in the' said statute of a clause as follows: - " Nothing in tins act shall be deemed to require the concurrence of the Parliament and Government of the Commonwealth of Australia in any law made by Parliament with respect to any matter within the authority of the States of Australia, not being a matter within the authority of the Parliament or Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, in any case where it would have been in accordance with the constitutional practice existing before the commencement of this act that Parliament should make such law without such concurrence." </para>
                <para>In the drafting of the resolution relating to the statute which was passed by the House of Representatives - on the 28th July last, particular care was taken to protect the rights of the States. The second paragraph of clause 4 was included by the Imperial Conference with this object, and to still further safeguard the States, additional paragraphs were added to the clause while it was before Parliament. </para>
                <para>Notwithstanding the provision of these safeguards in the resolution, four of the States made representations to His Majesty's Government in tL. United Kingdom regarding the proposed statute as it was thought to affect them. Consultation then ensued between that Government and the Commonwealth Government, and between the Commonwealth Government and the several State Governments, with a view to finding a formula -which would afford complete protection to the States, including the protection of their right to secure the application to a State of legislation by the Parliament at Westminster on matters solely within the authority of the States, if the State' so requested. The only suggestion that has been made thai those rights are in any way affected is that the requirement of the consent of the Commonwealth before any law made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom is extended to Australia would hamper a State in asking for British legislation on some matter of State concern. It is  hardly  possible to conceive that a State would make such a request, but the  Commonwealth.  Government is  quite  willing to make it clear that the statute does not alter the <inline font-style="italic">status quo</inline> m this respect. This motion, therefore, provides that, where the subject-matter belongs exclusively to the States, and where legislation by the  British  Parliament without the request of the Commonwealth would be in accordance with the present constitutional practice, the provision of the statute requiring the request of the Commonwealth shall not apply. </para>
                <para>The clause now included in the motion before the House has been drafted as a result of the discussion that has occurred. When it is included in the Statute of Westminster the fullest protection will have been given to the exercise by the States of all the rights they possess at present. </para>
                <para>But we are giving the States still further protection. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.']</inline> Paragraph 7 of the resolution provides that paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 6 of it  shall  not extend to the Commonwealth as part of its law unless and until they are adopted by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. The Government has given) the States- an assurance that it will not introduce any measure for the extension to the Commonwealth of the provisions of the statute, "when passed, until there has been an opportunity for further discussion with the States. It is hoped that as the result of such 'further discussion.  all the States will agree to the application of the statute to the Commonwealth. At present, however, whilst New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland accept the resolution, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania have not yet expressed themselves as being entirely in agreement with it. I hope this motion will have a speedy passage through the House. </para>

                        <para>.- The proposal to insert this additional paragraph in the motion previously carried in regard to the Statute of Westminster is being made in order to ensure that full and abundant caution shall be taken to make it clear that the proposed statute, which is being passed at the request of the Commonwealth Government, shall affect, in the Commonwealth, only matters in respect to which the Commonwealth has rights and duties, and not matters, which fall exclusively within the sphere of the States. Under the federal form of government there is a division of powers, and in certain matters the powers of the Commonwealth and of the States are exclusive. There are some matters in which the Commonwealth has the sole power of legislation; others in which the States have that power; and still others in which there is a concurrent power. The object of this proposal is to make it clear that, with respect to the matters as to which the States have the sole power of legislation, the statute shall leave the States entirely unaffected. That is in accordance with the fundamental and essential principles of the federation. If it is desired to alter the relations of the Commonwealth and the States in regard to any matter, that can bo done by appropriate action within Australia - by an amendment of the Constitution, or by a transference of legislative powers otherwise made in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution itself. But a statute, such as the Statute of Westminster, passed by the Imperial Parliament, at the request of this Parliament, obviously should not be utilized as  a  means of, in effect, bringing about any transfer of power from the State sphere to that of the Commonwealth. The proposal which has been moved by the Attorney-General,, and clearly explained by him, does not alter the position as between the Commonwealth and the States ; but it provides a safeguard which some of the States have requested, and which is entirely in accordance with the Federal Constitution under which we live, and which, moreover, is alterable in the manner determined by the people of Australia themselves under the Constitution they have adopted. </para>

                            <para>- The effect of this motion is to prevent the inference being drawn that the Commonwealth's consent, concurrence or request is required in the case of legislation, passed by the Imperial Parliament affecting what is entirely  a  State matter. Let us take a subject which is entirely within the domain of State powers, and sUppose that the State concerned desires to obtain imperial legislation on the subject - legislation passed in London. The idea underlying this proposal is that that  i3  a matter for the State, and that this motion and the proposed statute must not be interpreted as requiring any consent of the Commonwealth  to  action by the State in order to obtain such legislation. </para>

                            <para>- The general position was as I Lave stated it to be; but some  of  the States feared that the provisions  of  this statute might suggest that, in relation to anything to be done by way  of  imperial legislation relating to Australia, a request or the consent of the Commonwealth, was necessary. This amendment merely provides that, in exclusively State matters - "matters which come within the authority of the States not being matters within the authority of the  Commonwealth  " - the Commonwealth shall have no part ; it means that the consent  of the Commonwealth shall not be necessary. The amendment is in line with my views on this subject. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that they had anything immediately in view. I agree with the Attorney-General that it is difficult to conceive of a case in which a State would request imperial legislation in relation to a State matter. It might possibly arise in connexion with the - apprehension and arrest of criminal offenders. The law with respect to criminal offences on the high seas and in territorial waters is rather complicated; but it is not a matter which falls within the power of the Commonwealth. It is a matter to be determined by State legislation combined with British, or imperial, legislation. If an amendment were required of, say, the Fugitive Offenders Act, in matters relating to extradition, this Parliament would have nothing to do with it. In the legal sense, this Parliament is an incompetent body in such a matter. Unless a general power to legislate on criminal matters were transferred to this Parliament, that would be a matter between the States and the Imperial Legislature, without the necessity of any request or consent of this Parliament. The example I have given indicates the general idea associated with this resolution; but I think it unlikely that the subject will ever become of practical importance. </para>

                            <para>- So far as that aspect of the matter is concerned, I think that it would satisfy any desire on the part of the people of Tasmania; but there is another subject in which the people of that State are interested - I refer to the Merchant Shipping Act. This motion has no special bearing on the subject of merchant shipping; it leaves the position unchanged. Judging from what appeared in a report of a committee of the Chambers of Commerce of Tasmania, it would appear that there is a rather wide-spread misapprehension as to the actual legal position in relation to the Merchant Shipping Act and the Navigation Act. It is continually being suggested in Tasmania that the Navigation Act, particularly in its coastal clauses, is an infringement of the Merchant Shipping Act. As a lawyer, I am unable to see any ground for that contention. </para>

                            <para>- The Navigation Act passed by this Parliament has been in operation for many years; it wa3 passed in 1912, and was brought into operation in 1921. In Tasmania, it has been represented that I have recently written on the policy of the clauses. That is not so. I was not. associated in any way with the passing or bringing into operation of the Navigation Act, which took place before I entered Parliament. Questions recently raised in Tasmania upon what is called " a standard of ethics " in relation to the act have no relevance to anything that I have ever said, written, or done. On the question of validity, as distinct from policy, I point out that there has been ample opportunity to test the law, but that advantage has never been taken of it. The . Navigation Act of this Parliament was reserved for the assent of His Majesty the King in Great Britain. Acting on the advice of British Ministers, His Majesty assented to it. If -the act is thought to be invalid, the courts are available to test the matter. One would have thought that the validity of that act would have been tested before now if any real doubt existed concerning it- </para>

                            <para>- I merely say that the Navigation  Act  was assented to by His Majesty the King, on the advice of British Ministers, and was passed in accordance with the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act. That leaves open all matters relating to the  policy embodied in that act. As to the validity of that act, this motion leaves the position unchanged, whatever it may be. In my opinion, there is a great deal of misunderstanding in Tasmania regarding the validity as distinct from the policy of the Navigation Act. I support the proposal of the Attorney-General. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not propose to discuss, at this stage, the amendment of the resolution. I have already voiced my objection to it in its original form, and I now content myself with again protesting against this further curtailment of full federal powers. The Federal Labour party's platform pledges members of that party to ask for unlimited legislative powers for the Commonwealth, and such delegated powers for the States or provinces as the Commonwealth Parliament may determine from time to time. This motion provides for  a  further limitation of federal powers. I want the Australian Parliament and people to have full authority in every matter; I would rather have no Statute of Westminster than that we should pass this motion, which is an acknowledgment of a state of inferiority which has ceased to exist. </para>

                    </quote><para class="block">The object of this measure is to enable relief to be given to persons whose eligibility for pensions under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act is affected by the fact that they are entitled to deposits in the old business division of the New South Wales Government Savings Bank. Owing to the closing of that institution, these persons are, unfortunately, unable to operate on their accounts, which, in many instances, represent their whole life savings. As the pensions law stands at present, these deposits constitute property within the. meaning of the act, and there is no option but to take them into account in dealing with claims for pensions, despite the fact that the depositors are unable to operate on their accounts. It has been represented that in some cases this is causing hardship, and it is the earnest desire of the Government to afford relief in these instances. Cases have been brought under notice in which persons who are debarred from receiving pensions have offered to refund any pension paid to them when the State Savings Bank is in a position to repay deposits. It is now proposed to amend the law in order to enable pensions to be granted to these persons irrespective of the amount of their deposit in the Savings Bank, subject to their assigning the amount of such deposit <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the Minister administering the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. Provision already exists under the New South Wales Government Savings Bank acts for the assigning of deposits. If the proposed amendment becomes operative,  any claimant or pensioner who has a deposit in the old business division of the New South Wales Government Savings Bank will be able to assign his deposit to the Minister, and thereupon the amount of such deposit will cease to be regarded as property for pension purposes, and the amount of pension will be assessed accordingly. </para><para>It must be clearly understood that this concession will apply only to those persons who have money in the old business division of the New South Wales Government Savings Bank. Deposits in the new business division of that bank, or in the savings bank of any other State, or in the Commonwealth Savings Bank, will not be entitled to the benefits of this amendment. When the whole or any portion of the assigned deposit is paid by the Savings Bank Commissioners, the amount of pension which has been paid as a result of the assignment will be deducted from such payment, and the balance remaining, if any, will be paid over by the Minister to the pensioner, or to his representative, in the event of the pensioner's death. </para><para>The cost of this amendment cannot be estimated at present. The Commonwealth will be safeguarded by the provision for the deduction of any pension paid as a result of the amendment from any moneys eventually received from the Savings Bank authorities. That is a brief outline of the provisions of the bill. The amendments, which are only of a machinery character, are being made to give effect to the Government's proposals. They do not interfere in any other way with the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. This measure has been submitted in order to grant relief to those "deserving and thrifty persons who placed the whole of their life savings in the old division of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, and who are now in the unfortunate position that they cannot operate on their deposits. As the Government is anxious that these people shall not be left in their present position, I trust that honorable members will give the bill a speedy passage. </para><interjection>

                        <para>. - I take this opportunity to bring under the notice of the Government the absolute necessity of granting immediate financial assistance to those engaged in the gold-mining industry. When the plan adopted at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers was under consideration in this chamber, I believe that every honorable member who supported the Government's proposals understood that if certain things were done an amount of £5,000,000 would be made available to assist industry. Last evening we disposed of a measure providing for the payment of £3,000,000 to assist the wheatgrowers; but a determined effort should be made to afford relief to the vast army of unemployed which has increased within the last month. In these circumstances, </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">I am justified in asking whether the Government should not extend some assistance through the State Governments to those engaged in seeking gold or who are employed in the gold-mining industry, as recommended in three or four reports of the Development and Migration Commission. In October last a recommendation was made that £50,000 should be made available. I also understand that the unemployment secretariat recommended that the expenditure of £500,000 in this direction was warranted. A study of Australia's industrial position suggests that the avenues of employment will be closed for a considerable time. Within the last eighteen months the Government has reduced loan expenditure by £43,000,000, and this has displaced  a  large number of workers. In Victoria at present many are looking for gold, and all they receive is a State allowance of 8s. per week to provide them with some food. Despite this small allowance these men have carried on through  a  long and cold winter, and, as a result of their efforts, the gold yield in Victoria has been increased by 100 per cent. Eighteen months ago I urged upon the Government the necessity to encourage the gold-mining industry. The price of gold is higher than it has ever been ; it is always saleable and does not enter into competition with any other commodity. The Government should make an effort to place a sum at the disposal of the State Governments, which could be administered by State mining departments, and those engaged in gold-mining could thus be materially assisted. The Victorian Government has spent £13,000 in fifteen months in advancing loans to gold-miners, and £34,000 has been disbursed for relief works. In Victoria alone, during the first six months, the value of the gold yield was increased to £103,000, with the great advantage of preventing men who desire to work from remaining objects of charity, which is obnoxious to every Australian. <inline font-style="italic">{Quorum formed.]</inline></para>
                    <para>The plea that I am making is supported by the employment secretariat, the Development and Migration Commission, and all the mining experts of Australia. The case may be briefly expressed in the statement that the results of the expenditure in fostering the gold-mining industry are worth while, because the Governments have been amply repaid in the States in which money has been expended in that direction. When the " plan " was under discussion, a large sum of money was promised for the assistance of the industry if certain conditions were observed, but the money has not been made available. I am still hopeful that the Government will be able to obtain funds from the banks for the purposes of providing employment, and if a proportion of the amount is ear-marked for the assistance of the gold-mining industry, a maximum of employment for the money expended will be provided. It is impossible to find employment for large numbers of persons in the wool and wheat industries, and our secondary industries are now well staffed. As the representative of a district in which gold-mining is largely carried on, and in which over 1,500 additional men have been given assistance to search for gold in the last eighteen months, I feel it is desirable in the interests of the nation that every consideration should be given to my appeal at an early date. The gold-miners have shown their worth at every stage of the history of this country. </para>

                <para class="block">This measure provides for a number of amendments to the Customs Act that from time to time have been found necessary. I propose to refer briefly to the nature of each of the amendments, but I may assure honorable members that they are mostly of minor importance. In the practical application of an act such as the Customs Act it is found from time to time that more or less minor alterations are advisable to meet changing circumstances, but these alterations, while necessary,  may  not be of such a pressing nature as to justify special amending acts from time to time; so quite a number of amendments are embodied in this bill. The first is covered by clauses 2 and 3, and the provisions of the act affected are sections 37 and 39. The matter concerned  is  the entering of goods at the customs, and the point involved is the fixing of the moment at which goods are to be recorded as having been entered. The point  is  of importance, as under section 132 the duty payable on goods is that in force when the goods are entered for home consumption. After an entry is first delivered to the customs, it goes through various stages until it reaches that of  being  endorsed as " passed," and so becomes a warrant for dealing with the goods. It may be that an entry does not reach the " passed "stage on the same day as that on which it is delivered, and the present wording of the act leaves it open to doubt whether goods for which an entry has been delivered are, in fact, entered within the meaning of section 132 until the entry has reached the " passed " stage. , The amendment makes  it  clear that the goods are entered as soon as the entry is delivered to the customs. </para>
                <para>Clauses 4 and 5 of the bill are intended to amend the sections of the act relating to the prohibition of the importation of infringements of copyright works. These clauses amend sections 52 a and 57. The amendments simply bring the wording of these sections into line with that of the Copyright Act 1912. When section 52  a  was included in the Customs Act, there was no Commonwealth Copyright Act, and, as section 10 of that act is the prohibiting provision, it is necessary that the corresponding provisions in the Customs Act should be similar in their scope and terms. It was suggested by the Attorney-General's Department that this amendment should be made. Clause 6 of the bill makes a minor amendment of section 59 by substituting the words " three nautical miles " for the term " one league." The latter term is used to indicate the maritime three mile limit, and it is considered that the expression " three nautical miles " is more suitable, particularly as the term " league " has different meanings in different countries. This change is made at the suggestion of the British Government. Clause 7 of the bill amends section 71, which relates to sight entries. A sight entry may be made when the importer is not in possession of sufficient particulars completely to enter the goods. Section 71 provides that within seven days of the making of a sight entry  a  complete entry must be made. It is found that in certain circumstances seven days is not a sufficient period, and it is desirable that in such cases further time should be allowed. The amendment gives power to the Collector to extend the time, when necessary. Clause 8 alters section 73 by substituting for the words " one league " the words " three nautical miles " for the reasons previously mentioned. Clause 9 proposes to amend section 140 of' the act, under which any part of complete goods may, when imported separately, be charged duty at the rate applicable to the complete goods. When the rate on the complete goods is specific, or is both specific and ad valorem, the Minister has power to fix the proportionate rate of duty with which the part shall be chargeable. The tariff, however, now includes a third type of duty, namely, specific or ad valorem, whichever rate returns the higher duty, and the  power to fix the proportionate rate for the part when the complete goods are subject to this type of duty, is equally necessary. The proposed amendment simply makes that addition. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> come now to the most important amendment in the bill. Clause 10 is designed to amend section 151a of the act. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps that is so. Prior to 1925, the conditions with which goods had to comply so as to qualify for entry under the British preference tariff were laid down by the Minister, and such conditions allowed a certain amount of elasticity, thereby enabling the Minister to deal with special cases. In deference to representations that were made by certain honorable members, an amendment of the Customs Act was made in 1925 prescribing the conditions of eligibility of goods for entry under the British preference tariff; or, to be more exact, specifying what goods would be regarded as the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom. The conditions, being laid down in the law, were rigid, and gave no discretionary power to the Minister, the result .being that complaints were received from manufacturers in the United Kingdom, and importers and others in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I shall be glad to consider any suggested amendments when the bill is being considered in committee. I believe it will be found, however, that the amendments proposed by the Government meet the case quite fully. It has been found that the existing law is difficult of administration and interpretation. Manufacturers in the United Kingdom experience great difficulty in determining whether their goods are eligible for admission into Australia under the British preferential tariff, especially in cases where materials from foreign countries arc used in their manufacture. A number of instances have come tinder notice in which distinct anomalies have arisen. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, where raw materials from Australia cannot be taken into account in making up the 75 per cent, cost of materials and labour so as to qualify for the British preference; they are regarded not as raw  materials  of the United Kingdom, but as raw materials of a foreign country. For example, a hat made wholly in the United Kingdom from Australian wool, would be eligible for admission under the British preferential tariff as wholly made in the United Kingdom, but if it were trimmed with foreign trimmings, it would not be regarded as wholly made in the United Kingdom, and the 75 per cent, condition would then be applied. Because he had used a non-listed raw material, the manufacturer would have to exclude from his calculations the value of all imported materials, including the value of the Australian wool, with the result that the hat could not comply with the conditions of preference, and would therefore be ineligible for entry under the British preferential tariff. I think honorable members will agree that such a position was so absurd as to justify the Government in making the proposed amendment. At present, the manufacturer in the United Kingdom, in order to qualify for preference, can use only the raw materials enumerated in the determinations of the Minister and published in the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> It is now proposed to permit the use of any unmanufactured raw material without awaiting ministerial sanction. Therefore, manufacturers will be relieved of that disability under .which they - have suffered for some time. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> Under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> which relates to goods of a class or kind not. manufactured in Australia, and in respect of which only 25 per cent, of the factory or works' cost must be of United Kingdom labour and/or material, provision is being made under which the Minister may substitute 50 per cent, for the 25 per cent. This complies with the request of certain United Kingdom manufacturers. In the United Kingdom there arc manufacturers who put into their goods as much United Kingdom labour and material as possible, and who comply not only with the spirit of the preference, but also with the full letter of the law. Other manufacturers, however, do  only sufficient to observe the 25 per cent, condition. Although these goods do not compete with Australian-made goods, the latter class of manufacturer competes in the Australian market to the detriment of the manufacturer in whose interests the preferences were primarily granted. </para>

                <para>A special provision also is being made in regard to cinematograph films. Producers of films in the United Kingdom have, in certain instances, experienced difficulty in qualifying for the admission of their films under the British preferential tariff. Numerous films produced .by United Kingdom producers have been photographed outside the United Kingdom, such action having been necessitated by the location of the story. I believe that some of the scenes in the film " The Battle of the Falkland Islands" had to be photographed in the Falkland Islands. Technically, those films do not qualify for admission under the British preferential tariff. I think it will be conceded that where the whole of the work is done by British subjects, and the film is developed and printed in the United Kingdom, it should be regarded as the produce of the United Kingdom. </para>
                <para>Taking the proposed section in proper order, it will be observed that the first condition is in regard to goods which are wholly produced or wholly manufactured in the United Kingdom from "materials wholly produced or wholly manufactured in the United Kingdom or in Australia"; or from "imported unmanufactured raw materials"; or from " imported manufactured raw materials as determined by the Minister ". </para>

                        <para>- Certain powers have to be vested in the Minister. In the section as it now stands, paragraph  a  covers goods wholly produced or wholly manufactured in the United Kingdom from materials determined by the Minister as raw materials. The fact that/manufacturers in the United Kingdom had to await determinations by the Minister, before they could be sure that the materials used in the production of their goods would be regarded as raw materials for purposes of the preference, raised considerable difficulty and delays in both the United Kingdom and Australia. The section, as- amended, will provide that raw materials partially manufactured in Australia shall be included in the list of. raw materials determined by the Minister. It is proposed to insert irb sub-paragraph i of paragraph  a  of sub-section 1, the words, " or in. Australia ", so that there will be no&gt; need for the Minister to include in &amp; determination " raw materials partially manufactured in Australia ". Under sub-paragraph ii of paragraph  a  of subsection 1, " imported unmanufactured raw materials " have been inserted. This will remove the necessity for the Minister listing in a determination " unmanufactured raw materials". </para>

                <para>It may be well at this juncture to mention that a definition of " unmanufactured raw materials " is embodied in the proposed new sub-section 7, so that manufacturers in the United Kingdom will have less difficulty in deciding whether their products are entitled to entry into Australia under the British preferential tariff. As this provision follows very closely a similar provision iu the New Zealand law dealing with unmanufactured raw materials, manufacturers in the United Kingdom should have no difficulty in following it. </para>
                <para>Under the provisions of paragraph  b  of the present section, 75 per cent, of the factory or works' cost must be of labour and/or materials of United Kingdom origin.  As  I have already explained, this  has  proved to be a great disability to manufacturers in the United Kingdom. The alteration proposed will facilitate matters in that connexion. For a considerable time representations have been made by honorable members for the am'endment of the law to remove this anomaly. </para>
                <para>Paragraph c covers goods of a class or kind not commercially produced or manufactured in Australia; and the percentage of United Kingdom labour or material or of United Kingdom and Australian labour or material is only 25 per cent. Provision is being made, however, under the proposed new sub-section 2, that where, in relation to any particular goods or class of goods, to which paragraph c applies, the Minister is satisfied that it is desirable that 50 per cent, should be substituted for 25 per cent., he may so  determine, and thereupon that paragraph shall apply. </para>

                        <para>- It is necessary that the Minister should have that power. The proposed alteration has been requested. As I stated earlier, the reason for the insertion of this proposed sub-section is that certain goods which are being manufactured in the United Kingdom could easily comply with paragraph b; but other manufacturers are taking advantage of the fact that similar goods are not being made in Australia, to import foreign semi-manufactured goods, on which they carry put in the United Kingdom only sufficient work to enable them to comply with the 25 per cent, provision. Thus they arc detrimentally competing in the Australian market against the genuine British manufacturers, who are fully complying with the spirit of the preference. </para>

                <para>The proposed sub-section 3 provides that no goods shall be deemed to be the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom unless the final process of their production or manufacture .has been performed in the United Kingdom. This provision wa3 previously introduced, and was designed to prevent foreign countries from obtaining the benefit of the British preferential tariff. Under the proposed sub-section 4, the provisions of this section may be applied to, goods the produce of countries with which the Commonwealth has preferential tariff agreements, such as Canada. The proposed sub-section 9 applies specially to cinematograph films, the position in connexion with which I have already explained. </para>

Other amendments, particularly those bearing upon the conditions governing the giving of preference to British goods, are distinctly desirable. Unhappily, however, this Government, by its policy of general tariff prohibitions, lias so whittled away the value of our preferences to Great </para>

                        <para>- It is something; but, unfortunately, the opportunities for these amendments to have served British trade have be on very largely reduced by the tariff policy of the Government. However, the amendments generally are sound. I need scarcely say that I very warmly approve of the removal of the embargo hitherto existing on Australian raw materials so far as British preferences are concerned. It was not right that, because Australian materials went into the manufacture of British goods, those goods should be disqualified from receiving the benefit of Australian preference. The only amendment regarding which I have any doubt is that bearing upon the introduction of goods not commercially manufactured in Australia. Up to the present, such goods have been allowed to come in under the British preference provisions, if not less- than 25 per cent, of their manufacture is represented by labour or materials of the United Kingdom, or, as now amended, by labour of the United Kingdom and labour or materials of Australia. It is now proposed that the Minister, at his discretion, may insist that the British or Australian materials shall be not less than 50 per cent. The Minister has informed the House, and I accept his explanation, that this change is being made at the request of certain British manufacturers. I cannot refrain from pointing out, however, that the Minister's reputation as a tariff reformer is such that one almost instinctively suspects him, when he takes power to himself to raise the barrier against imports. It is difficult to suppress the feeling that he has it in mind to benefit some part of the Australian manufacturing industry. It is  true  that this condition of preference applies only to manufactures not produced within Australia, and it is, therefore, difficult to see how the discretionary power of the Minister can be exercised to the advantage of Australian manufactures at the expense of British goods. We know, however.  that, although Australia may not be manufacturing a certain article imported from Great Britain, there are various Australian goods which may be regarded as substitutes for it, and I am a little afraid that this amendment may, instead of assisting British manufactures, as it purports to do, be used upon occasion as a further barrier to the importation of British goods. </para>

                        <para>-- That is so. Under the present administration, if a substitute can be found for British manufactures, the Minister will insist upon the  50  per cent, provision in respect to British imports, instead of the  25  per cent, provision. That is the only proposed amendment which raised a doubt in my mind whether we should not ask for some delay before agreeing to these proposals. However, the bill is to go before the Senate, and there will be ample time to go into such matters. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has introduced a series of amendments to the Customs Act, and I am sorry that he has not taken advantage of the opportunity to deal with a matter which I raised some time ago, and with which he was, I think, partly in sympathy. My representations had to do with the importation of works of art, and I feel that honorable members should be given an opportunity of expressing their opinions upon a proposal to liberalize the provisions relating to the importation of such articles. I asked the Minister whether it wa's possible to remit the duties payable on an altar which it is proposed to import from Italy for the chapel of St. Scholastics, attached to the convent belonging to the Sisters of the Order of the Good Samaritan at Glebe Point, where the Order has its head-, quarters. I understand that the Customs Act provides that works of art may be admitted duty free, provided they are open for public inspection. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that the provision refers only to pictures; I understand that it has general application. In the case I have mentioned, the view taken by the department is that the altar would not be open for public inspection, but in that, I think, the department is drawing too fine a distinction. Altars of this kind cannot be made in Australia. At the present time, unfortunately, we have not in Australia men capable of doing this class of work to the satisfaction of those who are interested. It is true that the chapel is associated with a convent, but the building is separate and distinct from the convent building, and although in the convent grounds, it is not entirely closed to the public. As a matter of fact, the chapel is open at all times. </para>

If the Minister has not power under the regulations as they now stand to remit the duty in this case, I ask that he will give consideration to the matter during the recess with a view to making the necessary amendment, so that all religious institutions, and any one else who is interested, may import works of art of this kind without having to pay heavy duties on them. After all, whatever money is saved by religious boai.es through not having to pay duty will be spent on buildings and improvements, so that the country will benefit in any case. </para>

                    <para>.^1  suggest that the Government should regard works of art, and the duties imposed on them, from the point of view of the cultural interests of Australia. The exclusion of works of art by means of Customs barriers very seldom leads to anything being produced in Australia to take their place. Take the case of the Archibald statue in Sydney. It was surely inconsistent with the idea of developing the mind and taste of the people to impose a duty on such a statue. </para>

                    <para>.- I congratulate the Government upon one amendment it is making by this bill. In  1925,  a very stupid provision was inserted in the act, the effect of which was to deprive the British manufacturer of the advantage of the British preferential tariff if a fraction of foreign material was used in combination with Australian wool in the article manufactured by him. The Pastoralists Association has been agitating for years to have .-this anomaly removed. It is a source of considerable annoyance to British manufacturers. I remember quoting in this chamber a long extract from a South African newspaper of an interview with a British manufacturer who pointed out ill nt as a result of the determination of the then Commonwealth Minister for Trade and Customs, he had lost many thousands of pounds. He was so indignant about the matter that he had altered his machinery for the purpose of buying South African wool in future, instead 'of Australian. I am pleased that this amendment is to be made. It will not only do good to Great Britain, but will also help Australia. At any rate, il cannot hurt us in any way. </para>

                <para>I regret that this bill does not propose to deprive the Minister of the power he has to interpret the words " not commercially produced or manufactured in Australia." We have had most extraordinary ministerial determinations as to what can be commercially produced or manufactured in Australia. One instance mentioned in the chamber by the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> comes to my mind. A contractor who thought that he could do a great deal of good by boring for water in the Mallee made inquiries as to what would be a suitable type of plant to use for the purpose, and he chose a drill manufactured in the United States of America. Its landed cost was  £600,  but because the Minister decided that a similar drill could be commercially manufactured in Australia - the honorable member for Fawkner told the House that the Australian drill would have cost  £1,500 -  a duty of  £396  was imposed. This happened before the time of the present Minister. The net result was that the Mallee farmers had  o pay more for any boring done for them. This question affects all oil boring operations. If there is any enterprise the Government might assist  it is certainly that of boring for oil in Australia, because of the marvellous development that would follow the discovery of oil; but when- people who are willing to put up their money to explore for oil seek to purchase the most up-to-date oil boring plants, which are only obtainable in America, the duties charged by the Customs Department are exorbitant. I have letters from the Australian Roma No. 1 and No. 2 telling of the enormous sums they have been called upon to pay for duty on the plants they have purchased. In the matter of price and the quality of work capable of being done, there is no comparison between the San Francisco drill and that which is made in Australia. There should be some more definite interpretation of the words " not commercially produced or manufactured in Australia." In committee I propose to move for the insertion of the following new clause: - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">Section 52 empowers the Minister to prohibit the entry of certain goods which are inimical to the health or morals of the people. I agree that, power should be given to prohibit the importation of some classes of goods, but it is extraordinary that while a Minister is not. allowed to increase duties without seeking the consent of Parliament, he may prohibit trade with Australia in certain goods. Already he has prohibited the importation of reapers, threshers and various other types of agricultural machinery. Surely if he is not permitted to increase duties without the consent of Parliament, he should not be empowered to prohibit trade with Australia without the consent of Parliament. I am, therefore, suggesting that instead of being permitted to make these prohibitions by proclamation, he shall effect them by regulation, which, of course, must be laid before Parliament, so that Parliament may have an opportunity to disallow it. The issue raised by my proposal is that of Parliament versus the Executive. For years" Parliament has been fighting for the right to control all things, and I think that it should not permit itself to be deprived of its control over the trade of this country. I want a consequential amendment to be made in section 112 relating to the interstate conveyance of prohibited exports, and I shall move to add a new clause, "section 226 of the principal act is amended by adding tire words ' or until ninety days after such tariff or tariff period has been proposed, whichever period is the shorter.' " The effect of that amendment would be to render a. tariff schedule ineffective if not approved by Parliament within 90 days of its submission to this House. The present law provides that a schedule must be approved during the session in which it is tabled, but the present practice is for a session to extend over the whole life of Parliament. The Government may now impose duties and not get approval for its action until years after the schedule has been tabled. Every honorable member should realize his responsibility in this respect to see that Parliament alone imposes taxation on the people. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that this bill does not contain another amendment, which the business community had every reason to expect would be included in any measure to amend the Customs Act. As honorable members are aware, that act has not been amended since 1925. Each year since then the Chambers o.f Commerce throughout the Commonwealth have been urging that the Customs Act should be amended to provide that, as soon as an overseas vessel has reported to the customs at its first port of call in the Commonwealth, the rate of duty leviable on that day shall be the legal rate for the whole of that ship's cargo if entered for home consumption. At the annual conference of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, in 1925, 1926 and 1927, resolutions affirming that the act should be so amended were carried unanimously. In 1926, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten,</inline> then Minister for Trade and Customs, advised the chamber to seek legal advice on the subject, and it was referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> S. O'Halloran, E.C., of Adelaide. That gentleman submitted the opinion that there was nothing in the Constitution that prevented section 132 of the Customs Act from being amended to give effect to the desire of the Associated Chambers of Commerce.

The right honorable gentleman replied that the matter had received consideration, that an amendment of the Customs Act had been drafted to give effect to the request of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, and that the Government intended to proceed with the amendment as soon as possible. In a letter dated the 5th October, 1928, the Prime Minister reiterated the advice that he had given me on the floor of the House. Later, the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> visited Queensland in his capacity of Minister for Trade and Customs, and he also gave an assurance that a bill was being drafted to give effect to the request of the Associated Chambers of Commerce.

This position has been thrashed out at several of the annual conferences of the Australasian Chambers of Commerce, at which strong recommendations have been carried, practically unanimously, asking that this manifest injustice should be remedied. </para>
                <para>On presentation of the resolutions the Minister for Customs suggested that legal opinion should be obtained on the question, and accordingly the resolutions were submitted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> S. O'Halloran, K.C., of Adelaide, who gave it. as his opinion that there was nothing in the Constitution to prevent an alteration of section132 of the Customs Act to give effect to the desire of the associated chambers. At our interview in Brisbane with the Minister for Customs, he stated that, on his return to Melbourne, he would refer the whole matter to the Crown Law authorities, and it was stated in the House of Representatives on the 5th December, 1927, in the tariff debate, and was not contradicted either by him or by the Minister for Customs, that the Federal Attorney-General agrees with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Halloran's</inline> views, and has confirmed his opinion. </para>
                <para>According to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> of the 1st September, 1928, the member for Brisbane asked what action had been taken regarding this matter, and the Prime Minister replied, " That the matter had received consideration, and that an amendment of the Customs Act had been drafted to give effect to the request of the associated chambers of Australia, and that the Government intended to proceed with the amendment as soon as possible." </para>
                <para>During an address given by the Minister for Trade and Customs to the members of the Chamber of Manufactures and Chamber of Commerce on the 8th August this year, he was asked about the amending bill, and replied that it would be introduced shortly. </para>
                <para>As this matter is not a party measure in the slightest degree, and the amending bill is to remedy an obvious injustice, and what is an illegal preference, and, further, is contrary to the Commonwealth Constitution, I venture to ask that it will have your favorable and prompt action. </para>
                <para>Probably you are fully conversant with the position, but, in order to bring all the salient points used at the last conference under your notice, I am posting you under separate cover a copy of the annual report of the Associated Chambers of Commerce Conference, 1927-28, and on pages 80 to 91 will be found the debate on the question. (Sgd.) J. E. Plumridge. </para>
                <para class="block">I have quoted the opinions of those who are obviously thoroughly conversant with the subject, and they deserve the attention of the House. With the continual amendments of the tariff to which we are now accustomed, it becomes all the more necessary that these defects in the Customs Act should be remedied. </para>
                <para>In reply to the further representations of the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> wrote on the 23rd September, 1930, as follows: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Your letter of the11th August on the subject of customs duties has received consideration. You refer to uniform customs duties, but I would point out that customs duties are at present uniform, and at any given moment the same duties apply all over Australia. As the proposal would alter this state of things, it does not seem to be a proposition for uniform customs duties, but for differential customs duties. </para>
                    <para>I would ako like to say that the commercial community is not, as you suggest, unanimous on this subject, as one of the Australian Chambers of Manufactures has made an emphatic protest against such an alteration as proposed. lt is thought that the attempt now being made to remove certain anomalies will only create other anomalies in their place. When tariff rates are altered there will always ho, for a time on any market, some goods that paid the old rate and some that paid the new rate, and whatever is done, this cannot bo entirely avoided. </para>
                    <para>Under the proposed amendment, the old duty would be payable on goods on a ship that arrived via Australian ports, and side by Hide there may be a ship that arrived direct, discharging similar goods liable to the new duty. Two ships may leave Great Britain together. If one went to Fremantle for a few hours and the other did not, the first ship would secure certain rights for the cargo on that vessel, which may be denied to the other ship, which proceeds direct to a later port. </para>
                    <para>Another serious difficulty relates to goods entered for bond. Assuming that the alteration of duty was an increase, would it be fair that these goods should be sent to bond and bc allowed to come on the market at the lower duty, at any future time the owner thought fit? The conference, I think, saw this difficulty and suggested a modification to meet it, but you will remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> S. O'Halloran, of counsel, "raised a doubt as to whether it would he constitutional to give goods in bund different treatment from other goods. </para>
                    <para>It must not be overlooked that such an alteration of the law must "cut both ways." If a duty were reduced the higher duty would have to bo paid on all goods in Australian waters at the time of reduction. </para>

For some considerable time I corresponded and conferred with the Minister on a similar matter. A Brisbane lady desired to present a processional cross to the.

Representations were made to the Minister by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> among others, with the result that that gentleman had the matter investigated further.

I know of an instance in which goods which were consigned to Sydney bore a certain duty. The remainder of the consignment proceeded to Melbourne. Before they were landed, a fresh schedule was brought down, providing for an increased rate of duty, which had to be paid. Obviously, that put the Melbourne importers- at a disadvantage. </para>

                    <para>Frequently goods are entered under bylaw, a practice that inflicts an injustice both on manufacturers and importers. When it suits the convenience of the Government, and also when the Customs Department is satisfied that the goods cannot be made in Australia, the operation of the duty is temporarily suspended.  The practice would be fair and reasonable if the goods could not be manufactured here, and also if all importers concerned were treated on the same basis. I have questioned and written the Minister in connexion with a case in which certain hardware was imported, upon which duty was paid, while other similar hardware was brought in free as a result of the temporary suspension of the by-law. To rectify the anomaly I suggest that all decisions of the Government to admit goods free under by-law should be advertised seven days prior to any landing. The commercial community hears of these entries only after the goods have been landed, when the incident is advertised in the Government and trade gazettes. If it were, generally made known that certain goods would be admitted free, manufacturers or importers would have an opportunity to protest if they had objections. If my recommendation were accepted, it would mean a good deal of revenue to the department, . as an importer who believes that he could get goods through free under by-law would quote on that assumption.

                            <para>- I was not hinting at any improper action by the department. I had in mind a man who does not do his business through a customs agent, and who would quote on the assumption that a certain rate of duty would be payable on his commodities. Other merchants with experience in the matter could quote to greater advantage, knowing that they could bring in their goods free on a specified duty. My suggestion would be fair to the manufacturer who might be able to make the goods here, and who could lodge his protest, and to the importer. There may be difficulties in the way of incorporating it in the Custom* Act. Possibly that would come under the Tariff Act. But I urge that some action in this direction should be taken. </para>

                        <para>. -  The measure that has been brought forward by the Minister is exceedingly disappointing. It deals with a number of matters that are of relatively small importance. One would imagine after the wide experience that the Minister has gained through bringing down a tariff containing over 400 items, the most voluminous and punitive tariff ever introduced, that he would be able to introduce a series of comprehensive amendments that would be to the advantage of the trade and commerce of the country. I am quite sure that had the honorable gentleman given his capable officers full range, they would have suggested many more amendments, of greater importance than those now proposed. </para>

                    <para>We are solemnly asked to consider whether we shall delete from the act the word " league " and substitute the words " three nautical miles " That momentous discovery is the outcome of the Minister's great experience in tariff legislation. The Minister also proposes to take more power to himself, and certain matters are again to be left entirely to his judgment and authority. Against that I, and the commercial community generally, have protested. One satisfactory featare of the bill is that it does to some extent define the conditions under which British pref terence may be granted ; but the objectionable and indefinite words "not commercially produced or manufactured in Australia " are retained. During the tariff debate I unavailingly asked the Minister to explain what those words meant, and I mentioned an article of machinery which could have been imported for £2,000, but which the Minister held could be commercially manufactured in Australia, although its cost would be £6,000. The provisions relating to the preference to be granted to the United Kingdom might as well be deleted, if the Minister is to be able, by his interpretation of the phrase "commercially produced or manufactured in Australia ", to render the whole scheme nugatory. I am certain that, in practice, the preference will be rendered valueless. Another amendment refers to the taking of moving pictures in different parts of the world, and recognizing them as British films if they are registered under any law of the United Kingdom, a detail of comparative unimportance which might have been arranged without new legislation. </para>

I repeat that the bill continues the power of the Minister to dictate the operations of commerce throughout the Commonwealth. The conditions under which goods may be admitted should be stated in black and white, so that he who runs may read. Traders should not be at the mercy of any whim, caprice, or dictum of any individual as to the manner in which they shall conduct their business. Although the bill provides that the Minister shall decide these matters, in actual practice that will be impossible. Lord Hewitt, in <inline font-style="italic">The New Despotism,</inline> has pointed to the growing practice in British legislation to delegate to Ministers powers which really belong to Parliament, the exercise of which very often is in the discretion of junior officers. </para>

                            <para>- Lord Hewitt has protested against Parliament abrogating its authority by delegating duties and rights to Ministers and their officials. This bill perpetuates that evil, against which a large volume of public opinion has protested. I do not expect my views to be accepted by ministerial supporters. They are accustomed to solicit from Ministers favours for the sections and coteries they represent. Some honorable members glory in what they achieve in that way, and are able thus to retain their seats; but I do not consider it part of my duty to go on my hands and knees to Ministers or departments for concessions for any section. The rights of traders should be stated in black and white, and should not be subject to the caprice or predilections of the Minister or his officers. </para>

                        <para>. - Sometimes gifts are made to churches and other public institutions by persons resident or travelling abroad; some lady may offer a gift to the church in which she was baptized or married, and such a gift should, in my opinion, be admitted free of duty. I recollect one such gift in connexion with which I had to decide against my own conviction. An organ which had been installed in the private residence of a citizen of the United Kingdom was, on his death, dismantled and sent out to Australia as a gift to an Anglican Church in Sydney. In accordance with the rules and regulations, customs duty had to be imposed, but I resolved that if I remained in the department such regulations would have to be amended in order to allow greater discretion in these matters. Another gift to a church in Perth came under my notice, but I was able to regard that as a work of art, and admit it without payment of duty. The honorable member for Brisbane has stated that  after much trouble a silver cross presented to a church in Brisbane was admitted duty free. It is time that we came to  a  commonsense decision in regard to these matters. Churches are not engaged in competitive trading, and gifts of the character I have mentioned are not imported for pro.fi t. No doubt there are some people connected with churches who, if allowed a foot, would take a yard, but, generally speaking, the regulations should be liberally interpreted in relation to presentation goods for churches and other public institutions. I urge the Minister to give consideration to this matter; if he cannot make the necessary amendment in this bill I hope that he will propose it in another. Such an alteration would not involve any loss to Australian trade or interfere with the employment of our workmen. I endorse the Minister's denial of the statement that the admission of goods under regulations is decided by junior officers. Such matters are controlled by the senior officers, and I make bold to say that no department of the Commonwealth Service has such n highly-qualified staff as has the Customs Department. The responsible officers are quite capable of giving unbiased decisions in regard to important matters. Some wrong precedents may have been established, but I am not wedded to precedents, and 1 believe that the regulations should be relaxed or made more flexible in order to permit of the commonsense treatment of gifts from abroad. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to bring before the Minister a matter with which he is well acquainted ; I refer to the absolute prohibition on the importation of racing yacht sails. I understand that he has this matter before him for reconsideration, but the facts are these: The greatest sailmakers in the world for practically the last century are the firm of Ratsey and Lapthorn, of Cowes. The business has been handed down from father to son. No racing yacht that takes part in an important race has other than Ratsey sails. Let me give examples of the excellence of these sails. My own success in the yachting world for practically 30 years was due to the use of Ratsey sails. Notwithstanding the fact that Wilson and Silsby are one of the greatest sailmaking firms in the United States of America, yet that nation imported seven sets of sails from Cowes for the last America Cup race. The United States of America has been able to retain that cup against Great Britain only by the use of Ratsey sails. In Australia the equivalent of the America Cup is the Sayonara Cup, which is an interstate race. I had the honour, in 1910, to be the first New South Welshman to wrest, with the aid of my famous <inline font-style="italic">Culwalla,</inline> that cup from Victoria. We have held the cup since 1910, and Victoria has now challenged with a better yacht than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Albert's eight-metre yacht.- He cannot defend the cup with any chance of success without Ratsey sails. He ha« ordered a set of the sails, and they are to-day in bond in Sydney. He is prepared to pay even 100 per cent, duty to obtain them, but there is an absolute prohibition against them. I do not mind if the duty is heavy, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Albert cau well afford to pay it, but it is not right to place an absolute prohibition on these sails. Sport is perhaps the greatest thing in our Australian lives. The Minister has power under the act to lift the prohibtion, and if ho does so no harm will be done to the local sailmakes because if they were put in the witness box, good sportsmen as they are, they would admit that they could not make a Bermuda rig sail to fit a mast 75 ft. high, equal to a Ratsey sail. The race is to take place in January, so time is short. I appeal to the Minister to lift the prohibition so as to allow these sails to be admitted. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot agree with the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks),</inline> because sail* can be made just as well in Australia as abroad. I admit that the honorable member has had considerable yachting experience, but let me inform him that Ta§manian boats equipped with, local sails  have for years held the Forster Cup, which is competed for every year by small sailing boats throughout Australia. On one occasion a Tasmanian boat using Tasmanian  sails wiped the seas with a boat from. New South Wales, which used imported sails, costing fifteen times as much as the local sails. There is no reason why we should lift the prohibition on imported sails, because we can make sails equal to, if not better, than imported sails. </para>

                        <para>. - We all look upon the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks)</inline> as an authority on yachting, seeing that he has for years been one of the loading yachtsmen in Australia. We are, therefore, bound to listen with attention to any representations that he may make on behalf of imported sails, Although an unfavorable decision wa3 made in regard to the admission of Rats ey  sails for the famous yachting race that is soon to take place in Australia, I can assure the honorable member that I shall call for the file and reconsider the whole matter. The honorable member, and also the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill),</inline> have assured me that the imported sails are now in bond in Sydney. I was interested to hear from the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost)</inline> that on one occasion the Tasmanian boat - to use his own expression - wiped the seas with another boat using imported sails costing fifteen times as much as the local sails. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. They are experienced officers in matters of this kind. If necessary, they obtain the advice of experts, well-known artists and others. In connexion with the silver cross for the Brisbane cathedral, the opinions of a silversmith and a well-known artist were obtained in addition to that of the officers of the department. The department sometimes obtains legal opinion from the Attorney-General's Department as to what constitutes a public institution. Thi? matter is not dealt with haphazardly. There are certain, places that can !be called public institutions, but other places do not come under that heading; and therein lies the difficulty. Probably persons who do not succeed in having their pictures, statues or altars classified as works of art consider that unfair discrimination has been shown against them. Whether a work is a work of art sometimes depends on where it is to be hung or erected. If it were to be erected in a public place, the Minister would most likely give a favorable decision. It might be a different matter if it were to be erected in some secluded place not open to the public. I assure honorable members who have spoken on this subject that their representations will be sympathetically considered. </para>

                        <para>The claim is, in effect, that once a vessel is entered at an Australian port the rate of duty on goods imported in that vessel should be the same wherever those goods are landed. Under the present system an importer of goods at one port of call may pay a less rate than an importer at a later port, and may possibly be able to undersell the later importer by transferring his goods from one State to another. Section 132 of the Customs Act makes administration simple, and  while  it may bo practicable to amend it without creating any serious difficulties, care will be needed not to infringe the requirements as to uniformity, and after such an amendment it might happen that there would be similar goods in different ships in port cleared on the same day, paying different rates of duties. </para>

                    <para class="block">Government refused to do. Under section 132 of the Customs Act, duty is payable at the rate in force at the date the goods are entered for home consumption. The intention of the amendment which the honorable member proposes to move is to provide for the collection of duties at the same rate as that on similar goods out of a vessel which has reported at her first port of call in Australia before an amendment of the tariff has become effective. For instance, a vessel arrives at Fremantle on the first of the month. The goods for that port are landed, and duty paid at the rates in force on the first of the month. On the 3rd of the month, before the vessel has arrived at, say, Melbourne, duties are increased.  In that case, the honorable member desire's that all goods out of the vessel shall be permitted entry at the rates in force on the first of the month. I doubt whether such a course would be legal, and whether a breach of the Constitution would not be committed if varying rates of duty were charged on goods which arrived at an Australian port, on the same day. In the event ,of a vessel arriving at, say, Fremantle, on the 1st day of the month, and an alteration of the duty being tabled in Parliament on the evening of that day, a vessel arriving at that port on the second day of the month would probably reach other ports on the same day that the first vessel arrived there. In that case, the goods from one vessel would be subject -to a higher duty than similar goods from the other vessel; and thus there would be created anomalies much more undesirable than those which it is claimed now exist. The Chamber of Commerce at Brisbane has taken a keen interest in this matter.

                        <para>.- The principal act, which this bill seeks to amend, was passed in 1901. ' Power was then given to the Minister to prohibit the importation of certain goods, and articles, as, for instance, false money; counterfeit coin ; blasphemous, indecent, and obscene works and articles; goods manufactured by prison labour; and certain classes of drugs. It was recognized that there would probably be other goods which it would be undesirable to allow into this country, and consequently, in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of section . 52, &amp; general power was given to the Minister to prohibit the importation of goods by proclamation. The present Minister has abused that power. Since the present Government assumed office, the importation of from 80 to 100 different classes of goods, which formerly were imported, has been prohibited. Under the provision mentioned, the Minister is given more power than the tariff itself confers on him; the tariff must be approved by Parliament, whereas Parliament has no control over a proclamation unless it can carry a vote of want of confidence in the government responsible for issuing it. If we substituted the word " regulation " for " proclamation " in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of section 52, the power of the Government would not be diminished, for it would still be able to prohibit the importation of any goods; but if its action was contrary to the , wishes of Parliament, the regulation could be disallowed. Parliament should control the power to tax the people. By proclamation the Government can now refuse to allow goods of any description, whether harmful or not, to enter this country. No Government should be empowered to prevent the importation of goods unless its action is subject to review by Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so; but it was never abused before the present* Government came into office, nor was it intended to be used except to prevent objectionable articles entering Australia. By adjourning Parliament from time to time, thus making one session extend over a long period, a tariff schedule may continue in force for three years without being subjected to review by Parliament. I admit that action in the direction indicated by the amendment ought to have been taken earlier; but not until this Government came into office was the power conferred on the Minister abused. The Minister says that he has not abused the power conferred on him. I remind him that his tariff proposals of last year meant that we could not trade with certain countries. </para>

The action to which I refer was taken in order that certain manufacturers and traders in Australia might be given concessions. I should like to know why persons who wish to buy, say, a particular kind of machine, should not bc permitted to buy it, so long as they pay the duty which Parliament has imposed on it. if Parliament decides that the importation of certain goods shall be prohibited, I am prepared to accept its decision; but Parliament has not so decided. This Parliament is subservient to the Government, although we have been elected to this Parliament to protect the interests of the people as a whole. </para>

In my opinion, the present practice is both unreasonable and illogical, whereas the amendment of the honorable member for Swan is both reasonable and logical. The Minister may not impose duties, with the object of making it more difficult for goods to enter this country, without ultimately obtaining the consent of Parliament to his action; but, by proclamation, he can prevent such goods coming here at all. That is to say, he can do the greater thing, although he cannot do the smaller thing. He cannot put on a duty without the consent of Parliament; but by means of a proclamation he can impose a total prohibition, and his action is not subject to parliamentary review. The amendment would still permit the Government to place embargoes on imports, but Parliament would have to ratify or disapprove of what was done. I ask the committee to agree to the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- All that the amendment asks is that the word " regulation " shall be substituted for the word " proclamation," so that within a reasonable time Parliament will have an opportunity to decide on the merits or demerits of the regulation. It is notorious that the power to prohibit imports by proclamation has been grossly abused by the present Government, under the cloak of a national emergency. When the Prime Minister announced that certain prohibitions of imports had been made, and, later, when he imposed certain surtaxes, I agreed as to the necessity for action being taken along those lines, because of the national emergency and the necessity to adjust the balance of trade. I still admit the necessity for action along those lines; but I point out now, as I did then, that the act gives the Minister a power which might be dangerous in the hands of one who favours a policy of protection run mad. Honorable members on this side strongly urged, the Government to put a time limit upon prohibitions and surcharges. We expressed our complete readiness to consider them on their merits, and, if necessary, extend the period of their operation ; but this Government refused to introduce a time limit, and, therefore, its action in this matter is highly suspect. We do not ask that the power to prohibit summarily should be taken from the government of the day; that power is quite necessary. Moreover, it is conferred under every customs act throughout the world. It is desirable that a government should have power summarily to prohibit, on health grounds, the importation of various things which might spread disease. </para>

                            <para>- When I was Minister for Trade and Customs, I prohibited the importation of peanuts from China for one year, but the difference between my action and that of the present Government is that I obtained from the interested parties in Queensland, including the Peanut Control Board, on which there was a government representative, a written undertaking that at the end of the year neither the renewal of the embargo nor an increase in duty would be requested. One of the first acts of the present Minister, however, was to give that industry prohibition in perpetuity. That points to the necessity for agreeing to the amendment before the committee. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw it; but the Minister is becoming too squeamish. There is a vast difference between personal and political unscrupulousness. The Minister has said that the power contained in the bill is  necessary, and he has exercised it, to use his own words, to avert national bankruptcy. Two of the prohibited commodities were snuff and canary seed, and that is how the Minister averted national bankruptcy! Much harm has been done by the indiscriminate and reckless use of prohibitions, and we have given offence to certain foreign countries that have been good customers of Australia. Naturally, we have prompted acts of retaliation on their part. </para>

                            <para>- France, Italy, and Germany. As a representative of primary producers, the honorable member who interjects should support, the amendment.  If  these prohibitions had been brought before this committee, they might have been altered here and there without in any way destroying their effect in adjusting trade in the national interest, and yet the giving of offence to foreign countries could have been avoided. In the amendment before the committee, we are merely asking for an opportunity to consider proposed prohibitions. About fifteen months ago the importation of some 71 commodities was summarily prohibited, and the elect of the people of Australia have not been given an opportunity to express an opinion on the action taken. In the course of a few hours, probably, a proclamation covering many import prohibitions is prepared by the Minister, but it is impassible to deal with great subjects of trade in such a hurry without making mistakes. I do not suppose a step of greater concern to trade than the imposition of these prohibitions and surcharges has been taken since the inauguration  of  federation, and yet no" honorable member had the right to say anything to prevent it. </para>

The leading financial authorities of Australia advised the prohibition of the importation of such things as luxuries. Country members know that by prohibiting the importation of dried fruits, onions, malted milk, and other goods, the primary industries of this country benefited. Honorable members opposite cannot reasonably object to a Labour government exercising power which has been in the hands of all Commonwealth Governments, particularly when the object is to rectify our adverse trade balance during the greatest economic crisis in the history of Australia, and, indeed, of the world. </para>

                        <para>.- This matter might more properly have been raised on a question of privilege, because it is certainly an abuse of parliamentary privilege that the Government, which is the executive body, should take to itself powers which it was never intended to possess. Parliament is supreme, and yet its will has been thwarted in this regard. I shall support the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> who pointed out that there is much difference between a government doing a thing by proclamation and doing it by regulation.. A regulation may be discussed in this House, and may be either agreed to or disagreed with ; but we have no opportunity of discussing the action of a government taken by means of a proclamation, unless a special motion for the adjournment of the House is submitted, or unless a specific motion of want of confidence in the Government is moved. What has a government to fear in providing for prohibitions by regulation? Does the Government fear to have the light of day made to shine upon its actions? Is it fearful that, in a discussion on the floor of the House, it would be shown that the gain derived from a prohibition was not sufficient to justify such extreme action? In placing the various tariff items before us, the Government has been forced, willy-nilly, to accept the opinion of this chamber in regard to each item, and I contend that the same practice should obtain in regard to those items which have been placed on the prohibited list. I do not intend to discuss that matter to-day. The honorable member tor Swan has raised the question whether Parliament is supreme, or whether it is willing to permit the Government to us-: the powers given under the original act in a manner never intended by Parliament. I hope that honorable members who have the dignity of this House at heart, and stand for the privileges belonging to members, will support the amendment of the honorable member. </para>

                        <para>.- I intend to support the amendment of the honorable member . for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> I do not propose to go into the merits or demerits of the embargoes imposed by the present Government. My attitude is determined by my desire to afford Parliament an opportunity of discussing such prohibitions, and for that reason I support the amendment. My concern is not whether it was advisable for the Minister to prohibit the importation of canary seed, or any other article, but whether this Parliament should retain its supremacy as a legislative body; whether prohibitions of this kind are to be applied by proclamation in a manner which places them beyond the criticism of Parliament, or by regulations, subject to the review of Parliament. I am strongly opposed to government by proclamation. I have felt for some time that these powers vested in the Minister, though they have not been abused by the present Government, are subject Lo abuse, and have, as a matter of fact, been improperly exercised by previous governments. In the past, the power has been used, to prohibit the importation of certain goods, allegedly in order to prevent the entry of plant diseases. That was not the real reason for which the prohibition was desired. The application was made because the imported goods competed with certain trading interests in Australia. The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> when he was Minister for Customs, slipped badly iti regard to peanuts some' years ago. Interested parties in Australia were anxious to prohibit the importation of peanuts, and they, therefore, asked the Minister to place an embargo upon them, not for the reason that there was insufficient tariff protection, but because, they said, there was a plant disease affecting peanuts in some parts of China and elsewhere. </para>

                            <para>- I was not one of them. I believe that whether embargoes are imposed for such reasons as that, or because the Government is grappling with a situation in a statesmanlike way as this Government has been doing, they should be subject to review by this Parliament. The Minister said that this power had been enjoyed by Ministers for 31 years past. It does not follow that because a position was acceptable in 1901, it must still be acceptable in 1931. I cannot see any strong objection to allowing Parliament to exercise the fullest control over these matters, and I ask the Minister to review his decision. This amendment, if carried, would not lessen the power of the Minister to take what action he thought necessary during recess in  the interests  of the primary producers or other sections of the community, whether for quarantine or protective purposes. The Minister could take action, and, in due course, the matter would be reviewed by Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the amendment of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> It is evident that this power has been exercised  by the present Minister for Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> in such a manner as to bring home to honorable members the danger of allowing this section to remain in the act. I do not think that any honorable member will argue that the power was originally intended to be used as a means of affording protection to industry; yet, when we find that the Government has imposed embargoes on as many as seventeen items in one day, it becomes evident how the provision is now being used. In refusing to accept the amendment, the Minister could only plead that there was justification for the imposition of embargoes as a measure of protection. That, however, is not the point. It might be a good thing to prohibit the importation of dried fruits in the interests of those engaged in the production of such fruits in Australia. It might be a good thing to place an embargo upon the importation of peanuts, so as to assist those who are growing peanuts here; but, surely, if there is justification for protecting an industry, even to the point of prohibition, the matter should be decided by this Parliament, and by no one else. As the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> pointed out, when only a limited amount of protection is to be imposed, Parliament alone has power to grant it. For some months past this House has been considering whether the protection on various items should be 30, 40, 50 or 200 per cent., but while it has been so engaged, there have been in force a whole list of embargoes which this Government has imposed by proclamation. The position is absurd. I do not believe that, when this section was put into the act, it was ever expected that it would be used in this way. Surely the Government does not claim that it should have the right to decree, by executive action, what measure of protection should be given to Australian industries. The Labour party professes to be the most democratic of all parties, so that it should have no objection to these matters being submitted for decision by Parliament. I should have thought that the Minister's recent success in getting the tariff schedule through the House, would have convinced him that he might trust his party to support him in anything he might bring forward. For the sake of appearances, if for nothing else, he should be prepared to submit embargo proposals to Parliament for consideration. It is not a matter of whether governments have abused this power in the past or not; it is a matter of the supremacy of Parliament, and I shall be surprised if a majority of honorable members does not support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- I am glad the Minister has not agreed to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> Those who have spoken in support of the amendment have tried to raise two spurious side issues. The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> and others tried to make it appear that the Government, in exercising its right to prohibit the importation of certain goods into Australia, was seeking merely to give effect to its own protectionist policy. Every one who has followed the events leading up to the imposition of embargoes by. this Government knows that the action taken had nothing whatever to do with the Government's fiscal policy. The action was taken specifically for the purpose of dealing with a very serious condition of affairs which, as the Minister pointed out, had produced, over a series of years, an accumulated adverse trade balance of over £100,000,000. The position was rapidly becoming worse, and, in the national interests, the Government felt called upon, to exercise the powers which it undoubtedly possesses under the law to prevent the continued influx of imports from overseas. </para>

                            <para>- It would still have power to express its dissent. In this case, however, it is not a matter of any one embargo, but of many, and the powers of the Executive were exercised in extraordinary circumstances. Because of the extraordinary circumstances that existed, the Government placed an embargo upon a number of products that were being imported, as it was considered that their entry would seriously jeopardise the financial stability of the Commonwealth. The Government sought to safeguard the interests of the people aud of the nation. In the past, other governments have exercised the right to impose an embargo on any specific importation, an action which was subject to review by Parliament. No danger was feared from the practice, and there is no reason why anybody should cavil at similar action by this Government. I am glad that the Minister is opposed to the amendment of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> If I know anything about the good sense of the Commonwealth Parliament, I am confident that it will reject the honorable member's proposal. </para>

                        <para>.- We appear to have listened to a strong defence of parliamentary government. The arguments used by the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lewis),</inline> in relation to the power to prohibit the entry of any article into Australia by proclamation - which is not reviewable in any parliament except on a motion of censure- are two. First, that it is necessary to act promptly; therefore, the power should be exercised by proclamation instead of regulation. But, as both a regulation and ;a proclamation require executive action, a regulation may be made as promptly as a proclamation. ' So there is nothing whatever, in the first argument advanced by the honorable member.  His  second argument is that resort to proclamation ensures effective parliamentary control, because, if Parliament disagrees with any particular proclamation, a vote of censure, if you please, may be carried, and the Government put out of office. The old story of Bo-Bo burning down the house to roast the pig is obviously applicable. There may be disagreement to two of a list of about 70 items. The proposal of the honorable member for Corio is that a Government should be put out of office because of that dissent on two items out of 70. The idea of the honorable member is susceptible of further extension. Why should not all legislation be conducted in accordance with this purely democratic principle? Why should not the executive simply publish in the Government <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> such statutes as it thinks ought to form part of the law of the land, and leave it to Parliament to consider the detail's of that legislation during the discussion of a series of motions of censure of the Government? That is applying precisely the same procedure to legislation. If the idea is sound, and there is complete parliamentary control in accordance with the principles of representative and responsible government in the case of a proclamation prohibiting importation, there would be equally full parliamentary control if all legislation were conducted by that method. Accordingly, it would be necessary for Parliament to meet only very occasionally for the purpose of considering want of confidence motions. </para>

                    <para>The arguments of the honorable member do not support the conclusion which he draws, and it is remarkable that support should be given by honorable members in any .section of the chamber to the procedure adopted by this Government. The difference between the procedure adopted by this and other governments, is that this power to prohibit by proclamation, which has in the past been regarded as an emergency power, and justified by reference to considerations of health and disease, has been used by this </para>
                    <para class="block">Government in order to bring about most drastic changes in our whole fiscal system. If the government of the day wants to impose a duty of one-fifth of one per cent, upon any article coming into the country, it has to obtain the consent of both Houses of the legislature. But this Government has completely prohibited the entry of articles into Australia without reference to Parliament. I say that this power has been abused by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I am as much entitled to my opinion as is the right honorable gentleman to his. He holds his opinions just as dogmatically as I do mine, but has no more right to be dogmatic than I have. This is obviously a matter of opinion. I consider these prohibitions very important. It may be that the Prime Minister takes a very different view, to which he is entitled. ' I hold that there ought to be an opportunity for Parliament to discuss each prohibition in detail. This Parliament has the right to discuss every proposal for a duty, however small it may be; but in the case of absolute prohibitions it has had no opportunity to discuss them. </para>

Recent events have shown that there is no parliamentary control in relation to matters that have affected in a very important way the whole of our fiscal system. There ought to be an opportunity for Parliament to discuss, on its merits, and irrespective of the existence of a government, any prohibition of importations. I, therefore, support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I approach this matter from an entirely different angle from that considered by other speakers. When a government i3 returned to power it appoints a cabinet, which is responsible to Parliament for its actions. It is not right that a government supported by a majority such as this one has should have its efforts thwarted by a hostile Senate. The point is that if this Government passes certain regulations which are distasteful to the Opposition they can be nullified by the Senate. That is the governing factor behind the amendment. I shall oppose the amendment, as I believe that if the Government makes a mistake the Opposition is keen and capable enough to call attention to it, and, if necessary, to take action by moving a motion of want of confidence in the administration. The Government is responsible for any regulations that are enacted. If they do injury to any section of the community, or if the taint of graft is attached to them, this Parliament will be only too ready to take appropriate action. I shall oppose the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I confess that I am unable to follow the arguments advanced by the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. Riley).</inline> The only issue before the committee is whether Parliament shall have an opportunity to discuss prohibitions; whether they shall be effected by regulation or proclamation. All that the amendment seeks is an 'enlargement of the powers of Parliament to give it some control over importation. What objection can there be to allowing the Parliament to express its will as to what items shall be dealt with by proclamation? Although eighteen months have elapsed since some of these prohibitions were proclaimed. Parliament has had no opportunity to discuss them. The amendment proposes that regulations shall be substituted for proclamations; if that is agreed to, the rights of Parliament will be restored. I am amazed at the querulous opposition displayed by the Prime Minister. Obviously, he fears that the amendment may be decided against the Government. For that reason he entered the chamber in a state of flurry and excitement - not unusual on his part in certain circumstances- </para>

The Minister for Trade and Customs sought to justify the proclamation by reference to the adverse trade balance. The object of the proclamation was not so much to restore the balance of trade as to reward the protectionist followers of the Government for their services. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw it. The Prime Minister stated that the prohibitions were not part of the protectionist policy of the Government; but the Minister for Trade and Customs pointed out. this afternoon the extraordinary advantages which had accrued to the peanut industry and similar industries through the Government's protective exercise of its power of proclamation. The trade balance could and would have been redressed without resort to tariff prohibitions. Three things would have restored the balance:  (1)  the reduced purchasing power of the people which has prevented them from importing goods from overseas;  (2)  the adverse exchange; and  (3)  the stoppage of loan money, from overseas. The committee is now asked to decide whether Parliament shall have the right to discuss what goods shall be prohibited, or whether Cabinet shall continue by proclamation summarily to prohibit imports, and Parliament thus be prevented from expressing its opinion except by a motion of censure. The matters listed in the Customs Act, which, up to  1913,  were dealt with by proclamation, relate almost entirely to quarantine and health. </para>

He said that, the Government had abused the power of proclamation. This power was inserted in the original act in  1901,  and not by a Labour government; it is as old as this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- By means of proclamations the Government was able to deal with the serious trade position that confronted it when it assumed office. Over nine years of anti-Labour government had built up an adverse trade balance of over £100,000,000, and it was still increasing notwithstanding that our power to borrow overseas had ended before Labour was returned to power. The Bruce-Page Government was not able to borrow for months before it was put out of office. </para>

                            <para>- There had grown up in this country an extravagant system under which not only the governments of Australia but also private people were buying oversea goods on borrowed money. They were building up a huge debt in respect of oil and motor cars, and absolutely pawning this country to foreign traders. We came into office facing the worst economic and financial position in the history of this country, with an accumulated adverse trade balance of over £100,000,000. In . 1929-30, when we took office, the adverse trade balance, apart altogether from gold and bullion, was £32,000,000, and in that year we were unable to borrow money overseas. Imports were flowing in, and we had to check them at once. This year, because of the action taken by the Government, we have a favorable trade balance of £28,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- It is true that our ability to import was affected, not only by the reduced value of our exports, but also by the decline in the purchasing power of the community. The value of our imports in the last financial year was £45,000,000. The power of proclamation, which we have exercised, has enabled us to regulate the classes of goods imported into Australia. Honorable members seem to have lost sight of  that  fact. We were importing millions of pounds worth of goods that should never have been admitted into this country. I refer to luxury lines, such as tinned meats and vegetables, even dairy products. We were rapidly approaching the position in which we would not have had sufficient credit from our exports with which to pay for imported lines that were necessary to carry on industry in Australia. There was no money for imported raw materials or essential machinery. There was no money for the essential things that we needed, but there were millions of pounds available for luxury lines that could be manufactured successfully in Australia. We have turned an adverse trade balance into a favorable trade balance by the use of the power of proclamation. Set within one month of exercising that power, another place would have robbed us of it. </para>

We have clone things in spite of the hostility of another place, and it is because we have clone those things in the interests of Australia that the Opposition now wishes to rob us of this power. 1 repeat that, by our prompt action, without waiting for the consent of another place, we saved Australia from insolvency. </para>

                        <para>.- The Prime Minister has not given one reason for not accepting the amendment. At the risk of repetition, I wish to make clear not only my attitude in regard to these prohibitions, but also the attitude of every honorable member on this side of the chamber. I subscribed absolutely to the application of prohibitions as an adjuster of the trade balance. When the Government proposed to take the power of proclamation I spoke after the Prime Minister and pointed out definitely that there was danger in the free use of prohibition by proclamation. I said that it was calculated to antagonize certain foreign countries which are great customers of ours, and unless applied wisely with great discretion, would draw from, them active retaliation. I pointed out that we had much to lose as great exporters of primary produce, by the careless, if not reckless, use of prohibitions by proclamation. I, therefore, urged the Prime Minister to put a time limit upon them. At the same time I said that we, as an Opposition, were prepared, when the time limit expired, to consider any proposal from the Government to re-impose certain prohibitions should there be no alteration in conditions. </para>

                            <para>- lt was definitely moved. I am sorry to charge the Prime Minister with misrepresentation, but he certainly misrepresented my attitude. It is very evident that the speech of the Government Whip this afternoon has caused Government supporters to lose complete control of their tempers. The Prime Minister himself has never given a worse exhibition of loss of temper and loss of control in this chamber. The spectacle was painful. He claimed that this Government, by taking action under the power of proclamation, saved  Australia from insolvency; but the people of this country think differently. If the Government believes that, why this reluctance to face the electors? Why does it not ask for the re-endorsement of its policy ? </para>

                            <para>- I trust that the people, whom this Government considers should be grateful to them, will soon have an opportunity of expressing their gratitude. The sooner the election takes place, the better it will please honorable members on this side of the chamber. I believe in the imposition of prohibitions, within reason. Prohibitions have been a contributing factor in the falling off of imports, but not to any great extent. The main factor has been the reduced purchasing capacity of the community. If that were not so, the reduction of imports would have been attended by an increase of employment. The people would have manufactured goods which could be made here, and to which the Prime Minister referred, or they would have manufactured substitutes. They have done neither. We all know that, side by side with the falling off of imports there has been a terrible decline in employment. The correction of the trade balance has been brought about mainly by our relative poverty, and it would have taken place largely even without the use of this power of proclamation. </para>

                        <para>.- Will the Minister arrange for the inclusion in the bill of a definition of the term " not commercially produced or manufactured in Australia ". The decision in so important a matter should not be left to the favour of the Minister - I do not say that offensively. It would be well if the recommendations of the Tariff Board were published, so that the public would know what goods are considered to be commercially produced or manufactured in this country. We are now dealing with an amendment of the Customs Act, and the time seems opportune for this matter to be cleared up. Before the bill was introduced, the Government's proposals should have been referred to the various Chambers of Commerce in Australia, with a view to obtaining their advice as to alterations which would be advisable in the interests of trade generally. I know that it is useless to move an amendment unless the Minister is prepared to accept it. I hope that he will accede to my request. </para>

                    <para>The law provides that a tariff schedule shall be void unless ratified during the session of the Parliament in which it is laid on the table. In recent years, it lias been the practice to adjourn Parliament from time to time, so that it is possible for one session to extend over the whole life of a parliament. I want to ensure that a tariff schedule shall be dealt with by Parliament within a certain definite period after it has been tabled, and that if not so dealt with, it shall cease to have effect. We have to decide whether taxation is to be imposed without the consent of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- My advice is that it is in order. It is the only clause in the act which refers to the right of the payer of customs duties. In any case, if am wrong, the matter could be rectified later. Parliament should have the right to say whether a tariff schedule shall be permitted to operate for nearly three years  without parliamentary approval, and be ratified only a few months before a new parliament is elected. Customs taxation is the only taxation which is levied without the approval of Parliament. Neither laud tax nor income tax can be collected without parliamentary approval. In the United States of America, a tariff schedule is not operative until it has been approved by Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- In that case we could wait until the war wa* over. It is not reasonable that the business of the country should be held up by a tariff of 400 items, operating for two years during which the business community does not know whether or not they will be ratified. The proposal of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> is that, within three months of the schedule being put into operation, the Government should have the items discussed by Parliament, and decisions upon them made. What objection can there be to that? It is not a matter of flooding the country with imported goods, but of giving the public a fair deal. The only objection that the Minister seems to find to the amendment is that it is proposed to be inserted in the wrong place. If so, he might suggest for the benefit of the committee where it could be appropriately included. What objection can there be to the public being treated decently, and tariff imposts discussed and got out of the way? Although the present tariff has been in operation for practically two years, it still has to be dealt with in another place. The first schedule was brought down in November, .1929, and I shall not be surprised if a general election intervenes before the tariff is disposed of by both branches of the legislature. </para>

                            <para>- This amendment has been approved of unanimously by the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia at each of their annual conferences for several years past. The Brisbane chamber has, no doubt, been the most active in the matter, because Queensland has suffered more disability than the southern States owing to the absence of the provision contained in my amendment. The Minister also said that, if by any unfortunate circumstance - others might regard it as a happy circumstance - a change of government should take place, and a reduction were made in the tariff, importers in Queensland might suffer by this change. But all these points have been considered, and the one desire is to have the matter adjusted on an equitable basis. I hope that, even now, if the Minister is unwilling to accept my amendment, he will himself bring down an amendment to meet the repeated request of the chambers of commerce and the trading community throughout Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the amendment. The point that it raises has been discussed on numerous occasions. So far as my recollection serves me, each Minister for Trade and Customs, in turn, when waited on by deputations in Brisbane, has stated either that the Government intended to amend the Customs Act to enable this alteration to be made, or that he would at least give it sympathetic consideration. I think that that was the position in which the present Minister found himself when he was waited on in Brisbane a few weeks ago; but, despite the statements by various Ministers, no alteration has been made, and I am compelled to think that the officials of the department are opposed to any alteration. I can understand that, because in the past Parliament has dealt with every individual item in the tariff, and the average rate of duty to-day is much higher than it was, say, seven or eight, or even ten years ago. Each Minister for Trade and Customs, including the present Minister, has, as I have said, promised sympathetic consideration of this matter. </para>

                            <para>- But the present Minister,, by the tone of his voice, and by his facial expression, did more than that. Those attending the deputation in Brisbane went away convinced that he, at least, was on their side, and would use every  endeavour  to bring about the alteration provided for in the amendment now before the committee. I contend, therefore, that the. financial aspect has been the chief consideration in the past. The Customs Department, and each succeeding government in turn, has been loath to give up that proportion of  revenue  which would have been lost had the proposal embodied in this amendment been put into effect at any time within the last ten or twelve years. The position has altered to-day, however. I say, unhesitatingly, that the Australian tariff to-day is at its peak, and, if any alterations are made, they will be in the direction of reducing it. Consequently, neither the Government nor the department need fear any loss of revenue as a result of this amendment being accepted. There can be no argument whatever as to the justice ' of the proposal. Why should the people in the eastern States - not those in Brisbane alone, but in the other eastern cities, also - be penalized because a ship happens to call first at Fremantle? There are Borne ships - though not so many as in former years when the old B.I. vessels ito by way of Torres Straits? - which call first at Townsville and Brisbane, and then go on to Sydney, Melbourne and other ports. For a long time past, people have felt the injustice and inequality of the regulation as it is now framed, and now that financial considerations no longer enter into it so far as the revenue is concerned, there is no reason why the amendment should not be accepted. The Minister &lt; should consult with his colleagues in the Cabinet to see whether it is not possible, when the bill reaches another place, to have this amendment incorporated. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, as on cotton. The question whether a change should be made is, I admit, highly controversial, and the senior officers of the Customs Department, for whose judgment on technical matters I have the greatest respect, have been in favour of the retention of the present practice. After having given full consideration to the matter, however, I have come to the conclusion that this practice i» distinctly unfair to trading interests in the ports at which a ship may call after having first touched at Australia. I believe that, on the whole, the arrangement outlined in the amendment would be more equitable than the present one, and I therefore support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - In my reply, during the second-reading stage of the debate, I said that I could not accept this amendment, which had been foreshadowed, because its constitutionality was in doubt. It is true that one King's counsel has expressed the opinion that it would be constitutional, but others have said the opposite, and a royal commission which inquired into the matter stressed the administrative difficulties which would be raised if such a change were effected. There are some arguments in favour of the proposal; but, on the other hand, it would mean that, if duties were reduced after a ship had called at Fremantle, traders in the eastern ports would not obtain the benefit of it. Those who favour this proposal have asked that, instead of there being a uniform rate of duty all over Australia, duty shall . be payable at the rate applicable to the goods at the time they first arrive in Australia. Under such an arrangement it would be possible to have two ships discharging at the same time similar goods upon which two different rates of duty were payable. Such a situation would be fantastic, and I cannot accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the amendment. The Minister has said that its constitutionality is doubtful, but objections of that sort are. frequently raised by Ministers when they do not want to accept an amendment moved by a member of the Opposition. I do not know whether the amendment is constitutional, nor, apparently, does the Minister. The position, in any case, can be ascertained whether the amendment is passed or not. The Minister has stated that the demand for this change comes principally from Queensland. I remind him, however, that for years past the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce has advocated an amendment on the lines of that now before the committee. Tasmanian merchants have suffered from the present arrangement to a greater extent, probably, than those in other States. Ships coming from overseas discharge part of their cargo at Victorian ports, and then go on to Tasmania, perhaps only a day or two later, to discharge more of it. In the meantime, however, increased duties may have been imposed by this Parliament. The merchants in Tasmania are in direct competition with those in Victoria, because a great deal of trade is carried on between. Victorian merchants and the people of Tasmania, so that the Tasmanian merchants, who have to pay the higher rate of duty, are at a disadvantage as compared with their Victorian competitors. In some cases, the duty may be increased by as much as 50 per cent., or, as has happened within recent months, by as much as 200 per cent. Indeed, this matter affects Tasmania probably more than Queensland. Whether the change can be made constitutionally we cannot determine now, but the fairness and equity of the proposal must be obvious to every one. </para>

                        <para>.- The M inister stated that Queensland was most concerned in this matter, but that is not true. The Minister must know that ships bringing goods from America usually call first at Sydney, and afterwards go on to Melbourne, while ships from Great Britain call first at Fremantle. In the case of American goods, therefore, Sydney profits at the expense of Melbourne, while, in the case of English goods, Western Australia profits at the expense of the Eastern States. I know of an instance in which a firm, which is acting in Australia as agent for an American vacuum cleaner, actually unloaded a consignment of goods in Sydney at the lower rate, while Melbourne firms were compelled to pay the higher rate of duty which had been imposed after the goods were discharged at Sydney. That is not fair; there should be uniformity. Whether the proposed change would be constitutional seems to be a moot point, but the Minister has had ample time to learn the true position. </para>

                    <para>.- This is a machinery bill, and has apparently been introduced with the object of changing the method of imposing taxation on wine. I understand that, so far as a large part of the wine industry is concerned, there is no great objection to this, although there may be objection from other  quarters. At the present time, taxation is imposed only on the fortifying spirit contained in the wine. There is no excise tax on wine as wine. Under the proposed method it is intended to impose the excise tax on the wine itself as wine, at so much a gallon. There is something in the nature of a "pig in a poke" about this legislation. There is no indication as to the extent of the future taxation, and we shall not know what it is to be until an excise bill is brought down to impose it. The bill merely indicates that it will be applied in a way different from that which obtained in the past. It appears inevitable that, when this bill becomes law, taxation will be imposed on wine regardless of whether it is sweet or dry, although the same rate will not necessarily apply to each. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>At  present only sweet wine is taxed.  It may  be that some honorable members  are  curious to know why that is so, and what is the real distinction between dry and  sweet  wine for taxation purposes. I admit  that  probably no one in the House knows less than I about wine as a potable liquid, but I know a little more about the method of taxation of the different types of wine. When the grapes come in from the vineyard and are placed in vats at  the  winery, fermentation immediately begins. If that fermentation process is permitted to continue without interruption, the whole of the sugar content of the grapes is converted into alcohol, which results in a dry wine, containing between 20 and 2S per cent, alcohol. That dry wine is not taxed, as at present excise tax is levied only on fortifying spirit, none of which is introduced into dry wine. If the grapes are put into the vats at the winery and the process of fermentation is arrested at a certain point by the introduction of a quantity of fortifying spirit, the result is a sweet wine. The wine retains some of its original sweetness, because a portion of the grape sugar remains unconverted into alcohol. Sweet wine usually contains from 34 to 40 per cent, of alcohol. </para>
                <para>If the change contemplated by this bill is brought about, and excise tax is imposed on wine as wine, without taking into consideration the fortifying spirit that may be used in it, it appears to me that the taxation must apply to all wine at so much per gallon. If, despite the* legislation, it is the intention of the Government to confine taxation to sweet wines, wine-makers will take advantage of the opportunity, and mix the two classes, using a quantity of sweet "wine containing as high a percentage as possible of grape sugar and spirit. The practice would deprive the Customs Department of a considerable amount of revenue. </para>

                        <para>- There is not th*» same incentive to do it at present. Supposing that a wine-maker takes a wine, showing a very high sugar content, and a 40 per cent, alcoholic content, and mixes it with an equal quantity of dry win*1 with an alcoholic content of 28 per cent., on which there is no taxation, the result would be a blended sweet wine with an alcohol content of say, 34 per cent. Thai would considerably reduce the duty chargeable. For that reason, it seems to me that, if this system is followed of imposing taxation on wine as such, at so much per gallon rather than on the spirit, and dry wine remains tax free the Customs Department must inevitably lose a certain amount of revenue. </para>

                        <para>- There is not much incentive to do so now, because taxation is imposed only on the spirit content of the wine. It may be the practice to mix the two types of wine, but the profit to be gained thereby is nothing compared with what it would be if taxation were applied to sweet wines at so much per gallon, and dry wines left free of tax. There are relatively few persons making fortifying spirit.  It  is produced by tb»distilleries. On the other hand, there are a great many who make wine. I understand that very excellent wine is made by persons who own only a modes', plant and operate on a small scale. If the taxation is going to apply to all wine as such, rather than to the fortifying spirit content, the measure will need additional policing. I take it that that is  the reason why the Government proposes that the producer must be registered, and the wine-maker licensed. The registration of the grape-grower is to be free, but there is to be a nominal charge to license a wine-maker who has a small output, and a greater one for the man who is operating on a bigger scale. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> At present an excise tax must be paid on sweet wine that is to be exported. When the export occurs, a drawback of that tax is obtained, and a bounty is paid on the wine exported. There are really three operations. Under the proposed scheme no tax will be paid on the wine exported, so that there will bc no drawback. In that way the new system will effect a simplification. Clause 24 reads - </para>

                <para class="block">That is a very great power to give to the Minister. I do not suggest that it will be unwisely used. Nevertheless, if some future Minister were to use that power drastically, and cancel the licence of a wine-maker who employed a great number of men, because his manager or&gt; some other employee had committed a technical breach of the law, the result would be very serious, indeed. I imagine that there must be a certain amount of apprehension among wine-makers as to what might result from the bestowing of primitive power upon the. Minister. Some of that apprehension might be removed if the Minister would assure the House that the powers conferred in this clause to cancel licences will be used with discretion and moderation. Will there be any right of appeal against the delicensing of a wine-maker, or will the Minister's decision be final? I assume that the delicensed person will have recourse at law against the decision of the Minister. </para>

                <para class="block">I 'could understand this proposal if the Government intended to tax at a flat rate per gallon only the heavier wines and exempt light wines. There would then be an  incentive  to blending, and it would be exceedingly difficult to prevent such a practice. But if the Government intends to impose the same taxation on all wines, whether dry or sweet, fortified or unfortified, there is little need for the clause. If taxation were imposed on a scientific basis, rising gradually with the increase in the strength of the wine, little relief from tax would be gained by blending, or if blending took place, little or no loss of revenue would result. </para>

                    <para>.- I. am pleased that this bill was circulated in sufficient time to give honorable members an opportunity to consider it; and not, as happened last night with the Wheat Charges Bill, only a few minutes before it was to be passed through all stages. Another gratifying feature is that the machinery provisions are set forth in such plain language as to be understandable by any person of ordinary education and intelligence. This is mainly a machinery measure for the levying of excise on wine instead of, as previously, merely on the fortified spirit contained in wine. The Minister has been, in full consultation with the Viticultural Council which now represents, I believe, all the big winemakers. They have had an opportunity to consider all aspects of it. For that reason there is no particular call upon me to speak on behalf of the wine-makers, especially as several distinguished representatives of the industry are in the galleries at this moment. But has the Minister taken pains to ascertain the views of the growers? When the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> asked that question, the Minister did not answer it, beyond saying that ho had received no protests from the growers. Will he inform the House what growers or associations of growers have been consulted in regard to the bill? </para>

                        <para>- The Minister is skilfully evading my question and is trying to throw the responsibility on Messrs. Gunn and Gollan. The bill is supposed to make easier the policing of the excise law in relation to the manufacture of wine. I question whether it will do so, but I do not pit my limited knowledge against, that of experienced officers. There .is no doubt, however, that the field to be supervised is being extended. Formerly the excise officers had to deal with the manufacturers of fortified spirit; now their supervision will apply to all makers of wine. The sphere of their duties is  being  widened', and the number of men who may be inclined to adopt doubtful practices will be proportionately greater. This legislation will ease the position of wine-makers; they will have greater freedom in their industry, and will not require to send frequently for the excise officers to release this thing and that thing from bond. Requests for drawbacks also will be obviated ; but any increase of convenience to the department and the wine-makers will be at the expense of the growers. The Minister's statement that no protests have been received from the growers is an indirect admission that he has not actually consulted them. Those in my district are of opinion that the heavy excise duty on fortifying spirit, and the' resultant increase in the price of wine limited consumption, and to that extent was detrimental to their interest. "Whilst the method of collecting excise does receive some consideration from them, they are more concerned with the amount of excise. We do not know yet what the rates will be. Messrs. Gunn and Gollan suggested an excise duty of 2s. a gallon. </para>

                        <para>- I thank those honorable members who voted against the application of the gag. Unfortunately, the grape-growers of Australia have too few representatives in this House, and 1 want honorable members to be in attendance, so that they may fully understand the position of the industry. For that reason I called for a quorum. The bill provides that a fine of £20 shall be imposed upon any person who, without being registered, sells, grapes for making wine. I protest .against this penalty. The Minister, when moving the second reading of the bill, said that gold producers who benefit under the Gold Bounty Aci are called upon to register. The argument that he used in favour of registering grape-growers was that the winemakers are receiving an export bounty from which the grape. growers benefit. It is true that the gold producer has to register if he desires to participate in the bounty, but there is no penalty if <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> does not register. The linseed and  flax  growers also receive bounties under certain conditions, but there is no necessity for them to register: Of course, I should not expect the. Minister to agree that the cotton-growers of Queensland should be registered. They are able to obtain all  the benefits of the bounty without being obliged to register. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but there is no penalty if they fail to register. The Minister has said that it is usual for the sugar-grower3 to register their names. I might be taken to task by the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> if I said that there was a bounty paid on sugar, but there is in existence a sugar embargo which has all the benefits of a generous bounty. I have searched the Queensland acts, and I cannot find that the sugar-grower is compelled to register. I am open to correction on that point. In any case, if registration is necessary on the part of the sugar-grower, there is no penalty for failure to register. The Minister's best argument is in regard to the tobacco-growers. Under the Excise Act, it is necessary for tobacco-growers to register, and there is a penalty for failure to do so, but I still contend that a penalty of £20 for failure to register on the part of both the tobacco-growers and the grape-growers is unjust. Any lightening of the burden of the winemaker and the excise officer will be at the expense of the grape-grower. </para>

                <para>I find no provision in the bill relating to dealers who purchase grapes for wine-making. For several years, dealers in South Australia have travelled through Adelaide and its suburbs purchasing grapes grown in backyards, and selling them for spirit and wine-making purposes. This year it seems there will be plenty of grapes in South Australia to meet the demand, and it will not be profitable for dealers to purchase grapes in- the suburbs, but the position may be different in the future. I admit that it is better to sell the grapes grown in backyards in that way than to leave them on the vines to ferment and become a nuisance. Honorable members may not realize how prolific grape vines are in South Australia. I trust that  in  the interests of the grape-growers it will again be necessary for the dealers to purchase grapes in and around the city  of  Adelaide, and that better times are in store for the industry, particularly under the Canadian Trade Agreement, which will permit the entry of our wines into Canada. I also hope that the British preference will be retained. If the exchange remains as it  is  at present, we shall have a decided advantage over South Africa. I am looking forward to an extension of our trade in sweet wines on the other side of the world. This bill should contain a provision enabling dealers to purchase grapes grown in and around the suburbs of Adelaide and elsewhere for wine-making purposes. Are these dealers, if they purchase grapes without being registered, to be liable to a penalty of £20? I think that the Minister should give consideration to that question. It would be ridiculous to impose  a  penalty of £20 upon. me just because I have four or five vines in my backyard and sell the grapes to a dealer who sells them for wine-making purposes. It would be equally foolish to contend that I should be registered before I could make such a sale. A dealer,  of  course, could be registered or licensed. The Minister has ,said that it does not cost the grape-grower anything for registration. That is quite true, but he fails to realize that unless the return which must be supplied by the growers is simple - and I fear the red tape of Government departments - many of them will be put to the expense of paying 10s. 6d. or £1 ls. for the compilation of the return. In South Australia many grape-growers, especially those of the older generation, are conversant more with the German than with the English language. They have been brought up in Lutheran schools in which the German language was largely taught. If the return is complicated, they will be forced to incur additional expenditure. They have already been hit hard enough, and I contend that they should not be asked to suffer <inline font-style="italic">any</inline> further burden. I, therefore, urge the Minister aud his officers to make this return as simple as possible. </para>

As this bill deals entirely with grapes grown for the production of wine, I should like to know whether a grower who sells grapes to a winery one year, and the following year sells them as currants, will have to deregister each time that he passes from a grape-grower for wine-making purposes to a grape-grower for the purpose of producing currants.

                <para>Since it is evident that the Government intends that the growers of grapes shall be registered, any protest which I might make would be unavailing. If the growers of grapes for wine-making purposes are to be registered, I hope that, if constitutionally possible, new growers will be prevented from entering the industry until the demand overtakes the supply. In the report of the Minister's speech, as recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> I am credited with having interjected, "I hope that the object is not to prevent new growers from entering the industry". The word " not " should not be there. I said " I hope that the object is to prevent growers from entering the industry ". Unless the recent frost in South Australia has been particularly severe, there is every likelihood that large quantities of grapes will be left on the vines in the coming grape season. Unfortunately, that condition of things may continue for some years. There is room for a difference of opinion on this matter; but I am inclined to think that only gradually will conditions improve. Since 1924 I have done my best to discourage the planting of further areas with grapes for wine-making. </para>

On one occasion, when a deputation of grape-growers waited on me, I had to defend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gollan</inline> from an attack by a big wine-maker, who said that he was standing in the way of the growers. I have found the senior inspector to be wise and tactful in dealing with the difficult problems which he has had to face; he has not favoured either the growers or the makers of wine. Naturally, he considers the interests of the department of which he is an officer, and does what he can to protect the revenue of the country. I intend to move for a reduction of the heavy penalty on those who grow grapes for wine-making without being registered, but I do not wish it to be thought that in so doing I am out to encourage sly grog-selling. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> for making the position clear. I have already said that the report of Messrs. Gollan and Gunn contains much valuable information, but I wish to make it clear that I do not agree with their recommendation to reduce the wine bounty to. 1s. 3d. a gallon. Already it is only about 1s. 4d., and probably the Minister will be satisfied with that. I hope that he will not further reduce the bounty. I have always found the senior inspector optimistic in regard to the prospects of the wine industry, but I hope that the Government will not go back on its original intention to grant sufficient bounty to enable the glut of wine to be sold.

                    <para>There can be no doubt that the position from Australia's point of view in regard to increased shipments has been very substantially assisted by the rates of exchange ruling. Competition from South Africa has been growing in intensity and the decreased purchasing power of the English community at the same time was creating a position that would have been extremely difficult indeed for Australian wine exporters. The present rate of exchange permits the English merchant to purchase Australian currency wherewith to pay the minimum fixed price, and the board is of opinion that it would be a mistake to endeavour to raise the price to the English importer at this moment, or to insist upon his rebating some of the exchange. Such an action would be tantamount to throwing away a unique opportunity for clearing the great accumulation of stocks in Australia, and emptying our over-stocked cellars. </para>

                    <para>The British merchant has also taken advantage of the rate of exchange, prices in London having been reduced to the extent of the exchange premium. After a complete examination of the position it is considered that a reduction in the rate of bounty is justifiable. If the rate were reduced to1s. 3d. per gallon, it is not anticipated that the export trade would be seriously prejudiced. </para>

                <para class="block">I hope that the Minister will not be influenced unduly by the optimism of his senior inspector regarding the future of the wine trade. It must be realized that once South Africa's disadvantage owing to the exchange rate is removed, the competition of the wine trade of that country will be serious for Australia. If,  as suggested, there were a common currency standard for the whole British Empire, South Africa, with its cheap coloured labour and its proximity to the British market would prove a formidable competitor with Australia in 'the export of wine. Some of our big wine-makers who have a home market are very little concerned about the export trade. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that Messrs. Gunn and Gollan conferred with the growers in the various States, as the members of the Select Committee on the Tobacco Industry conferred with the tobacco-growers, and that they took evidence from all angles, in order to get the views of the growers, the manufacturers and the consumers. The honorable member failed to give a single reason why the growers should not be registered. Clause 7 of the bill provides that no person shall produce grapes for use in the manufacture of wine unless he is registered. That does not mean that a person who has a. few vines at his back door must register. The registration of the growers of grapes intended for use in the manufacture of wine would be helpful to the statisticians and for record purposes. Owing to the registration of tobacco-growers, I was recently able to ascertain from the Customs Department, by return post, the names and number of tobacco-growers throughout Australia. The registration of grape-growers will cost them nothing, aud the information obtained will be useful in considering any need for limitation of the acreage under crop. It costs a gold producer nothing to register his name, but if a man is not registered he cannot participate in the gold bounty. A tobacco-grower, even though he may not manufacture tobacco, is subject to a penalty for non-registration. There is more to be said in favour of compulsory registration than against it. </para>

                <para>I was delighted with the homily of the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> regarding the manufacture of wine. If he had been accustomed to sampling the finished product, he might have spoken of sparkling wines, and of "beading bubbles winking at the brim". He said that at the present time there was little incentive for the blending of wines, but I claim that there is much incentive in that direction, because the excise duty is on the fortified spirit content of wine. The practice has grown of late years for some to blend dry wine with sweet wine, and sell the product as sweet wine, in order to evade the excise duty. If a flat rate of excise duty were imposed on all wine, there would be no inducement to blend in that way. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Angas complained of the penalties contained in. the bill, but I do not consider them to be too high. Heavy penalties act as a deterrent to those who may be disposed to transgress the law. ' If the penalties were nominal, excise officers would probably have to deal with many complaints. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> I remind the honorable member for Angas that some of the grape-growers are also winemakers. If he had his way, the grower who is also a wine-maker would have to bo licensed as a winemaker, but he would not have to register as a grower of grapes for use in the manufacture of wine, and that would create an anomaly. There is in my electorate a vine-growers' association, which is represented on the Victorian Viticultural Council, and I received advice only to-day that two delegates from the association were attending a meeting of the council in Melbourne. It is clear, therefore, that the growers had a say in these matters. The growers in my area are not prone to indulge in destructive criticism.  They are appreciative of the efforts of this Government on their behalf, and recognize what it has achieved for the wine industry. Some time ago, the Minister for Trade and Customs accompanied me to Rutherglen, so that he might obtain a first-hand knowledge of the problems confronting the wine industry. It became evident to him that many of those engaged in it were in a desperate plight. The previous Government had) reduced the export bounty on wine from ls. 9d. to ls. 3d. a gallon, and it did not then pay the wine-makers to export. Their cellars were full of wine, and they could not buy any more grapes from the growers. Many hundreds of returned soldiers, who had been encouraged to go on the land to grow grapes, were faced with the prospect of seeing their crops rotting on the vines. The Minister immediately restored the bounty of ls. 9d. a gallon, with the result that the wine-makers cleared their cellars, and were able to buy the grapes which the growers had to offer. The Government is deserving of credit for that. To-day I received a communication from the Vine-growers Association at Rutherglen, extending a cordial invitation to the Minister for Markets to visit them, so that they might express their appreciation to him for his work in bringing about the trade agreement between Australia and Canada. I hope that the Minister will be able to accept the invitation, and, if he does, I am sure the vine-growers will welcome him warmly. I am convinced that this measure will simplify the working of the Excise Act, and will safeguard the revenue. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the measure before the House. This bill, I understand, contains only the machinery clauses for the collection of excise duty on wine. The important measure - that fixing the rate's - has not yet been brought down. I am interested in this matter, because there are many vine-growers in my electorate. They have never approached me, and I have never come into contact with any of them. When it was suggested that they should get into touch with me, they said, "All he thinks about is coal; he is not interested in wine." I assure honorable members, however, that any industry in Australia paying a decent living wage to its employees, and certainly those in my electorate, will receive my support, whether those controlling it are supporters of mine or not. At any rate, they probably employ people who are supporters of raine, and that is the important consideration so far as I am concerned. In my electorate, between 150,000 and 200,000 gallons of light, dry wine are produced each year. So far, this wine has not been subject to excise duty, because no fortifying spirit is used in its manufacture. It shows the quality of the goods they produce in that district  when  no fortifying spirit is needed. Our wines contain only the pure grape juice. Some of the wine is sent to other places, and used for blending in the preparation of other wines. I ask the Minister to exempt these light wines from excise duty. Many of the wine-makers have suffered severely as a result of the depression, and some of the firms are in the hands of receivers. In the report presented by Messrs. Gunn and Gollan, particular reference is made to light wines, and a plea is made for special consideration by the Government. At page 60 of the report it is stated - </para>

                    <para>It is considered desirable that dry wines should be exempt from excise duty. It may, however, be necessary to impose a nominal duty for purposes of control over all wines. The" consumption of dry wines is not very extensive. They are the natural product of the grape, and it has been urged that the use of light dry wines should be encouraged in preference to other forms of alcoholic  beverage,  There are certain grape-growing areas which produce these wines under heavy disabilities, and an excise duty on a class of wim: which has never previously been taxed would still further handicap their production. </para>

                <para class="block">Chablis,  and other dry wines, arc manufactured in the Hunter Valley, and arc sold at ls. 6d. a bottle, as compared with similar wines sold elsewhere at 4s. 6d. a bottle. I understand that the Minister proposes to apply a flat rate of duty on all wines, but I urge him to exempt light, dry wines of less than 23 per cent, of alcoholic content. If the same rate of duty is imposed on dry wines from the Hunter Valley as on sweet wines, the industry in that district will be ruined. I recognize that it is necessary to provide legislative machinery for the control of the wine industry. In this way some check can be kept on the operations of illicit wine-makers, who are placing their product on the market in the cities. It is difficult to know whether some of the stuff so made is wine or dynamite. Judging by the effect it produces on some people, one would imagine it to be 100 per cent, over proof. I urge the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to my request. </para>

                    <para>. - I admit, candidly, that I know nothing about the growing of grapes or the making of wine, but I do know a good deal about the drinking of it. I have drunk a considerable quantity of Australian wine - of course, under doctor's orders - a fact which is no doubt responsible for my magnificent physical condition. In other words, I am fully matured, as is the Australian wine I drink. I wish particularly to refer to the marketing of Australian wine in Great Britain. I have made about eighteen or twenty trips to Great Britain, the last about two years ago. I have found that it is not possible to obtain Australian wines on any of the trains running between Southampton and London, nor, for that matter, on the trains running north from London to Hull, Edinburgh and Inverness. Apart from such places as The Trocadero, and one or two others probably known to the Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney),</inline> it is impossible to get Australian wines in any of the hotels in London. It cannot be obtained at The Savoy, The Ritz or The Cecil. I made inquiries, beginning at Australia House,, to find out the reason for this. The head waiters - on the trains and in tha hotels all told me the same thing. They seemed to know the word "Australian", but they knew little or nothing about the country or its products. When I pressed one of them, he told me that it was possible to obtain Australian wine&gt; perhaps in April and May, but not in June, July and August. It generally became available about Christmas time-. Continuity of supply is essential if Australian wines are to capture a place for themselves on the English market. I admit that, at the time of which I speak, there was some shipping trouble in Australia, which may have prevented sup plies from coming forward, but it remains true that Australian wines do not reach England with sufficient regularity to keep the market supplied. I do not know whether the Minister for Markets went into this matter when he was abroad, but it is deserving of his attention. Our wines can hold their own with those of any other country in the world. The American wines most sold in England come from California, the " Big Tree " brand of sparkling hock being the most popular. Of that I have drunk a good quantity, but I do not think that either it or their Burgundy is a patch on ours. I went into the subject, and made a report to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> who was then Prime Minister. To make a success of this, or of any other industry, we must put our best young Australians on the job, with a salary of about £1,000 a year plus a commission on the gross turnover. The salary would allow them to dress and look well, take people to dinner, to the theatre, and to the pictures, while the commission would be an incentive for them to go their hardest and sell our goods. I admit that the Export Board at Australia House is doing very good work, but it is not all that T desire. You cannot get a body of men sitting around a table in a room at Australia House a few times a week to deal adequately with such an important subject as our export trade. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> referred to the power that is being given to the Minister to cancel licences. It is similar to that provided in the excise and the beer excise acts, a power that has never been abused, arid is not likely to be abused under this measure. The honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> raised the subject of the registration of growers. A grape-grower has to register only when he produces grapes for  use  in  the  manufacture of wine. If he produces currants that are to bc used as dried fruits, he must register under the Dried Fruits Act, but he has not to deregister simply because he grows grapes that are used in the manufacture of wine. He pays no fee to register, but has only to fill in a simple form stating bow many tons he has sold and to whom rho sale was made. Four-fifths of the money raised under the proposed flat rate will go into the trust fund, as was the case with the excise duty on fortifying spirit. As to conferring with the growers, the senior inspector of excise is constantly in touch with them in South Australia and other States. I have received deputations from growers in the Great "Western and Rutherglen districts, and from the Hunter Valley, and the views that they expressed wore taken into consideration by the Government when framing this measure. </para>

As grapes are down to about £7 a ton, it is highly improbable that we shall have any trouble of that nature in our time. </para>

                    <para>.- The information that has been given by the Minister is not correct. To my knowledge the dealers went round buying grapes for several years. Perhaps the grape-growing section of my electorate might not appreciate my bringing up this matter, but I have also to conserve the  interests of  the metropolitan district. However, if the Minister gives me no hope in the matter I shall hot persist. </para>

                    <para>.- The imposition of an excise duty on wine is a new departure. So far as I am aware uo such duty is imposed in any other wine-producing country. I suppose all countries collect excise duty on beer and spirits, and there must be some very general reason for the exemption of wine. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and also, I think, on must; but  I  am referring to wine-producing countries. We have not yet seen the Wine Excise Duty Bill, but obviously it will impose a duty on wine, as such, instead of, as in the past, spirit used for fortifying wine.  If  the duty applies to all wine, the unfortified dry varieties, which are not so highly alcoholic as the fortified sweet wines, will be for the first time taxed, and the tendency will be to increase the price of them in relation to the price of the heavier brands, I would welcome any measure to increase the proportionate consumption of the lighter wines. It is questionable whether we are not taking a step in the wrong direction, having regard, not only to the ultimate interests of the wine industry, which I regard as secondary, but also to the interests of the people as a whole. Whether the effect will be what I fear, will depend on the scale of the duties, but any tax that would increase the price of the lighter wines and reduce the consumption of them against the stronger wines would be inadvisable. This clause merely applies all the general provisions of the Excise Act to wine; this obviously must increase the general expense of conducting the industry, but if an excise duty is to be imposed on wine, as distinct from fortifying spirit, some such provision is obviously necessary. </para>

                    <para>. -  I cannot see the reason for this clause. It states that a producer may be severally registered in respect of any number of separate and distinct premises. When a grower is registered he is under the control and eye of the department. If he has several vineyards why is it necessary for him to be registered severally in respect of each ? I shall not attempt to move an amendment to this clause because, judging by the last vote, the growers have little to expect from this Parliament. I fail to see why they should be put to the trouble of filling in a return for each vineyard that they own. </para>

One grower has written to me to the effect that this Government is anxious to put the grape-growers in the position of Russian serfs. That statement seems  to have some truth in it. I admit that a certain amount of Government supervision is necessary, but this provision goes too far. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister said in his reply that practically all that the grower had to show in the return to be furnished to the department was the quantity of grapes grown, to whom sold and, I presume, the price. I do not wish this return to take the form of a baby income tax return. I ask the Minister to say straight out whether the grower has to furnish a balance-sheet in regard to the conduct of his business. Does the department wish to ascertain the cost of the production of grapes so as to be able to fix the price? </para>

                    <para>.- The clause states that licences may be cancelled by the Minister by notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> if the licensee is convicted of any offence against this act or any other act relating to excise. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> seemed to think that this power might be exercised by the Minister at his own discretion. I do not know whether that will be the position. It seems to me that the cancellation of a licence would depend upon a conviction. The penalty is not too harsh, because under this legislation the department is placing a tremendous trust in the wine-makers. I believe that most of the wine-makers will respond, especially the bigger wine-makers who have too much at stake to risk the cancellation of their licences. This legislation, in spite of the Minister's statement to the contrary, will make it harder for the department to police the industry. </para>

                    <para>.- Is it proposed to require a small winemaker to provide elaborate office accommodation for the supervising officer ? The clause states that every holder of a licence shall, if required by the collector, provide reasonable office accommodation for the supervising officer. The premises of many wine-makers are small, and it would be unreasonable to expect them to provide elaborate office accommodation. I ask the Minister to give the committee some information respecting this clause. </para>

                    <para>.- It is evident that the department will not be able to police this provision, but that does not concern me. I am not interested in the fight of the small dry wine-makers  who fear that the bigger wine-makers are taking advantage of  them. One of the last things that I want to see in this country is a wine monopoly like the existing whisky monopoly. Some years ago I expressed the view that one big wine-maker was doing his best to bring about a wine monopoly. At the time my statement was ridiculed by some of the growers of grapes; but they are now convinced that I was right. I hope that the Minister will take action to  prevent  monopolies. This clause plainly shows that there will be a differentiation between the rates for various classes of wine. I suggest that the Minister will be acting in the best interests of the country if he follows the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gollan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn</inline> on this matter. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall not delay the House by making any lengthy observations on this bill. No honorable member in this chamber is more opposed to repudiation, or to compulsion, that I am; but, after all, the interests of the country are paramount. We have to consider  the  proposals in this measure from the point of view of justice to all classes  in  the community. The conversion loan was a magnificent success; 97 per cent, of our internal indebtedness has been voluntarily converted, leaving only 3 per cent., representing about £16,000,000, to be dealt with. In this legislation the Government proposes that the holders of that amount of stock or bonds shall be deemed to have converted their holdings. Considering the matter from every stand-point, I can see no alternative to the Government's proposals, notwithstanding that they involve a measure of repudiation, which is, however, I think, merely a technical repudiation. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> Although the conversion loan was dealt with on a voluntary basis, there was a general feeling that, in their own interest, as well as in that of the country, bondholders should convert their holdings. Throughout the campaign it was frequently stated that those who did not convert could not expect to be treated more generously than those who did convert. I listened with interest to the various proposals to deal with the amount unconverted, but I have not heard a practicable scheme propounded. The statements of persons who are in a position to know the facts make it clear that the country cannot pay the amount outstanding, though it has been suggested that money should be obtained from various sources to pay the dissentients. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that there is a considerable amount of inflation going on at the present time. In the interests of the people as a whole, I have set my face against inflation; I shall not, therefore, be a party to inflating the currency for the purpose of paying off those who have not converted their "holdings. The further suggestion has been made that a loan should be raised to pay off those who have dissented. In my opinion, that is . not a practicable suggestion, for I do not think that the people of this country would be willing to subscribe to a loan for that purpose. We have also to consider the effect of such a proposal on the interests of those who have already converted. I blame, to some extent, those who conducted the conversion loan campaign for the fact that even £16,000,000 remains unconverted. At one stage the committee in charge of the appeal announced that advices had been received from various sources which ensured the success of the loan. The effect of that premature announcement was that some stock-brokers who were watching the position carefully advised their clients to dissent. It is probable that had the committee not made that announcement, a further £15,000,000 might have been converted. In these circumstances, I cannot see how we can  allow the dissentients to be treated more generously than those who converted, especially when we reflect on the hardship which conversion means in many cases. I submit that our first consideration should be to meet, so far as possible, the needs of those who otherwise would suffer by reason of their patriotic action iu converting their holdings. My concern is chiefly for the small bondholders. I think it is clear from the statement of the Treasurer that the Government desires to do something to assist them. I make no complaint regarding the proposed treatment of foreign companies which temporarily put money into Commonwealth loans. They did so in accordance with an arrangement with the Government and the Loan Council. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>From the inception of the campaign the conversion loan was regarded as a loan of sacrifice. Bondholders were asked voluntarily to accept a reduction of interest. If the proposals contained in this measure amount to a technical repudiation of our obligations to those who dissented, what shall we say of its effect on those who converted ? In justice to the 97 per cent, who agreed to accept the sacrifice demanded of them, I cannot see how we. can allow the other 3 per cent, to escape sacrifice. It was not a sacrifice on the part of 97 per cent, of the bondholders for the benefit' of the 3 per cent, who dissented. Nor can I see how it would be possible to pay them, other than by inflating the currency or raising a loan. In my opinion, the country cannot do more than this bill proposes to do. I admit that the position is unsatisfactory; but are not things in general unsatisfactory? We have been forced into a position from which we cannot escape. I desire to quote from the <inline font-style="italic">British Financial Times,</inline> which is probably the greatest authority in the world on finance. </para>

                        PARKHILL.When the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales closed its doors, the Commonwealth Bank had advanced* to it £1,229,183, which it had paid out to meet necessitous cases while negotiations were proceeding as to -whether the bank should be taken over by the Commonwealth Bank or re-opened. I desire the House to remember that on that sum the Commonwealth Bank is charging the New South Wales savings bank 5 per cent, interest, which amounts to about £60,000 per annum, and that liability is a first call upon the savings bank's assets. Before it can do anything to assist needy depositors, who -are suffering most harrowing privations, it must pay the interest on
                        <inline font-style="italic">the</inline>
                        amount advanced by the Commonwealth Bank. It has been said that the State Savings Bank has not had any dealings with the Commonwealth Bank, but its credits with the Commonwealth Bank in its various accounts amount to just over £1,000,000, and it is not permitted to use that credit as a set-off against the
                        <inline font-style="italic">£1,000,000</inline>
                        that it owes to the Commonwealth Bank. In those circumstances, I venture the opinion that there is a considerable volume of public  opinion  in New South Wales that the Government Savings Bank is being unfairly treated, and that it has a transcendent claim on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of its needy depositors to the redemption of the £1,000,000 worth of Commonwealth stock which it does not desire to convert. That amount would go a great way towards setting the bank on its feet again,  and assisting the depositors, "who have  £00,000,000  locked up in the State Savings Bank, by giving them access to a portion of their capital. The release of that money would make a tremendous difference were it in circulation in New South Wales. It is surprising to me that the people of that State have been able to carry on in these circumstances. E have no desire to go near the State Savings Bank so long as it remains closed, because there one hears the harrowing statements of women and others who are suffering acutely because they are deprived of their money. These people expected never to be hard up, "but, owing to their money being locked up, they are unable to obtain a penny to meet their ordinary expenses. I urge the Government to endeavour to make available to the bank  £1,000,000  in regard to the conversion, in order to relieve the position of these depositors. If that were done it would dissipate the feeling, which is fairly general in New South Wales to-day, that the Commonwealth Bank has been strangely indifferent to the sufferings of hundreds of thousands of persons who are not only depositors in the State Savings Bank, but also citizens of the Commonwealth. The feeling  i3  fairly general that the Commonwealth Government is more concerned in obtaining control of the State Savings Bank than in assisting it to carry on its operations. I am not at the moment arguing the question whether the bank should be taken over by the Commonwealth Bank, or whether it should be rehabilitated. I simply make an appeal to the Treasurer to endeavour to make available to the depositors who are in need, the  £1,000,000  which has not been converted to the Commonwealth loan.

                        <para>. -It is gratifying to know that success has been achieved in the conversion of a stupendous loan, the like of which has not been known in the whole world. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> has insinuated that the Government which I support is, to some extent, responsible for the financial position in New South Wales, owing to the closing of the Government Savings Bank in that State. I congratulate the Government on the success of the conversion loan, and I think that it would have been recreant to its duty if it had not brought down a measure such as that now before the House, for the purpose of securing equality of sacrifice, and dealing with those bondholders who have declined voluntarily to convert their stock. In my electorate there are a number of small bondholders who will suffer great hardship under this bill; but I feel certain that the Government will show them all possible consideration. The Government, is in no way responsible for the attitude assumed by the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. The control of that institution has been handed over to a set of septuagenarian satellites of vested interests who are able to prevent the policy of the Labour party in regard to banking reform from being put into operation. Those men were appointed by a gentleman who is supposed to be a statesman. He has one leg in the Premiers' plan and the other leg in the Lang plan. With the leg in the Premiers' plan he has kicked usurers and the rack-renters, and has done good for the workers, and with the other leg he has kicked the workers, and reduced the basic wage, without submitting the matter to arbitration, and has kicked over the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. The honorable member for Warringah will be pleased to know that on Monday next a new publication, to be known as <inline font-style="italic">The World,</inline> will be launched by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes.</inline> If it had been published two years ago, we should not have been called upon to pass legislation of the nature of this bill. </para>

                            <para>- The Government is prevented from carrying out its financial policy. That unscrupulous publication, the Lang <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily</inline> has done considerable damage to the nation. By persistent praise of Lang it has placed that gentleman under the spell of a megalomaniacal obsession, an obsession tinged with anglophobia and chicanery. This journal has, in its political columns a kind of picture gallery, and it publishes portrait's of the breakaways in the Beasley group. It boycotts members of our party who are loyal to the Government they were elected to support, and makes heroes of those who harass and embarrass the Labour Government. There was. a time when the honorable member for Werriwa was a useful supporter of the Government, and, had he and others assisted the Government to carry out its policy, legislation such as that now before us would not have been necessary. The honorable member for Werriwa was once regarded as a useful member of this House ; now he has become an absolute pest to us. He has developed into a sort of supercilious nabob, who delights in preventing the Government from carrying out its policy. When this new newspaper is published, it will not heap laudation on the leaders in this House, or of any other house. The success of the conversion loan marks a new epoch in the history of financial affairs. No other country can claim such a wonderful achievement. When this Parliament agreed to legislation to reduce the wages of the workers, and to cut down social services, it was understood that stops would be taken to reduce the nation's interest burden. By means of the loan conversion, that has been done. I trust that the Government will do its best to relieve cases of hardship among small bondholders. Those with big holdings must be prepared to make sacrifices in common with other sections of the community. This measure, when carried, will relieve the financial situation, and help us to meet our obligations. I suppose I should scarcely be in order, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> if I said that <inline font-style="italic">The World</inline> was going to be published on Monday next, just three days and five hours from now. With the advent of that newspaper, the Government will have a powerful ally in carrying out its policy. </para>

                    <para>This bill is consequential to the measure we have just been considering. It gives authority to the Commonwealth Government to provide for the statutory conversion of the internal portion of the public debt. As I propose to insert in committee an amendment to enable cases of hardship arising out of compulsory conversion to be met by the use of sinking funds, I take this opportunity briefly to refer to the resources of the sinking fund. The  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> touched on this matter, and made certain suggestions as to how sinking fund moneys might be applied to the retirement, redemption, or purchase of securities held by persons suffering hardship through having to convert, or through having the maturity dates deferred for a longer period than they originally contracted for. When the matter was first considered by the Loan Council, and subsequently by myself as Treasurer, it was thought that about £1,250,000 could be made available from the sinking fund for such purposes during this financial year; but after discussion with other members of the National Debt Commission, at a meeting which took place last week in Canberra, and a careful examination of the funds which were accruing, we decided that the amount could be increased. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline></para>
                    <para>I shall now give particulars of the resources of the sinking fund for the current year. Balances carried forward for 1930-31 amount to £519,000, while the estimated contributions for 1931-32 are £7,036,000, making the total amount expected to be available, £7,555,000. The amount actually used for the redemption of State loans in July, 1931, was £370,000. Certain commitments have to be met with regard to loans, some raised by the States, and some by the Commonwealth - totalling £1,466,000- in London and New York. The sum of £2,219,000 has to be found to meet commitments in Australia, including securities representing investments of trade moneys, which have been dealt with under the original conversion act, and the moneys required for cashing the securities paid over in connexion with probate duties. This brings the total commitments up to £4,055,000. Two million pounds have been allotted by the National Debt Commission for the relief of cases of hardship among bondholders, leaving £1,500,000, which is regarded by the Commission as required for accruing obligations, other than those already mentioned, that must be met before the 30th June, 1932. I am not able to give full particulars in respect of this amount, but it might be informative to honorable members if I indicated the nature of some of the commitments. The National Debt Commission believes it to be necessary to have some funds available for the support of the market month by month in Australia, and £100,000 a month has been tentatively allotted for that purpose. Moreover, it is asserted that it may be necessary, in conjunction with the Commonwealth Bank, to use a portion of the sinking fund moneys for the purpose of meeting maturities held by the Savings Banks of Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales. All these banks hold matured securities which have not yet been met, and are pressing for some arrangement regarding them. The matter is under negotiation between the Commonwealth Treasury and the Commonwealth Bank, and it is probable that a call may be made on the National Debt Commission to make funds available for this purpose. This touches on the point raised by the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> regarding £1,000,000 worth of securities held by the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, which matured on the10th August. In my opinion, it would be unwise and unjustifiable for either the National Debt Commission, the Commonwealth Treasury, or the Commonwealth Bank to discriminate between the various State savings banks in any allotment of moneys to meet matured securities. Honorable members will see that the commission has allotted just about the maximum available for the relief of cases of hard ship. If it is found that more than £2,000,000 can be allotted from accrued sinking funds this year, then a greater allocation will be made, but how much more will be available cannot be stated yet. </para>

                        <para>.- This is the provision against which many honorable members have protested, but upon which they had not the courage to register a vote. In effect, the clause informs dissentient bondholders that their " no " means "yes". In common with other honorable members, I have received a number of communications on the subject, which disclose how severely the proposal will affect many bondholders. Today, in very brave words, the Prime Minister declared that the Government had saved Australia from insolvency. Why, then, should it be guilty of this dishonorable conduct to its bondholders? I know of the case of an old man of 81 who has South Australian stock to the value of £200 which matures on the11th August next. I do hope that his case will be regarded as a necessitous one. Strangely enough, the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> stated that he is satisfied with the assurance of the Government in this matter. I am not satisfied. I am not unmindful that there is an election in prospect. I wonder to myself whether the £2,000,000 that is to be provided from the sinking fund to redeem stock held by necessitous bondholders is merely a vote-catching device. What is going to happen the following year, when there will be no election? I am particularly apprehensive on that score. I received the following letter from a person whose bonds fall due in 1933 : - </para>

                        <para>. - The bonds to be purchased by the Commission are to be not above par. but may be above the market price. Am I to assume that it is the intention of the Government that the National Debt Commission shall make a profit out of those bondholders who are in necessitous circumstances? I should like the Treasurer to influence the National Debt Commission to repay bondholders who are in necessitous circumstances. In 1893, when our banks were being reconstructed, there was a provision that all depositors with accounts up to £50 or £100 should be repaid. At the time I was a young solicitor, and had £53 in the National Bank. It was repaid to me within a fortnight, which saved me from serious embarrassment. I ask the Treasurer for an assurance that the National Debt Commission will not make any profit out of distressed bondholders by buying in their stocks at less than the amount they invested, plus interest. </para>

                        <para>. - The intention is to repurchase the bonds at full face value from those who require their money for their own maintenance, or to meet definite and immediate obligations, the withholding of which would impose a hardship upon them. The National Debt Commission was faced with the difficulty that under the act which governs its -proceedings a definite obligation was placed upon it to employ all its funds to the best advantage of the national debt - normally to buy at market price, except in respect of matured bonds, which can be redeemed at full face value. The bonds under consideration are not redeemable in that sense, and must be purchased. The commission represented that unless it were given statutory authority it would be committing a breach of trust if it applied its funds to the purchase of bonds at a higher price than that ruling in the open market. That is why Parliament is being asked to give to the commission power to use its funds for the purchase of bonds at their face value. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> suggested that the relief to be afforded by the National Debt Commission to bondholders should not be limited to £2,000,000, but that, in addition, funds already allocated for the purchase of bonds on the market should be applied to the relief of cases of hardship. The honorable member, therefore, proposed that the clause should be amended to give a mandatory instruction to the commission. The commission is set up under a specific statute, which gives a statutory undertaking to bondholders that the sinking fund will be managed in a certain way by an independent body. It would be unwise to interfere with that. </para>

                            <para>- The commission manages the sinking fund in respect of all loans, overseas as well as internal, and we -should be careful not to create any misapprehension amongst bondholders at home or abroad. I call attention to the personnel of the commission, nearly all the members of which hold office, <inline font-style="italic">ex officio</inline> - the Chief Justice of the High Court, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, a representative of the State Governments, who at present is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pitt,</inline> Under- Treasurer of Victoria; the secretary to the Commonwealth . Treasury, the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth Treasurer. The honorable member for Swan questioned the wisdom of ear-marking £100,000 a month for purchases on the market. The commission realizes the extreme need" to provide the maximum amount of funds for the relief of cases of hardship, aud, taking that fully into account, allotted this £100,000 a, month for market operations, but limited the allocation to three months, at the end of which the commission will meet again and further consider the matter. If it is thought then that further funds should be allotted, even to the exclusion of purchases on the market, I have no doubt that the commission will act accordingly. </para>

As the Treasurer pointed out, the commission as a trustee for the nation has a fiduciary responsibility, and must act in accordance with the law. It is in duty bound to buy at market rates. If a private trustee were to pay £95 for bonds that he could have purchased for £88 he would be held to have committed a breach of trust. </para>

                            <para>- That is so ; therefore, it is necessary to give a mandate to the commission to buy bonds at. face value. The bill gives to the commission power to buy at a price in excess of the market rate, but not above par. Bonds can be bought in the market to-day for £S7; they may rise to £90. The obligation of the commission as trustee will be to consider how far this bill limits its obligations. The cases of hardship will absorb very much more than the £2,000,000, which the commission will make available this year. If bonds are quoted in the market at £90, many people will be ready to sell their bonds for £91, and the commission will be compelled by its trust to buy at that price. The commission is a corporation and has to act legally. It cannot be influenced by sentiment. A corporation has been described as having neither a body to be saved nor a soul to be dammed. If I were the trustee of an estate, and my duty required me to buy bonds the <inline font-style="italic">cestui que trust</inline> could sue me personally, if I paid £100 for a bond which I could have bought for £91. </para>

I regret that the Attorney-General is not present, because I should like to have his confirmation of my interpretation of the legal position. If the commission paid £100 for bonds at a time when the excess market price was  £91, then, as trustees for the nation, they would be guilty of a breach of trust. I realize that it is useless for me to move an amendment, but I appeal to the Treasurer's sense of right in this matter, and suggest that he submit it to the law  advisers  of the Crown, and, if necessary, have the point reconsidered in another place. No distressed bondholder should receive less than par. </para>

                            <para>- No; but the Chief Justice was particularly concerned about the point which I have mentioned, and the National Debt Commission carried a resolution authorizing the use of £2,000,000 for this express purpose. As Treasurer, I discussed this matter with the National Debt Commission, which realized that the position would be met by inserting an amendment in the bill giving the commission the necessary authority. This amendment was drafted by the Solicitor-General, who is also a member of the commission. It was carefully considered by him, and discussed fully with his law officers. He has assured me that it does everything that is necessary. I must be satisfied with that advice. </para>

                        <para>. - This clause simply gives the National Debt Commission authority to buy, at their face value, bonds for the relief of hardship case3. It would be unwise to insert in it any provision of a mandatory character, because, when the commission was appointed, it was clearly understood that it should be removed as far as possible from political control. If such an amendment as has been suggested were inserted, it would be mandatory upon the commission to do certain things which might be undesirable. I am glad we have had the assurance from the Treasurer that, if the necessity arises, and if the £2,000,000 which is being set aside for the purpose proves insufficient to adequately relieve hardship cases among both converters and dissenters, the commission may make an even larger sum available for the purchase of bonds at their full face value. </para>

                        <para>. -  I am afraid that the Commonwealth Parliament has got into a rather bad habit of allowing Supplementary Estimates to accumulate for two or three years, and then to pass them without much consideration being given to them, but it must be borne in mind that the information contained in the Supplementary Estimates is always before honorable members prior to the introduction of the Supplementary Estimates, and that parliamentary authority is given by the appropriation in the Estimates in chief under the designation of Treasurer's advance. The details are then set out in the subsequent Estimates. The actual amount expended is set out alongside the vote for the previous year, and it can be seen at n glance whether the vote has been exceeded and what call there has been on the Treasurer's advance. For some years past the Supplementary Estimates have not been brought down year by year. I think that they should be, even though honorable members have the information before them; and, so far as I am able to do it, I shall establish the practice of bringing down Supplementary Estimates following the Estimates in chief each session. </para>

                    <para class="block">That provision "was unsatisfactory, even in 1920, and aviation then had riot developed to the extent that it has now. Since 1920 great strides have taken place in aviation, particularly in the mileage and carrying capacity of aeroplanes. Civil aviation in Australia is controlled by departmental regulation, and it could hardly be expected that such a position would be entirely satisfactory. One honorable member to-day referred to <inline font-style="italic">Tha New Despotism,</inline> by Lord Hewart, which contains a description of the government of a country being carried out by departmental regulation. We have a similar position in Australia in which a whole province of aviation - the public side - is entirely controlled by regulation. The fault is not with this Government, because it was found that the Commonwealth did not have power under the Constitution to legislate on aviation. The Royal Commission on the Constitution pertinently pointed out that the States should hand over to the Commonwealth their powers in relation to the control of aviation. That body made a definite recommendation which I shall read later. The following extract is taken from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of yesterday: - </para>

                        <para>The managing director of West Australian Airways Limited <inline font-weight="bold">(Major Brearley)</inline> said today that the control of aviation was exercising the minds of those actively engaged in the advancement of air transport. Western Australia had not transferred to the Federal Government the powers desired by the Commonwealth to enable it to enforce laws relating to air transport, and it was evident that no proper authority existed hero to exercise that control. There had recently been cases in which machines outside the control of his company had been flown in a condition which involved very serious risk to the lives of the occupants, while the lives of those iti other planes in the same locality had been jeopardized. So serious had the position become that his company had decided to give the Commonwealth an opportunity to test the position on : safe " technical breaches of the regulations which he had committed. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not know how <inline font-weight="bold">Major Brearley</inline>  intends to test the position, but the fact remains that the regulations governing air transport arc not satisfactory. Recently, the Air Accidents Investigation Committee, which was established purely under departmental regulation, inquired into the crash at Temora of the <inline font-style="italic">Love Bird,</inline> a commercial air plane, and it came to a certain finding. I asked a question in this chamber regarding that finding, with a view to having the inquiry reopened, so that other accidents might be investigated. </para>

                            <para>- If I cannot discuss air accidents, I shall refer to the subject on another occasion. I wish now to call attention to the manner in which the Air Accidents Investigation Committee conducts its inquiries. The committee consists of three officials of the department, who do not sit in open court. It should sit in open court like the Marine Court, which is a court of record. It is high time that the Minister, and, in fact, the Cabinet instituted a thorough investigation into air accidents. This committee inquires into all cases of injury to aircraft passengers, forced landings, incompetence of personnel, and so on; but it is composed purely of departmental officers who, while desiring to do their work well and conscientiously, are in an invidious position, as only their finding and not the evidence is disclosed to the public. Such finding may be at variance with that of a coroner, as has happened, and is therefore not acceptable to the parties concerned or the relatives of the deceased. I therefore suggest that the Government should replace that committee by a body constituted on the lines of a marine court, on which a magistrate and other skilled persons would sit. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> I point out that the Commonwealth Parliament has no express power under the Constitution to make laws in respect of aviation, although it has some power in this direction under its trade and commerce powers. It was only because the Commonwealth was a party to the International Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation that it was able to pass the Air Navigation Act, the one page statute to which I have referred. The Royal Commission on the Constitution made the following specific recommendation in regard to aviation :  - </para>

                            <para>- I am not. This man is a real " go-getter ". In 1928 the administration of the telegraph branch of the Postal Department, by this officer resulted in a loss of £312,075. In the following year the loss was £22S,134, a total of £540,209 for the two years.  His  administration of the telephone branch in those two years resulted in losses of £322,438 and £247,211 respectively, a total loss of £569,649 for that branch. Taking the two branches mentioned, we find that the losses in those two years amounted to over £1,000,000. Before his appointment the telegraph branch showed a small profit each year, but under his administration enormous losses have been incurred in both that branch and the telephone branch. This gentleman was sent abroad; but no one appears to know what he did during his absence from Australia. I have endeavoured to elicit information from the Postmaster-General on the subject, only to be told that the work upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> was engaged was of such a nature that his reports could not be divulged, even to members of this House. Even when I asked questions regarding contracts of a suspicious nature, no information' was given me, because it was again alleged that secrecy must be maintained. This highly-paid official, after having been sent on a trip to Britain and the United States of. America, was paid £1,000 in addition to his salary. That was done behind the  back of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I have no grudge against- him as an individual; but I feel that I am doing my duty in ventilating these matters. This afternoon references were made to robbery of various kinds : we heard some plausible remarks about political rectitude, and the sanctity of contracts. Surely this committee has a duty in connexion with the expenditure of public money? In order to elicit information I desire, I now ask the Postmaster-General the following questions : - (1) Is it a fact that the Imperial "Wireless and Cable Conference of 192S presented a report of 26 printed pages which was laid on the table of the British Parliament in July, 1928? (2) Is it a fact that that report was printed by the British Government, and made available for public distribution? (3) Is this the report referred to by the Postmaster-General in his reply to a question by me on 23rd July, 1931 <inline font-style="italic">(Ilansard,</inline> page 2490) ? (4) If so, why does the Postmaster-General refer to that report as " the secret report of the conference"? (5) Why was that report not laid on the table of the Australian Parliament? (6) Will the Minister now make that report available? (7) Did the Director of Postal Services, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> P. Brown, who attended the conference referred to, concur in the recommendation for the handing over of the cable and wireless services of the Empire, including those owned by the British Government, to one new company apart from the British Postal Department? (8) If so, why did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown,</inline> after agreeing to the dissociation of the combined wireless and cable services from government control, so far as Britain was concerned, urge that such control, so far as Australia is concerned, should be vested in the Postal Department, of which he is secretary? (9) Will the Minister state plainly whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> made any report on his return to Australia from this conference? (10) If so, why has not such report been presented to Parliament? </para>

                    <para>In the early life of this Parliament I obtained information that, since the appointment of this officer, contracts amounting to over £5,000,000 had been let overseas for goods the bulk of which could have been made in Australia.  Only  this week the Minister admitted that since this Government has been in office Postal Department orders had been placed overseas for materials and supplies to the value of approximately £49,000, notwithstanding that they could have been manufactured in Australia, and that thousands of our people are workless and in poverty. The Minister's reply to my question was most unsatisfactory; he gave no explanation whatever. The main reason given by this Government for placing orders overseas, is the high cost of the locally-produced articles. But in proof of this no information is given regarding the items. In fairness to the country, full information on these matters should be supplied to Parliament. I voice my protest against the highly unsatisfactory and. questionable administration of this official. Members are entitled to object when they find that for all they know £3,221 has been squandered, and no explanation given. I should like to know why, in addition to being paid a high salary, this officer was granted an honorarium of £1,000 for work which after all was only part of his duties for which he received a. princely salary. </para>

                            <para>- With the results that have been brought under our notice ever since by the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge).</inline> It appears that this gentleman is capable of exercising some extraordinary influence over Ministers controlling the Postal Department. They always seem to be in such a frame of mind that they adopt, without question or criticism, whatever proposals he places before them. There is no doubt that to-day certain members of the Government, including the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cunningham),</inline> who was one of the strongest critics in the party of his administration, could express their views in terms similar to those used by the honorable member for Martin on the administration of this officer, if they had the courage to do so. There are half a dozen other honorable members representing country electorates who would condemn in the strongest possible terms the ruthless way in which postal services in country districts have been restricted under his direction. It is also true that notwithstanding the high salary which he receives, the department which he has administered has showed a substantial loss during recent years. The figures quoted by the honorable member for Martin show that he has been a colossal failure. The Government cannot thrust this matter aside, and sooner or later, we shall reach a stage, particularly with respect to the letting of contracts, when the public will demand an explanation of what is going on. Such an agitation will be set up that the Government will be forced to review the position. The circumstances which at present exist can no longer be tolerated. It will be very interesting to certain members of the Public Service, particularly those engaged in the Postal Department, who have been seriously affected by the legislation recently passed by the Government, to learn that this officer is receiving such a princely salary. The remuneration which he receives is of particular interest when it is remembered that the other day I had to approach the Postmaster-General on behalf of 30 returned soldier cleaners, who were to be dismissed from the Sydney General Post Office. It will also be of interest to them to know that notwithstanding the high salary which this officer receives he has also been granted an honorarium of £1,000 in connexion with certain services which he is alleged to have rendered to the Government. It is true that the Postmaster-General said that he will do all he can to retain the services of the cleaners to whom  I  have just referred. The Minister doubtless realizes that he is confronted with an extraordinary handicap when it is pointed out that the department over which this highly paid officer presides is showing, such a tremendous loss. The position should not be tolerated any longer. Instead of brushing aside the questions submitted by the honorable member for Martin, the Government should fully investigate the matter. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> said that the honorable member for Martin has an obsession in this matter. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member objects to the expression I used, t shall later substitute another term which may be more fitting. I do not question the right of any honorable member to express an opinion concerning the administration of any public officer; but any unbiased honorable member will admit that for months past the honorable member for Martin has directed most of the criticism in which he has indulged # in this House to the Director of Postal Services, and has insinuated that there is something wrong with the contracts into which the Postmaster-General's Department, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> is the principal administrative officer, has entered. There is not a scintilla of truth in the honorable member's remarks, which would be regarded as grossly unfair by any public servant. It  i3  not my intention to explain the circumstances under which an honorarium of £1,000 was paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown,</inline> as that was the act of a previous administration. The action of the honorable member who has repeatedly hurled questions at me, and cluttered up the notice-paper with similar questions, has not resulted in any service to the country. These questions have been submitted at the behest of some obscure person. I am not a hero worshipper, but I have had sufficient experience to RECOGNIZE a man's ability and to form an opinion as .to his honesty. For the honorable member to insinuate that the contracts let by the department, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> is the responsible officer, were in any way suspicious, is improper in the highest degree.  His  insinuation savours more of cowardice than of anything else, because the gentleman against whom he makes the charge is not able to defend himself- </para>

                    </para><para>Reference has been made to the losses experienced in the telephone and telegraph branches of the Postal Department. It is true that, in. common with all other business concerns, whether public or private, those branches of the service have not paid directly, but, taking the Postal and Telegraph Department in its entirety, it has proved a good business proposition for Australia. Considering the sparse population of Australia, compared with other countries, the telephonic, telegraphic, and postal services provided are relatively cheap. Telephonic and mail services are not expected to pay, the main object being to make life in the back country more tolerable than it would be without those services, and to give rural settlers means of communication with their fellow citizens in the more thickly populated areas. In some districts, the department gives services worth, say, £2,000 for a return of a few hundred pounds. The honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge)</inline> has made a great deal of the expenditure, during the present Government's term of office, of £49,000 on material of overseas manufacture which could have been made in Australia. In a department which spends over £12,000,000 a year, a paltry £49,000 is of small importance. As a matter of fact, it can be shown that the expenditure to which the honorable member has referred was justified. He made a considerable fuss about the purchase abroad of the material for two broadcasting stations. I think that the department was quite justified in placing the orders abroad, because the local tender was £56,000 for material which could be purchased overseas for £30,000. For substation protectors, the Australian tender was 25 per cent, higher, or £2,271 over and above the duty on a job costing less than £4,000; and for porous pots, 85 per cent., or £1,276 higher than the price paid. The honorable member did not mention that since the present Government has been in power it has reduced the proportion of material purchased abroad from 40 per cent, to 32 per cent. </para><interjection>

                        <para>.- Judging by the Minister's reply to the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge),</inline> one would imagine that the Director of Posts and Telegraphs had accomplished much; but the postal services have never been in a more deplorable condition than at the present time. Throughout Australia, post offices have been closed. In my electorate, at one time, they were being shut up at the rate of about four a week. When applications are made for telephone facilities for a town, the residents are required to guarantee a certain revenue, and if it is not forthcoming, they are obliged to make up the shortage. I. have repeatedly referred to the need for better facilities in Cardiff in my electorate, which has a population of over 4,000, and still has only an allowance post office. The 48 telephone subscribers are attached to three different exchanges. It seems to me that the Government is willing to grant postal facilities to members who hold doubtful seats, such as Calare. Apparently the electors of Hume must be given a sop for fear of Hardy, who threatens to lead the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> to his political doom. I can foreshadow a scene in his electorate which will be a reproduction of the happening on board the <inline font-style="italic">Victory,</inline> at Trafalgar, when we shall again hear repeated, as the Minister expires politically, the historical words, " Kiss me Hardy, I am done." Better facilities could have been made available than have been provided by the administration since the present Government has been in power. It does not appear as though the department is desirous of catering for the needs of the people or of encouraging the flow of revenue to the Treasury. Although all postal matter is stamped with the injunction, "Do it by 'phone ", in numerous cases persons who have made application for telephonic installations have been advised that this facility cannot be made available to them, unless they defray a certain portion of the cost. I have urged the extension of many postal facilities, but have never been able to obtain satisfaction. I hope that before the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> again boasts of what the department has done he will be in a position to produce proofs of the provision of additional facilities instead of the curtailment of those that are already provided. </para>

                        <para>.- Under Division  79  - Civil Aviation Branch, Department of Defence - there appears the item " Subsidy of aerial ambulance service, Queensland,  £1 ". That, in  my opinion, is somewhat ironic.  In  the previous two years, a subsidy was granted to the Australian Inland Mission, which has performed a service of incalculable value in Queensland. Its base is at Cloncurry, and it subsidizes  the  Queensland and Northen Territory Aerial Service to transport a medical man  to  places where his services may be needed  in  cases of sickness. The Queensland </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Government has paid the mission a small subsidy and the balance of the money which it has needed has been subscribed privately, largely by the H. V. McKay bequest. The contribution of the Commonwealth Government was very small, compared with the value of the service that was rendered by the mission; yet, for some reason that has not been disclosed, and that has not been satisfactorily explained, so far as I have heard, no amount appeared on the Estimates this year for this purpose. The board of the mission asked me if I would invite a delegation to meet the Ministers concerned, and a deputation waited on the Ministers for Defence and Home Affairs and the Postmaster-General to ascertain whether, perhaps,  £200  could be made available from the contingency vote of each of those three departments. The deputation received a courteous reception, and was given a good hearing, but was informed that no amount could be made available this year. The opinion was expressed, however, that next year something in the direction desired might be possible. I think that some reply should be made as to why the money has not been provided. A definite service is being supplied from the Home Affairs stand-point. I quote the following paragraph from a letter received from one of the police stations in the Far North. It is as follows:- </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Situated as I am here on the junction of two great stock routes, along which every year come many thousands of travelling cattle with their attendant droving plants, I am in a position to receive many sick and injured people in the year, and do so receive them. Most are received and treated by me successfully, but nobody hears of them. At times, however, comes a case with which 1 cannot cope, and it is then that the Flying Medical Service takes from my shoulders the responsibility such as it is in my opinion distinctly wrong for any layman to be called upon to bear. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The Minister knows that the flying doctor recently visited Mornington Island, and dealt with an epidemic amongst the natives there which might have cost the Government many thousands of pounds. The service is a definite asset also to the Postal Department. The mission has issued wireless sets to stations within a radius of  400  miles of Cloncurry. I have a list of twenty stations which take telegrams from the cattle stations round about, and transmit them to the department. It is not necessary to dilate on the advantages of the service from a defence point of view. It ensures that a trained pilot is in commission, it serves to make the people air minded, and induces them to look upon the humanitarian side of aviation. It is no exaggeration to say that this service has saved each year as many lives as are lost in aviation, and yet the Government cannot find a paltry £600 for its support. Yet in the same Estimates the Government enters into a contract with a private company-s- West Australian Airways Limited - in connexion with some advertising work, and arranged to pay it £3,000. The Government did not go on with the contract, but it has paid the company £657 Ils. 9d. I asked a question recently whether a payment had been made to the West Australian Airways Limited by way of compensation, and was given the following reply : - - </para>

                        <para>No payment lias been made to West Australian Airways by .way of compensation. I may say, however, for the honorable member's information, that the sum of £G57 Us. 9d. was paid to West Australian Airways Limited, in full and final settlement of a claim for reimbursement of expenditure incurred by the company in connexion with a special air mail publicity campaign for the East-Wed service. This campaign was originally approved by Cabinet as a joint effort by thu Commonwealth and the company to attract a greater volume of air mail traffic to this service, and consequent benefit to Commonwealth in surcharge air mail postage, expenditure to lie incurred by Commonwealth and company on a £1 for fi basis. Subsequently, however, and before the Commonwealth had incurred any expenditure, the matter was reviewed in the light of the adverse financial situation, and the arrangements cancelled by the Commonwealth. The suspension of the campaign in its early stages deprived the company of any financial benefit from it, and after considering various factors, Cabinet approved of the refund to the company of all expenditure incurred which was deemed to be a reasonable charge against the publicity scheme. </para>
