                    <para>Proposal by the Minister of Customs to reduce the protective duties on stout in return for purchase by Guinness, of Dublin, of supply Tasmanian hops strongly objected to. Australian brewers use Australian hops, and have at Markets Department's request refrained for years from using imported hops which they can buy of best quality for less than the price they pay for Australian. Brewers pay heavy excise duty and are large employers of labour under Australian conditions. These surplus hops were grown when it was obvious that there would not be a market for all of them, and the growers were warned of this. They arc sold to Guinness at half the price paid by local brewers in return for reduction in protection to local manufacturers. This in unfair and an invasion of the country's settled protection policy. </para>

                        <para>- When the Estimates for the Trade and Customs Department are under consideration to-day, the honorable member will have an opportunity to discuss this matter in general terms. No protective duty has been removed from the Australian manufacturers of stout. The duty on imported stout is 3s. 6d.a gallon, and even when exchange was normal, Australian brewers considered that they had ample protection, and made no request for an increase of duty. The 50 per cent. surcharge and the rationing of imports of stout were introduced in April of last year, with a definite assurance by the Prime Minister that they were not protective measures but were merely intended to help to rectify the adverse trade balance. The Tasmanian growers hada surplus of 4,000 bales of  hops  for which there was no market. They represented to the Government that some of their former trade with Guinness of Dublin could be recovered if the surcharge and rationing were removed from imported stout. Negotiations resulted in an offer by Guinness to take the whole of the surplus of 4,000 bales of hops, and 1,000 bales annually from 1933 onwards. I am assured that this order will be worth £42,000 in English currency and £57,000 in Australian currency, to the Tasmanian hop industry. As exchange is over 30 per cent. against Australia the duty of 3s.6d. per gallon on imported stout should he ample protection for the local brewing industry. </para>

The Government has taken up this matter with the banks very determinedly, and I believe that they are arranging to take the requiredaction. I have invited them to confer with representatives of the various Australian Governments at the forthcoming conference of Premiers, if satisfactory arrangements are not. made in the meantime. Any action recommended by the conference will, if necessary, be referred to this Parliament. </para>

In these negotiations the Government does not interfere, but an amalgamation of the two institutions cannotbe effected without the consent of the Commonwealth Treasurer, which means the consent of the Commonwealth Government. This is wholly a business transaction, and the intricate banking arrangements involved, and the consideration of assets to be taken over and liabilities to be assumed, are not the responsibility of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- It is the very opposite. Regarding the second part of the honorable member's question, we cannot lay down any fixed rules for amalgamation, or say that the same conditions shall apply in all cases. I absolutely deny that, in regard to the negotiations between the bank authorities, I have taken any but an impartial attitude. I point out that the financial advisers and experts of the Commonwealth Bank would have to treat every proposal for amalgamation on its merits. </para>

                        <para>- Any one who knows the facts is aware that I have been most active in safeguarding the Australian timber industry against importations of Russian timber. No shipments of Russian timber have been dumped in Australia. One cargo has been unloaded, but the invoice showing the value of that timber was not received in Australia until  a  few days ago. I have given definite instructions that delivery of that timber is not to be taken until I have been consulted. That timber has not been offered for sale, and there are no further shipments on the water. The Australian timber industry is being amply safeguarded. I hope, in the near future, to have from the Tariff Board a report as to whether this is a case in which the anti-dumping duty should be applied. </para>

                        <para>- Parliament will adjourn when it has disposed of the business that I have previously indicated, and I propose to move that the House adjourn to a date to be fixed. That date shall be not more than five weeks from the date of adjournment, but Parliament may be called together earlier than that - it will depend upon the speed with which we transact the business at the conferences that are to be held. The Loan Council has important  matters to discuss, and a Premiers Conference will also take place. In all probability, legislation arising out of those conferences will have to be prepared. If that can be done within four weeks the House will be called together at the end of that period, but it will meet not later than five weeks from the date of the adjournment. </para>

I have since written to every Premier asking whether hisState would be preparedto cooperate with the Commonwealth in the making of such an investigation. I pointed out that it was desirable that the fullest possible power should be given to such a committee. While the replies of some Premiers have indicated that they are in favour of the proposal, other replies have not been favorable. I have listed this subject for discussion at the coming Premiers Conference, and shall endeavour to have it finalized. </para>

Reaper-threshers, and many other goods, are prohibited imports under a proclamation which was issued in April, 1930, for the purpose of restricting imports with a view to rectifying Australia's adverse trade balance. In the interests of primary producers, the inclusion of reaperthreshers and other agricultural implements in the proclamation was made contingent on undertakings by Australian manufacturers that the prices of the implements concerned would be reduced during the term of the prohibition. </para>

            <para>Mr.R. GREEN  (Richmond) [2.55].- The money proposed to be voted for this department is intended for expenditure under the River Murray Waters Act. It is stated in to-day's press that the Government of New South Wales has again defaulted in certain payments. We are becoming accustomed to this sort of thing, for that Government is the most madheaded Australia has ever known. I wish to know what the Commonwealth Government intends to do in regard to the default of New South Wales in respect of its payments under the River Murray Waters Act. As honorable members are aware, extensive works are being carried out on the River Murray, under an agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. I know that the Government of South Australia feels itself under a. considerable disability in this connexion, for it is required to provide the money for  a  quarter of the expenditure although it will not reap anything like the same benefits as Victoria and New South Wales, which are not only more populous States, but are also wealthier from 'the revenue point of view. Does the Commonwealth Government intend to provide the money which, in the ordinary course, the Government of New South Wales would provide for this purpose? </para>

                    <para>. - When this subject last came before the River Murray Waters Commission, which has control of the works being carried out on the river, the payments due by the Commonwealth Government and the Governments  of  South Australia and Victoria had been made, but an amount of £12,500 was outstanding from New South Wales. A request was made that the Commonwealth Government should find this money pending the meeting of the Loan Council, when consideration should be given to the subject; but the Commonwealth replied that it could only provide its own quota. A proposition is being put to the next meeting of the Loan Council for the raising of the money required for the current year's work. In the meantime each Government must find its own quota of money to meet its own commitments. </para>

                    <para>. - I  should like to see this proposed vote reduced by £25,000. According to newspaper reports a meeting of Ministers  of  the Commonwealth and the States interested in this subject has been held at Albury within the last few days. It was there agreed that £500,000 was more than the Governments would be justified in spending on these works this year. But the Commonwealth Government is evidently asking for a vote on the assumption that £500,000 will be spent, and not £380,000, which was the amount agreed upon at the meeting to which I have referred. Before I actually move for the reduction of this item, I should like to hear from the Minister whose department is supervising this work what is the actual position. If £25,000 can he saved on this vote, it can be made available for important work somewhere else. It is not  fair  to ask Parliament to vote a larger sum than the Government intends to expend. </para>

When it was set down, it was thought that£ 500,000 would be the total expenditure of the year; but it is now suggested that the expenditure could be reduced. The whole matter must come up for discussion by the Loan Council before  a  conclusion is arrived at, but eventually the item may be reduced to  a  much greater extent than is suggested by the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker).</inline></para>

The whole matter must be determined by the Loan Council. I assure honorable members that the Commonwealth Government will not pay more than its quota, and, if the amount provided in this item is more than sufficient, only what is necessary will be expended. If the other governments are in favour of £500,000 being expended, the Commonwealth Government will require the amount set out in this item. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Government will not favorably consider any proposal to whittle down this vote. Although the sum of £380,000was mentioned recently at a conference of representatives of the States concerned, many other works are associated with the river Murray water scheme. There are, for example, isolated locks, upon which money must be expended. </para>

                <para>I am rather surprised that a representative from South Australia, who has shown such a keen interest in the development of the Murray Valley, should have brought forward a proposal to reduce this amount. If  any  proposal is submitted to the Premiers Conference in connexion with expenditure on works of a constructional nature along the river Murray, it should be for the increasing of the amount. Such work is of a developmental nature, and will provide employment. </para>

                    <para>.- The item contemplates that the economies effected in Commonwealth expenditure shall be used during this financial year for the discharge of the Commonwealth's obligations in connexion with this work, although in previous years the Commonwealth Government has met this and other such obligations out of loan funds. It seems to me to be quite wrong that the capital cost of important national works should be financed out of what are really wage reductions and economies effected at the expense of those who are entitled to a normal income. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but, instead of the money being provided out of the capital resources of the country, the work is to be paid for by the diminution of the earnings of the public servants. It is important that this Parliament should realize that that practice represents an entire change on the part of this Government in the method of financing important public works. </para>

                        <para>- What I say is correct. Previous governments have discharged the cost of the river Murray development scheme out of loan funds. This Government is faced with the obligation of continuing that work, otherwise the whole of the investment will be lost, and it is providing its share of this year's obligations, not out of loan funds, as hitherto, but practically out of economies effected at the expense of pensioners and of the servants of the Crown. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>I rose to point out this fact, so that the country may recognize that not only are the workers required to make an absolute sacrifice in order to balance government budgets, but their sacrifice is also being used as a contribution to the capital of the country. They should be entitled to draw interest on the amount involved just as any ordinary capitalist who financed a loan for the purpose of carrying out the work would be entitled to do so. The total interest cost of this work will be less than would otherwise be the case, because  of the method adopted by the Government to finance it. As a general principle, I agree that the correct method to adopt is to pay out of revenue ; but I submit that the right way for the Government to finance its share of this tremendous work is in accordance with the principles of the Fiduciary Notes Bill, brought down by the Government some time ago, which was rejected in another place. </para>
                <para>Honorable members opposite have no scruple about taking 2s. 6d. from the weekly earnings of old-age and invalid pensioners, in order to build the Hume Weir, and this Parliament, and this country, ought to recognize at last that the pensioners and public servants have had their incomes reduced in order to provide the means whereby this and other important national works shall be financed. That is the truth. This money is being found out of revenue, and has been provided by effecting a reduction of public expenditure. However much honorable members opposite would like to evade the fact, the truth is that this department will now cost the nation £90,000 a year less for administration. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so,but the Government is spending £120,000 out of revenue to meet the capital cost of this important work, not for the purpose of balancing the budget. When honorable members opposite were in power, they would have borrowed that £120,000, and paid6 per cent. interest on it in perpetuity. That is the programme and policy which they put into effect. This Government is not following that procedure. It has reduced the wages of public servants and the allowances of invalid and old-age pensioners, and is using the money so saved to carry out this work. The facts prove it, and I invite the country to take notice of them. </para>

                    <para>. - The point raised by the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> requires answering. He worked himself up into a passion during his denunciation of the Government for proceeding with theconstruction of the Hume Weir out of moneys allegedly taken from pensioners and public servants. We have no money in the loan funds at the present time, and if we did not use money from revenuewe would have to dismiss the men now working on the weir. It is better that we should have reductions all round than that a large group of workers should be put off. I have yet to learn that the honorable member for Fremantle favours the gospel of borrowing. The honorable member said that the last Government would have borrowed money at 6 per cent., but surely he does not suggest that the present Government should do the same. At any rate, it would not be possible for us to borrow money for this purpose. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and when that proposal was introduced in the form of a bill, it was rejected in another place. The honorable member has no right to say that we are unnecessarily cutting down wages and pensions, when he knows that our proposal for obtaining credits by a fiduciary issue was defeated in the Senate. If he wishes to give expression to his opinions, he should at least stick to facts. If wo could raise money for the prosecution of this work we would do so, but in the meantime, we wish to provide employment for 500 or 600 men on the construction of the Hume Weir. </para>

This vessel is to replace the <inline font-style="italic">Kyogle,</inline> which has been doing the work for many years. When the new vessel is- completed, it is proposed to sell the <inline font-style="italic">Kyogle,</inline> but if the <inline font-style="italic">Kyogle</inline> is fit to be used by a private purchaser, she must be fit to be used by the Government. This new ship will cost at least 50 per cent, more to build here, than the Government would have had to pay for an imported vessel. It was disclosed during the discussion of this subject some time ago that the New Zealand Government has obtained a better lighthouse vessel from Great Britain for £64,000, so that we are not justified during this time of depression in paying £50,000 more than necessary for the luxury of having this vessel built in Australia. If we imported the vessel, we could afford to pay the workmen employed in the construction of this new ship the basic wage for a year, and still save money on the deal. </para>

                    <para>. - As the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> suggests that the building of this lighthouse vessel involves a waste of public money, I ask if he contends that we should not maintain our lighthouses, in order that sea travel may he safe ? For the maintenance of the lighthouses, it was found, on examination by the department, that more than one vessel was required, even though the <inline font-style="italic">Kyogle</inline> were retained in the service. Let the honorable member consult his own conscience in deciding whether it is a waste of money to provide the necessary protection for the crews and passengers on the vessels that ply round our coasts.. The honorable member alleged that the Government set out to build the vessel in question at a time of depression when money was scarce. The logic of his argument was that all the workers who were employed on the construction of, the vessel, and those dependent upon them, should, metaphorically, be thrown- to the wolves by being deprived of the necessaries of life because of the depression. The building of this vessel provided a measure of employment for men who had followed that class of work for many years.  The honorable member favours the maintenance of a navy for the protection of our shores, and for a navy the maintenance of a dockyard is essential. It should be remembered that hundreds of men have been specially trained at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard in shipbuilding, and they are entitled to continuity of employment, so far as it can be provided. This establishment should be maintained for naval purposes. Although the honorable member said that the position might be examined from the point of view that those workmen could be provided with the basie wage in some other activity, I point out that, for many months, the workers at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard have not received more than the basic wage, a general scheme of rationing having been applied to them. I do not know whether the statements of the honorable member are based on information supplied to him by an employee of the dockyard; but his remarks are diametrically opposed to the best interests of the country, and of the men engaged at the dockyard. If all public works were regarded as involving a waste of money, the workers employed in connexion with them would have to be placed on the dole. Are we to stop all government works throughout Australia because of the cry that . money is scarce? That would mean placing Australia at the mercy of overseas countries, because it would be necessary to import almost everything we need from countries that have no Consideration for Australia. Reference has been made to a vessel purchased by the New Zealand Government, but no shipbuilding organization in any part of the world can do better work than that turned out in Australia. Vessels built at Cockatoo Island challenge comparison with any constructed elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Every public man, particularly members of the National Parliament, should take a pride in shipbuilding activity in Australia, and do everything to encourage it, so that this skilled work may be available to the rising generations. Owing to our geographical position, we should bend all our energies to the development, to its fullest extent, of the shipbuilding industry. </para>

                    <para>.-Though I admit that ship construction is of vital importance to Australia, and every member favours the building of vessels in this country, the cost of the work has to be considered, and, in my opinion, tenders should be called for. The Government has adopted the policy of giving Cockatoo Island Dockyard all the work that it can do at whatever price it likes to charge. It is well known in New South Wales, and particularly in Sydney,  that this dockyard charges more for its work than any other shipbuilding yard in New South Whiles. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; I entirely agree that the work put into the cruiser referred to by the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks)</inline> compared more than favorably with that in any other unit of the British fleet. But, as a member of the royal commission that inquired into (he operations at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard - the honorable member for Wentworth was also a member of the commission - I have no hesitation in saying that the charges made at that yard are altogether excessive. Although I do not approve of importing ships from overseas, because I believe that we can build them locally, I claim that tenders should be called to give private enterprise a chance to compete. Such a policy would meet the objection raised by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> to the throwing of workmen out of employment, because no less employment would be available if the work were carried out by private firms. The Cockatoo Island Dockyard enjoys many advantages that are denied to private companies; it pays no rates or taxes. I could give the Minister specific instances in which excessive charges have been made by that dockyard. The highest price tendered by a private firm for the overhauling of launches for the Quarantine Department was about £200, but, under instructions from the Government, the vessels were sent to Cockatoo Island, and the charge amounted to over £S00. If an industry can live only by unsound bolstering of this character, it should be closed. I believe in giving to our workmen all the jobs they can do, but as a check on extravagance, private engineering yards should have an opportunity to tender for the construction of ships. The Government should not continue to pay to Cockatoo Island dockyard prices far in excess of those at which private enterprise- could do the work. </para>

                    <para>. -  I did not suggest that anything should be done to jeopardize the lives of those engaged in the lighthouse service. The Public Works Committee reported that the <inline font-style="italic">Kyogle</inline> which is now engaged in this service is seaworthy; indeed, so" seaworthy is it that when the new steamer is completed the Government will sell the <inline font-style="italic">Kyogle</inline> in the open market. If the lives of government employees would be endangered by the continued use of the vessel, the Government has no right to sell the ship and so imperil the lives of others. 1 am not averse to our own workmen being employed on the construction of vessels, but such undertakings should be carried out on business lines. If Australian workmen are as competent as the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> ha3 stated, why should a vessel produced by them cost £50,000 more; than the price at which a similar ship could be manufactured abroad and brought to Australia? </para>

One of the destroyers bought abroad was defective, and new machinery had to be installed after the vessel reached Australia. Further, cost was incurred by sending a crew to England to bring the vessel out. I remind the honorable member for Warringah that a previous government induced artisans to leave their ordinary jobs and engage in shipbuilding at Cockatoo and Walsh Islands, lt was generally admitted that five of the warships built in those yards were constructed better and more quickly than they could have been produced elsewhere. Unfortunately, the workers who were induced to give up their half-paid-for homes in other parts in order to take work at Walsh Island have been thrown out of employment through the closing down of the shipbuilding yards. The statement that ships cannot be built as well in Australia as elsewhere is so much humbug: </para>

                    <para>.- Year after year I have urged the need for the provision of a lighthouse on the east coast of King Island, and each year I have had to deplore the fact that no money has been placed on the Estimates for this work. The need for such a light is recognized by the Director of Lighthouses; but we are told that no money is available for the purpose. Only a few weeks ago I again urged the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> to provide money for this work, but my representations were not successful. These Estimates provide for an expenditure of £800,000, and I believe honorable members will agree that many of the works- provided for could better be postponed than the erection of a light for the protection of the shipping in Bass Strait. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say; but the expense would not be very great. Apart from the need to protect the regular services between Tasmania, King Island and the mainland, there is no light to guide ships passing between the north-' west coast of Tasmania and Melbourne and Adelaide. The adequate lighting of the coast for the protection of shipping is a Commonwealth responsibility; but, because only those who are concerned in the navigation of ships realize the danger of a long stretch of unlighted coast, the proposed work has never been sanctioned. I honestly fear that a serious disaster may occur through the absence of a light on the east coast of King Island, and the various governments which have refused to provide it will have to share the responsibility. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to pursue the matter further. 'The remarks of honorable members opposite regarding ship-building in Australia are in keeping with their past utterances and actions. They say that they believe in Australian workmen being given the work that they are capable of doing; but we know that that is on the condition that our workers shall accept the low standards of living of the Chinese coolies, or of the workers of other cheap labour countries. They are not prepared to allow the Australian workmen to enjoy at least a decent standard of living. Cockatoo Island Dock yard is the only dock in Australia capable of docking the largest naval vessels on the Australian station. Many of the employees at that dockyard are highly skilled, some of them having had special training overseas. These patriots on the other side of the chamber, who are so greatly concerned about the finances of the country, are anxious to have work sent overseas to be done under cheap labour conditions, irrespective of the fact that we should thus deprive many of our highly skilled and other workers of their means of employment. Honorable members opposite did not hesitate to call upon these men to defend Australia and the Empire during the war, but now that this country is not in danger of invasion, they are asking them to bear more than their fair share of sacrifice in the general plan of rehabilitation, by depriving them of work, and giving it to the workmen of low-wage countries. I am anxious that the standard of living of the men employed at Cockatoo Island should be maintained; that it should not be lowered as suggested by honorable members opposite. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like from the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McNeill)</inline> some information with regard to the treatment that is being meted out to the occupants' of war service homes. I have heard some heartrending stories about the drastic treatment given to some of these occupants. It is said that in one instance  a  returned soldier who was in arrears with his payments  was  ejected from his home, and that it is now occupied by a private citizen who is paying less rental per week than the soldier occupant was called upon to pay. If that is true,I consider that the treatment of the returned soldier occupant was altogether too harsh. The Government, as a landlord, can afford to be lenient.  I am  informed that a private landlord, to meet the altered financial circumstances of his tenant who was purchasing his home on instalments, reduced not only the payments per fortnight, but also the interest rate. Surely if a private landlord can exercise leniency, the Government can act similarly, and I believe that it has done so in the majority of instances. I hope that, if it can be proved  that  drastic treatment is being meted out to the occupants of war service homes, the Government will take steps to see that they are given at least a fair deal. </para>

                    <para>.- There are many matters concerning the construction of this lighthouse steamer, which have not yet been touched upon. In the first place, I submit that the sum of £120,000 which is being expended on the construction of this vessel at Cockatoo Island will not entail any loss to this country. The price quoted to the Public "Works Committee for the building of a similar vessel in England was £64,000, but that sum did not take into consideration the adverse rate of exchange, the cost of sending a Government official to England to supervise construction, the cost of bringing the vessel when completed to Australia, or the cost of repatriating the English crew. Another phase which has been lost sight of is that the construction of this vessel in Australia keeps a number of our workless citizens in employment, and thus relieves this country of the necessity for paying them the dole. When ' all the costs incidental to the construction of a lighthouse vessel in Great Britain are taken into consideration, we discover that there is practically no difference between the price in England and that in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that there is little difference between the cost in Australia and that in England. It was stated i  ii  evidence before the Public Works Committee that a large quantity of material that had been taken from dismantled craft, such as wireless and electrical fittings, could be used in the construction, of this lighthouse vessel, and that if it were not used for this purpose it would soon be in a state of disrepair and of little value. In fact, if it were offered for sale to-day, there would be practically no demand for it. The Government was forced to provide a vessel to take the place of the <inline font-style="italic">Kyogle,</inline> because the cost of making that vessel efficient was prohibitve. It is abso lutely unfitted for the lighthouse service. It is obsolete and its maintenance costs are heavy. Fuel had to be sent ahead, because the <inline font-style="italic">Kyogle</inline> had not sufficient fuel storage capacity, nor has it the steaming rate required on the run. As it was uneconomical to keep the <inline font-style="italic">Kyogle</inline> in commission, it was decided to replace it with an up-to-date vessel. If a small sum were expended on the <inline font-style="italic">Kyogle</inline> in making it seaworthy, probably a purchaser could be found for it. By keeping this work in Australia we shall assist, not only in maintaining Cockatoo Island Dockyard, but also in relieving unemployment. Ii has been proved beyond doubt that in respect of ship-building, Australian workmen are as efficient as workmen overseas. </para>

                    <para>.- When this vessel ploughs the seas it will no doubt encounter some tempestuous weather. We have had some tempestuous passages in this debate, particularly in respect of the speech of . the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> who has been quite up to form, and has put spirit into a discussion which might otherwise have been dull. Therefore, our thanks are due to him. </para>

                <para>One point which has been missed - 1 think the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> touched upon it - relates to defence. Cockatoo Island Dockyard has to be maintained, and it is an expensive proposition. We are groping in the dark a good deal to find excuses for keeping it in operation, and we have to continue to find those excuses, perhaps at too great a cost at a time like this. When the proposal for the building of this lighthouse vessel was before honorable members, I voted for it on the ground that we have to keep employed at Cockatoo Island a highly skilled technical staff. That dockyard has magnificent machinery, none better in the world for shipbuilding purposes. It is the only naval dockyard in this part of the Pacific. I admit that it cannot accommodate a modern battleship, but should one of the units of the British fleet come to these shores it could be repaired and work done upon it at the dockyard. We have at Cockatoo Island a naval staff capable of carrying out that class of work. Most of us will admit that this vessel has cost far too much,  but against that we must take into consideration the fact that every penny expended upon her is expended locally. The expenditure of this money in Australia will keep men off the dole, and enable them to maintain their families in reasonable comfort. The money will be spent in Australia. Moreover, it should be remembered that a saving of £19,000 odd will be effected in exchange by keeping the money here. It is essential that we should maintain a naval dockyard in good order in Australia, not only for effecting repairs to our own ships of war, but also for giving attention to visiting naval ships. It is quite possible that the maintenance of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard is a matter that might come within the purview of the League of Nations under the special category of British Empire Naval Forces. At any rate, so long as we maintain a navy in these waters we must also maintain a dockyard. In my opinion, the expenditure of this money in Australia is justified. If the question arose again whether we should build a ship here or abroad, I would vote for it to be built here. </para>

I amnot surprised that the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> and his colleagues arc opposed to it, for they have shown a callous indifference to the welfare of the men who go down to the sea in ships. The honorable member would doubtless like to see all the money that we have for shipbuilding spent abroad. Perhaps he would like to see it spent in the shipbuilding yards of Hong Kong, where Chinese coolie labour is employed. </para>

                        <para>- It is regrettable that the shipbuilding industry of Australia has been allowed to languish. The Government should do everything in its power to stimulate this industry. Work should be provided for the Walsh Island Dockyard, as well as the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Many of my constituents work there in normal times. Hundreds of skilled mechanics, ironworkers, and men trained in shipbuilding are on the dole, because of the lack of encouragement to this industry. I believe that all the ships which trade on our coast should be built in Australia. The expenditure of the £36,000 necessary to complete the vessel under discussion is justifiable in every respect. The Government should prohibit vessels built overseas from trading on the Australian coast. I understand that this policy is enforced by the Government of the United States of America. We have placed a prohibitive duty on iron, steel, and certain other products, and there is no real reason why we should not prohibit foreign built ships from engaging in our coastal trade. The building of the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> proved conclusively that Australian workmen can build' ships equal to those built in any other part of the world. The workmen of Walsh Island are just as efficient as those of other dockyards in Australia. I do not place the workmen in one part of Australia on a higher plane than the workmen in other parts of it. We should encourage shipbuilding in Australia wherever it can be carried on. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> has referred to the administration of the War Service Homes Department. I believe that a comprehensive inquiry should be made into that subject. Money has been wasted, and many returned soldiers have been carelessly treated by the department. Many returned soldiers have got into serious arrears in their payments, because of intermittent work or unemployment. These men received very little consideration from the previous administration, in fact many of them were callously treated by it. The Minister at present controlling the department has shown more consideration for these men than was shown to them by his predecessors. The capital value of the war service homes should be reduced. Although the value of house property has fallen, the men who are purchasing war service homes are still being called upon to pay at the old high rates. I understand that a proposal has been made that their interest should be reduced by½ per cent. Such a reduction would be quite inadequate. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that they should be given a concession of another 1 per cent. Sometime ago I submitted for the consideration of the War Service Homes Commission, the case of Alderman Shakespeare, the mayor of Cessnock, who is a returned soldier. Although this gentleman has paid more than £300 off his home only approximately £110 has been allocated to the reduction of the principal; the remainder has gone in interest, sinking fund, insurance, &amp;c. This gentleman, lite many others in Cessnock, and on the coal-fields generally, suffered sixteen months unemployment, due to the lockout in the industry, which obliged him to fall behind in his payments. The men who enlisted for active service were promised all sorts of things; but to-day they are being treated more harshly by the War Service Homes Department than they would be treated if they were in occupation of privately-owned houses. Many returned men were ejected from their homes by the previous Government. </para>

                <para>Mr.MARR (Parkes) [4.11].- The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> has made some statements in respect of the administration of the previous government which are inaccurate. For instance, he said that the previous government had treated returned soldiers in occupation of war service homes with callous indifference. I emphatically deny that statement. The honorable gentleman also made some reference to the policy of the previous government in regard to dockyards. I point out that the Government which I had the honour to support, wrote down the capital cost of Cockatoo Island Dockyard from £12,000,000 to £4,000,000 with the object of assisting it to maintain its operations. It has been said that we should not allow any ships built overseas, to trade on the Australian coast. I point out to honorable members that even if we buy ships overseas, we can pay for them with our wheat and wool. It is not necessary for us to send money overseas in payment for them. We expect overseas countries to buy our primary products, and we must therefore be willing to buy other goods abroad. Reference has been made to the successful building in Australia of the cruisers <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide,</inline> but honorable members know very well that we could not roll a single plate required for those ships. We have also had to buy abroad the plates and many other parts required for the lighthouse ship now being built in Australia. We must realize that freedom in international trade is a big factor in the maintenance of world peace. We cannot expect people overseas to continue to buy our primary products if we flatly refuse to buy anything from them in return. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks)</inline> referred to the exchange aspect in regard to the lighthouse ship which we are now building, but that was not a factor when this order was placed. </para>

I agree with the honorable member only in regard to one type of machinery at Cockatoo Island; that of a special nature, to repair  turbines. I have known vessels to come to Australia which could not be accommodated at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. They have had to go to Mort's dockyard for attention. Why should not. those private concerns, which provide the sinews of  war,  be given an opportunity to compete with government-owned institutions? I make no objection to the Government calling tenders for the construction of * vessel, or for any other purpose. </para>

They omitted to refer to the fact' that a previous government let a contract for many thousands of pounds for the construction of ships to men who should have been gaoled for criminally defrauding the nation. I remind them of a vessel which was recently completed by private enterprise, and intended mr the New Guinea service. When it put to sea it was proved to be thoroughly unsatisfactory, and  it  had to be taken to Cockatoo Island Dockyard in order to be made seaworthy. Had that dockyard not been  in  existence, the money expended on that vessel would have been wasted. </para>

It is dangerous to continue it in commission. Yet that vessel will be purchased by private persons, and manned by foolhardy men, who will be forced to earn a living in that way. That should not be countenanced. </para>
                <para>Honorable members opposite have said hew much better it would be for the nation df the vessels which we require were constructed overseas- That policy was put into operation by the Bruce-Page Government, when it sent nearly  £6,000,000  to Great Britain to buy cruisers, at a time when "patriotic" British shipping companies were having the vessels that they needed built in Germany, by cheap labour, whilst British artisans were walking the streets unemployed. That is the kind of " national " spirit that animates honorable members opposite and those whom they champion. The Bruce-Page Government also purchased submarines that were constructed overseas, which could hardly make the journey to Australia, and which had to be reconditioned on arrival here. </para>
                <para>Australia has learned to its cost the folly of building bridges by contract, and it is now realized that if satisfaction is to follow, it is advisable to have our vessels built at our own dockyard. Even though the cost may be greater, and that is questionable, our own product ia reliable and seaworthy, and safeguards the lives of those who man it. Private enters prise turns out slummed work. It is only necessary to recall the South African war, when private munition makers sent consignments of rifles, to be used by our men, the bullets from which would bit anything except the object aimed at. </para>
                <para>It is for those very  definite reasons that I and my colleagues support work being given to our own dockyards. I hope that we shall no longer hear anti-Australian sentiments such as those expressed by honorable members opposite, when items of this nature come up for discussion. </para>

                    <para>. -In reply to a question that was asked  a  week or two ago, the Minister informed the House that at the 31st May last, 531 war service homes had reverted to the commission, 294 of which were occupied by tenants. The honorable gentleman told us that those homes had been vacated for various reasons. In some cases their former occupants had moved to cheaper homes; in others they had decided that, to meet changed economic circumstances, it was desirable to share a home with another family, or to live with their parents, and so save rent. The Minister drew attention to the splendid record of the occupants of war service homes in continuity of their payments. Even in these troublous times the arrears, I understand, are less than 2 per cent. What  I  wish to know now is exactly how those persons stand who for years occupied war service homes, paid their instalments regularly, but finally had to abandon them for any of the reasons detailed above. In the event of the commission finding other occupants for the houses they have left, or selling them, will they be reimbursed the instalments that they have paid? </para>

                    <para>. - I do not desire to delay the business of the House, I should not have participated in the debate had it not been for the remarks of certain honorable members opposite, who allege that the construction of a lighthouse steamer in Australia involves a waste of public money. They complain that the cost of £120,000 for that vessel is excessive, and that it could have been built overseas for £64,000. Before hon* orable members make such statements they should investigate the facts.. Au exhaustive inquiry was conducted into the construction of this lighthouse steamer, and numerous witnesses were examined, on oath, They included many practical men, well versed in shipbuilding. One naval expert was asked what this vessel should cost if constructed in Australia, and he answered about £96,626. A similar vessel constructed in England would cost £70,000, hut that would be the cost of the vessel at the dockyard, while £120,000 would be the cost of a vessel built here, and handed over to the Government. To the dockyard cost of a vessel built in Great Britain must be added the cost of exchange, which at the present rate, would work' out at between £20,000 and £22,000. It would cost another £6,000 or £7,000 to bring the vessel from England to Australia, and to repatriate its English crew. The committee which inquired into this matter had before it <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hastie,</inline> mechanical engineer in charge of ships in the Department of Public Works. In answer to a question by myself, he said that it would ordinarily cost between £6,000 and £7,000 to bring a vessel of this class from Great Britain to Australia. The difference of £50,000 between the cost of a vessel built overseas, and that of a similar vessel built here, would be partly accounted for by the fact that wages are higher here than in Great Britain. Taking British wages on a basis of 100, the index figure "for Australian wages, he said, was 187. Iron could be obtained in Great Britain direct from the mills. Seeing that the ship-building industry had yet to be established in Australia, he said that, in his opinion, it would be a good thing to have the ship built in this country, thus keeping the money here. The Australian artisan was just as good a workman as the overseas artisan. Australian workmen would be quite competent to handle such a job. I ask honorable members opposite whether Australian artisans are never to be taken into consideration when we are dealing with the expenditure of public money? The difference between the cost of getting a vessel overseas, and of building it here, is not worth consideration when we remember that by building the vessel here we shall be keeping the money, la </para>

During this  time,  when we are all asked to pull together for  the  benefit of the country, there should  be  no suggestion that Australian workmen should not benefit from the expenditure of Australian money on public undertakings. I support the proposal of the Government to spend Australian money in the employment of Australian workmen. </para>

                        <para>- If she is not, it is because of the conditions for which honorable members opposite stand, and which we have condemned this afternoon. Australia is an outpost of the British Empire, and of the white race in the Pacific. This continent which we occupy became ours largely as a result of the seamanship and courage of a very capable navigator, and I sometimes feel that the future possession by us of Australia will depend a great deal upon the capacity of our seamen. The Cockatoo Island Dockyard is the only one of its kind in this portion of the Pacific. I do not think that even on the American Pacific coast is there a dockyard to equal it. Proposals for the building of ships at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard should be considered, not wholly in the light of relative costs compared with dockyards overseas,  but  in the light of the desirability of maintaining such a valuable institution as this dockyard. If we are to consider shipbuilding and other industries only in the light of relative costs, why trouble about paying bounties and subsidies to private manufacturers to encourage Australian enterprise? Ifit costs more to build ships at Cockatoo Island Dockyard than we could buy them for overseas, we can at least regard the extra cost as something in the nature of a bounty to ourselves to encourage ship-building in Australia. One honorable member stated that the Cockatoo Island Dockyard was not subject to taxation, and for that reason was not working on the same basis as private enterprise. We should not overlook the fact, however, that no privately owned dockyard in Australia is required to carry such high grade equipment, or such extensive, expensive plant, and this offsets any advantage which the institution might derive from the nonpayment of taxes. Moreover, the government dockyard is not allowed to compete with private enterprise, although there are a hundred and one ways in which it might do useful national work. This dockyard should be regarded as a national institution of vital importance. Honorable members opposite, who have condemned the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, were strongly in favour of the construction by the British Government of a naval dockyard at Singapore; but it is characteristic of them that they should oppose anything of a similar character which is in the interests of Australian nationhood. Sufficient has been said by some members on this side of the House about the good work at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, but I am justified in touching upon it because I represent an electorate in which there reside, thousands of former employees of the yard now unfortunately unemployed, and some of the present employees. Thework done by this dockyard is of national importance, and since we have it and its valuable equipment, is it not sound policy for the Government to maintain it at full working capacity? Steps should be taken to enable the dockyard to compete with private enterprise. As a matter of fact, private yards very often turn to the Cockatoo Island Dockyard for assistance in their work which their plants are unable to handle. I understand that Cockatoo Island Dockyard is prohibited from doing private work because of an interpretation of the High Court involving a constitutional issue given in regard to the Bunnerong power house. Consideration of pounds, shillings, and pence should not be the determining factor in matters of this kind. In regard to shipping, perhaps more than in any other form of commercial enterprise, callous trafficking in human life has, in the past, been practised. It is only necessary to recall the splendid work done by Plimsoll, and how it took him long years of noble public-spirited effort before he could induce the House of Commons to safegard the lives of those who travel on the seas by requiring ship-owners to refrain from overloading their vessels. As a result of his work on behalf of humanity, in opposition to the grasping commercialism of the ship-owners, we are now all familiar with the Plimsoll mark which may be seen on every ship that sails the seas. I trust that the Government may be able to find more work for the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, so that, in addition to keeping the splendid mechanical equipment in full operation, the services of the skilled workmen and officers now and formerly attached to the yard may be fully availed of. The Government, in many instances, went to the expense of sending officers to acquire skill in. special work, and it is a tragedy that men possessing technical skill and experience of the highest order, should be turned adrift merely because it costs a little more to build ships in Australia than abroad. </para>

I have no objection to the money being voted; I am merely seeking information. I find myself in disagreement with one or two speakers who have castigated the "War Service Homes Department for its administrative methods. I can only say - and I oiler this testimony with pleasure - that so far as my own experience goes, I have had nothing but satisfaction from the department. In many instances, families have been saved from calamity by the sympathetic and generous consideration extended to them by the Ministers in charge of the department, during the last few months, and their officers. Such action should be recognized, and, on behalf of my constituents and myself, I express deep gratitude to thedepartment. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire certain particulars regarding the policy carried out generally by the department in connexion with the insurance of war service homes. I wish to know the total amount that has been paid by occupants of war service homes in insurance premiums up to the present time, the amount paid out in connexion with losses from fire and other causes, the amount now standing to the credit of the fund, and also the conditions under which the insurance premiums are paid. I am of the opinion that this fund  is  becoming large, and the experience of the last few years should have convinced the department that it is now in  a  position to reduce the premiums which the occupants are called upon to pay. Many  exsoldiers  have told me that the amount charged is excessive for the type of bouse they occupy, in view of the care exercised by them. Will the Minister inform me whether it is possible to reduce the premiums? </para>

                    <para>.- The budget proposals of the Treasurer contemplated  a  reduction of½ per cent. in the interest on advances for war service homes, and I wish to know whether an amendment of the act is necessary to give effect to the reduction. If so, when will the amending bill be brought down, and will it be passed before Parliament rises? I assume that an amendment is necessary, because the War Service Homes Act prescribes the rate of interest as 5 per cent. I object, formally, to discrimination under the Government's policy with regard to the reduction of interest upon war service homes advances compared with advances to soldier settlers. In the latter case the reduction is to he 1 per cent. It has been contended that as the Government bears the cost of the administration of war service homes the reduction in interest should be less in that instance; but I believe that this advantage is more than counterbalanced by the large amount that has been written off advances to soldier settlers. It seems to me that it would be equitable to reduce the rate charged to the occupants of war service homes by 1 per cent.  When  the rate was fixed at 5 per cent., the borrowing rate that the Government had to pay was considerably lower than it has been in recent years, and it would be equitable to make a similar reduction in both instances. I should like to know when the reduction will be effected, and how it is proposed to bring it about. Is an amendment of the act necessary, and will the reduction take place from the beginning of this month,  as  in the  case  of other reductions? </para>

                    <para>. -  About some of the matters which have been mentioned by  honorable members, I cannot at present supply the information that has been asked for: but I shall obtain it and supply it either at a later stage, or subsequently by letter. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> raised the subject of ejectments from war service homes. Since the present Government assumed office no ejectments have occurred in cases where the occupant is unemployed. When ejectment has been found necessary, this cause has been taken as the result of inquiries, and in the opinion of the department and the Minister the occupant has been in a position to make the payments required of him. The payments required for the purchase of war service homes generally are lower than those required as rental for similar houses anywhere in Australia. That is one of the reasons why the interest rate on these homes has .not been reduced to the same extent as the rate charged by private lenders is expected to be reduced. The rate originally charged to ex-soldiers was very much lower than that for which private enterprise would look as a reasonable return from an investment of this character. It must be remembered, too, that during the recent boom period private landlords received very much higher rentals for similar houses than have been charged for war service homes, and consequently private rentals are subject to greater fluctuations than payments under contracts entered into for the purchase of war service homes. I am informed by my predecessor, the  Hon.  Parker Moloney, that arrangements have been made for the reduction of the payments on these homes in conformity with the reduction of wages, and, therefore, no hardship will be inflicted then. In all the cases that have come before me in which a purchaser is out of employment, not one has been ejected; but in certain cases occupants of these homes have been in receipt of from £4 4s. to £5 12s., and even £6 a week, and yet have been in arrears in their payments over a period of years. I submit that it is unfair to those occupants who meet their payments regularly to allow others to escape their liabilities. The rate of interest at which the money has been provided for the building of these homes is low, a long term of years is allowed for the completion of the pur-  chase, and the payments are in consequence relatively small. Thus, the occupier after he has lived in his house for a certain number of years, will become its owner, although his payments will have been less than would have been required to rent a similar house from a private owner. In the latter case, at the end of the period, he would have no equity in the property. </para>

Cameron),</inline> I may say that no case of re-possession of the kind he referred to has come under my notice up to the present time. The usual arrangement in regard to the purchase of war service homes is a hire purchase agreement; the purchaser does not acquire an equity in his home until such time as the property has been paid for. In the great majority of cases where the account is considered unsatisfactory the amount of arrears would exceed the purchaser's equity in the house. In making that statement I am guided by the particulars that have been placed before me regarding the contracts; the amount in arrears and the amounts paid off the principal. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member will bring such cases under my notice, I shall be pleased to look into them. I would point out that in the early years of the repayments most of the money represents interest on the capital; very little goes to the reduction of the principal. It is only in the later years of the contract, after 50 per cent, or more of the principal has been repaid, that the greater part, of the annual payment is applied to the reduction of the principal, a relatively small amount being required for the interest payments. If the purchaser of a war service home undertakes to buy on the rent purchase system he has no equity in the property until he has paid off the whole debt. If an occupant has a title to his home as a mortgagor to the department, he has the usual rights of a mortgagor, and in that case the usual mortgagor's equity. In the case of foreclosure, if there were a surplus when a house was re-sold, it would be paid over to him, but he would be liable for the payments due to the department up to the date on which the home was relinquished. We have had cases in. which the occupants have walked out of their houses, leaving the department to find out that the house had been vacated; but these, of course, are hopeless cases, and are not, I presume, of the kind the honorable member for Brisbane has in mind. </para>

It has cost the States a considerable sum for administration, and they havewritten off large amounts for losses incurred in connexion with soldier settlement. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> referred to evictions. I assure him that none have  taken place under my administration in caseswhere the purchaser is unemployed. It is very difficult at times to know what to do with some of the occupants of these houses. In quite a number of cases the departmentwrites to the occupier for an explanation of arrears, and the letters are absolutely ignored. Sometimes the purchaser can not be seen, and the officers of  the  department, after vainly trying to make contactwith him, interview his wife who can give no satisfactory explanation. Because of such conduct, action has to be taken by the department to bring a number of these people to a sense of their responsibilities, but the policy of the </para>
                <para class="block">Government is that no final action shall be taken without the matterbeing referred to the Minister. I assure honorable members that, if any complaint of hardship is made to them because of action threatened by the department,I shall be prepared to let them have all the facts. I feel certain that there is a good deal of misunderstanding about these cases. We all have had experience of some complainants whowrite to honorable members, but state only half the facte. A few days ago I had to dealwith a man who is in receipt of a salaryof approximately £20 a week who will not pay his installments regularly and has ignored the demands of the department. Is it reasonable that the Government should be involved in the trouble and expense of continuallywriting to this person to require him to fulfil his obligations? If hewill not do the right thing, the department has no alternative but to evict him. </para>

                    <para>. - The new vessel for the lighthouse service, to be christened the <inline font-style="italic">Cape Otway,</inline> is to be used on the north and north-west coasts. What the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lacey)</inline> has said of theKyogleis quite correct. Because of her small bunker capacity, supplies of coal must be sent forward. This makes the vessel very costly to work, and altogether unfit for long voyages. The <inline font-style="italic">Cape Otway</inline> will be finished in September, and, therefore, the debate on the expenditure incurred in connexion with it is too late to have any effect. When comparing the price quoted by the Cockatoo Dockyard with the  cost at which a similar vessel could be built elsewhere, honorable members must take into account the large overhead costs at the dockyard, which the Government would have to meet in any circumstances. Making allowances for that factor, the work done there is cheaper than the actual figures indicate. TheCape <inline font-style="italic">Otway</inline> is a first-class job, and equal to any vessel of her class. </para>

                    <para>.- The losses on the railway systems of Australia are one of the main causes of the huge deficits with which the various governments are confronted. Therefore, the Government should eliminate all expenditure that can possibly be avoided. The total revenue of the Commonwealth rail-; ways is only £334,000, and on top of the. huge expenditure for operating, management and maintenance, we are asked to find for new works £57,000,  or  approximately one-sixth of the total revenue of the system. The actual loss upon that railway system will be over £750,000. I know that many items of expenditure are absolutely essential, but the proposed expenditure upon the Commonwealth railways this year represents one-sixth of the total revenue from that source. The position is becoming more serious year by year. </para>

                    <para>. -  In reply to the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> I understand that approximately half of the sum provided under this item will be utilized for ballasting purposes. We regret that it is impossible to make available a larger sum towards the improvement of the line and the provision of employment. The Railways Commissioner has informed me that as soon as money is provided he can give employment to a number of men on ballasting. This Government, in common with other Governments of Australia, has little money at its disposal. In fact all Governments, including that of New South Wales, are endeavouring to arrange with the financial institutions of this country for assistance. The expenditure covered by this item is to be provided out of revenue, and its allocation must necessarily be left to the Commissioner of Railways. He must at all times keep a certain sum in reserve for unexpected expenditure, such as in connexion. with washaways and breakdowns. The Leader of the Opposition- <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has referred not only to the loss sustained on the railways, but also to the proportion which this expenditure bears to the total revenue from the railways. I respectfully point out to him that the party with which he is now associated did a most idiotic thing when it paid a subsidy of £30,000 to a company to enable it to run an air service in competition with the Trans-Australian railway. That action has resulted in a loss of many thousands of pounds to the Commonwealth railways. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member would be one of the first to object if the Government tried to break the contract that was entered into between the Bruce-Page Government, which he supported, and Western Australia ' Airways. This Government cannot be blamed for the loss caused by the action of its predecessor. No doubt the Bruce Page Government, in giving that subsidy, had good intentions. Its revenues were booming, and it evidently considered that it was justified in encouraging this branch of aviation. </para>

                    <para>.- Earlier in the afternoon, I referred to the scant consideration that had been given to the claims of Tasmania for communication with the mainland. I pointed out that Tasmania is the only State in the Commonwealth which is not linked with the other States by telephonic communication. In 1928, the then Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> stated  in his  policy speech that communication with Tasmania was woefully inadequate. Let me say that it has not improved since then. If anything, it is worse. The right honorable gentleman also stated that it was the responsibility of the Commonwealth to provide interstate communication, and he pledged himself, if his party were successful at the election, to install an efficient line of communication between the State and the mainland. </para>

                <para>Federal Parliament. I consider that Tasmania has been badly let down. Definite promises were made, and no effort has been made to carry them out. I wish to be fair. I am not unmindful of the financial embarrassment of the Government to-day. Tasmania is prepared to bear its fair share of sacrifice, and it has tacitly agreed to the postponement of an improved steamship communication. But it does object to the manner in which this Government has brushed aside its promise to provide telephonic communication between Tasmania and the mainland. That proposal was submitted to and recommended by the Public Works Committee. On the 25th of June last, I asked the Minister the following question : - </para>

                    <para>In view of the cessation of the aerial mail service between the mainland and Tasmania, and the inability of the Government to subsidize the service in order that it may be continued, and also in view of the fact that Tasmania has to rely during the winter months on the equivalent of three mails per week, will he cause the work of linking up Tasmania by telephonic communication, as recommended by the Public Works Committee, to be put in hand with the least possible delay? </para>

                <para>Subject to Parliament approving of the recommendation of the Public Works Committee, the work will be proceeded with as early as the financial position permits. The department realizes the importance of the service, and is anxious that it should be established as early as practicable. </para>
                <para class="block">My complaint is that Parliament has not been given an opportunity to express its opinion whether telephonic communication should bc given to Tasmania in the same way as it has been given to the other States. We are isolated; we have no aerial service, because of the inability of the Government to subsidize one. We have to suffer the inconveniences of a curtailed shipping service during the winter months. Yet we are an integral part of the Commonwealth. The northern part of the State has a mail delivery three times a week - Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, and the southern part has three deliveries a week - Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays. Since Tasmania has tacitly agreed to the postponement of an improved shipping service, I suggest that the Government might give favorable consideration to the pro vision of telephonic communication with the mainland. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Guy)</inline> has put forward the case for Tasmania. Let me remind him that that State would now be enjoying telephonic communication had it not been for the action of his leader and himself, among others, in opposing in caucus proposals that were designed to provide the Government with sufficient funds to finance that and other works. The honorable member and his leader are, therefore, responsible to a great extent for Tasmania's present position. They held back in the traces when we were fighting in the caucus room for the adoption of proposals to finance the Government's activities. The honorable member voted in favour of the continuation of the orthodox method of finance. He fell down on his job. While he sticks to his present policy Tasmania will continue to have only three mail deliveries a week, and inadequate communication with the mainland. The worse the depression becomes, the greater will be the curtailment of Tasmanian services, and the policy endorsed by the honorable member has tended towards deepening the depression. </para>

                        <para>- In his enthusiasm to defend the Government, the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> will say almost anything. He has been a Minister, and must know that the money is, presumably, to come out of the £550,000. I have no desire to raise the issue of city versus country; I do not believe that their interests are in opposition. In my opinion, all sections of the community should pull together for the common good; but I protest against anything being spent on providing improved postal and telephonic facilities in city and suburban areas, while facilities which have been enjoyed in country areas for the past 50 or 60 years are being taken away. If it is necessary that men and women should go into the outer areas, and, in the interests of national development, endure hardships of which city dwellers have no conception, the Government should at least help them to the extent of providing adequate postal and telephonic facilities. It should certainly not take away any of the facilities they now enjoy. An adequate telephone service is essential in the outback, where it is generally the only means by which medical aid can be summoned in urgent cases. In the past the department followed the laudible policy of steadily improving country services; but it has now reversed that policy, and is whittling those services away. Where there was a mail service on three days a week, it is being reduced to two, and bi-weekly services are being reduced to weekly services. Sometimes mail services are being cut out altogether. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to join in the appeal to the Minister for more sympathetic consideration for country districts, particularly in respect to telephone and postal services. I am inclined to think that the Minister and his department are expecting the country people to bear more than their share of the general sacrifice demanded at the present time. Some honorable members have much more serious complaints to make than I have, and, for my part, I desire to pay a tribute to the  Deputy  Director of Posts and Telegraphs and the officers of his department in Queensland for the consideration they have extended to representationsI have made from time to time.I believe, however, that there is a general feeling throughout country districts in Queensland that the Government is not so sympathetic towards their interests as they have a right to expect. Telephone and mail services mean much to the people in the remote areas, and economies should not bear with undue weight upon country residents. The Minister should keep in mind the sacrifices which country residents are already making by virtue of their residence in isolated areas. </para>

A sum of £2,500,000 was appropriated for work of this kind, and if definite amounts were allocated for specific undertakings, what has been done with that money? The Minister has stated that, of the sum of £2,500,000 appropriated, only £1,288,114 has been spent, which leaves over £1,200,000 unexpended. Honorable members are entitled to some information as to bow that money has been disposed of. If it has been diverted to other uses, by whose authority was that done? </para>

                    <para>. Honorable members representing country electorates have, of late, been besieged with protests from their constituents against the reduction of postal and telephone services. Departmental economies have been effected in the country to a greater extent than in the cities. I join with those who have already protested against this policy. The district which I represent has been well treated by the Postal Department in the past. That, perhaps, was because, when the big scheme for improving postal facilities was inaugurated, the member representing my electorate happened to be also Postmaster-General, and, no doubt, he was impressed with the need for increased facilities in country areas. Though my electorate benefited then, it is now suffering from the reversal of that policy, and country residents are being asked to make more than their fair share of  the  sacrifices required. Many suburban districts are still enjoying daily mail deliveries, while residents of country districts have to be content with a delivery once every fortnight. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not propose to allow to pass unchallenged the remarks of the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> about the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Guy) and myself. The honorable member for Werriwa declared that  we were  largely responsible for Tasmania not having adequate shipping communication with the mainland, because we opposed financial plans that would have made that possible. At the time there was no money available to enable the Government to inaugurate that service. The honorable member and those associated with him who demand that everything should be built in Australia endeavoured to force upon the Government an expenditure of at least £1,500,000 to provide the necessary shipping service. Naturally, I opposed that, and all the other stupid monetary propositions that have emanated from the honorable member. The Commonwealth Treasurer placed that scheme before the Tasmanian people at the last State election, and the very persons who desired the service rejected the proposal of the honorable gentleman, so that I am in line with the people of Tasmania when I refuse to accept the project. I hope that, in the near future, the Government will endeavour to help Tasmania in that regard. "When a member of the Government I did all that  I  could in the matter, and I give the Government credit for helping me along reasonable and sound lines. However, I know the financial position of the Government, and realize that it cannot do the impossible. </para>

As a result of the establishment of telephonic communication between Australia and other countries, every State in the Commonwealth can now communicate with practically every other part of the world, with the exception of Tasmania. Every city and town in the Commonwealth is linked up by telephone, with the exception of those in the island State of Tasmania. I join the honorable member for Bass in urging that it is not too much to ask that that State should be brought into line with the rest of the Commonwealth in this matter. </para>

                <para class="block">Chatswood, Kogarah, Petersham, Sydney General Post Office, and the Sydney Parcels Post Office, while new buildings are to be erected at Corowa, Edgecliff, Sydenham, and theWynyard Square and Town Hall railway stations involving an expenditure of £550,000. It is most unfair to do that at the expense of country residents. Both my predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton,</inline> and I have urged that an official post office should be erected at Cardiff, but our representations have always met with a refusal. My request that a public telephone should be established at Pelton was also rejected. At any time one of the miners might meet with an accident, and it is necessary to have telephonic communication in order to call medical assistance promptly. Warner's Bay is also in need of a public telephone, while I have urged that there should be an extension of the postal delivery at Birmingham Gardens. That has been refused. The postman goes along one side of the street, but will not deliver letters on the other side because it is out of the 1-mile radius. </para>
                <para>Since this Government assumed office it has spent a considerable amount of money in advertising, urging the people " to do it by 'phone ". Yet, when requests are made for the installation of a public telephone which would produce revenue, they have been refused, " financial stringency " being urged as an excuse. I specifically cite the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burden,</inline> Coal Point, Toronto, who isagreeable to pay a reasonable charge for the installation of a telephone which could be used for business purposes. The department indicated that they would install the instrument if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burton</inline> paid for the erection of the necessary telephone posts. TheKurri Kurri Golf Links also need a telephone installed at the golfhouse. That application was refused, on account of the " adverse financial position ". Last Monday I interviewed the  Deputy  Director of Post and Telegraphs in Sydney, who stated that if the club were willing to pay £30 for the cost of erecting the necessary telephone poles, the telephone would be installed. What a tragedy! Every facility is given to metropolitan and suburban districts, at the expense of country districts. When people are prepared to pay the rental and calls for a telephone service, their needs should be supplied. This proposed vote of £550,000 should be divided, with the object of having half the money spent in the metropolitan areas and half spent in the rural areas, including the Hunter electorate. Instead of that the money is to be utilized for the improvement of city services which are already better catered for than the country. </para>

                </continue><para>Mr.RIORDAN (Kennedy) [6.5].- I notice that while a considerable amount has been provided in these Estimates for postal buildings in New South Wales, nothing is being provided for work of this description in Queensland. One can find a post office in nearly every street in our capital cities, but there are  many country settlements without post offices. The department has refused application after application for the establishment of a post office at the new settlement of Chewko, in Queensland, where 150 people are engaged in tobacco cultivation. The same is true of other places. People are encouraged to go out into the unsettled areas with the object of doing developmental work, but are denied the ordinary facilities of civilized life. Many people in my electorate are living seven or eight miles away from <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> post office. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> has complained because the department requires a golf club in his electorate to erect a couple of poles before it will grant telephonic facilities. In Queensland, many poles and miles of telephone wire have been erected at the Cost of the applicants for telephonic facilities. It appears to me that while the officials of the Postmaster-General's Department are expert in regard to automatic telephones and city postal facilities, they know very little a,bout the needs of country districts. Not only is the department refusing to grant applications for new post offices, but it is closing up offices already in existence. </para><para>At Mein, in the division of Herbert, the post office has been closed, although 75 or 80 people live in the settlement. Post offices at Millaa Millaa, Malanda, Mount Isa, and Hughenden, in North Queensland, require new buildings. It is high time that more attention was given to the postal and telegraphic needs of the country. The present policy is causing decay in country districts. </para><para>Money has been voted on the Estimates for several years for a new post office at Hughenden, but I have tried in vain to get the department to out the work in hand. The other day I received a letter to the effect that a person who had stepped on the verandah of the present post office building there with the intention of entering the office disappeared through the floor. At Hughenden, electricity is used to light all the private houses and business premises; but a person who desires to use the public telephone there has to take a friend along with him to light matches to enable him to find the number he wants in the tele phone directory. It is high time something was done to build new post offices at these places. </para><para>It is true that on my representations the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> when he was Postmaster-General, provided a hurricane lamp for the people at Tolga, but" they had to supply their own kerosene, and when the glass of the lamp was broken on one occasion, they had to provide  a  new glass for it. I have been told by honorable members who represent other districts that I was lucky to get even  a  hurricane lamp. </para><para>In these .circumstances I cannot feel any enthusiasm about  a  proposal to spend a lot of money on  a  new post office  at  Wynyard Square, and other city centres, in expectation of the completion of the underground railway system. Half of this money should be spent in country centres. I hope the Government will revise its policy, with the object of granting better facilities to country districts. </para></speech>

                    <para>.- I regret that provision has not been made on these Estimates for the provision of telephonic communication between Tasmania and the mainland. Tasmania is an integral part of the Commonwealth, and its people are just as much entitled to proper means of communication with the other States as are the people of a mainland State entitled to proper means of communication with the people of another mainland State. When it was proposed to ask the Public Works Committee to report upon the provision, of telephonic communications between Tasmania and the mainland, the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> said that there was very little hope of this Government giving effect to any report that the committee might make.  His  statement has been borne out by experience. It is perhaps hopeless to ask the Government to do anything immediately to provide Tasmania with adequate means of communicating with the mainland, because the financial position of the Commonwealth is so unsatisfactory; but I must voice my protest against the treatment that has been meted out to this State. It would be of immense benefit to the  business  interests of Tasmania if  tele  phonic communications  between  that State and the mainland were provided. I sincerely hope, therefore, that the pre-election promise of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> in this connexion  will  be fulfilled as soon as possible. </para>

Only to-day I received a refusal of a request for the provision of a letter-box near an ambulance station in my electorate. The granting of increased postal facilities should not be confined to the capital cities. </para>

                        <para>- I asked the Minister if he would state the intention of the Government with regard to the equipment of radio stations. . Some time ago a definite policy was laid down with a view to establishing a chain of radio stations throughout the Commonwealth, not only in the cities, but also in country towns. Owing to lack of funds it become necessary to cancel orders given overseas for the supply of the requisite equipment. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> will recollect that some of the trade unions complained at the time that this equipment should be manufactured in Australia. I believe that a number of deputations waited on the Minister, and asked him to reconsider the matter, so that Australian firms might be permitted to manufacture the equipment. I think that the honorable member  for  Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge)</inline> caused a stir when he requested that the details of the overseas tender be made available. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> is smiling  at  my remarks. He, no doubt, remembers the controversy that occurred on this subject. The sum of £550,000 is now being voted for new works, and the provision of radio stations and equipment is included among them. If the overseas contracts have been cancelled, is it intended to develop, even on a less ambitious scale than the original scheme, a chain of radio stations, and will the work be given to local manufacturers ? Wireless broadcasting promises to be of the utmost importance to Australia. If the people in the country are to be denied telephonic facilities, why not compensate them to some extent for that loss by the provision of more radio stations? </para>

I do not quarrel with the expenditure of money on road-making generally; but, once again, I complain that a particular State has been picked out for road construction out of federal funds. Other roads in New South Wales and in other States are equally in need of repair or reconstruction. I notice that a further sum of £8,000 is providedfor the Canberra-Goulburn road. If the work is to be done within the Federal Capital Territory, I have no complaint; but, if the money is to be spent outside the Territory, I submit that the vote should not be allowed. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that in no circumstances will the Government devote Commonwealth money for the maintenance of the Canberra Yass road. I travelled over it recently, and found it to be in much better order than most country roads in Australia. If an honorable member wants the road that leads to and from his own -home put in first class order, I hope that the Minister will pay no heed to his request. When the Minister replies to the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton,</inline> regarding the Canberra-Goulburn road, I hope that he will be able to give some indication whether the present vote of  £8,000  for that road will be sufficient to put it in permanent order, apart from ordinary maintenance costs. The vote last year was  £71,305,  of which only  £34,215  has been spent. If the additional vote of  £8,000  is sufficient to complete the road, the work will be carried out much more economically than was anticipated. I support what has been said by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> about the profligate extravagance involved in building fine highways through country where there is very little traffic, and where the roads benefit chiefly local traffic, or, at most, the traffic of only one State. I hope that in addition to explaining the meaning of the item of  £54,000  for miscellaneous works and services, he will give an indication of the object of the further vote of  £21,000  that appears under a similar heading. The total vote for the Federal Capital Territory amounts to  £90,500,  and that is  a  big sum to be spent in  a  few square miles of country such as this Territory. There is not much evidence in Canberra of work in progress, or of works that ought to be carried out. So far as one can see, Canberra is already overbuilt. Even if it is considered impracticable to turn the place over to better use,  it should,  at any rate, be allowed to lie fallow for a while. We should not  permit it  to consume too great  a  portion of the taxes which are so hard to find in the taxpaying parts of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. -  The amount of  £21,000  to  be  expended in the Federal Capital Territory, under the control of the Department of Home Affairs, includes  £2,000  for parks and gardens to complete sections partially planted and to provide replacements - this is practically a re-vote; and  £14,500  for forestry. The whole of this amount will  be  expended on unemployment relief. In the Federal Capital Territory  we  have been able to date to avoid paying the dole to residents, by giving intermittent employment on reproductive works; only to the travelling unemployed is the dole paid. The expenditure on afforestation may be regarded as definitely reproductive, because it will return an hundredfold to the people  30  or  40  years hence. Meanwhile, it provides much work for the unemployed, because  99  petr cent, of the amount is absorbed in labour. </para>

                        <para>- A few specimens are growing in the Yarralumla plantation, but there neither the altitude nor the rainfall is sufficient. Improvements to  farm  houses, dairies, fencing, &amp;c, will absorb  £2,500,  but these properties are tenanted and yield a return to the Commonwealth. Of the miscellaneous works and services under the control of the Department of Works, architectural and engineering services account for  £11,500  and  £43,100  respectively. The engineering services include an extension of the Western Creek sludge beds at a cost of  £1,750;  sundry minor water supply works to cost  £2,000,  and the duplication of the pumping plant at the Cotter river. The estimated expenditure of £10,250 represents a revote of last year's item, which has not been expended owing to delay in the  delivery  of the electrical plant, plus an amount to cover the adverse exchange. </para>

                        <para>- The last Government was notoriously prodigal. The Canberra-Yass road within the Territory is in fair condition; the maintenance of it beyond the federal boundary is the  responsibility  of the Main Roads Board of  New  South Wales, which has gazetted it as a main road. Having travelled over that road recently, I can confirm the statement of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cusack)</inline> that if is in a shocking state. The Commonwealth has done its share  by  making a grant of money to the State for expenditure on roads, but the Main Roads Board apparently, has not been able to spare money for this particular work. </para>

                    <para>For the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works £1,709 is provided, and for the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, £1,461. These committees are entirely unnecessary at the present time, and their operations should be suspended. Here is scope for legitimate economy without inflicting hardship on anybody. At a time when we are reducing pensions and the salaries of public servants, because of the dire needs of the nation, it seems to me that Parliament will render itself liable to just criticism if it continues these two standing committees with their concomitant expenses when there is no work for them to do. There are no urgent works upon which the Public Works Committee can be asked to report, and in any case, no money is available for expenditure; therefore, we should avoid the cost of this peripatetic body. For the time being, at any rate, we can dispense with the services of the Public Accounts Committee also. The work that it might do could be transferred to departmental accountants and other officials. I submit that an economy in expenditure of at least £6,000 could be legitimately effected  without doing any injustice to the Public Service or of impairing its efficiency in any way. </para>

                        <para>As the questions asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> were not put until the 2nd July, it is hard to understand what the  Speaker  means to convey when he says that the last price quoted by the Department of Works was too high, when, as a matter of actual fact, the prices paid to the Department of Works during June was in the case of coke 6s. per ton less than that paid to the contractor from the 1st July, and with coal, although on paper the price is the same, as you can see above the department supplies best Maitland coal against the contractor's inferior Happy Valley coal, which the department would supply at £2 7s. 3d., or4s. 9d. less than the contractor's price. </para>
                        <para>Even admitting the answers given by the  Speaker  to be correct, the figures supplied show that a saving on coal of1s. per ton net was secured, but a gift of6s. per ton net was made to the contractor in the case of coke, and when it is pointed out that twelve tons of coke are supplied per week approximately, against only one ton of coal, where is the  economy effected, and God knows, we hear, enough about economy when they are sacking some poor worker from his job. </para>
                        <para>In view of the statement by the  Speaker  that the contractor will make due allowance for any variation in prices on the market for coal and coke, I would .point out that at the very moment that the Joint House Department »vas making this present of (is. per ton for coke to the contractor, the department was supplying to the hotels  and public offices from' the 1st July coke for £2 17s. net, and coal £2 lis. per ton net, delivered, and if the Secretary of the Joint House Department had so desired, he could, on inquiry from the Controller of Stores, have arranged for supplies at the same prices. Yet by correspondence, this officer advised the Controller -of Stores that ho had mode an arrangement highly satisfactory to the Joint House Department. </para>
                        <para>With regard to the assistance to unload Government lorries stressed by the  Speaker,  it ' is necessary to point out that this is not always given, and neither is it required, and even when given  it certainly involves the Joint House Department in no extra expense, because the employees of the Joint House Department are there in any case, and to use it as a lever to justify the giving of an order at Cs. per ton  more  (and on present figures 8s. per ton more) is from the point of view of economy, beyond my comprehension, and would seem to point to the fact that some hidden influence, in this particular instance, has been brought to bear on the Secretary of the Joint House Committee, .compelling  him  to ignore the instructions as laid down by the Auditor-General in connexion with the expenditure of public moneys. </para>
                        <para>On a basis of a supply of twelve tons of coke, and one ton of coal Pcr week average to the Joint House Committee, they are paying in the case of coke £4 16s, more, and for coal 4s. 9d. more, or a grand total of £5 Os. 9d. per week more for fuel to the contractor than they would be paying to the department at current rates. Further, if added to this is the loss of revenue to the Government's own lorries of £3 per week, it will be seen what a highly satisfactory arrangement this must be from the point of view of the Commonwealth Treasury, particularly as the plant and staff of the transport must remain the same in order to carry out efficiently transport services to the other departments. </para>
                        <para>In my previous communication to you under the above subject, I omitted to state that the contractor in question is not only an undischarged bankrupt, but is at the same time a real all-square-and-a-yard-wide Nationalist. </para>

                        <para>.- I again protest against the vote for the parliamentary refreshment-rooms, which involves an expenditure on wages amounting .to £3,750. Twelve months ago I contended that, as there were two  fullystaffed  government hotels within half a mile of Parliament House, members of this  and  another place should have their meals at those establishments. No reasonable argument can be advanced against the curtailment of this expenditure. Honorable members would be afforded an excellent opportunity of exercising themselves if they chose to make the short walk between here and either of the hotels that I have mentioned. </para>

                            <para>- And I am prepared to vote for this one. Honorable members should be equally logical, and assist me to save' the country at least £3,000 of this £3,750. I make no apology for ventilating this matter. The trouble is that honorable members believe that they are a privileged class, who can mulct the taxpayers as they will, provided that they are not found out. When I have mentioned the opportunity to effect this economy I have been told, " Oh, look at the prestige of the position !" I do not see anything derogatory in honorable members in going for their meals to either the Hotel Canberra or the Hotel Kurrajong. It has been said that all other parliaments have refreshment-rooms. I remind honorable members that in the State capitals there are no government-controlled hotels within half a mile of Parliament House. Some time ago we were promised that a report would be made regarding irregularities that were alleged to have occurred in connexion with the parliamentary refreshment-rooms. Why have we not seen that report? If wrong has been done, the transgressors should be punished. I notice that the grant in aid of the refreshment-rooms has fallen from £900 last year to £200 for the current financial period. What is the reason? Have economies been effected, or have leakages been stopped? We are entitled to know the truth. </para>

                    <para>I am glad that the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> had the courage to bring up certain matters which directly affect the taxpayers. The trouble in this Parliament is that if a person is game enough to try to expose expenditure that he believes to be unwarranted, he receives black looks, and sometimes has unkind words directed to him. I do not think that anybody can justify the continuance of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in times such as these, when retrenchments are being made all about us. It may be asked where the officers of that committee could be placed. There is a secretary, a very efficient man, who could be attached to the Income Tax Department to catch those who evade lodging returns, and the remainder of the staff of that committee could be satisfactorily placed in other positions. </para>
                    <para>Similar remarks may be applied to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the members of which sit for an hour or two before Parliamentmeets, and draw25s. for each sitting, in additionto their ordinary salaries. That sort of thing has been going on too long, and many of us have remained silent overlong. Now that it is imperative to effecteconomies whenever possible, the time has come to take a stand on these issues. Surely no one can defend the practice of honorable members who are in receipt of £800 or £900 a year being paid an additional 25s. for a sitting of a couple of hours, while waiting for Parliament to meet 1 This Government should take courage, and eliminate such anomalies. Last year the Public Accounts Committee drew almost double the estimated amount for travelling purposes. Its members visited South Australia and other States, and made inquiries that had been made many times before. I refuse longer to remain silent about such happenings. A man with any backbone must expose them, particularly when it is essential that we should make all reasonable economies. I know that if I move for the omission of any of these items, I shall not receive any support. </para>

                        <para>.- As the senior member of the Joint House Committee in this chamber,I feel it my duty to reply to the request for information that was made by the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill),</inline> and to the statements of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> and the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb).</inline> The present House Committee, which represents the interests of this House as well as of the other chamber, has been most painstaking in carrying out its duties. We have made every effort to effect economies. An investigation was made into the management and general conduct of the refreshment rooms, and while the report submitted did not specifically allege that anything illicit had been going on, it intimated that there was room for improvement in some directions, and that it should be possible to effect important economies. There was duplication of services in respect to the dining rooms, and this added to the cost. The work was re-organized so as to eliminate the duplication, and it is now being carried on more economically than ever before. This is disclosed in the Estimates, which show that the grant in aid has been reduced from £900 to £200. </para>

Honorable members can have no reason to complain regarding what has been accomplished by the House Committee. It was found that there were difficulties in the way of any drastic re-organization of the staff, because many of those employed are permanent officers. </para>

                            <para>- That is true, but that is another phase of the matter. Until a week or two ago, the classification covering these officers had not been approved or gazetted, and it was not possible to make any alteration in staffing arrangements until this had been done. The House Committee could only effect what economics were possible without interfering with the staff. Honorable members will agree that considerable savings have been effected without reducing efficiency. </para>

                        <para>.- This is an appropriate time to discuss items of expenditure in connexion with the Parliament. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> is to bo congratulated upon his reference to the two Parliamentary Standing Committees. Having been a member of the Public Works Committee for about nine years, I can vouch for the excellent services that it has performed, and for the thoroughness of its staff. While I was a member of the committee, I advocated that the number of its members should be reduced. On looking through the Estimates I find that the Public Works Committee has an office staff of a secretary, a clerk, and a messenger. The total sum set down for salaries is £1,224, while £485 is provided for contingencies, of which £400 is for travelling expenses, making a total of £1,709. In addition to that, £1,600 is provided for fees for members of the committee. In the vote for the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, provision is made for the salaries of a secretary and a clerk, totalling £891, which, with contingencies, £570, makes a total of £1,461, and in addition, £1,600 is provided for members' fees. I have the greatest respect for the members of both those committees, and I. believe that they do conscientious work. The honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> was slightly mistaken, because, if members of the committee do not attend the meetings, they do not draw fees. </para>

                            <para>- The point I wish to make is that those committees involve an expenditure of £6,370 per annum, and I think that, in these times of financial depression, the number of members on the committees should be reduced. The Works Committee now comprises nine members, and that is an unwieldy number. It is true that all the members do not regularly attend the meetings; but, if the number were reduced to five, the work would be done more expeditiously, and a considerable saving would be made. A similar remark applies to the Public Accounts Committee. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Angas has referred to the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms, and I endorse all that he has said. Oil previous occasions I have pointed out that the Government hotels in Canberra, which are fully staffed, could easily accommodate the members of  this Parliament with three meals a day and a bed. At the present time, members are supplied with bed and breakfast at the hotels, and the country is put to considerable expense in providing the other two meals at Parliament House. T favour closing the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms as a dining establishment, but making them available to members for morning and afternoon tea. It is absurd for the Government to provide meals at Parliament House and at the hotels as well. It involves a duplication of staff which is unwarranted. </para>
                    <para>I am glad that the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> has referred to the coal contract with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Sweetnam.  As a member of the House Committee, I know something of the circumstances under which that contract was let, and I commend that committee for accepting it as that has compelled the department to reduce its price. 1 understand that the difference between the price formerly charged by the department and that now quoted, amounts to 18s. a ton, owing to the huge overhead .expenses that had to be allowed for under commission control. The cost could be reduced by letting a contract for the coal required for government hotels and other public buildings, as well as for Parliament House. It has been said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sweetnam</inline> is employing non-union labour, but I know that that statement is not correct. I know nothing of the quality of the coal. If it is inferior I would not attempt to defend the contract, but I believe that the article supplied is giving full satisfaction. </para>

                        <para>.- Apparently some honorable members desire that the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms should be kept open for the supply of afternoon tea and liquor, because they do not patronize the refreshment rooms for lunch and dinner; but, if the services are to be reduced at all, I would advocate closing the rooms altogether. If the bar is to be kept open, and if tea is to be provided mornings and afternoons, as well as during all-night sittings, it would be more expensive than if the present arrangement were continued. Why should we cease providing luncheon and dinner because certain members do not take those meals at the </para>

                    <para>So long as it is understood that the proposed reduction of expenditure on the two Parliamentary Standing Committees is to be confined to the fees and travelling expenses of members of those committees, and that the present officers of those committees will not be jeopardized in their employment, I am prepared to accept the proposal for the present year. In normal times, when Commonwealth works are under construction in the different States, and, perhaps, also in the Mandated Territory, the services of these committees are most useful. Although I was a member of one of the committees for a couple of months only, I am of the opinion that, they do good work, and that a considerable sum has been saved as the result of their investigations. At the present time, however, when practically no Commonwealth works are in progress, and  when  pensions have been reduced, we should not provide £1,600 for each of these committees, so that their members may get a little extra pocket money to compensate them for the reduction of their ordinary allowance. I believe that these committees are often used for " buying off " the opposition of members to certain proposals, and that they were appointed originally for that purpose. I am well aware of the fact that, when the committees do not sit, the members do not draw fees. I am prepared to vote for a reduction of the expenditure on these1 committees for the present year, and for next year, if the depression continues, as it certainly will if the present Government remains in office, and pursues itf present policy. On this matter I find myself in the extraordinary position of being in entire agreement with the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill).</inline></para>

                            <para>-No. There is little or no work for the committee to do; but there is much scope for the Accounts Committee, which is empowered to initiate any inquiry which it deems fit. If the membership of these committees were limited to seven, or even five each, their work would be more efficiently and economically performed. The Accounts Committee has initiated many investigations. I see in this chamber several honorable members who were associated with me on that body, and I feel sure that none of us has any apology to offer for the work we did. But the conditions at the present time are exceptional, and as we have found it necessary to reduce even old age, invalid, and war pensions, we have an obligation to curtail, wherever possible, the expenditure connected with this Parliament. When the Works Committee was first established, accommodation was not available at Parliament House, Melbourne, and itleased offices in Collinsstreet. As the committee was divorced from the services and conveniences of Parliament House, the appointment of a special staff to assist it became necessary. Now, however, the committee is housed in this building, and as the services of the ordinary messengers are available, the retention of its own special messenger is not necessary. The Accounts Committee has never felt the need to appoint a messenger ; it has conducted its work with the aid of the secretary and a clerk, and if other services are required, the parliamentary messengers are called upon. We cannot dispense with the services of the officers of the Public Works Committee, but surely other employment can be found for them. I urge honorable members to vote for the reduction of the expenditure on these committees as an intimation to the Government that their membership should be reduced. I reiterate that these committees are necessary. Undoubtedly, the Public Works Committee has saved to the public Treasury many hundreds of thousands of pounds, and a similar claim might be made on behalf of the Public Accounts Committee. Nevertheless, the committees are unnecessarily large. Nineteen of the 111 members of this Parliament are appointed to the two committees. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> criticized the parliamentary refreshment rooms. I would not like to see them closed,but when the Government hotels in Canberra are unable to pay their way there is no need for the refreshment rooms to provide heavy meals. Afternoon teas and suppers might be continued, but as all honorable members live at the hotels, they should take their regular meals there. Such a change might deprive a few men on the Joint House staff of their positions, but at a time when we have to cut down the essential services of the community why should we retain to ourselves privileges which are not necessary, and are not availed of by very many honorable members? </para>

                            <para>- Only a small proportion of honorable members avail themselves of the refreshment rooms, but the expenditure upon them is almost as  great as if the majority patronized them. When we are reducing pensions and Public Service salaries, we should set our own house in order as an example to others. I have every sympathy with the amendment moved by the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb).</inline></para>

                        <para>.- Anybody listening to or reading some of the speeches that have been delivered on these Estimates would form the opinion that the members of the standing committees have laid themselves out to make as much money as possible by way of attendance fees and travelling expenses. One would think, also, that the critics had never been candidates for appointment to the committees. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member did not criticize the committees, but many of those who did have been candidates in the party rooms for election to them. There is no need for a definite motion to suspend the activities of the Public Works Committee. That body cannot conduct any investigation until this Parliament has referred a proposed work to it. In the absence of such a reference the committee does not function. As a matter of fact, the last meeting of the committee was held on the 19th April, and during this year only nine meetings of the full committee have been held. </para>

Of the £2,000 voted for the Public Works Committee in the last financial year, an unexpended balance of £1,100 was returned to the Treasury, notwithstanding that for fifteen meetings the committee drew no fees. Yet the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> and others suggest that the members of the committee are avaricious, and grasp at every penny. </para>

                            <para>- I shall explain that. Some of the amounts claimed as savings were, it is true, effected by the actual disapproval of the work and the consequent abandonment of the project. Such were the proposals to build a storage reservoir on the Queanbeyan river at a cost of £100,000, to construct dams for ornamental waters at Canberra at a cost of £912,481, and to provide wharfage facilities at Darwin at a coSt of £223,934. Other savings were brought about by the fact that after investigation the committee was able to suggest an alternative or an improvement to the proposed work. For instance, in respect of a proposal fo carry a water supply to the Flinders Naval Base, the committee, entirely ou its own initiative, suggested a source of  supply which, until then, had never been mentioned by Commonwealth or State engineers. This suggestion was adopted, and resulted in a direct saving to the Commonwealth of £61,000. By suggesting an alteration of the work proposed to be carried out in the remodelling of the Customs House, Sydney, a saving of £10,481 was made. By a modification of an elaborate air-conditioning plant suggested for the City West telephone exchange, Melbourne, a saving of a capital cost of £3,000, and an annual payment of £300 was effected. A similar saving was made in connexion with the automatic telephone exchange, Hobart. The report of the committee had the effect of delaying the work proposed to be carried out at the HendersonNaval Base, Western Australia, at an estimated cost of £4,529,109, and subsequent events showed that such work was unnecessary; but that is not claimed as an actual saving. Other instances of more frequent occurrence in which suggestions for small alterations or modifications, effecting savings of from £300 to £400, help to swell the total savings in fifteen years to £5,000,000. Apart from actual savings, the committee has been able at times to give valuable advice to the Government of the day. For instance, it insisted on the disposal of the sewage of Canberra at a point three miles outside the city when the designer of the Federal Capital was strongly in favour of the establishment of a number of septic tanks at various points within the city. On another occasion the inquiry of the committee into a contract for the construction of wooden ships for the Commonwealth led to the discovery of certain structural defects, which would have made the vessels unseaworthy, and endangered the lives of the crews. At the same time it relieved the Commonwealth from a liability of £135,200. Sometimes the advice of the committee has not been sought, and at other times its advice when sought has been unheeded, and perhaps the finances of the Commonwealth have suffered in consequence. Within the former category are the alterations to Yarralumla House to fit it for a residence for the Governor-General, and also the erection of the Prime Minister's house. Within the latter category is the erection of the </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable member, and the committee itself has, during the last twelve months, recognized that fact. Only recently a proposal to link Tasmania with the mainland by telephone connexion was referred to the committee, and, in the interests of economy, a sectional committee consisting of a senator who represents Tasmania, the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> in whose district it was proposed that one terminal of the telephonic link should be established, and myself, as  chairman  of the committee, was appointed to make the investigation. We inquired into the project and reported to the full committee. As a result of economies, there was an unexpended balance of special appropriation for the year of approximately £1,100. It is true that last year the committee held fifteen meetings in the final month of the financial year, but let me point out that had the committee postponed its work until after the 1st of July of that year it would have been able, because of the new appropriation, to draw additional fees. Most of the members attended every one of those fifteen meetings, and the position is quite the reverse of what has been stated here this afternoon. I agree that the personnel of the committees is too large, and that they could function properly with seven members each. I propose to move, as an amendment to the amendment of the honorable member for Angas - </para>

It  may be necessary for the committee te investigate any proposed works that are approved by the Premiers Conference to be held within a week or two.

                    <para class="block">This resolution has been introduced for the purpose of removing certain disabilities under which local petrol refineries have operated since the introduction of the resolution of March last. Certain amendments were then made to the items covering crude petroleum imported for distillation purposes, the object of which was to prevent the importation duty free of crude petroleum of high petrol content for distillation purposes. The Commonwealth Analyst had reported that certain crude petroleums at present being obtained in the United States of America were practically ready-made petrol, as they had a petrol content of 98 per cent. The March resolution fixed the limit of petrol content of crude petroleum at 35 per cent, for distillation purposes; but my departmental officers, after further inquiry, found that this percentage was too low, and recommended that the limit of petrol content be increased to 70 per cent. I decided, however, to refer this and other phases of the duties on petrol to the Tariff Board, which in due course endorsed the department's recommendation that the petrol limit be fixed at 70 per cent. This motion which I am moving gives effect to that recommendation. </para>
                    <para>The other amendments made to the March resolution by this motion are as follow : - </para>

The object is to remove the disabilities under which the local distilleries - the Commonwealth Oil Refineries and the Shell Refineries - have been operating since the 27th March. Thu amendments are substantially in accordance with the recommendations made by the Tariff Board. </para>

                    <para>The object of this motion is to amend the rates operating under certain tariff items in order to give effect to preferences to Canada under the Canadian trade agreement. But opportunity is also being taken by the introduction of the motion to include five other items which are urgently in need of amendment. </para>
                    <para>The items which are being amended for Canadian trade agreement purposes are Nos. 291 (i) and (j), which cover timber for use in the manufacture of boxes and cases. On undressed timber in sizes not less than 4 in. by 3 in. the British preferential and intermediate tariffs are being reduced from ls. per 100 super, ft. to free, but the general tariff will remain at ls. The general tariff on timber undressed, cut to size, for making boxes and timber undressed or partly dressed for making boxes, is being increased by 2s., making the general tariff rate in each case 14s. and 36s. respectively. </para>
                    <para>The motion also makes a substantial ' reduction in the rates of duty on hoods other than panama, pandan, and those made of felt. The reduction in th, specific rate of duty on the hoods affected, that is, straw and fibre hoods, amounts to, per dozen, 27s. British preferential; 30s. intermediate; and 36s. general. The reduced duties will, however, afford adequate protection to the straw hatmaking industry of Victoria. </para>
                    <para>An all-round increase of1s. per lb. which has been imposed on filament lamps, is in accordance with the recommendation made by the Tariff Board. It is generally know that these goods are being made in Australia at present, and representatives of the company manufacturing them have stated that it is essential that increased protection be granted. I have been advised that the rates suggested by the Tariff Board and imposed by this resolution will not afford protection, but can only be regarded as revenue duties. The Government has, however, given effect to the Tariff Board's recommendation, and proposes holding a further investigation into the subject between now and the time when the item will come up for discussion by honorable members. </para>
                    <para>An alternate specific rate of1s., British preferential, and 2s. general, each, on wireless valves has been imposed for the purpose of giving effective preference to British manufacturers. Although a 15 per cent. preference was granted to British manufacturers under the old rate of duty, the actual average amount of duty paid on the British valve was the same as that paid on the Dutch valve by reason of the lower f.o.b. price of the latter. In reviewing the request submitted for an effective margin of British preference the Government was forcibly struck by the great disparity between the landed duty-paid price of valves and the retail selling price. In some cases the retail selling prices were four times greater than the landed duty-paid prices. In fixing the specific rates of duty the Government has paid due regard to this fact, and the changed rates should ensure an increased revenue of £20,000 per annum without in any way increasing the price of valves to the public. The Government proposes looking into certain other lines of goods where there exists a great disparity between the landed dutypaid price and the retail selling price, and it will not hesitate to impose increased duties for revenue purposes when the facts indicate that undue profits are being made. </para>
                    <para>An increased duty is being imposed on turpentine substitutes imported for use as petrol substitutes. Since the increased revenue duties have been imposed on petrol, importations of turpentine substitutes have increased considerably. Inquiries made into the reason for these abnormal importations elicited the information that large quantities were being imported by a certain proprietor of a number of service stations in Sydney, and as he could not give any sufficient reason as to the uses to which turpentine substitutes imported by him were being put, the inference is that he is selling them in admixture with petrol to unsuspecting motorists. This trade has developed by reason of the fact that the duty on turpentine substitutes is only1d. per gallon, while the duty on petrol is 7d. per gallon. The new duty of 7d. per gallon on turpentine substitutes will render the practice of mixing it with petrol unprofitable, and will also protect the revenue. Provision still exists for paint-makers and other manufacturers to obtain their supplies of turpentine substitutes at1d. per gallon. </para>
                    <para>The remaining item in the schedule relates to the duty on newsprint and printing paper n.e.i., tariff items 334c 1 and 2. The British preferential tariff is being reduced by £1 per ton, and these printing papers will now be admitted free under the British preferential tariff, except, of course, for primage duty. As importations of newsprint from Canada are entitled to admission under the British preferential tariff, they also will not be required to pay the £1 per ton as hitherto. This will be a further concession to Canada, in accordance with the promise made in Parliament on 14th July, and will make the Canadian-Australian trade agreement more acceptable to Canada. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment of the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> cannot be regarded as a motion of censure on the Government, for these committees are appointed by Parliament, although, of course, the Government has to find the money to enable them to function. I freely admit that the committees have done good work ; but, under present conditions, it is certainly unnecessary that the Works Committee should continue to operate. It can Only work, as a matter of fact, if Parliament gives it work to do. The position of the Public Accounts Committee is somewhat different. The honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lacey)</inline> has pointed out that last year the Works  Committee  spent only £900 of the £2,000 voted to it, and returned £1,100 to the Treasury. He also referred to the good work that the committee had done. I admit this; but, on the other hand, if one desired to be critical, he could point to mistakes which the committee has made. To do so he would not need to go further than this House, some of the appointments of which are not nearly as convenient as they might be. One has only to consider the arrangements that were made with regard to the refrigerating chambers. On the one side were placed the boilers, on the other the ovens, with the refrigerating chambers between the two. Over the top of the boilers was erected a room in which were placed expensive billiard tables. The first time that the boilers were heated the billiard tables were put out of plumb,1 and the 001 tractors blamed. However, I do not wish to raise controversial points. If I  did,  I could refer to the action of a committee in going to the Northern Territory to report on the construction of telegraph lines. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to raise controversial issues. I believe that the Government is just as keen on saving the country's money as is any individual hon.orable member. These committees have given of their best from time to time, but I hold that their members should make their services available free. I am of the opinion that committees could be appointed with advantage to investigate proposed legislation, and give Parliament the benefit of their views when the bills were presented. I support the amendment, not as a reflection on the Government, but as an indication that the expenditure on both of these committees should be reduced, and as a reminder to the  chairman  of the Accounts Committee that instead of instituting further work his committee might cease its activities for twelve months. </para>

                    <para>. -  For some time the Government has been considering the reduction of these committees, but many other important problems have diverted its attention. It is the opinion of Ministers that the membership of these committees is too large, and as soon as the opportunity occurs, the matter will be considered with a view to proposing a reduction. I ask the committee not to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb),</inline> and suggest that the honorable member should withdraw his amendment on my assurance that the Government will investigate this matter. If an amendment were carried to reduce the vote, a considerable amount of work would be involved in reprinting certain pages of the Estimates, and that would necessitate a much greater expenditure than £1. Of course, if some honorable members desire that the committees should be abolished, the matter must, go to a vote. </para>

                        <para>- Parliament has power to refuse to expend any moneys. As the amount of work to be done is small, the activities of the Works Committee will be negligible. That remark does not apply with the same force to the Accounts Committee. I believe that the solution of the problem is the reduction of the membership of these committees, seven being too many! I suggest that  smother Minister or myself should take up the matter with the committees.

                        <para>- I understand that the number was increased in order to give the new party representation. I remind honorable members that the members of the committee consist of representatives of both chambers. One reason for the present number of members is to ensure a quorum. I give the lie to the suggestion that the members of the Accounts Committee attend meetings simply to collect fees. Last year the special appropriation for the committee was £2,000, of which £1,300, in round figures, was expended, the balance being returned to Consolidated Revenue. That conclusively proves that the committee docs not sit just for the sake of making fees. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that later. The Accounts Committee undertakes investigations which have the approval of the Government. To that extent its activities can be safely limited. Its secretary is at present engaged upon a government inquiry which is apart altogether from the activities of the committee. That proves that the experience that he has gained in connexion with the committee is of considerable value to the Government </para>

                        <para>- It relates to hotel and transport charges in the Federal Territory. Under its act, the committee has power to initiate its own inquiries; but during this Parliament its time has been spent on government references. The inquiry into the finances of South Australia was instituted by a resolution carried at the Premiers Conference iD August of last year. The South Australian Government asked for a grant of £1,950,000, but having made its investigations the committee recommended a grant of £1,000,000. The Government accepted that recommendation, and provided for that amount in the Estimates, thereby proving that it thought the recommendations of the committee of  value. The members of the committees inform their minds in the process of their investigations upon subjects concerning government finance, and to that extent become useful critics in this . chamber. The activities . of both committees have an educative influence upon their members, and give them a greater sense of their political responsibilities. These committees are the investigators of Parliament, and it  is  from that stand-point that they should be regarded. The suggestion that the committees should be abolished leaves my withers  unwrung;  but I believe that to abolish them would be a serious blow to Parliament. The Public Account* Committee was inaugurated as the result of a demand by honorable members for the examination of public expenditure. </para>

                <para>Another important inquiry which engaged the attention of the Accounts Committee was made into the finances of Tasmania. Recommendations were submitted to Parliament last year, which were welcomed by Tasmania, but, because of the financial difficulties that confront the Commonwealth, the Government was unable to give effect to them. </para>
                <para>Regarding travelling expenses, the Public Accounts Committee, when travelling in South Australia last year, followed an itinerary, provided for it by the South Australian Government. It went only where is was asked to go. Further, all of the members of the committee did not visit that State, and no unnecessary travelling expenditure was incurred. </para>
                <para class="block">Under the Financial Emergency Act, the whole vote of the committee has been reduced. </para>
                <para>I do not propose to deal with the origins and functions of the Public Accounts Committee at this juncture, in view of the Prime Minister's suggestion, which I hope will be adopted by the committee. I merely point out that in Great Britain a public accounts committee has existed since 1861, and has earned the tributes of such great parliamentarians as Gladstone, Disraeli, Asquith, Lloyd George and others, who recognized the necessity for such a body to exercise some control over the nation's finances. </para>
                <para>It would be a retrograde step to abolish these committees at this stage. I agree that their scope could be restricted, and their membership reduced. There are often, however, times when there is need for a standing committee to deal with government references. It is a much more economical form of investigation than that by royal commission. If cost is the only consideration, I direct attention to the fact that during the regime of the Bruce-Page Government, twenty-one royal commissions were appointed in the period beginning on the 1st January, 1923, and ending on the 30th June, 1929, at a cost of no less than £107,765, the average cost of each inquiry being £5,132. During the same period the Public Accounts Committee conducted sixteen inquiries at a cost of £19,556, the average cost of each inquiry being £1,222. The inquiry by a royal commission into the finances of Western Australia cost £5,681, compared with the £1,682 incurred by the Accounts Committee when making its inquiry into the finances of South Australia. The investigation by the Development and Migration Commission into the economic position of Tasmania cost £14,973, compared with that made by the Accounts Committee for £1,524. Those figures indicate that the committee's investigations have been conducted with due regard to economy and savings have been effected, as a result of its close scrutiny of the matters to which I have referred. </para>

                    <para>.- I intend to persist in my amendment, in an endeavour to prevent fees being paid to honorable members who sit on these com mittees. It is not my purpose on this occasion to bring about a reduction of the vote for the refreshment rooms. The purpose of my amendment is to abolish the payment of allowances and fees to members of Parliament sitting on the Public Works Committee and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and the amendment is confined to that alone. The chairmen of those committees have said that they and their fellow members are anything but avaricious. Well, let us assume that they are actuated only by a desire to render public service. That being so, and seeing that they have been able to render such valuable service in the past, they should be only too willing to sit on these committees without fee or allowance. I do not propose to be deceived by the window-dressing which has gone on here to-night. It may go down with the public, but if honorable members were courageous enough to say here what they say freely' in the party room and in the corridors regarding the Works Committee and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the public would learn something very different from what it has been told to-night. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> should know very well what I mean. Members of this Parliament are supposed to be paid for doing a full-time job. It has been claimed that the members of these committees are not avaricious; that considerations of pounds, shillings and pence do not weigh with them; that they are immolating themselves on the altar of duty. No doubt members of the Cabinet will claim the same, despite recent revelations regarding expenses, and the use of motor cars, matters, concerning which Ministers have consistently tried to dodge the issue. It has been claimed that the committees have been instrumental in saving a great deal of public money. A great many matters relating to the building of Canberra were referred to -these committees, but I doubt whether the work could have been characterized by greater waste and inefficiency if the committees had never functioned at all. Some honorable members now in this House sat on these committees in Melbourne when matters relating to Canberra were being inquired into. As one honorable member suggested, whatever economies the committees may be responsible for are more than offset by the extravagant expenditure which they have recommended at different times. The honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lacey)</inline> said that certain honorable members had not told their party that they were not candidates for positions on these committees. I do not know whether he was referring to me, but I may state that from the day when I voted against the salary grab away back in 1920, I knew that I was a marked man, and that I had no chance of getting on any committee. There was no need for me to say that I was not a candidate. If honorable members wish me to give details of the canvassing which has been done for positions on committees, I shall do so. Why all this hypocrisy? Everybody knows of the underground manoeuvring which goes on in the Labour party, and, I have no doubt, in other parties also, and yet it is said that honorable members are not avaricious. The honorable member for Grey threw out his chest and said, " Our committee sat four times in one day, and we only took one fee." I should think so. They were very lucky to get that. They did very well to get 25s. for sitting a few hours at a committee meeting, when all the time their parliamentary allowance was going on. The time is rotten ripe for Parliament to take action in regard to this matter. It is all very well for the honorable member for Grey to say that his committee has not met for so long and has handed back so much of its vote. If there had been any excuse for the committee to meet, it would have done so. </para>

                        <para>- I am referring to what was done last financial year. The committee has the whole of this year before it, and it is not rushing the first fences. I hope that the Committee will express itself by a definite vote on this matter. If honorable members support my amendment they will be setting a good example to the country. If the present members of committees are not prepared to do the work without extra payment, I am prepared to make one of those who will do the work for nothing. If I have not as much brains as some of those at present serving on committees, 1 should be sorry for myself. Work done voluntarily in this way is more likely to be satisfactory than that done for a fee. I hope honorable members on this side of the House will stand up to what they have said to me in private. It is of no use honorable members trying to make the public believe that they are not concerned about the pounds, shillings and pence side of their job. </para>

                        <para>- That is approximately correct. We are all concerned about the money, but some of us are also desirous of rendering faithful serviceto the country. If we are getting £800 a year to do a full time job, surely there are nine or ten of us in this House ready to serve on these committees without extra payment. </para>

                    <para>. - In every community of men holding various political and social opinions, there is generally one at least who is prepared continually to thank God that he is not as other men; and whether he spends his time swinging the bag, or preaching the Gospel of the Pharisees, makes no difference to his character. There are men who, in their dealings with other men in Parliament, or in the club, or in the street, are prepared to play the man, and there are others who are, unhappily, only too ready to play the unctuous censor. For several days past it. has been my painful experience to listen to the honorable member for Angus retailing rumour, gossip and innuendo. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Angas referred to the things he had heard spoken of in the corridors of this House; to the things which he could tell if he would; to what he had heard in the party room, and to various sorts of rumours, innuendoes and suggestions, unsupported by facts, which he has made the basis of his argument regarding the amendment he has moved. My purpose in rising was to call attention to the fact that, in a gathering of manly men, we do not act on rumour or gossip to the  detriment of each other. We do not make unsupported suggestions regarding what may be said in the corridor. We do not base motions in Parliament on things suspected but not revealed; on things which take place at private meetings of the party. There are, happily, some things which are not done. And now I say to this honorable gentleman, seeing that he is supporting his amendment with suggestions of this kind as he has so frequently done - with what he could say if he would say, with the whisperings there - if he is a man, let him come out and state his facts, and not by suggestion and innuendo defame the Parliament of which he should be proud to be a member, but which he is seeking to defile from day to day by his unsupported innuendoes. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb).</inline> Unlike some honorable members who have spoken, I do not approach this matter with any heat. The proposal to suspend the operations of the committee for twelve months is to be commended; but, in my opinion, the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> should have gone a step further. I notice among the votes for the Prime Minister's Department. £3,000 for travelling expenses of Ministers despite the fact that they are all provided with gold passes. That item also should be disallowed. Despite the 20 per cent. reduction in all salaries, a full-time Minister will receive £1,520 per annum, and assistant Ministers £1,200, and surely it is not necessary to provide an additional £3,000 to be cut up among Ministers by way of travelling expenses. There is no justification for voting £2,000 as travelling expenses for the members of the two Parliamentary Standing Committees. Since the Government has decided to reduce the pensions of invalid and aged persons to 17s. 6d. a week, and to cut down by 2s. 6d. a week even those pensions which amount to only 5s. a week, we should not become heated over a proposal to prevent members already in receipt of £800 a year from recouping them selves of part of the loss due to the 20 per cent. reduction by collecting travelling expenses. If these members had any sense of decency they would forgo these perks. The honorable member for Angas is to be complimented on his courage in drawing attention to this matter. I would have difficulty in finding words to express my feeling concerning those who, while agreeing to the reduction of invalid and old-age pensions, and the reduction of the maternity allowance from £5 to £4, complain that members receiving £800 a year should be prevented from cutting up a few extra thousands a year in travelling expenses. </para>

                        <para>- In the discussion on this very grave subject, I wish to avoid saying anything that may engender heat, but I intend to protest in terms as strong as parliamentary usage will allow, against the dictatorial attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, and wish to impress upon honorable members the grave danger that threatens the financial structure of the Commonwealth. The conditions laid down by the Commonwealth Bank Board are such as would not be imposed by anyself-respecting Jew upon a needy client, and it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that they have been dictated by political considerations, and that the desire is to humiliate and destroy the Lang Government. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson is endowed with keen business instincts, he was not associated with banking until he was foisted into his present position by the Bruce-Page Government and continued in it by this Government. But that is another story. My present intention is to confine my remarks strictly to the terms laid down by the Bank Board for acceptance by the New South Wales Government. The Government Savings Bank of New South Wales has been most unfairly treated. If the private banking institutions of this country had been called upon to withstand for one day a raid such as was made upon the savings bank for a month, they would have closed their doors immediately. The situation has now become so serious that people are becoming restive, not only in New South Wales, but also in the other States, and the fear is entertained in some quarters that if  the existing depression Continues <inline font-style="italic">mud</inline> longer, depositors in other States will be forced to make such heavy withdrawals from government savings banks and private banks, that it will not be long before those institutions will have to close their doors. If such a situation is threatened, will this financial dictator demand of other State Governments the conditions which he has imposed upon the Government of New South Wales? I realize, of course, the limitations of this Parliament in this matter. I am aware that the Commonwealth Bank Board, which is the creation of a Nationalist Government, is in absolute control of our monetary policy; but the position may develop and become so intolerable that this Government and Parliament will be forced to take action. In many respects, the present crisis is much more serious than that which occurred in the 'nineties, because then the Government of New South Wales had absolute power over the currency and was able to take action to ease the situation. If it had been endowed with similar powers in the present crisis, I am convinced that the savings bank would not have been forced to suspend operations. To that extent, the Commonwealth must accept some responsibility in this crisis, because the instrumentality which could have averted it is the creation of this Parliament. The slender thread of faith is the only thing upon which government or private banking institutions depend for their solvency. If depositors or the people generally lose faith in the present banking system, we shall see a crisis of great magnitude, because the volume of banking business has grown to enormous dimensions in recent years. The private banking institutions are in an exceedingly serious situation, because they have on current account nearly £100,000,000, and the currency available to meet sudden demands does not exceed £30,000,000. I should add that current accounts in private banks are in a totally different category, from current accounts in a government savings bank. The former return to depositors nothing in the way of interest. On the contrary, the banks charge a certain amount per annum for the keeping of these accounts, and, in return, they are supposed to be able to meet every call demand immediately.. On the other hand, current accounts in savings banks return to depositors a certain amount per annum by way of interest, to earn which the bank authorities are obliged to invest the deposit sums in approved  securities,  which will return to the bank an amount sufficient to pay the agreed upon interest to depositors, and also provide for the working expenses of the institution. So serious is the position of the private banks that if a panic were created, disaster would overtake the Commonwealth in a very short space of time. If the Commonwealth Bank will not come to the aid of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales on terms' more acceptable to the Government of that State, how will it be possible for the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> to justify assistance from the Commonwealth Bank to the associated banks, should that be necessary to avert a financial crisis? And yet apparently that is to be done, because, when I spoke upon this subject some time ago, the right honorable gentleman intimated that, if a crisis should occur, the Commonwealth Bank would have to be empowered to print a sufficient number of notes to meet any abnormal demand. If such action is contemplated to buttress private banking institutions, a similar course should be adopted to save an important institution like the Government Savings Bank in New South Wales. My views on banking are well known to honorable members. If it were possible, I should have no hesitation in supporting a scheme to absorb compulsorily the government savings banks in all the States, for I am convinced that Commonwealth control of banking is the only sound policy. The Commonwealth Bank should either take over the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales or render it a reasonable measure of financial assistance on terms that will permit it to function  again on the scale obtaining prior to its suspension. The whole of the resources of the Commonwealth should be utilized to avoid a banking crisis. I assume that honorable members are conversant with the terms submitted by the Commonwealth Bank to the Government of New South Wales, and that it is not necessary for me to refer to them in detail. All I need say is that, in my opinion, they are unnecessarily harsh. In the present parlous condition of our rural industries the position of the people on the land will be rendered desperate if theRural Bank is compelled to foreclose, and force off their holdings people who have received advances from it. A little while ago it was stated in this chamber that the wealth of Australia is £4,000,000,000.With all this wealth as a guarantee for the stability of the Commonwealth Savings Bank, surely an effort should be made to rehabilitate the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. Whatever honorable members may think of the political events of the last few months, there should be on the part of all a definite desire to see that bank rehabilitated, knowing that if its existence is endangered other savings banks and private banks may also be affected. On other occasions I have expressed views hostile to private financial institutions, but I would devote all my energy, and all my time, to prevent an upheaval approaching in its intensity that of the 'nineties. History is valuable only for the lessons it teaches us. The history of the 'nineties must teach us plainly the lesson that we are now playing with gun-powder, and if we are not careful an explosion is not far off. It is the bounden duty of the Prime Minister and the Government to do all in their power to impress on the Commonwealth Bank Board the necessity for modifying the conditions it has laid down for the absorption of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, or at any rate for making them sufficiently reasonable that the State may still find it possible to accept them. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister, and particularly of the Minister for Home Affairs, the tardiness of the Commonwealth in dealing with the buffalo fly pest. During a recent visit to Queensland, I discussed this matter with the Minister for Agriculture and Stock, the Honorable H. P. Walker, M.L.A., who complained of the scant courtesy he and his Government had received from the Commonwealth Government and the Minister for Home </para>

                <para class="block">Affairs. I regret that the Commonwealth Government has not seen its way to give financial assistance to the Queensland Government to enable it to prepare a buffer area by means of which the prevention of the spread of the pest may be attempted.Seeing that the buffalo fly first came into Queensland from the Northern Territory, which is Commonwealth territory, a direct responsibility rests on the Commonwealth Government. At any rate, whatever expenditure is involved in trying to check the further spread of the fly may justly be regarded as national expenditure. If the buffalo fly is allowed to spread without hindrance, it will reach down to the east coast, and many millions of pounds will ultimately have to be spent in trying to prevent its further spread and its ultimate eradication. The Minister for Agriculture and Stock in Queensland and the senior officers of his department have made an exhaustive examination of the problem on the spot. They have travelled for many thousands of miles through the affected area. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walker</inline> and his officers are cattlemen of life-long association with the cattle industry. They are, therefore, competent to give a judgment upon this particular problem, and after the thorough in vestigation they have made they are emphatically of the belief that a buffer area similar to that recommended in the report to the Minister for Home Affairs will be 100 per cent. effective in preventing the spread of this pest.

If the problem is not tackled by putting into operation the proposal of the Minister for Agriculture and Stock, I am afraid that the fly will spread down the south coast of Queensland into the dairy-' ing country in the north and south coast areas and before long reach into New South Wales. In that case, the loss of stock and the consequential decrease of our national income would be colossal. The probable ruin of many of our producers in the pastoral and dairying industries is undoubtedly a matter of national concern. </para>

                <para>The Government of Queensland has given every facility to the officer appointed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to investigate the problem on the spot, and has offered its full co-operation with the Commonwealth Government, pointing out the urgency of the matter; but so far as I can ascertain, there has not yet been any consultation between the Minister for Home Affairs and any State Minister on this subject. All that "the Commonwealth Government has done on its own initiative has been to propose, to treat the matter by biological control. This is only in the  experimnetal  stage. No definite result has yet been achieved from this method, although it is certainly full of possibilities, and on that ground the Commonwealth Government proposes to resort to apply it in dealing with the buffalo fly problem. It may be years before a satisfactory conclusion is reached. I quote the following report of the Minister for Agriculture and Stock upon this method : - </para>

                    <para>With reference to proposal <inline font-style="italic">d,</inline> the placing of the fly under biological control presents considerable difficulty. A great deal of work in the nature of research and investigation has been carried out by the Council for Scientific arid Industrial Research, but to date the information obtained is not sufficient to allow "of the design of a plan of biological control for this particular insect, although the results at this stage offer some promise of success being achieved later. Under the most favorable circumstances, it cannot be expected that the eradication of the fly  will  be possible by this means. Nothing more than a measure of control of the fly can be hoped for. The parasitic insects to bo introduced would al most bc capable of keeping the numbers of buffalo flics within restriction, and preventing the fly from occasioning any sevese injury to stock. </para>

                <para class="block">My opinion is that to adopt this unsatisfactory method of dealing with a matter which may ultimately become a great national problem, is only baulking at the question, and that if prompt, and effective action is not taken to establish a buffer area it may later on be useless to do so. A buffer area would at least ensure - that the fly is prevented from spreading. The biological test, according to a statement of the Minister made available to the press, is as yet only in the experimental stage. No complete scheme has been worked out, and no possible relief can be expected for a number of years. Yet it was the only proposal put forward by the Commonwealth; the Queensland Government has practically been asked to play a lone hand in dealing with this big national problem. That Government and the pastoral and cattle men of Queensland are prepared to make their contribution towards the cost of a buffer area, and they urge co-operation and ask for the co-operation of the Commonwealth Government. I ask the Commonwealth Government to reconsider its attitude on this question, and to give a more satisfactory reply to the representation* put forward by the Queensland Government. I am satisfied- that that Government would welcome an opportunity to discuss the whole problem with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> and the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)/</inline> But a buffer area should be declared immediately, while the biological tests are being pushed forward, or, at any rate, until they prove to be successful. It will definitely hold up the onward march of this pest. This point is emphasized in the following extract from a letter sent by the Premier of Queensland (the Honorable A. E. Moore) to the Prime Minister: - </para>

                        this connexion I desire to stress the view that the damage which has taken place up to date through the buffalo fly infestation is infinitesimal compared with the damage likely to occur to the dairying industry if the fly spreads to the coastal areas cf Queensland and the southern States. As the cost of the buffer area now rendered necessary is quite beyond the capacity of the Queensland Government to defray, I shall be glad to learn what assistance, if any, is available from the Commonwealth Government in an endeavour to arrest the further spread of the flY in Queensland, and, if possible, entirely eradicate it.

                    <para>.- It is amusing to hear die honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> speak on this subject.  His  interest in the buffalo fly pest is very recent. He must realize that the eradication of the pest should have been undertaken by the Bruce-Page Nationalist Government years ago. To hear the honorable member talk about establishing a buffer area would also bo amusing if the subject were not so serious.  Let me ask him what will happen to the cattlemen on the Gulf of Carpentaria and in the Northern Territory if a buffer area should be established. It must be apparent to the honorable gentleman that the taking of such a step would deprive the settlers in those areas of any opportunity of getting their stock to market. They will be expected to continue paying taxes, but will be prevented from selling their stock. The honorable member for Moreton has been a member of this Parliament for fourteen years, and so far as I know, he has never before taken an interest in this subject. If a buffer area is established, the Government should also establish meat works in the north iii order to ensure a market for the cattle raised there. Ever since this Government has- been in office it has interested itself in ways and means of eradicating the buffalo fly, but for a long while it could not get the Queensland Minister for Agriculture to do anything. The people engaged in the cattle and dairying industry in North Queensland have already been put to a lot of trouble, because of the fear of the spread of this pest. It is of little use for politicians to talk about constructing fences to keep back cattle infected with the buffalo fly, particularly if they expect the cattle-raisers to pay for the fences. But something effective will have to be done before very long, or this pest will cost the cattle and dairying industries of Australia, the Commonwealth Government, the Queensland - Government, and the general taxpayers  a  very large sum of money. The buffalo fly is now on Mornington Island, 32 miles from the mainland. It is three years since any cattle were taken to Mornington Island. It must be evident, therefore, that the fly is blown along on the wind. If it once reaches a railway terminal in North Queensland, the results will be disastrous to the dairying industry of thai State. </para>

                <para>I suppose that a Labour government will have to deal with this pest as it had to deal with the prickly pear pest. For many years Nationalist governments in Queensland talked about the prickly pear, but did nothing to eradicate it. That work was left for a Labour government to do. It appears to me that the honorable member for Moreton is trying to make a party political issue out of this subject. Notwithstanding his ignorance of it, he has talked a good deal about it. The subject is too big to be made the plaything of party politics. Un- - loss effective steps are taken to eradicate the pest, millions of money may have to be spent to protect -the dairying herds of Australia. I hope that the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government will set to work in dead earnest to prevent any further invasion by the buffalo-fly. </para>

Immediately after the Government came into office it arranged a conference with representatives of the Queensland government and other interested paru.es at Brisbane with the object of formulating a plan of campaign against the fly; but the conference was abortive. Reports were obtained later from the officers of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Health Department, and the Home Affairs Department, which showed that the fly was spreading in an alarming way. Subsequently 1 arranged for the Premier of Queensland to meet me in Canberra while he was here attending a Premiers Conference, and we discussed the matter with the Director-General of Health, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston,</inline> the Director of Veterinary Hygiene, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. W.</inline> A. N. Robertson, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Tiliyard, Dr. Mackerras,</inline> and an officer of my department . We went into the matter very fully. The Commonwealth Government indicated that it was anxious to assist the Queensland Government to do everything possible to resist the invasion of the fly. After the Premier returned to Queensland, he wrote a letter to me to the effect that the Queensland Government considered the eradication of the pest was the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. With that contention this Government could not agree. However, it was arranged later that certain officers of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research should visit Queensland and report upon the conditions. The survey which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mackerras</inline> then made showed that the fly was spreading very rapidly. The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> has advocated the proclamation of a buffer area, but neither <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mackerras</inline> nor <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walker,</inline> the Queensland Minister for Agriculture, considered that that - action would be effective.

                        <para>- It could not possibly be so. Fully 600 miles of fencing would have to be erected in the proposed area in which it is estimated that there are 10,000 brumbies, and a similar number of clean skins, as well as ji number of buffaloes. Very substantial fencing would be required to keep the brumbies and clean skins in check, and a most formidable type of fence would be required to keep the buffaloes back. It is admitted by the Minister for Agriculture that it would be almost impossible to clear that territory of brumbies and clean skins. While one single beast remained in that area a  li03t  would be provided for the buffalo fly, which, during prevailing winds, would be carried where  it  could increase at an enormous rate. In addition, 12,000 square miles of territory would have to be policed, and it is impossible to estimate the cost of getting a muster, which would have to be repeated three or four times. Owing to the rough nature of the country, it would be practically impossible to clean out the country, and any improvements effected would be only of a temporary nature. Even a skeleton fence, consisting of two barbed wires and, perhaps, a single plain wire would cost £60 a mile, or a total of about £30,000. Even if such a fence were erected, the owners would have to be compensated for vacating their leases and for losses incurred in other ways, which would amount to from £50,000 to £100,000. If that expenditure were incurred there would still be the danger of from 10 per cent, to 20 per cent, of the brumbies and clean skins remaining. Policemen and black trackers would have to patrol the fence from one end to the other. Even if the buffer area were 50 miles in width, it is possible that with a favorable wind at 60 miles an hour the fly could be carried from one end of the buffer area to the other. The expenditure might be anything in the vicinity of £500,000, which would, in all probability, be wasted. Moreover, such a proposal has not been favorably reported upon by the expert advisers of the Commonwealth. What would be the opinion of a government, which, after having employed the services of Commonwealth and State experts, ignored their recommendations? Surely, it is not suggested that the flight of the fly could be prevented by the erection of a barbed wire fence. We might spend £500,000 and then find that this pest was still finding its way to the south. A government that adopted such a course now, in the light of the evidence available, would be held up to contempt and ridicule. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that aspect of the question later. Certain recommendations have been submitted for the consideration of the Government, which appointed a sub-committee of the Cabinet consisting of the Minister for Health, the Minister controlling the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and myself, as Minister for Home Affairs. This sub-committee made certain recommendations, which have received full publicity and have been brought under the notice of Parliament. Briefly, the recommendations of that subcommittee were that the Commonwealth Government could not, in view of the,.reports submitted by Commonwealth and State scientists, accept responsibility for the provision of a buffer area. Another of the recommendations was that meat* works should be established in the north, in order that cattle should travel in that direction for treatment rather than to the south. The Government considered that purely a State function. It was also suggested that cattle should be driven from the buffalo fly area into the semi-arid regions where there is a rainfall of under 21 inches, where the fly ceases to thrive, but that was another matter over which the Commonwealth Government could not possibly have control. ^ The transportation of stock over the Queensland railways is also a State function. The spraying of cattle when trucked, or when transhipped, is also a function which was recognized as being a State responsibility. After giving very careful consider ation to the report, the sub-committee unanimously recommended to the Government that  it  should not accept responsibility in any  of  the directions I have mentioned. The Government, however, made a generous offer  to  the Queensland Government  to  make available the services  of  certain scientists  in  the employ  of  the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Health Department, and the Department  of  Home Affairs, and  to  advise upon methods  of  spraying. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>The Government also stated that  it  was prepared  to  extend its activities  in  the matter of biological control, and Professor Hansen,  an  overseas professor, who is at present working  in  Java, will,  in  the near future, proceed  to  Timor  in an  endeavour to secure a suitable parasite. At present a parasite known as " B.Z.", as well as twelve others, are being tested. Entomological stations are  to  be established  on  Mornington Island,  at  Armraynald,  in  Queensland, and  at  Burnside and Brock's Creek  in  the Northern Territory, each  of  which will be under the control  of  entomologists capable  of  studying the breeding and distribution  of  parasites. It  is  likely  to  be a costly undertaking and the work will take some time, but we hope that science will, eventually, be able  to  eradicate the buffalo fly. </para>
                <para>The Government, which feels that  it  has done everything humanly possible, cannot be reproached by the Queensland Government for any lack  of  activity. I can appreciate the extraordinary difficulty with which governments have been confronted  in  dealing with the buffalo fly pest. Many cattle-owners  in  the north pooh-pooh the idea  of  the buffalo fly being dangerous, because any suggestion  in  that direction results  in  their stock being held up. Quarantine has been broken  as  cattle and horses taken from the quarantine area have assisted  in  the distribution  of  the fly. In view  of all  the circumstances, the Government feels that  it  cannot accept the responsibility which the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> has endeavoured  to  place upon it. </para>

                        <para>- I am not reflecting on you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crouch,</inline> but am merely referring to the action that you have taken officially. My reason is that this matter was raised during the speech of the honorable member for Werriwa. The point was then taken that this question should be discussed on the vote for the Prime Minister's Department, or on that for the Treasury. The  Chairman  of Committees, after consultation with the officials, ruled that it was a question of Government policy, and, therefore, came under the administration of the Prime Minister's Department. That decision should, I contend, bind the House, including yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman.</inline> The honorable ' member for Werriwa then devoted practically the whole of his speech to a discussion of the matter without any objection being offered by either the Prime Minister or any other honorable member. If there is anything that can be characterized as Government policy, I submit that it is the administration of the banking operations of this country; and surely such a matter comes under the guidance and the direction of the Prime Minister. The vote for the administration of this department amounts to ?60,166. Every question relating to the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, as well as to banking generally, has been directed to and answered by the Prime Minister. It is "straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel " to rule me out of order in the circumstances, and to ask me to wait several hours for the opportunity to bring the matter up in a disjointed way in a later debate. Every honorable member who pauses and considers, must agree that the subject of banking and of finance in the administrative sense is entirely within the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister. He alone can say what is the policy of the Government in regard to the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, and the taking over of savings banks generally. That is the question which is here involved. One would not expect any other Minister to reply to questions relating to the control of banking institutions and the conditions under which the Commonwealth Government is prepared to take over the savings banks of the different States. It is not a question of what has happened in the past, nor of responsibility in connexion with banking institutions. The whole issue is, what is the policy of the Scullin Government in regard to the taking over of savings banks ? I insist that I am within my rights in discussing this matter under the " administrative " vote for the Prime Minister's Department, because it is clearly a matter of government policy. That was the ruling of the  Chairman  of Committees. I submit that neither the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> nor any other member is entitled to challenge my right to do this. They heard the matter discussed for half an hour by a member of the committee, and no point of order was taken. </para>

If any matter concerns the administration of the Government, surely its banking policy and the taking over of savings banks by the Commonwealth is such a matter. The Prime Minister alone can speak for the Government on a matter of this kind. For that reason, and the others that I have advanced, I am, I submit, entitled to discuss this matter. </para>

                        <para>- It is true that the  Chairman  of Committees ruled that the subject raised by the honorable member for Werriwa' was a matter of general policy which could be discussed when the Estimates of the Prime Minister's Department were under consideration, and it is equally true that neither I nor any other honorable member raised a point of order when the honorable member was speaking. I did not interrupt the remarks of the honorable member for Werriwa, although I did not agree with the Chairman's ruling. I saw no justification for it. If the subject referred to could properly be discussed as a matter of general policy in connexion with the estimates of my department, any matter could be so discussed in connexion with these estimates. But I was willing that the honorable member should be allowed to speak on the subject raised, and I was prepared to listen also to the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill).</inline> The Temporary  Chairman  is within his rights in ruling that the honorable member for Warringah is now out of order, and- 1 think that that ruling is unassailable. The fact that the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> was not challenged does not establish a right on the part of the honorable member for Warringah to discuss the same subject at this stage. I can readily understand that the honorable member for Warringah is smarting under a sense of unfair treatment when he recalls that the hon; orable  member for Werriwa was allowed to make a speech on a certain subject, and that he is now denied a similar opportunity. But that is not the fault of the Government; it is due to the fact that the  Chairman  and the Temporary  Chairman  have given opposite rulings. We now have to decide whether the ruling of the Temporary  Chairman  is correct. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> says - </para>

The fact that I have answered questions dealing with a matter of general policy does not permit hon.orable members to discuss the Government's administration in considering the estimates of the Prime Minister's Department. I answer questions of general policy that may relate to all departments, but it would not be permissible, in dealing with the Prime Minister's departmental estimates, to discuss every subject that relates to other departments. Strictly speaking, I do not believe that honorable members may discuss the position relating to the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales under any division of the Estimates. Honorable members have many opportunities of discussing matters of government policy, but they cannot do so on the Estimates. They may do it during the budget debate, on specific motions, or on motions for the adjournment of the House. I submit that honorable members must now confine their remarks to the items contained in the Estimates. x </para><continue>

                        <para>- I was prepared to per mit a certain degree of indulgence in regard to the discussion of an important matter, and I was ready to extend that indulgence to the honorable member for Warringah. Although I could have taken that point at the time, I did not do so. I think, however, that the ruling of the  Chairman  was wrong.  Had I taken such a point of order after allowing the honorable member for Werriwa to proceed with his speech, the honorable member for Warringah would have had a genuine grievance against me. We are not now dealing with a question of indulgence; we must decide whether the ruling of the Temporary  Chairman  is sound. It would be wrong for this committee to refuse to uphold the Temporary  Chairman  in what is unquestionably a sound ruling. </para>

                        <para>- I always like to be treated fairly in this chamber, whether honorable members agree with me or not, and to be fair to others. I suppose no honorable member of the committee disagrees with the honorable member for Warringah more than I do; but in this case it seems to me that he has not received the same treatment as was. extended to my colleague, the honorable member for Werriwa. Apparently, if you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crouch,</inline> remain in the Chair until we reach the Department of the Treasury, you may then repeat your present ruling, and no opportunity will be given further to discuss the matter. No doubt you have the right to rule as you think fit, but when the  Chairman  of Committees has declared that a certain form of procedure will be followed, those who subsequently take the chair should, I think, follow the precedent he has set. I noticed the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibbons)</inline> endeavouring to obtain the call following the honorable member for Werriwa, and I, too, hoped for an opportunity later to speak on the matter also. If the ruling of the  Chairman  of Committees is upset, no opportunity will be given to discuss the matter further. Therefore, I support the honorable member for Warringah. </para>

I have no fault to find with the officers concerned, but I doubt that our representation is of any value to the Commonwealth. The officers who are employed there might be able to serve Australia more effectively if they were transferred to the sister dominion of Canada, and carried out duties on behalf of the Markets Department. </para>

                <para>Another matter about which I am concerned has to do with the administration in New Guinea. About twelve months ago, the Government, realizing the serious position that was developing in connexion with the price of copra, came to the assistance of the planters by declaring a moratorium for twelve months. That moratorium has been renewed recently. When it was declared, the price of copra was £14 a ton. To-day, the price is £11 15s., and if one subtracts from that amount expenditure on account of insurance, freight and other charges, amounting to about £7 a ton, the net return to planters is not sufficient to cover cost of production. Consequently, the planters arc in a desperate plight. They appreciate very highly the efforts of the Government on their behalf, but they wish me to remind the Prime Minister that they are carrying the whole burden of taxation in New Guinea, professional officers, business people and public servants not being taxed in any shape or form. They suggest that, in order to give relief, the very high export duty on copra should be removed. </para>

I am aware that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has been dealing with this question, and has given it his sympathetic consideration, but I hope that the Prime Minister will realize the seriousness of the position confronting the administration of New Guinea, and if possible give some relief to the planters. </para>

                <para>Another question to which I direct attention has relation to the shipping services under item 16, " Shipping and mail services to the Pacific Islands ". For some time, vessels other than those trading to Australian ports, have been visiting outports, picking up copra for transhipment at the main ports. Several German ships have come into the trade recently, and as these are manned by coolie labour, they are in unfair competition with vessels of the Burns, Philp line which observe Australian conditions, although not obliged to do so. These foreign vessels take copra from outports free to the mainports, and, at the same time, they carry German agents whose business it is to push the sale of German commodities as against Australian products. It has been suggested that a duty of 10s. per ton on all cargo picked up at outports would clear up the position and enable us to maintain an Australian shipping service under Australian conditions in the islands. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The cost of administration has been substantially reduced during the last twelve months, but my point is that, as our trade with the United States of America shows an adverse balance, there is no particular reason why we should maintain the office on an elaborate scale. We should concentrate upon Canada, where there is a reasonable prospect of building up increased trade. I also wish to know what further savings in our London representation, if any, have been effected. I direct attention to the misleading manner in which the Estimates of the Commonwealth have been presented for some years. , The need for uniformity between the practices of the States and the Commonwealth in the presentation of Estimates is urgent, both from a financial and from an economic standpoint, and I suggest that a conference beheld between Treasury officials with a view to ensuring uniformity in future. Because of the application of different methods, considerable difficulty was experienced at the recent Melbourne conference in arriving at a satisfactory basis for the purpose of a comparison between the respective estimates of the Commonwealth and the States. Our estimates do not disclose the true cost of departmental activities. I cite as one example the presentation of accounts in connexion with the High Commissioner's office. According to the Treasury estimates, the cost for 1931-32 will be £49,000. but when I conducted an inquiry last year in London, I discovered that the cost, in round figures, was £62,000, but associated activities cost another £61,000, so the total cost of London representation in that year was £124,000. Presumably, a similar result would be shown in these estimates if the cost of associated activities were added in an explanatory footnote, or in some other form, so that honorable members would know what is the real cost of our representation in London. In 1929-30 the cost, excluding the agencies-general and other nonCommonwealth activities, was £200,000. Somewhere in the neighborhood of that total would be shown in these estimates if all the revelant items were included under the High Commissioner's Office. For example, the estimates for the High Commissioner's Office do not include the cost of the liaison officer, whose salary is provided under the Department of the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- He is engaged on work in connexion with our export trade in meat. But there is also a dairy officer there, and a number of other Commonwealth activities. The point I wish to make is that, although these Estimates show the cost of the High Commissioner's Office to be about £49,000, the real cost, including the associated activities, isin the neighbourhood of £200,000. In 1929-30, the cost of our London office, including the representations of the States, was £312,000, or, if we deduct £69,000 for the Agencies-General, a total of £243,000. I think I am right in saying that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has in the past criticized the manner in which these estimates are submitted; but time and matters of more importance have prevented him from taking the necessary action to have them presented in a way that would readily disclose the true position. In my report, I directed attention to the manner in which the salaries of 93 clerks, typists, storemen, messengers, telephonists, and assistants were shown, and suggested that it would be more helpful if the Estimates gave more details in the case of officers in receipt of salaries of £800 a year or thereabouts. Parliament is entitled to know how much these activities are costing Australia. The Auditor-General has, on more than one occasion, directed attention to the manner in which the accounts are presented, and has emphasized that the information should be shown in a way that could be readily understood by the general public. </para>

                    <para>. - The suggested removal of the export duty on copra, mentioned by the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> has already received attention. As the honorable member knows, the duty has been reduced from time to time, and consideration given to the possibility of raising taxation from other sources. I am aware that foreign boatshave, for some time, been engaged in trade between the outports of New Guinea to the prejudice of vessels of the Burns, Philp line, which is subsidized by the Government. Complaints have been made of this unfair competition; and recently it was suggested that, to meet the situation that had arisen, we should impose a tonnage duty on all cargo shipped from outports in foreign vessels which are trading in competition with the vessels of the Burns, Philp line. The whole question is now under review. It has been brought under my notice that restrictions of the character suggested have been applied, in relation to the same matter in other Pacific islands, and I am having inquiries made as to their result. </para>

                    <para>. -Of the £52,000 provided for Pacific mail services £8,000 is paid to Burns, Philp and Company for supplying a service to the Solomon Islands. The principal trade done by the steamers which maintain this serviceis the carrying of logs to Sydneyand Melbourne, where they are sawn into planks. But on the 20 th June of last year the Minister for Trade andCustom's placed a prohibitive duty on these logs, although similar timber from North Borneo was still allowed to come in at a 10 per cent. tariff. The company which is importing these logs from the Solomon Islands, which, forsomeinexplicable reason, . have been subjected to this prohibitive duty, is registered in Victoria. It is purely Australian ; all its shareholders are Australian; itscapital is approximately £100,000, and it spends at least £8,000 a year in wages. It buys Australian goods only for its white staff and native labourers. Yet it is denied an opportunity to import its timber except at a prohibitive rate of duty. On several occasions the Minister has been asked to rectify this anomaly, but all that he can promise is that when the item is under consideration in this chamber attention will be given to any representations that may be made to him. At present the company is importing logs and sawing them in bond under special permission, in the hope that the excessive duty will ultimately be removed. I trust that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade and Customs will give immediate attention to this matter, andnot  wait  until the tariff item is reached, which may not be until Christmas, or possibly March next. </para>

                    <para>.- On page 23 of the Estimates is the item, " Travelling expenses of Commonwealth Ministers, £3,000". After the  recent debates  urging economy in all directions, and the reduction of the invalid and oldpensionto17s. 6d. a week, and in many instances to 5s. a week, we can hardly justify a vote of £3,000 to Ministers for travelling expenses. I, therefore,move- </para>

                <para class="block">There are under the Prime Minister's Department several items for travelling expenses totalling in all £13,300, andat a time like this I think we should show our sincerity, or, at any rate, practice what  we  preach to the invalid and old-age pensioners, by asking Ministers to do without this extra £3,000. Despite the recent cut, Ministers with portfolios are still in receipt of £1,520 a year each, and Assistant Ministers receive £1,200. The £3,000 provided for their travellingexpenses could be devoted to a better use. It could be used to advantage by subsidizing the research that is now going on in an endeavour to extract oils from coal. If Lyon Brothers, who at their own expense are experimenting in that direction at Wallsend, were given some encouragement, I thinkthey could  do  good work for this country. In the past it has been our practice to give assistance to those who are searching for metals,and to make huge grants for oil-boring, but so far as the coal industry is concerned - </para>

Provision is made in these Estimates for assistance to mining and metallurgy, but there is no item for the coal industry which, as the Prime Minister knows, is in a languishing state today. It has been proved in other countries that oil can be extracted from coal on a commercial basis, and we are now importing oil to the value of nearly £16,000,000 per annum. I admit that £100,000 was set aside for the coal industry, but that money has now been transferred to the shale oil industry. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member will see that certain amounts are provided in the proposed votes for every department for travelling allowances for Ministers and departmental officers engaged in public business away from their homes. If Ministers and public servants were paid salaries covering travelling allowances, clearly those salaries would be too large for normal needs. On the other hand, if the salaries were equitable for the work ordinarily performed, they would not allow any margin to meet additional expenditure incurred when travelling on public business. The amount spent in travelling allowances includes transport by motor car, and other means. This expenditure has greatly decreased in the last few years. The amount spent in the Prime Minister's Department under this heading in 1928-29 was £7,078; in 1929-30 it was £4,593, and last year it was £2,564. Although an amount of £3,000 is proposed to be voted this year. it. is not anticipated that it will all be used, for economies are being effected in every possible direction. Reductions are being  made in the travelling allowance of Ministers and public servants. If honorable members think that travelling allowances should not be permitted in any circumstances, they should say so. If the present salaries are sufficiently large to include travelling allowances, they are too large for ordinary purposes, and should be adjusted. </para>

                    <para>.I have argued for a number of years when the Estimates have been under discussion, that Australia should be represented in America by the most capable man available. I do not think that we need a trade commissioner so much as a person who could act as an ambassador for Australia to the people of America. We want a person in the United States of America who would endeavour to strengthen the bonds of friendship between these two great branches of the English-speaking race. Our representative should have his headquarters in Washington or New York, and he should interest himself principally in the development of friendly sentiment between Australia and America. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Under date 9th May, 1930, I received from the Right Honorable J. H. Scullin, P.C., M.P., Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, the following letter: - </para>
                    <para>The Government would be glad if, whilst in London, you would, in your capacity of chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Public Accounts, inquire into and report upon the organization of the High Commissioners Office and the activities associated therewith. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I submit that the Prime Minister was not entitled to ask the honorable member for Reid to make his inquiry in his capacity as  chairman  of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The Public Accounts Committee Act provides that the committee may only function when a quorum is present, and it cannot be contended that the  chairman  alone constitutes a quorum of the committee. It would have been quite in order for the -Prime Minister to ask the honorable member to make his inquiry in his capacity as a member of this Parliament, but that was not done. The report presented by the honorable member was signed as follows : - " P. E. Coleman,  Chairman,  Commonwealth Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts." It should have been signed. "P. E. Coleman, M.P." </para>

                    PARKHILL.That is so. In my opinion this expenditure is extravagant and entirely unwarranted at present. Australia has not derived any material advantage from the maintenance of this office in the United States of America at a cost of anything up to £2,000 per annum.

I direct the attention of the committee and of the public generally to this unwarranted expenditure, and I invite the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> to intimate to the taxpayers the benefits, if any, which the Commonwealth is receiving from such representation.  i; has been said that the Commonwealth should have a' representative in the United States of America to handle financial matters, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> R. Collins, the financial adviser of the Commonwea th in London, was recently sent to the United States of America when investigations were conducted in connexion with certain Commonwealth loan proposals. Obviously, this office is not kept open to assist the Government in connexion with loan transactions. </para>

                <para>The amount of £103,000 is also to be appropriated to meet the expenditure of the present financial year for  the Council  for Science and Industrial Research, £71,000 of which is to be obtained from the trust account. A study of the items of expenditure in this department discloses that there is a remarkable similitude between the subjects invest gated by that council and the Department of Health. A close examination would disclose a good deal of over.lapping in the activities of those two  departments  irrespective of the extent to  which they in turn overlap the activities of State departments performing similar functions. This is a clear instance in which Commonwealth expenditure can be materially reduced, and the disinclination on the part of the Government to exercise economy in this regard shows its incapacity and ineptitude in handling Commonwealth finance. </para>

                    <para>-. - I intend to support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James),</inline> as in the present circumstances an expenditure of £3,000 to meet the travelling expenses of Ministers is unjustified. During recent weeks, the attention of this Parliament has been devoted almost entirely to reducing pensions of invalids, the aged, the salaries of public servants, and the maternity allowance. From time to time we have been informed of the necessity for equality of sacrifice, but in this instance Ministers of the Crown who are in receipt of a substantial allowance, and. are also provided with free transport, will not make any real sacrifice. We have been informed that the finances of this country are in a precarious condition, and the banks are threatening the Government that unless economies are effected no further accommodation will be made available. While the Government has exerted its energies in reducing the payments in some instances almost to the last penny of those who can ill afford to make any sacrifice, its members who enjoy privileges which have never been experienced by these unfortunate people are to participate in an expenditure of £3,000 which is wholly unwarranted. Is it not- time that Ministers who have many facilities at their disposal, should make some sacrifice? Members of this Parliament, particularly those representing extensive electorates in Queensland and Western Australia, incur considerable expense out of their own pockets, and it is time that Ministers met their expenditure in the same way. One could give Ministers credit for some sincerity if they made some sacrifice; but it appears that, while. they are anxious to extract the last penny from the unfortunate pensioners, they intend to fight to the last ditch any interference with the rights and privileges which they now enjoy. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> to delete the item of £3,000 for the travelling expenses of Commonwealth Ministers. The right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> said that, if I wished to be logical, I should move for the deletion of all travelling allowances. If every member of the Commonwealth Public Service received a travelling allowance of 30s. a day the position would be different. The Prime Minister  must  realize that there are many public servants, such as messengers, who receive a comparatively small salary, who could not be expected to meet their own travelling expenses. </para>

                        <para>- I am not. I \vish to deal with the Prime Minister's assertion that, if I wish to he logical, I should move for the deletionof all travelling allowances. Public servants in receipt of  £4  a week should not be asked to make the same sacrifices as Ministers of the Crown, who, in some  cases,  receive salaries amounting to £4 or £5 a day. If it were proposed to cut out the travelling allowances of all government employees receiving £750 a year and over, I should support it. That would discourage Ministers, heads of departments, and other public servants from travelling unduly. </para>

                        <para>- We shall see. The total expenditure for the year 1931-32 is estimated at £103,322. I understand, however, that none of this will be a charge on the current revenues of the Commonwealth; that there is in existence a trust fund which permits of at least £71,000 of it being expended therefrom, and that it is anticipated that the balance will be met from certain revenues and savings that are effected by the council. </para>

                <para>This council was brought into existence in 1926, and an amount of £250,000 was appropriated from revenue to establish the trust fund. Subsequently, there was another equal appropriation for the same purpose, making a total of £500,000. Up to the 30th June, 1929, the sum of £205,781 had been spent. The expenditure for the year 1929-30  was  £99,867, and for the year that has just closed it apparently was £112,067. As an honorable member said earlier of the Australian representation in the United States of America, we are entitled to inquire what benefits the Commonwealth receives from this expenditure. </para>
                <para>We might, with advantage, here glance at the reports of the council. In the latest report, that for the year ended the 30th June, 1930, there appears the following sentence:- </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The work of the council is being pushed forwardas fast as practicable in full recognition of the fact that the establishment of primary production on a more profitable basis is a vital factor in the present economic and financial situation of the Commonwealth, and in the restoration of prosperous conditions. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That language has a very familiar ring. Another sentence is - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Whilst governments and the nation as a whole have their own role to play in the reduction of costs of production and in increasing efficiency, science can take an equally important part. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">But the report does not indicate the extent to which the activities of the council will promote that end. Its work is related exclusively to material factors. Its operations are devoted chiefly to plant industries, animal nutrition - not that of human beings; animal health - not that of human beings; and so forth. On the whole, without reflecting in any way upon the good work that the council may be, and probably is, doing, it may be said that there is evidence of extraordinary inconsistency in the expenditure of the vast sum that is involved, without any attempt being made apparently to consider even the overlapping with, for example, the Health Department, that a previous  speaker  referred to. Hundreds of thousands of pounds are being spent, and will continue to .be spent, without any attempt at reconstruction, either financial "or to achieve the general objectives of the organization as an agency of genuine science. This, I think, has been brought about chiefly by the fact that it is an organization which was based upon the reports of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Heath, who was brought from England to this country by the previous Federal Government,- doubtless at a considerable fee. The initial report furnished <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> that gentleman bristled with such words as " scientific ", " industrial ", and so forth; but a sinister silence was maintained in regard to the human and social factor of existence, without which such words are barren of intelligent meaning, viewing larger aspects of life, and especially in the light of existing circumstances.  Apparently  the basic principle was that this organization should secure the confidence of every one in Australia and abroad, except the workers in industry, and their trade union and parliamentary representatives. It may be urged in defence of that gentleman, that this was not his business; but even if we concede this, it was certainly the business of those who were in office and in power at that time. To-day we have to consider whether, in view of the drastic cuts that have been imposed on the most defenceless section of the community, expenditure of this kind is justified. We are entitled to ask whether this is not another example of riotous extravagance that calls for immediate attention. It seems strange to me that while the Government has surrendered those principles which brought it into power, it apparently is either blind or indifferent to the equity of effecting economies in expenditure of this nature. Other honorable members have spoken of the necessity for a revision of items of this type, and I endorse their views. It would be idle to say that this country is not in need of some council of a scientific nature, and I should not like  my remarks  to convey the impression that I do not believe in the application of scientific principles to the affairs of this country. But apart from the economies that might be effected directly, the time has surely arrived for insisting that the work of this council shall include social science activities bearing on the human factor in industry and society in general. I consider that a very good case can be made out for the establishment of consumer economics and home welfare organizations, such as have been established in the United States of America, and in several parts of Europe. One of the greatest of the controlling forces in the economic situation to-day is the purchasing power of the home-maker. Is not that something which is entitled to be given some semblance of scientific consideration? The true conception of Australia is, not merely that of a nation of 6,500,000 persons, but of a community of about 2,000,000 homes. About four-fifths of the nation's retail spending is in the hands of women, who are thus the ultimate controlling force in every avenue of production and distribution. The welfare of the child is inextricably bound up with a home life, which is satisfactory psychologically, materially, and spiritually, and is conserved and promoted only to the extent that its interests are fostered and directed with the fullest advantages of modern science in the most wise application of the laws of nature. The womanhood and motherhood of Australia would strongly support activities such as these. It surely  is  a  tragic commentary on Australian civilization that there is no Federal Government agency to deal with these problems. Although Australian scientists have visited the United States of America, I have found no record of reports having been submitted to the Commonwealth Government of the activities in that country in the direction of the establishment of women's and children's bureaux, and the consideration of human and home economics. In that country problems concerning the welfare of the child are regarded as of paramount importance, as is shown by the conferences held there periodically. Some of these, including the "White House conference on child welfare, and motherhood problems, are of an international character, and have been conducted under the personal presidency .of the  President  of the United States of America. I suggest that, instead of passing estimates involving great expenditure on activities that are comparatively inconsequential, some attention should be paid to more constructive and socially urgent work, such as I have outlined, on which the ex- penditure would be better justified, t is difficult to find any infor.mation regarding the sessions of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Apparently, only two meetings «f the full council are held annually. In view of the general desire for economy, the Government would be well advised to give careful attention to the activities of this body, with a view to effecting Savings of a real character and its entire reorganization. In its investigations, it should pay due regard to social science and the human factor in industry. </para>

                    <para>. - It is due to the members of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research that I should say that their work has proved of real value to. Australia. The expenditure contemplated for this year represents a decrease compared with last year. There will be no expenditure from revenue this financial year, because- £71,000 is being provided from the trust fund, and £32,643 has been contributed from outside sources. Another £14,000 has been received from outside sources since the Estimates have been prepared. </para>

To show that the work of this body is of practical value to the country, I may mention thai the Empire Marketing Board has provided £5,071 for the investigation of animal health, the Australian Pastoral Research Trust £2,071, the Queensland Government £1,000, the United Graziers Association of Queensland £1,000, and the meat export industry £1,000. In addition to those sums, the Empire Marketing Board contributes £9,700 for the investigation of plant diseases, and £7,351 for entomological research. Other important items are - Rural Credits Development Fund, £1,000; Empire Marketing Board, £1,475; and Australian Pastoral Research Trust, £1,475, for the investigation of animal nutrition ; and the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission of New South Wales, £1,500 for horiticultural investigation. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has asked for practical results, and, when I give instances of them, ho turns to another matter. The work of the council could be extended to other activities, but all that it accomplishes will be of assistance to the community in increasing production. The discovery of the <inline font-style="italic">cactoblastis,</inline> for the eradication of the prickly pear was of immeasurable importance. I believe from reports that the council is meeting with success in its efforts to cope with that noxious weed know as St. John's Wort, which is prevalent in Victoria, and if the success is as great as is promised, it will be of worldwide importance. The discovery of the  cause of blue mould in tobacco will be of enormous benefit to that industry, and a similar remark applies to the water blister which affects pineapples. I have mentioned but a few of the investigations that have been undertaken by the council. When we find that organizations like the United Graziers Association of Queensland is contributing its cash to the work, it shows that great faith is placed in the labours of the council. It is true that many years may be spent before practical results are achieved in particular directions. But the results likely to be obtained are of such far-reaching importance that they will more than justify the expenditure involved. The suggestions of the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge)</inline> are worthy of consideration, and the Government regrets that owing to the financial position the activities of this body have been restricted. </para>

He mentioned that years may elapse before practical results are obtained in certain directions; but the members of the council are a most enthusiastic body, and they are giving their best services to Australia. I regret that the Government has found it necessary r,o restrict the expenditure on this work for the present year. Every new discovery made by the council will result in an enormous increase in Australia's productivity. Such investigations as those into animal health and plant diseases are of the utmost value to this country, and I hope that the Government will do its utmost to keep the personnel of this organization at its full strength. </para>

                    <para>.Too much importance cannot be attached to the work of this body. I point out that we have a staff of men in Canberra who are giving attention at the present time to the very matter that has been raised by the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge). Sir Colin</inline> MacKenzie and his staff are particularly interested in human muscular development. Scientists throughout the world have drawn attention to the failure of the nervous system of man to maintain a standard of strength sufficient to cope with the demands of modern life. I would like to see a greatly increased vote given to. the scientists, who are engaged by the council. I cannot allow the statement to go unchallenged that Australia is not paying proper attention to the physical development of the human race. We should give full credit to those who are doing valuable work for the community under unfavorable circumstances. I believe  that some of these officers have voluntarily surrendered a considerable percentage of their salaries, and, in view of the importance of the branch, I consider that they should not have been included in the retrenchment scheme even at such a critical time as the present. </para>

                    <para>. - I was pleased to hear the criticism of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> of the remarks made by the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge)</inline> who displayed a lamentable lack of knowledge concerning the functions of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Other honorable members were similarly in the dark, one  speaker  even confusing the council with the Health Department, If honorable members had studied the bulletins issued by the council they would know that already it has saved Australia many millions of pounds in connexion with prickly pear and other pests, and would have realized also that, in the fulfilment of its functions, it will bring material benefit to wage-earners also. The staff is a comparatively small one for the immense amount of research work that is being carried out. I also remind the honorable member for Martin that the other  members of the council's personnel he was worried about were scientists attached to our various universities. Their services are co-opted, and they meet twice a year to further the work of the council. Reference has also been made to the representation of the Commonwealth in the United States of America. Last year the CommissionerGeneral voluntarily retired from his position, because, in view of the difficult financial position that 'was then developing, he believed Australia could not afford to continue the expenditure, and in his report he admitted that Australia could not expect to derive much trade benefit from representation in the United States of America. The salary of the office has been saved by his retirement, and the duties are now being carried out with a minimum staff. Much time might have been saved in this debate if honorable members had taken the trouble to make themselves conversant with all the facts in connexion with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and our representation in the United States of America. </para>

                    <para>. - Although the pruning knife has been applied fairly heavily, I believe further economies are possible. Considerable expenditure on travelling allowances must, I assume, be incurred by the Governor-General, the Public Service Board, and the Auditor-General, but I believe it is possible to make further savings in allowances to the various departments. I do not intend to vote for the amendment, because I feel sure that the Government will do what is possible to improve the position in this respect. The cost of our representation in the United States of America has been reduced from £11,228 in 1930-31 to an estimated expenditure for this year of £6,518, or a saving of £4,700. I wish to pay my tribute to the patriotic action of the ex-Commissioner-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> Brookes, who resigned last year. He and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Brookes</inline> rendered signal service to the Commonwealth during the period of his appointment. I shall be glad if the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> will furnish information with reference to the cost of Australia House for the years 1929-30 and 1930-31, together with the estimate of expenditure for this year. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not concerned at the moment with the closing of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales; I am more concerned with the opening of the bank, and with seeing that its 500,000 depositors get a fair deal. They may reside in the State of New South Wales, but they are all citizens of the Commonwealth, and as such the Commonwealth Government owes a responsibility to them just as it does to all other citizens of the Commonwealth. Surely the Government has some policy to submit with regard to the taking over of the Savings Bank, and its relations to the Commonwealth Bank! I admit, as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> said in reply to a question, that every case must be decided on its merits; but I hold that these 500,000 depositors in the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales should not be allowed to be the sport, so to speak, of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> on the one hand, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson on the other. There may be some desire on the part of the Commonwealth Bank Board to discipline the Premier of New South Wales, but I submit that it should not be done at the expense of these 500,000 depositors. </para>

                <para>During the course of a discussion on land tax valuations, certain remarks were made in reference to the Taxation Board of Review, which came somewhat as a surprise to me because from my association with the business community of Sydney, and from what I know of the work of the board, I believe that it. occupies a very high place in the confidence of, and is held in groat respect by, taxpayers generally. It is performing a very important and valuable function in connexion with appeals which do not inflict upon the appellants the heavy costs appertaining to appeals to courts. </para>

                    <para>. - The Treasury takes the profit. Under this heading there is an increase of £7,900. Increased coinage has been necessitated by the withdrawal by the public of British silver coins in order to gain advantage from the exchange position, and because the hoarding of silver has caused a depletion in the stocks held by the banks. </para>

                    <para>. - Provision is made for the payment of £2,093 to cover expenditure incurred in connexion with the recent inquiry into the sugar industry. It is a further indication of carelessness in the expenditure of public money. The report upon sugar was a report of partisans all of whom were engaged in the industry, and was therefore of no real value to the community. A report of real value to the public would have been a recommendation that there should be a substantial reduction in the price of sugar; but as the report recommended a continuation of the already excessive price of sugar which is levied upon every working man and housewife, I think the expenditure incurred was a waste of money. The inquiry was not such as to give the public confidence in those who made it, or to create the impression  that it was a fair and square investigation of the sugar industry. I must protest against the action of the Government which has permitted the price of sugar to remain at the present exorbitant figure. </para>

Claims amounting to about  £6,000  have so far been made by New South Wales, in pursuance of an arrangement made by the former Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> for the payment of1s. per ton on all coal exported, except to New Zealand. The remaining  £19,000  is still in the fund to be drawn upon. </para>

                <para class="block">Seeing that Australia is already practically disarmed the Government can do no more than it has done to encourage international disarmament. Actions are better than precepts, and deeds are better than words in a matter of this kind. If this money is spent it will only provide another picnic trip overseas for a Minister. Four Ministers of this Government have already had a trip overseas at the expense of the taxpayers, and there is no justificationwhatever for sending another Minister abroad. I look upon these visits as holiday trips in the main, although I know that the Prime Minister will dispute this view. If the sending of another Minister abroad would do anything to encourage disarmament, something might be said in favour of the voting of this money; but Australia has already set an example to the world, and that is the best thing that she can do. It is remarkable how quickly the members of the Government took advantage of their office to take picnic jaunts abroad. I know that I have been making some pertinent - some honorable members called them impertinent - inquiries into certain matters, and perhaps Ministers are quite willing to get away from me; but I shall continue to object to the expenditure of public funds on travelling allowances, overseas picnic jaunts, and the like while the country is in its present deplorable economic condition. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire the Prime Minister to give me some information about the following items :- </para>
                </talk.start>
                <quote>
                    <para>Grant to Australian Empire branch of Empire Parliament Association, £250. Towards maintenance of Cockatoo Island Dockyard on nucleus basis, £42,000. Repairs to plant and buildings at Cockatoo Island  Dockyard  £10,000. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>What is done with the  £250  voted for the Empire Parliamentary Association ? </para>
                <para>I understand that the Shipping Board has control of certain funds of its own for operations at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Is the amount of  £52,000  provided in these Estimates an additional sum to be spent in maintenance and repairs to plant and buildings at the dockyard? If it is, it will be very acceptable at the present time. </para>
                <para>I support the amendment of the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> for the deletion of the item, " World conference on reduction and limitation of armaments,  £2,000."  The Government cannot possibly justify this expenditure at present. About two years ago the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, attended a Disarmament Conference in London as the representative of the Commonwealth Government; but I have yet to learn that anything useful was accomplished at that conference. It would be useless for the Government to send a representative to another Disarmament Conference. Australia, as has already been pointed out, is already practically disarmed. In view of the attacks that have been made upon pensions, wages and social services in this country, we should insist that the expenditure of  £2,000  in providing what would amount to a holiday overseas for a Minister, is entirely unwarranted. There has already been a good deal of criticism concerning the expenditure involved in connexion with the recent tripe abroal by Ministers. Public attention has already been focussed on the fact that the Prime Minister, who attended the recent Imperial Conference, had an opportunity to discuss, from an Australian view-point, the question of disarmament with other delegates at that conference. The Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> was also in London at the same time to discuss with other delegates at that conference certain trade matters affecting Australia and the dominions. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> was Australia's representative at the Tenth Assembly of the League of Nations,, and the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> was Australia's delegate at the International Labour Conference of the League of Nations. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran, the Solicitor-General, and other Commonwealth officials were also members of the delegation. I bring these facts under the notice of the Prime Minister in view of the criticism which, undoubtedly, will be levelled against the action of the Government in proposing to send a representative to the forthcoming Disarmament Conference In view of the fact that quite a number of Ministers have recently visited Great Britain, the Government's proposed action in this instance cannot be justified, and I think it would be wise if this item of expenditure were deleted. </para>

An additional sum of £10,000 is also provided for the maintenance of plant and equipment. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so, but it is a valuable asset which cannot bo allowed to go to disrepair. As a large amount of capital has been expended at Cockatoo Island, the Government cannot allow what is, perhaps, the most valuable plant of its kind in Australia, to get into a state of disrepair. I regret that a further sum cannot be made available for this purpose. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> also referred to criticisms which will be levelled against the Government for providing <inline font-style="italic">£2,000</inline> for a representative .of the Commonwealth to attend the forthcoming Disarmament Conference. It is quite true that there may be some criticism, but it will not be well-founded. Proposed expenditure is usually criticized, but that criticism becomes more acute during periods of depression. The honorable member has said that at least four Ministers have visited Great Britain on official business during the last twenty months, but he should realize that the circumstances have been exceptional. In connexion with the Naval Disarmament Conference the Government hesitated for some time before sending a delegate, but T was very pleased with the way in which the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Fenton),</inline> who waa then Minister for Trade and Customs, represented Australia at that most important gathering. Imperial Conferences are held once in every three years, and our representation at the last of such gatherings was the smallest and most inexpensive that Australia has ever sent. The honorable member also referred to the presence in London of the Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> who performed excellent work, not only in London, but also in Canada. </para>

                        <para>- No, but the honorable member referred to the outside criticism which will be levelled against the Government, which. I am now endeavouring to meet. I know that it is easy to refer to such trips as picnics, but as one who has had some experience in attending such gatherings, I have no hesitation in saying that the work imposed upon Ministers on such occasions is of a most arduous nature, and cannot be regarded as in any sense a picnic. . The experience which Ministers gain abroad is of great advantage, but it' is belittling the services which public men render to their country to refer to the trips which they make as picnics. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> represented Australia at the last Assembly of the League of Nations, where Australia has, up to the present, always been  represented. This will be the first occasion on which the Commonwealth has not sent a representative from Australia to the League. Although a Minister is not being sent, we shall be well represented. In view of our present financial position, it is the desire of the Government to effect economies wherever possible. The forthcoming assembly will be comparatively unimportant as compared with the conference to be held in February. This is the first attempt which the League has made to convene a general disarmament conference, and, if this Government stands for anything, it is for general disarmament. </para>

As efforts are being made in that direction, we should show the world what we are doing, and induce others to follow our example.

I agree with the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> that this is an important international gathering, and, as the party which I have the honour to lead favours world peace, the Government should be represented at the first international conference on general disarmament. Where there are armaments there is always the danger of war.

                    <para>. - This money is expended in assisting Australians who, being stranded in London, wish to return to Australia. In most cases money is available, after investigation, in the form of a loan, which is repaid by the friends or relatives of those receiving it. When those wishing to be repatriated have no friends to repay the -money advanced, it is paid in the form of a grant. Instances have occurred in which girls have left Australia to go to London to try their fortunes, and have eventually become stranded. When the parents of such persons are unable to pay their return fare, a thorough investigation is made, and, if the case is genuine, assistance is rendered. The money is usually repaid, sometimes over a period of years. </para>

                        <para>- If Germany makes certain claims which are refused by the other nations, she may withdraw from the League of Nations and claim the. right to arm herself, which may precipitate another war involving practically every other nation. Great Britain's armaments have been steadily reduced until the personnel of the British Navy is now  20,000  below that of the United States of America. Great Britain is the only nation which is in a weaker position than at the termination of the Great War. I suggest that this amount be not allocated, and that, if the conference does eventuate, the Prime Minister should delegate an Australian naval expert in the Royal Navy, or some other authority who is at present in Great Britain, to represent Australia at it. That would be. much better than having the Attorney-General posturing as he did at Geneva, and with no knowledge of the subject, informing the nations of the world that Australia had already disarmed. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the deletion of this amount. I am not so confident as some speakers of the benefits that might accrue as a result of our being represented at a so-called disarmament conference. There is no disguising the fact that some nations, particularly those who participated in the last Great War, desire a holiday in the matter of armaments, because they feel that they cannot help themselves; they have either to reduce their armaments to a minimum, or face national bankruptcy and internal disruption, such as Germany is experiencing to-day. But' in every country the scientists are devoting the whole of their time, not in the interests of humanity, to the preservation of peace, but to devising the most dreadful means by which human life may be destroyed. That proves conclusively that the nations are desirous not of preserving world peace, but of making the destruction of human life much cheaper by the use of poisonous gases, and the adoption of other hideous methods. 1 do not share the view of some honorable members that the last war was a war to end all wars. So long as the competitive system operates, and the capitalists of different countries compete with each other for spheres of influence, economic conflict eventually will lead to armed conflict. The only way in which we can move towards peace is by altering the social order under which we live.- So long as there is competition for markets we shall  be faced with the possibility of war ; and it will be on a larger and more destructive scale than the last conflict. </para>

                <para>The Government's solicitude for the welfare of humanity, and the preservation of peace, can be gauged by turning to page 271 of the Estimates, where it will be found that only £500 is provided for subsidies and expenses in connexion with maternal and infantile hygiene, while the subsidy for cattle tick control in Queensland and New South Wales amounts to £44,450. That is  a  striking illustration of the attitude of the Government towards the preservation of human life. To-day human life is the cheapest commodity procurable. Conference after conference has been held for the purpose of bringing about dis-. armament. I notice that Australia's share of the expenses of the secretariat of the League of Nations amounts to £30,000. I have not yet seen any advantage accrue to this country because of its participation in these conferences. Some speakers have said that this will be a pleasure trip, or a holiday, for a Minister or some other person who is regarded favorably by the Government. I agree that that is exactly what it will be. I have  do  doubt of what the result will be, and I shall vote for the amendment with  a  view to saving this country £2,000. </para>

                    <para>. - It will be observed that the sum of £52,000 is to be spent on Cockatoo Island dockyard this year. In addition, the dockyard is being given a preference amounting to £50,000 in connexion with the lighthouse steamer that is being built there. Therefore, in effect it is being subsidized to the extent of practically £2,000 a week at the expense of the Commonwealth revenues. I consider that the public should be supplied with information as to the benefits that an conferred by the dockyard which warrant that contribution being made to keep it in existence. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> argues that the expenditure is justified, because a large quantity of valuable machinery would otherwise lie idle. I contend, however, that an expenditure of £100,000 per annum for the purpose is not economic, and cannot be afforded. Another aspect of the matter is that this subsidy, which is made with the taxpayers' money, enables the dockyard to compete with Morts Dock, and the enterprise of the State Government at Walsh Island, in which large sums that have also been contributed by the taxpayers are invested. </para>

Although the desirability of preserving peace is everywhere proclaimed, all the European nations that sit in conference to consider the question of disarmament are preparing for future wars by building armaments as fast as circumstances will allow. At the present time, Germany is appealing for assistance to establish herself economically, but concurrently is building a number of new battleships. France, on the other hand, refuses to grant her assistance so long as she continues that policy. </para>

                <para>Tho Prime Minister claims that the expenditure on the repatriation of distressed Australians abroad is justifiable. 1 say that it is also justifiable to give some assistance to good Australian citizens who are starving in this country, and whose cases have been brought under his notice from time to time. He has absolutely refused to grant such requests, the pretext being that it is a matter for the States. If it is logical to say that those who are hungry and who desire medical attention are the responsibility of the States, it is equally logical to say that the relief of distressed Australians abroad is also a matter for the States, because those persons come from some State or another; or that they should be the responsibility of the country in which they are domiciled. </para>
                <para>An amount of £100 is provided for this year for the entertainment of visitors. Last year, the sum of £200 was appropriated, of which £182 was spent.- I do not suppose that these visitors are on the dole, or that they are hungry and footsore. Probably they are wellfed. It would be more fitting if we spent the £100 provided for their entertainment in feeding some of the hungry members of our community. </para>
                <para>The sum of £3,000 is set down to defray the expenses of an investigation into the tobacco-growing industry. I should like the Prime Minister to explain how that amount will be expended, and who the recipients will be. I notice that £343 was spent last year, and £150 is voted this year in connexion with the Premiers Con ferences. How is this money expended) Am I to understand that the salaries of the State Premiers cease when they attend these conferences? </para>

No new expenditure is involved. The Government expects that £2,000 of this sum will be contributed from outside sources, which will reduce the actual government expenditure to one-third of the proposed vote. It is also anticipated that a considerable revenue will be derived when the film dealing with the expedition is released. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask the Attorney-General to furnish me with all the available information relating to the Commonwealth Investigation Branch in Sydney. I wish to know how many officers are employed, and who they are. I am particularly anxious to know whether a man named Longmore is still engaged as an investigation officer. He is the person who was responsible for "framing" Jacob Johnson, and providing the necessary faked evidence on which he was railroaded into prison for six months, to suit the political ends of certain individuals. What are Longmore's qualifications for his present position? How long has he been in Australia, and what have been his associations in other countries? It is common knowledge that he was a "Black and Tan " in Ireland, before he came to Australia, where he was pitchforked into a job as an investigation officer by the late Government. He has had a lot to say in public places about me, because of my efforts to expose his methods of securing evidence and he has used language of a nature that is sufficient to enablehim to be put in a place where he will probably be quiet for some time. What need is there for this Investigation Branch more particularly when it is said to be essential to reduce governmental expenditure. Can the Attorney-General furnish sufficient evidence to establish the necessity for the continued employment of these officers? So far as I have been able to ascertain, they merely serve political ends. If the honorable gentleman can give us information upon the points I have raised, we may be able to follow it up at a later stage, and in more favorable circumstances. </para>

Recently, when a newspaper representative took, or was handed documents from a government file, and used the information thus obtained, the Attorney-General's Department immediately took action against him; hut apparently it is quite unable to do anything for a man who has been " framed " and railroaded to gaol on corrupt, faked and false evidence. It is not even able to locate certain documents belonging to the man in question. I hope that these papers will be produced at an early date. .  </para>

Last year, the same amount waa provided, but the actual expenditure was £1,018. If last year's estimate was exceeded by nearly £300, the logical thing to do this year would be to place on the Estimates, not £750, but the higher amount expended last year, unless the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> can show that the actual expenditure will be kept within the sum estimated. I am not clear whether- the item refei'3 to the Minister's private secretary, or to the secretary of the department. As the expenditure on travelling allowances in all the departments is very considerable, there should be the closest scrutiny with a view to effecting economies. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that this is definitely the function of the Registrar of Copyrights. Australian books intended for publication are submitted to him, and if, in his opinion, they are not fit for publication, the copyright is withheld. In this way, Australian authors are placed at a disadvantage compared with American authors, because, as I have stated, imported books of questionable taste, for the most part American, are admitted through the customs, and are allowed to go into circulation, whereas an Australian publication has to survive a much stricter censorship, [f the Registrar of Copyrights were authorized to censor imported, as well as Australian books, the position of Australian authors would be much more satisfactory, and we should have a better class of literature in circulation. </para>

                    <para>.- The figures relating to the average cost of living are compiled from the cost of living figures in certain towns, whilst other towns are excluded. This is a matter which has already been referred to the department, but has not yet been rectified. In this respect the people of Port Augusta, in which town a large number of railway employees are located, are of the opinion that they have been unfairly treated, but the reply of the department has been that they are not. Therefore, the Minister in his reply need not deal with the position at Port Augusta. There are, however, many other large towns in South Australia, particularly in Eyre's Peninsula, whose citizens think themselves unfairly treated by the way in which the average cost of living figures are compiled, and I should like the Minister to indicate whether any consideration has been given to their request that more towns should be included among those upon whose cost of living figures the average cost is compiled. </para>

The figure thus arrived at has been accepted, generally without demur, except in isolated instances such as Port Augusta, and Eyre Peninsula. Up to date there has been no good reason for adding to the number, but I am constantly investigating various phases of the cost of living figures and shall continue to do so, and if I see that there is a definite need for increasing the number of towns used as a basis for compiling the average I shall certainly recommend an increase. </para>

Ships or Establishments, and no parliamentary candidates or canvassers or political agents are to be allowed to visit H.M. Ships or Establishments. Any form of political activity on board H.M. Ships or in any Naval Establishments is prohibited. </para>

                <para>The lower deck as  a  whole are very sore and discontented at their inability, because of the foregoing articles, to voice any opinion whatsoever, and this discontent is intensified when an erroneous statement creates  a  false impression. </para>
                <para>The Minister for Defence stated that an able seaman's pay was £4 5s. 2d. per week. In direct contradiction to this the Naval Board in 1924 published a booklet entitled " How to join the R.A.N.", and therein gave the rate of pay for an able seaman as £2 9s. per week, plus 12s. 3d. per week deferred pay. This booklet also states that deferred pay can be forfeited for misconduct or if a man is discharged at his own request before expiration of his time; therefore deferred pay is really a bonus for good conduct and long service, and was instituted in lieu of the pension system of the Royal Navy. </para>
                <para>An able seaman's pay is 7s. per diem, plus 7d. clothing allowance; this clothing allowance entails the upkeep of a comprehensive kit, including bed and bedding. </para>
                <para>The Honorable Minister in his computation of our pay allows 2s. 3d. per diem lodging and living allowance, which we cannot understand, as the victualling allowance was1s.8d. per man, and has recently been reduced to1s. 5d. (the press states1s. 7d., Which is incorrect), so we presume the balance of the aforementioned 2s. 3d. is represented in our " Quarters " (bedding being already covered by clothing allowance). At any rate, this 2s. 3d. lodging and living allowance is not credited to us when we are ashore, Week-ends, &amp;c. ; except when on annual leave we are paid the. victualling allowance of1s. 5d. per day, Which will not pay for one meal, let alone three and a bed. </para>
                <para>After three years good conduct man's time, an able Seaman receives a good conduct badge worth3d. and a progressive of 2d. per day. </para>
                <para>If an A.B. is married he receives 2s. per day marriage allowance and 6d. for each child, which makes his pay as follows:- </para>

                <para>Total - £2 13s.1d. per week. </para>
                <para>Further, I would like to state that a man serving in the Fleet whose home is in Melbourne travels home on leave twice a year, the return fare being £56s., making a total of £10 12s., which is equivalent to about 7d. per day for the whole year. Roughly, 40 per cent. of the personnel of the R.A.N. are domiciled in Melbourne. Ratings from other States are in a far worse position. Understanding the financial emergency, we quite realize we should bear our share of the burden thrust on the community, but do not consider we should be cut any more than any other branch of the Federal Public Service. </para>
                <para>Hoping that this letter will receive due consideration, </para>
                <para>I remain, your obedient servant, </para>
                <para class="block">I have no doubt that the Minister will be able to give me some information in reply to the statements in that letter, but the discrepancy between the payment of the men on the lower deck, such- as the able-bodied seaman, married, with one child, £3 10s. 7d. per seven-day week, and the rear-admiral at £5 per day, needs some explanation. More consideration should be given to the men on the lower deck. The pay of the different ranks from top to bottom should certainly be- equalized to some extent. </para>
                <para>On page 134, certain particulars are given of the expenditure at the naval depot and dockyard at Garden Island. I ask the Minister to tell us how the administration expenses on the island compare with the amount spent on wages to employees. It is well known that the conditions of the employees of the dockyard are not entirely satisfactory. Not much work is being done there just now, and a good deal of that which is available is being done by naval ratings, which is unfair to the skilled workers on the island. A very severe scheme of rationing is in operation there; for instance boiler makers and electricians are rationed one week in eight, moulders and coppersmiths, one week in two;  engineeers,  one week in four; pattern makers, one week in two; painters, one week in two; riggers, one week in eight; storemen, one week in ten ; and ironworkers' assistants, one week in six. In these circumstances it is desirable that some comparison should be made between the administrative costs and the actual working expenses. </para>

                    <para>. - I, too, would like some information about the expenditure of this department, which I regard as the most extravagant of all our departments. Unfortunately, the manner in which the Defence Estimates are prepared makes it difficult if not impossible, for honorable members to obtain reliable detailed information.

                <para>I direct attention to the fact that the secretary to the department draws a salary of £2,000 per annum. Other high salaries are: - Defence Liaison officer in London, £2,000 per annum; Assistant secretary, £1,012 per annum; Finance secretary, £1,112 per annum; and Director of Works, £864 per annum. We all know that some extensive pruning has been done in this department in the last two years, with the result that its activities have been very greatly curtailed. Consequently, even though the secretary may have been entitled to a salary of £2,000 per annum two years ago, he cannot claim that amount at present owing to the extensive curtailment of the activities of his department. In any case, it seems to me that the payment of this salary to one man cannot be justified in view of the fact that the lower branches of the service are paid at the very inadequate rates mentioned by the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward).</inline></para>
                <para>When we refer to other pages of the Estimates for this department, we see that the policy of grouping has been carried out to a greater extent than in any other department. I have had some experience of this department, for when the present Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> was Minister for Defence he had to visit Western Australia on one occasion, and I had to deal with certain of the business of his department. It was a common thing for the officers to produce files for signature without any satisfactory detailed explanation. In fact, one had to demand details if he wanted any specific information. </para>
                <para>I shall now proceed to refer to particular items on the Estimates in respect of which I desire information. On page 139, expenditure amounting to £S30,000 is grouped in one sum. One item which is specified is " Rear-Admiral, £5 per day ". On the next page, which covers permanent naval forces, seagoing, I find the following rates of pay specified : - " Engineer captain, £3 15s. per day; engineer commanders, £2 17s. per day; engineer lieutenant-commanders, £1 18s. per day",1 and so on. Does the Government intend to maintain these high rates of pay to these officers in view of the fact that the men on lower rungs are paid such miserable rates? On page 121, provision is made for paymaster commanders at £2 12s. per day; paymaster lieutenantcommanders at £1 14s. per day, and so on. On page 123, an amount of £250  is provided for recruiting expenses. I. am not aware that any recruiting is being done at present for the naval service. On page 125, medical services are dealt with, but no details are given. On page 126 provision is made for the expenditure of £3,952 on the Royal Australian Naval College. 1 should like an explanation of how this money is to be spent. The details of the payment to the various officers should be given. It is not fair that votes should be bunched together in this way. "We have a right to know exactly what emoluments the officers of this department are enjoying. On page 128 an amount of £3,842 is provided for commanders, and £1,250 for lieutenantcommanders of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve. What is the pay which each of these individuals draws? On page 130 provision is made for captains, commanders, surgeon commanders, surgeon lieutenant-commanders, surgeon lieutenants, and so on, of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, and the following note appears at the bottom of the page: - " Paid for services rendered at rates prescribed in regulations." Where are the regulations to be seen, and what do they prescribe? Provision is made on page 134 for the payment of £400 to a sub.inspector of police. "Does this officer work in connexion with the police organization of the naval dockyard? On page 140, an amount of £S,000 is provided for " payments in lieu of furlough." Why cannot the persons concerned take their furlough? If necessity arises for work to be done while they are on furlough, it could be given to other, persons, and probably help to relieve unemployment to some slight extent. On page 142, provision is made for the payment of well over £100,000 to brigadiers, colonels, lieutenant-colonels, majors, captains, and lieutenants. I object to the- grouping of this- amount, and ask the Minister to give me the details of the payments to each individual officer. Provision  i3  made on page 153 for the expenditure of £2,010 to meet the cost of certain professors engaged at the Royal Military College. Will the Minister state the amount which each professor receives ? Again, on page. 157, the salaries of ordnance mechanical en- gineers are grouped. On page 165 there is an item of £20,500 for the " maintenance and replacement of arms, armament, equipment and general stores." Can the Minister say what equipment will be required under this heading, and whether it will be manufactured in this country, perhaps in the electorate represented by the Minister, or is it to be imported ? </para>

                    <para>. - As I have on previous occasions spoken at length on defence generally, I do not propose to detain the committee at this juncture. There are, however, several matters in connexion with civil aviation upon which I should like to obtain some information from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley).</inline> Although the proposed vote for civil aviation has been reduced, I am pleased to find that it has not been cut too drastically. The amount provided will enable civil aviation to function fairly effectively, without which Australia would drop back in the race with other nations. In a country such as Australia, with its vast open spaces, it is absolutely essential to encourage the development of civil aviation in order to assist the transport of mails and passengers to the remote parts of the Commonwealth, and by that means bring those who live in a state of comparative isolation in closer contact with those in the more populous centres. The </para>

                <para class="block">Aerial Medical Service, operating in Queensland under the control of the Australian Inland Mission, saves more lives by transporting the sick to receive medical and hospital attention than have been lost as a result of flying in Australia.. Aviation annihilates time and space, and its development will be of great assistance in establishing closer economic relations between these Dominions and  s  between them and the heart of this great Empire. As the Dominions grow and their power increases, aviation will be an important factor in securing' world peace. The people of Australia are now awakening to its possibilities. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> I agree with the view expressed by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> that more detailed information should be made available in the Estimates. I have, however, been able to obtain certain data in regard to which I desire some information from the Minister. I am pleased to find that the contributions to aero clubs, which are carrying out such useful work in training pilots, and will be of considerable assistance in the matter of defence, are to be maintained. I notice that there is a disparity between the contributions paid to such clubs. In one instance £40 is paid for each pilot who qualifies, while to other schools only £20 is paid. I should like to know why private schools do not receive the same assistance from the Government as is received by aero clubs. In different parts of the Commonwealth, there are schools in which aviation is taught which have to meet their own overhead, and whose pupils have to pass the same tests; yet they are not receiving any assistance from the Government. As they are performing work similar to that of aero clubs, it is only reasonable that they should benefit by a subsidy such as is granted to such clubs. I notice that the amount of £80 is provided to meet the cost of certain club accommodation in Western Australia. The aero clubs with which I was associated, always paid for their own accommodation, and perhaps the Minister can say why the Western Australian club is on a different basis. I am aware that the Government was unable to grant a subsidy to Australian National Airways, which I am sure the Minister regretted. I realize that that company was rather ambitious in endeavouring to conduct an unsubsidized service from Brisbane to Hobart. The only two sections of that route which were a commercial proposition without a substantial subsidy were those between Brisbane and Sydney, and Melbourne and Hobart. Unfortunately, it was impossible for this service to operate without a subsidy. Germany is the most striking example of what can be done with the assistance of a substantial subsidy, and as that country is not now manufacturing aircraft for war purposes, it has concentrated upon civil aviation, in which she is leading the world. In Australia, flying can be undertaken almost any day in the year, and in a country 'of such distances, where there is in many cases an absence of railway or other means of communication, civil aviation should receive the greatest encouragement. It would have been a graceful act on the part of the Government to have assisted Australian National Airways, the founder of which, AirCommodore Kingsford Smith, is the greatest aviator the world has ever known. With a little assistance from the Government at the proper time, that company may have been able to carry on without suffering any loss by conducting a service over portions of the route on which it was operating. To afford the utmost assistance to aviation I suggest that, instead of civil aviation being under the direction of a controller of civil aviation, it should be under an air board, such as the Air Board, which looks after the defence side of aviation. </para>
                <para>A good deal of justifiable criticism has been levelled against the Health Department, because of the way in which its . activities overlap those of State Health Departments. I put forward the suggestion that the Health Department should be placed under the control of the Minister for Home Affairs, and the Department of Repatriation under the control of the Treasury. If that were done, a Minister would then be available to give proper attention to aviation. The Minister for Defence has sufficient to do in controlling the military and naval sections of his department. But civil aviation is not receiving the at- tention which such a modern science warrants. The Government should seriously consider the necessity of giving further attention to commercial aviation which, if linked up, an Australian service with Imperial Airways or with a Dutch company, would bring us in closer touch with the old world. An Assistant Minister could seriously tackle the problems on both the civil and military side of aviation, the line of demarcation between which is not great. The appointment of an Assistant Minister would not involve any additional expense, and a civil aviation board consisting of the present controller of civil aviation, the  deputy  controller, the superintendent of civil flying and the superintendent of aircraft should be appointed. Such a board would encourage aviation, and develop and give consideration to every aspect of its usefulness to the fullest extent. </para>

He mentioned an amount of £830,000 which appears on page  119  in respect of which it is impracticable to set out details required. One amount is for the payment of interest under regulations to the credit of a trust fund. It is unnecessary to supply details of expenditure of this nature, which are always checked by the Auditor-General's Department. </para>

                <para>The  honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> questioned certain of my statements regarding the pay and allowances of the lower ratings of the Navy. I had already seen a copy of the letter that he received; apparently it was sent to a number of honorable members. One copy of it was received by the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> and I replied to it at length. Had I known that the honorable member for East Sydney intended to raise the matter, I would have kept the details by me. It has been said that deferred pay is liable to  be  lost as a result of bad conduct. That  practice is no different from what obtains in the ordinary departments. Even in the railway services, if a man is dismissed for serious misconduct, he loses all superannuation rights. Without going into details, the position is that the pay and allowances are not to be reduced below £182 per annum. The figures that I quoted the other night were furnished to me by the accountant, and can therefore be regarded as reliable. </para>
                <para>The subject of rationing has been referred to. The position is that we have only a certain amount of money to spend. When it was proposed to reduce the staff at Garden Island, it was suggested to me by one or two unions that we ought to adopt rationing rather than dismissals. I gave sympathetic consideration to that, for the particular reason that men with many years of service who had only a couple of years to go would lose all the benefits of their furlough rights if they were dismissed. It is claimed, however, that the rationing has been too severe; and my officers in Sydney are meeting the unions with a view to seeing if some satisfactory arrangement can be come to. </para>

I have heard the honorable member say on another occasion that only a man who was familiar with the Defence organization could make proper contact with members of the naval and military forces with whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trumble</inline> has to confer in regard to different matters. The Prime Minister has explained previously that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trumble</inline> was surplus in Australia and that a position had to be found for him because, being a permanent officer, he could not be dismissed. Probably in other circumstances a member of one of the forces would have been appointed. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for West Sydney' directed attention to overhead expenses in connexion with the navy. I have had returns prepared showing the overhead expenses in Australia and elsewhere. It is true that the administrative expenses - if I may so term them - are fairly high compared with the total amount spent. I do not admit that they are tremendously high; but they are somewhat higher than in the British Admiralty. This matter is continually under review ; but after all, when there is a certain number of men for an equal number of permanent positions, what opportunity is there for retrenchment? </para>

                <para>The honorable member also referred to recruiting. A very small sum is involved in that item. Enlistments will be accepted only to make up any shortage below the strength of 3,300 in the permanent naval forces. I do not anticipate that very much expense will be incurred. I am unable to state the exact expenditure involved in the importation of materials from abroad, but nothing is being imported that can be made here, or done without. The high exchange rate alone does much to check imports. About £227,000 will cover the total amount, excluding exchange, that has to be sent abroad for various purposes, but there are certain naval requirements that cannot be met in Australia. </para>

The Maribyrnong factory has extended its activities to the commercial arena, and so has the Lithgow factory. The latter has produced 300 "talkie'" machines for the Western Electric Company. These are not made in Australia by any private firm, and an opportunity was thus afforded to keep the Lithgow men employed. Shearing-machine combs and cutters, which previously had to be obtained from abroad, are now being manufactured at Lithgow. The manager of a munitions factory now has highly responsible work to do, because, in addi tion to supplying naval and military requirements, he must be able to deal with orders placed by commercial firms. </para>

It is claimed by the honorable member that other firms should have the right to buy direct from the factory; but it must be remembered that the 2$ per cent, paid to Noyes Brothers relieves the department of all responsibility with regard to the collection of the sales tax, bad debts and advertising. Since the honorable member raised this matter, price-lists have been supplied to private firms. Since the selling agency has been given to Noyes Brothers, brass sheets are obtainable at a uniform price throughout the various States. Nearly all big companies appoint selling agents, and the department has merely followed the practice adopted in the commercial world. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> referred to civil aviation, and the granting of subsidies to private flying schools for the training of pupils on the lines of the assistance given to the aero clubs. Naturally the Government is reluctant this year to spend money in the direction indicated, owing to the stringency of the financial position. The aero clubs were encouraged by the Government, because I felt, and I think that my colleagues agreed with me, that we are under a moral obligation to the flying clubs, which were encouraged by the previous Administration to go on with their work as an auxiliary to the defence forces. That is why I continued the subsidies to those clubs, and in more prosperous times the Government would be inclined to give similar assistance to private flying clubs. </para>
                <para>I am not in a position to disclose the position of Australian National Airways Ltd., but the amount previously guaranteed by the Government was substantial, and we could not, in view of the present state of the finances, guarantee a large sum of money in order to assist that company. The previous Government was subjected to much criticism for subsidizing private air services that were operating in opposition to government owned railways. I recognize the value of the services rendered by the company to which I have referred, and the development that has taken place as the result of its activities. . Therefore, we regret that economic circumstances have forced it out of business; but I do not think the Government would be justified in incurring the expenditure that would be necessary to enable it to continue its operations. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to draw attention to the excessive cost of the Department of Health and to the high salaries paid to some of its officers. In the third division, for instance, there are a senior medical officer at £1,020 and two medical officers who are paid £1,656. In the division of Marine Hygiene a divisional director draws a salary of £1,400. In the division of Industrial Hygiene another divisional director is paid £1,296. The director of Veterintary Hygiene draws £1,000. The Director of the division of Tuberculosis and Venereal Disease has a salary of £1,396; the Director of the division of Maternal and Infant Welfare a salary of £1,200; and the Director of the division of Epidemiology a salary of £1,396. Under the heading of School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, the  Deputy  Director of Tropical Medicine is paid £1,030 ; and the  Deputy  Director of Bacteriology £1,100. Extraordinary expenditure is here incurred, but I venture to say that an examination of the work done by the recipients of these salaries will show that the Commonwealth is not getting a commensurate benefit.  A  tremendous organization has been built up in Canberra to do work which is being done in many of the States. This duplication has been going on for years, and no effort has been made to co-ordinate the activities of this department with those of State departments by means of which a considerable portion of this expenditure could be avoided. No attempt has been made to check the growth of this department. Like a snowball it has  gone on increasing in size until it has reached alarming dimensions. At a time when economy is supposed to be the order of the day and retrenchments are necessary, and when this Parliament is being subjected to all sorts of criticism because of reductions already made, it is certainly wrong to allow this particular department to proceed blithely on its way building up an enormous expenditure and duplicating work which has for many years been undertaken with equal efficiency by the' various State departments. Apparently everybody's business is nobody's business. No effort has been made to prevent the duplication and overlapping of the health administrations of the Commonwealth and the States. The expenditure of the Commonwealth in this direction  i3  continually increasing. I do not exonerate the Bruce-Page Government from blame in this connexion, but that is no justification for continuing our expenditure on the old scale. I urge the Government to take steps to put an end to the present serious overlapping. </para>

Tho health of the people should engage the attention of the Commonwealth Government, but everything possible should be done to ensure close collaboration between the  Federal  and State Health Departments. In view of the fact that we have even reduced pensions in an effort to balance our budget, we should try to eliminate all unnecessary overlapping.

                    <para>. - Apparently some honorable members have not realized that the proposed vote for this department is £25,500 less than the vote for last year. Economies have been made in every possible direction, and though it may be practicable to reduce expenditure to a slight extent, no great savings can be made. In spite of the remarks of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill),</inline> I can say with every confidence that the Commonwealth Health Department has thoroughly justified itself. Its officers in Canberra have done, and are doing, excellent work. This department set an example to the world in the use of radium for the treatment of cancer. It was the first to undertake this treatment on an extensive scale. Although its activities in this respect were undertaken against' the weight of medical opinion elsewhere, they have been thoroughly justified, for 41 per cent, of the patients treated have been cured. </para>

I urge the Government to take steps to discover and adopt the best method of representing Australia in the East. Countries like Canada and the United States of America have had" to seek foreign markets, and we shall have to do so. The people of other countries will not come to us and ask us for our products; we shall have to develop markets for ourselves. It certainly seems strange, in all the circumstances, that nothing is. being voted for the representation of Australia in the East. </para>

Should we not be taking steps to increase our expenditure in that country with the object of enlarging our market? Will the Minister inform me whether the trade agreement with Canada has been finalized in every respeot? I hope that the Government will pay some attention to the possibility of extending the activities of this department so that we may open up markets abroad for- our surplus^ primary production. </para>

                    <para>.The position of Australia in having to find markets for its exportable surplus of primary products is so serious that every attempt should he made to improve our present marketing arrangements. After listening to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> early last year, when he introduced a scheme for a commercial intelligence service, I hoped that something of a practical nature would be done. But I have waited in vain to hear any- thing from the Minister in regard to the proposals he then outlined. It is true that this Government has sent <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGregor</inline> to Canada to carry out essential work, and so far as one can judge from reports, he has rendered excellent service. But Canada is not our only market. Last year, Parliament voted £4,000 for general representation and this year an amount of only £1,000 has been provided. Although £4,000 was voted last year, not one penny wasspent in finding new markets, and this year the Government is content to provide £1,000. Five or six weeks ago I read in one of the publications supplied to honorable members that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maynard,</inline> an advertising expert in Sydney, had said that many manufacturing firms in and around Sydney were confronted with the difficulty of disposing of their product and generally in making ends meet. They were not making sufficient to cover their out-of-pocket expenses, quite apart from their overhead. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maynard</inline> advised them to advertise, and despite the fact that their profits were decreasing, they increased their advertising bill by from 100 to 200 per cent., with the result that their businesses were soon in a flourishing condition. We must advertise our products, but in a more satisfactory manner than is provided for by representation of the nature covered by this vote. Individual firms can do much to advertise Australian products in the East and in other countries; but governments can do a great deal, because they have nothing to gain by furthering the interests of any particular firm or brand of goods. Only within the last few days, Professor G. L. Wood, Associate Professor of Commerce and senior lecturer in economics at the University of Melbourne, in a lecture on " The function of administration in economic development," according to a report in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 17th July, said :  - </para>

The exchange bounty represented for secondary industry almost the whole cost of the labour added in manufacture, but the Chambers of Commerce and Manufactures in Australia were slow to embrace the opportunities presented. </para>

The only expenditure out of the vote of £4,000 last financial year was to cover the expense of a conference convened at Canberra. It is useless to vote money to serve the trade interests of Australia unless it is spent. </para>

                    <para>.I agree to a certain extent with the opinions expressed . by the honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bayley)</inline> ; but a better method for those anxious to exploit overseas markets would be to encourage the pooling of the resources of those interested, and to send abroad direct trade representatives whose business it would be to sell their commodities in much the same way as the primary producers have done in connexion with the export of dried fruits. The exporters of that commodity after pooling their  resources  have made a determined attack upon overseas market, which has resulted in a tremendous increase in the sales of our dried fruits in Great Britain. That system places a responsibility upon  those  who have the goods to sell, and is better than to have the Government establishing elaborate overseas representation. Under such a system there would be collective representation in which the Government could participate in order to organize and encourage export in every possible way. That system has the advantage of creating joint responsibility, and of the assistance of a vigilant body operating in the interests of our export trade. I admit that the export control board system has not been a complete success, but that is due largely to the policy and methods  of some of them. The Dried Fruits Export Control Board, in particular, has been successful, but the same cannot be said of some of the other export control boards. The onus must not be thrown upon the Government to create a demand overseas for goods which ' it is not in a position to supply. The gap can be bridged only in the way I have suggested. A marketing bureau should be established whose responsibility should be to study the possibilities of overseas trade, and to bring the data collected under the notice of local producers. </para>

It is, however, useless for the Government to send representatives to large consuming centres in other countries unless they can supply the goods they are endeavouring to sell. Our present trade representatives are not commercial travellers. There should be some connexion between the Government representative and those who have commodities to market. - Although, unfortunately, wheat-growers have been compelled to accept low prices for their wheat this year, its low price may be a blessing in disguise. Owing to the low price, Japan and China 0 have been able to buy large quantities of Australian wheat, and in future years they may continue to do so. The money expended in procuring representation in the United States of America, which is of little benefit, should be spent in establishing markets in the East. </para>

                    <para>. - A few years ago, before leaving Australia on a visit to China, I communicated with several Australian manufacturers with the object of bringing their products under the notice of the consumers of that country. I wrote to a number of prominent biscuit and jam manufacturers in Australia, but the response I received was anything but gratifying, principally because Australia's exports at that time were in a fairly satisfactory position. When I made inquiries in Hong Kong, which is a British possession, which  ought  to give us some advantage in the matter of trade, I found that the Australian manufacturers were at fault, as is usually the case in connexion with British manufacturers developing new markets. In a sense, our prejudices are the same as theirs; that is to say, we manufacture what is undoubtedly a good article for the home market, but do not take pains to adapt it to the use of those to whom we sell it abroad. No amount of government representation will do anything to rectify that. At the time of which I speak, Germany, which had not then been beaten to her knees as she has been since, sent her own trade agents to China. Instead of being content to allow the work to be done by Chinese  compradores,  as the British manufacturers were, those agents learned the different Chinese dialects and sold the goods themselves in the various provinces. Practically the whole of the market for cutlery was monopolized by German manufacturers, who put up the different articles in fantastically designed cases to suit the requirements and tastes of the market. Very valuable work has been done in Canada by means of agreements, and that is the method that we shall have to adopt to obtain European markets so long as we continue the policy of protection. </para>

                    <para>.The opening up of new markets would provide an excellent means of removing some of our, financial difficulties. Some years ago, when I was a member of the Parliament of South Australia, a representative was sent to Java and other eastern parts to inquire fully into questions con- nected with marketing. At that time we succeeded in placing quite a lot of South Australian flour in Java, and in addition did a substantial business in canned fruits. One of the difficulties that were encountered arose out of the fact that inappropriate labels were placed on the tins. The people in the East want to learn from the wrapping what the tin contains. These and similar difficulties, I believe, are gradually being overcome. It must be realized, however, that there is only a limited market in the East, because the people there are so poorly paid. I hope that the Minister will succeed in regaining the market that wo had for flour. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> has stated that quite a lot of our wheat is now being purchased; but it would be better if we were able to send that commodity in the form of flour, because the milling of it would provide employment for many of our people. I consider that we are not doing sufficient to develop the London market. The Minister should have appointed a live man as trade commissioner for Australia in England. I have written and spoken to the honorable gentleman in regard to this matter, and I mention it now merely in order that he may not overlook it. An effort should be made also to develop the Argentine market, where I believe there are available opportunities for the sale of our apples and oranges. Recently I have received letters from the Argentine making inquiries in this direction, and have spoken to the Minister in regard to the matter. </para>

                    <para>.I regret that no provision is made for improving markets in the East that we have endeavoured toexploit for years by the export of fruits, butter, meat and other products. The great drawback formerly was that there were no cool stores ; but at the present time a number of those are available for the storage of our products. There has been a good deal of criticism of the Minister's trip abroad, but I regard it as one of the most profitable of the whole delegation. I feel sure that a trade agreement with Canada could not have been secured by other than personal interviews with Canadian ministers. </para>

                        <para>- I notice that some of the Tasmanian papers say that that was only a " deal ". But for the wires that I sent away on the day when it became known that the " deal " was on, the hopgrowers would not have benefited. I should like the Minister to take a trip to the East, with a view to forwarding our interests there. I am a director of a cooperative concern in Tasmania, which this year sent to the East a number of samples of fruit juices and canned fruits, and I can say that there is a likely market there for a large quantity of our products. I cannot agree with the suggestion of the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Price)</inline> that we should send a trade agent to the Argentine, with a view to shipping our apples to that country. We have been misled in the past by persons who did not understand the potentialities of different markets. At the present time, the Argentine competes with Australia, because its season is the same as ours. It would be disastrous were we to encourage our fruit growers to send their product over there. We have been baulked in this way in the past in our endeavours to open up new markets. A few years ago, fruit was sent to the East, but because there were no cool stores to hold it, it had to be placed on the market immediately, with the result that those who consigned it lost heavily. Now, fruit is sent by every ship that sails, because it can be held in cool stores and distributed as the market requires it. The honorable member for Boothby said that the buying power in the East is not so great as in European countries. That is not so. There are as many wealthy people there as in Europe. The number of millionaires in Northern China is not fewer than in the United States of America. The market is available, if we can develop it. I hope that an endeavour will be made during the coming year to obtain that trade, which would be of great benefit to the whole of Australia. At the present time the market is practically monopolized by American products. Even in the mandated territory of Papua, which I visited some years ago, nearly all the tinned products come from the United States of America, yet that territory is within a couple of days' steam of Australia. The Minister would be quite justified in placing a considerable sum on the Estimates to open up these markets. </para>

                    <para>.- I disagree with the statement of the last  speaker  that the placing of trade agents in the East will help Australian producers. It will be necessary. for the producers and manufacturers to combine for the purpose of maintaining their own representative in the East. The honorable member said that there were no cool stores in which goods could be placed; yet, in Singapore, Sourabaya and Batavia, one can purchase any foodstuffs that money can buy. The United States of America, of course, supplies most of the market at the present time. As has been pointed out, the Australian methods of marketing are unsuitable. American canned fruits are packed in 12 oz. tins, which can be sola at a cheaper rate than the 16 oz. tins sent from this country. Australian butter is packed in containers of the wrong size. In the East, butter has to be used as soon as the container is opened, because it rapidly deteriorates. Australian producers and manufacturers would have a good chance of developing a most profitable trade with the East if they would go about the business in a proper way. It is useless to send white travellers into the Eastern bazaars. The Chineses krani are in close touch with the Chinese bazaars. Fruit sent from Adelaide to the East, and costing 5-^d. per lb. f.o.b. Port Adelaide, was retailed at 2s. 4d. per lb.; but the growers on the Murray were debited with a loss of 16s. lOd. per ton, Because incorrect trading methods were adopted. The goods passed through so many channels that all the profits to the growers were absorbed. Biscuits are sold in the East, but they should be suitably labelled. It is said that when Arnott's biscuits were marketed there in tins on which was a picture of a parrot, the natives imagined that the tins contained pickled bird. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that this business should be left entirely to commercial men. The Government should not interfere in trading matters except to assist in' the establishment of agencies. The firm with which ' I was connected years ago sent a man to Hong Kong and Shanghai, and he obtained sufficient orders for leather goods to keep the whole of the tanneries in Australia busy  for  at least twelve months. But the necessary hides for the manufacture of the leather were not available. Although the Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> did good work for Australia in Canada. I do not suggest that he should visit the East, because that is a big market that needs special attention by men who know, how to place goods on that market. We must pack our goods, not as we' may imagine they ought to be put up, but as they will appeal to the consumers in the East. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> took exception to the amount of the proposed vote for my department. Owing to the deplorable financial situation, this vote, in common with others, has had to be greatly reduced. As the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> has said, if we had a dozen trade representatives in the East, and had not the full co-operation of the business community, success would not attend our efforts. Since the middle of last year a big improvement has occurred in the volume of our eastern trade, and it is ever increasing. The conference that I called recently in Sydney of business men interested in this trade was one of the most representative that has ever been held in this country. There were nearly 100 persons present, all the interests concerned being represented. The department^ was able to supply the members of the conference with all the available information relating to the East. Thousands of persons have availed themselves of the statistics which the department is able to furnish. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> suggested the establishment of a bureau. I point out that we have a commercial branch of the Markets Department which answers the purpose better, and is well staffed, and is now collating all the available information required by those interested in overseas trade. The demand for this information is so continuous that the staff has to work assiduously, and it rs rendering excellent service to the business community. Australia ought to have a trade representative, not only in the East, but in all other important countries with which we have a chance of trading. These representatives should not be mere bagmen, but their duties should be to arrange contact between the business houses where they happen to be located, and those in Australia. </para>

During the negotiations that I had with the Canadian authorities; it was suggested that there might be some disagreement among the consumers concerning the concessions with regard to currants and raisins. It will be remembered that on these items I secured an extension of the preference from £14 per ton to £18 13s. 4d. per ton, and endeavoured to resist any time limit. The Canadian Government suggested that it might be necessary to place a two years' limitation upon the preference granted with respect to those items ; but no definite decision was made until the agreement came before the Canadian Parliament, when the two years' limitation was inserted. I had not that information before me when putting the agreement through this chamber. I have been in touch with the Prime Minister of Canada regarding those two items, and he has promised me that the matter will he reviewed next session. The Dried Fruits Board in Australia, however, is of the opinion that in the next two years the 'Australian growers will secure the remainder of the Canadian market for those commodities. </para>

                <para>In reply to the honorable member for Parkes, I admit that the commodities sent out of Australia some years ago were faultily packed and graded. On my way to Great Britain recently, I learned that we lost the Ceylon market because of our ineffective packing and grading. I have seen 50 or 60 big stores in London, and in cities like Oxford, where Australian commodities are displayed for sale, and are meeting with a most favorable reception. Particularly owing to the service of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hyland,</inline> our publicity officer in London, Australian traders are receiving the benefit of the closest co-operation of the business "community of Great Britain. When attending an exhibition of our commodities, and when speaking from the platforms of picture theatres in Great Britain, for the purpose of stimulating interest in Australian trade, I found that there was a strong tendency to buy dominion goods. The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> will agree with, me that, as regards grading and packing, Australian goods are now well up to the Californian standard. I agree with the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Price)</inline> that there is room for a trade representative in Great Britain and also in the East. Excellent publicity work is being done in Great Britain, but we could well do with a trade representative also. These are matters to which I have given a good deal of consideration, and, but for financial difficulties, I should have no hesitation in proceeding further along these lines. But we are using the resources of the department to procure and collate information desired by business people, and we now urgently need their hearty co-operation. </para>

This matter was discussed at a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce in Sydney five or six weeks ago, when it was decided to equip a good-will trade ship on lines similar to the " Reso " train scheme, which has had such an important influence in introducing articles of Australian manufacture to people in the various States. The venture is being financed by a number of merchants and others interested in the development of Australian trade, and they have approached the Minister for assistance. I should like to know what stage has been reached in the negotiations. I also suggest that a number of officers of the Markets Department should accompany the trade delegations that will visit the East on this good-will trade ship so as to be thoroughly conversant with trade developments. </para>

                        <para>- As this good-will trade ship will visit Burma, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, China, and Japan, there should be important trade developments in the near future. Good work along these lines is also being done in Canada. I understand that the Dried Fruits Board is contributing a considerable proportion of the expenditure incurred in commercial representation in that Dominion, and it may be possible to have similar organizations in Eastern countries. British consuls always render valuable aid in this direction. About three years ago, when I was. at Weltevreden, I met a number of importers and wholesalers from Bataviaand other parts of Java. They had come to the western end of the island from Sourabaya to discuss trade matters, and gave me a considerable amount of information concerning faults in packing of Australian products. I passed this information on to the department. Some of our manufacturers make an excellent display, and put up their products in a most attractive form ; but if only 5 per cent. fail to reach what is regarded as a reasonable standard, it is sufficient to seriously endanger the trade of the remaining 95 per cent. I suggest, therefore, that stricter supervision should be exercised by the Customs Department, and that it would be a good plan if our trade agents also acted as liaison officers between vendors in Australia and buyers in Eastern countries. Any complaints could be brought to their notice, and representations made in the right quarter. In this way we could hope to reach and maintain a high standard, as regards not only the quality of our products, but also the manner of their presentation to Eastern customers. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know, but I should like the Minister to ascertain the facts and see if this handicap upon our primary producers can be removed. It is alleged that New Zealand exporters of frozen mutton and lamb always have ample shipping space available, and that on many occasions Australian exporters are unable to secure the necessary space. This is a matter of considerable importance to our primary producers, because, owing to low prices for wheat and wool, many of our farmers are giving attention to fat-lamb raising, in which business there is still some semblance of profit. An endeavour is now being made to develop this trade, and it is probable that next season will see a substantial improvement in the export figures. This development will tend to steady prices in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The difference in distance should not be sufficient to account for the higher freight charges from Australia to London, because New Zealand exporters have to pay the Panama Canal dues. The Minister said a few moments ago that it should not be the function of the Government to seek new markets. I entirely agree with him. Our exporters  should get out and hustle for themselves. In this connexion, I am reminded of the excellent example that has been set by the Australian dried fruits industry, in which I am interested. Honorable members will notice on page 247 the item : " Trade representation in Canada, £5,250 ". It may interest them to know that the dried fruits industry alone contributes £2,500 of that sum. All primary producers in that industry must derive  a  great amount of satisfaction from the knowledge that they are able in  a  spirit of self-help to carry their share of the load. The work done by the Federal Export Control Board is an excellent example of the fruits of our marketing legislation' Without it, it would have been impossible for the dried fruits industry to take such an important part in this business of extending our trade relations with Canada. They have developed markets, not only in Great Britain, but also in Canada, and they are doing what they can in regard to the East. They are showing  a  spirit of self-help, and co-operating with the Government in  a  way which I think is worthy of emulation by other enterprises. </para>

                    BLAKELEY  (Darling- Minister for Homer Affairs [7.25 a.m.]. - The substantial reduction from £118,000 to £93,000 in the cost of elections has been brought about by economies within the department and in the conduct and control of elections. Assistant returning officers have been reduced from £3 3s. to £2 10s., presiding officers and assistant presiding officers from £2 2s. to £1 15s., and poll clerks from £1 5s. to £1. Other reductions have been made in regard to the meal allowance and such like expenditure. The total saving on the remuneration of officers, &amp;c., is £10,000, and in regard to meals and other allowances, £7,000.Whether the Senate or the House of Representatives goes to an election separately or whether both Houses go together, makes little difference to the cost of holding an election. The Senate election will be held next May.

                    <para>. - At a meeting of the international map committee, held in London in November, 1909, at which Australia was represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cecil</inline> Darley, M.I.C.E., it was decided to publish an international map of the world. The details of the method of construction were discussed, and certain principles were agreed upon, the whole of the proceedings being embodied in a report published in February, 1910. Owing to the outbreak of the war in 1914, the matter remained in abeyance until the 1st of May, 1924, when Cabinet approved of the participation by Australia. The work is of world-wide importance, the map showing all railways, roads, towns, harbours, forests, watercourses, mountains, &amp;c. Practically all countries are contributing towards its production. Steady progress is being made with the preparation of the Australian section, and the sum of £1,000 is required to enable the work to be continued. I think that the total cost to Australia is £5,000. Honorable members may have noticed in Ministers' rooms sections of the map already produced, showing in detail Canberra, the southeastern portion of New South Wales, and portions of Victoria. </para>

                    <para>. - I direct the attention of the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> to the serious complaints that are being made about the curtailment of postal services in rural districts. I have received many complaints in this connexion, and so have other honorable members who represent rural areas. I recognize that it is inconsistent with economy plans for honorable members to demand extra services ; but there is a very bitter complaint, particularly in the sparsely populated areas in my electorate, about the drastic curtailment that has been made in their postal services. In many cases these curtailments have been made because of curtailments in the railway services due to the general depression; but I feel that a good deal more could have been done than has been done to meet the situation. I feel very sore about the whole position. Whenever a request is made for a new service the stereotyped reply is sent that the finances will not allow it to be granted. In many  cases this decision is decidedly unfair to the people who are living outback. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I suggest to the Postmaster-General that in cases where the services have been curtailed because of the curtailment in the passenger train services, the mail bags should be placed on convenient goods trains that may be running. I know that it is not the policy of the department to despatch mail bags on goods trains in normal times, but these are not normal times, and the department should cut through some of the red tape which is binding it to the practices of normal times. Arrangements could surely be made with the railway departments in the various States for the proper and careful handling of mail bags on goods trains going outback. </para>
                <para>A serious source of complaint in regard to the curtailment of our mail services is that the economy axe has fallen heavily on the people in the rural areas, but has not fallen on the people in the city and suburban areas. The environment of the people outback is very different from that of the people in the cities. City people enjoy two postal deliveries daily; and they have a post-office in every convenient place, and a pillar-box on practically every street corner. They are waited on hand and foot. If the economy axe must fall, it should fall on city and country people alike. If there is to be any discrimination it should be in favour of outback people. "When I made a complaint of this nature last year, the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> who was then Postmaster-General, said that if the city people were receiving better treatment than the country people, it was because the staff was available in the cities to render the ordinary service, and might just as well be working as sitting down doing nothing. That sounds plausible, but I suggest that instead of making two deliveries a day in all the suburbs, a delivery should be made in the morning in one suburb and in the afternoon in another suburb. It would not hurt city people if they had to go to the post-office for their mail matter like many country people have to do. I have no desire to make a personal attack upon the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, but' I feel certain that if he had any personal knowledge of outback conditions he would deal much more sympathetically with the applications made to his department in their behalf. I make the strongest possible protest against the infliction of economies on the country people alone. If justice were considered, the city people would be called upon to suffer before the country people. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that honorable members on both sides of the committee who represent rural areas could make most serious complaints about the treatment of their constituents. In some country districts the postal services were better 50 years ago than they are to-day, while in the newer districts it is impossible for the people to get any adequate service whatever. In many cases the departmental officers admit the justice of the applications made to them, but they say that they cannot grant them because of the financial stringency. I suggest to the Postmaster-General that he should call the Director and the Deputy Directors of Posts and Telegraphs into conference and have a heart-to-heart talk with them on this subject. I cannot think that any of these gentlemen have ever lived in the outback areas, or they would be more sympathetic than they are. </para>

                    <para>. -I had something to say on this subject last night. The policy of the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> in the curtailing of the mail services of settlers in the rural areas requires immediate reconsideration. In spite of the interjection made a few minutes ago by the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley),</inline> I do not think that many of the  Deputy  Directors of Posts and Telegraphs have lived outback, and I am sure that the Director has never done so. The  Deputy  Director of Posts and Telegraphs in Queensland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Little)</inline> has told me that he has never been farther north than Brisbane. I urge the Postmaster-General to regard these complaints as of the utmost importance. It is unreasonable that every application for a new service should be refused simply because the financial position is difficult. In Thornborough, a settlement in Northern Queensland, in a district in which there arc 200 or 300 residents, the work of the Postal Department was undertaken by a youth who was receiving only 15s. a week. The business in that office was not extensive, but owing to the department's policy of economy it was decided to close the office without any departmental pronouncement to that effect. Had the people in that locality been notified that it was the intention to close the office, they would have willingly contributed out of their own pockets the amount necessary to pay the wages of the postal and telephone attendant. At the Batavia diggings, which boasts of a population of about 75 persons, and which is about 75 miles distant from any other post-office, the office was closed, but the department eventually said that it proposed to reopen in a residence which it owned. The inspectors made certain inquiries, and ascertained that the residence had been sold, and consequently nothing further was done. There are also pack services costing in the vicinity of £130 a year, but many of these have been reduced or entirely withdrawn. Surely the residents in the outback portions of the Commonwealth, who do not enjoy any of the facilities of those in the more populous centres, should receive more consideration. Unfortunately, they are under the influence of those who have a " Brown " or at least a very dark out look, and until drastic alterations are made in the control of this department our complaints will not cease. Increases in postal and telephonic rates always affect the country people with greater severity than those in the cities. In many country districts group telephone services are in use. Subscribers are compelled to use the same wire, which results in cross talk and endless inconvenience. It is easy for the Government to use the economy axe to the extent it has been used in country districts, but it is time it dropped on some of those fortunate city dwellers who receive a mail twice daily, and are compelled to walk a few yards to their front gate in order to collect it. If they had to cover that distance only once a day they would have sufficient exercise. When travelling to Brisbane on Saturday last I saw the head of the Postal Department making his way to Brisbane to confer with the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, who will doubtless make recommendations for further reductions in country services, and in the name of economy will further smash the already inadequate facilities now provided. Residents in country districts have not representation in this Parliament comparable with those who live in metropolitan districts. During the last few years economies have been effected to such an extent that many of our country mail services have been seriously reduced, if not entirely dispensed with. </para>

                        <para>- A representative in this chamber of a metropolitan constituency told me that some of his electors had to walk a mile or two to a post office, but in some of the districts in my electorate the people consider that they are exceedingly fortunate if there is a post office within five or ten miles of their home. In many cases boxes are placed on trees or posts, in which valuable mail matter is frequently placed. These have to meet the requirements of perhaps 20 or 30 persons, but no complaints are made. If a request is made for any alteration to the mail routes when new areas are being opened up, an offer is frequently made to contribute towards the extra cost. But to this the depart- ment will not agree. I have no knowledge of the Chambers of Commerce or any other such body making such an offer. At Chewko, in the vicinity of Mareeba, where land has recently been opened up for the cultivation of tobacco, additional mail facilities have been sought. There is the usual delay, and eventually a letter will be received to the effect that the inspector will visit this locality, and after such an inspection has been made, a further intimation will be given, that owing to the financial position it is impossible to grant the request. I strongly resent the treatment now being meted out to residents in country districts, who in the matter of mail services are entitled to more consideration than city dwellers. Some of these people in the out-back, who receive only a weekly or semi-weekly paper, do not complain of the conditions under which they are living. If the Governmentdoes not take immediate action in this matter it is my intention, on the motion for the adjournment each evening, to read every letter I" have received. I want <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> and his satellites to face up to the position, and to cease slashing the mail services in country districts. If people are to develop the back country they must be provided with reasonable postal facilities. As they contribute large sums in the form of taxation to keep a vast army of politicians and public servants in employment, they are entitled to the privileges enjoyed by others. Only last night I referred to the erection of new post offices at Chatswood, Killara, Sydenham and "Wynyard Square. Money is being expended in these localities, because those seeking additional facilities are able to get the ear of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown,</inline> whom they may entertain from time to time at functions in Sydney. The unfortunate people in the outback districts who do not meet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown, Mr. Little,</inline> or other departmental heads, have no means of bringing under their notice the conditions under which they are living. Some part of the amount of £500,000 which is to be spent in the erection of new post offices should be used to enable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> and his  deputy  to visit the outback country. I should be willing to take them through my electorate, and after seeing the conditions under which the people are living, I am sure that they would show more sympathy towards them. I trust that honorable members representing country constituencies will voice their protest in this matter. </para>

                    <para>.- I have waited for some hours for an opportunity to discuss the subject raised by the honorable member for "Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart),</inline> and supported by the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan).</inline> I am as mindful as is any other honorable member of the need for economy in the administration of government departments, and I know that the people in country districts realize the need for reduced expenditure. But it is the country which keeps the cities going, and has to bear the bulk of the disabilities resulting from financial stringency. "We have heard a good deal about the equality of sacrifice. These words fall very easily from the lips of Ministers, but in this instance there is no equality of sacrifice. Every Minister realizes that in the reduction of mail services and postal facilities generally, country residents are bearing more than their fair share of the burden. It is true that when the ex-Postmaster-General. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> was controlling the department the financial position of the Commonwealth was such that he was able to do what cannot possibly be done at the present juncture. In regard to extensions of telephones and mail services the country districts were then reasonably provided for. But now, when members write urging the need for a telephone line or mail service we are frequently told that the need for such service is realized, but owing to the financial position they cannot be provided. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to indulge in party propaganda, but it is plain that the needs of country districts must be urged constantly if justice is to be done to those who are doing the real work of the nation. I do not blame the men administering the department. The  Deputy  Director of Posts and Telegraphs in Tasmania is sympathetic and understands the position, but he has not the funds to provide the services that are required, and he is governed by instructions from head-quarters. This is wholly a matter of Government policy. If the Government chooses to decide that real economies shall be effected in the urban areas, i'u order to allow reasonable services to be provided in the country, that can be done. That the Director and  Deputy  Directors have not lived out-back is immaterial; in the main these men know their jobs; but they are restricted by considerations of finance and Government policy. Some years ago the Postmaster-General issued a pamphlet stating the conditions under which telephone services would be provided in country districts, but that is of no guidance to-day to honorable members or to applicants for services. I want to be able to help the department as well as my constituents, and I should have definite information regarding the conditions under which telephone lines will be provided, and what will be expected of an applicant living a few miles off the main road or beyond the terminus of an existing line. I have always contended that it is not fair to require the applicant to bear the capital cost of his own line. At one period that was recognized and the department paid for the material and labour. Now, it is discouraging the extension of telephone lines, but if an individual is desperately in need of a service 'and cares to put his hands into his pockets, to pay for the erection of posts and miles of wire, the department will install a line. If the department insists that it cannot provide the same facilities as were given years ago, I want to know what the revised conditions are. If the Postmaster-General cannot make a complete statement on these Estimates, he should, in the interests of his department, have one printed, and circulated to members. I hope that the Prime Minister will take up this matter at an early date with the Postmaster-General, and the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, with a view to evolving a more sympathetic policy. The only policy that will satisfy this Parliament is one which gives reasonable treatment to those in the country districts, even if it involves some curtailment of the privileges of the urban population. </para>

                <para>For years the Postmaster-General's Department has paid a subsidy to Tasmania!) Steamships Proprietary for the carriage of mails between the mainland and the island. The amount paid by the Government is about £31,000, exclusive of an extra £6,000 or £7,000 for putting the <inline font-style="italic">Nairana</inline> into service for a few extra weeks. One condition of the contract is that during its currency the company may not increase the freights or fares without the permission of the Postmaster-General. This condition should have been a valuable safeguard. The company has been well treated by various governments, and because of the agitation of Tasmanian members, .it has been paid a substantial subsidy to carry mails and provide a better passenger service. But I believe that every application by the company for permission to increase freights and fares has been granted. Recently the shipping companies have had relief from the Arbitration Court; the wages of seamen, officers, and waterside workers have been reduced. I am told that the amount of the reduction, including the cost of living adjustment, is approximately 22 per cent. But freights and fares remain high, except for some slight reduction between certain mainland ports. This matter is of great importance to the Tasmanian primary producers. Has the Postmaster-General power to bring about a downward revision of freights and fares? If not, I shall seek to create an atmosphere which will compel the company to make a reduction. I hope the Postmaster-General will go into this matter; he has had power to prevent increased charges, and has not done so, no doubt because the company claimed that costs had increased. Now, costs have been reduced, and the Postmaster-General should be able to influence the company to adjust its charges accordingly. If he has power to insist upon a reduction of freights and fares, he should do so. </para>

                    <para>.I join in the protest by rural members against the curtailment of postal services. In justice to the Minister, I admit that some of the grievances of my constituents have been rectified during the last few days, but only after much correspondence and many personal interviews, lt will be generally admitted that the man in the country is in serious difficulties. Rural members have twice as much responsibility and worry as city representatives have; after all, urban residents have all the conveniences and many of the comforts of life. If a curtailment of postal services is necessitated by the state of the finances, first consideration should be given to the rural areas, to which the mail services are of prime importance. </para>

                        <para>- Rural representatives have loyally supported city representatives in the past, and there should be reciprocal good feeling towards the man on the land,- whose job is undoubtedly the hardest. In my electorate mail services have been reduced. Where passenger trains have been discontinued, mails could be carried by goods train. I suggest that the Minister should look into that possibility. An instance of the small economies being effected by the department is the discontinuance of the lighting of the Castlemaine post office. For many years people have been accustomed to look for that light, and the loss of it is an inconvenience which is not warranted by the small amount of money saved. I admit that economy must be practised, but the Minister should see that it is so spread as not to place an undue hardship on the people outback. The man in the city enjoys a mail delivery twice a day, and if he desires to send a telegram he can do so at probably twenty offices between his home and his office. Rural populations, on the contrary, suffer many natural disadvantages, and are further handicapped by only limited postal and telephonic services even in prosperous times. </para>

                    <para>. - The reduction of postal services in my electorate has been so serious that I cannot allow this occasion to pass without making a protest. I emphasize the statement of the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> that where train services have been reduced from four and six weekly to two weekly, the mail services have been curtailed accordingly. I am speaking now of towns of from 2,000 to 3,000 inhabitants. The municipalities, when they have protested, have been informed that it is impossible to give a better service, and that if they are prepared to carry out an additional mail service without expense to the department they can do so. The people will soon revolt against such a position. If the same disabilities were placed upon the people in the cities they would immediately be up in arms. In my electorate small post offices, which have been in existence for nearly 50 years, have been closed down, despite the fact that protest after protest has been made against such action. We know perfectly well that the department is not doing this with the desire to place additional burdens upon the people in the rural districts, but ii should at least endeavour to formulate a policy under which the mail services generally will be equalized as much as possible. I trust that the Postmaster-General, in collaboration with his departmental officers, will give this matter favorable consideration. </para>

                    <para>.A matter which closely affects my electorate is the uncertainty of the Government's attitude with respect to the installation of dictaphones in country newspaper offices. Recently the Government gave this matter consideration and postponed its decision to abolish the use of these machines, and I enter my protest against its attitude. The dictaphone was introduced in the. country newspaper offices at the request of the Postal Department, but now that the use of that facility has enabled the country people to obtain news with a rapidity, which, to some extent, has interfered with the circulation of great metropolitan newspapers, influence has been brought to bear upon the department to compel the country newspaper proprietors to abandon the use of this machine. The country press, as an institution, has done more for the actual development of this country than anything else, and ite work has been facilitated by the use of the dictaphones. The Postal Department has suggested that the use of these machines should be abandoned, because it interferes with the revenue of the post office. It is just as reasonable to instruct the country press to revert to the telegraph system, and abandon the dictaphone as it would be  to instruct the Railway Department to abandon the train service and to revert to the bullock dray. If the country newspaper proprietors have to revert to the primitive telegraph system, it will be a departure that should not be tolerated by us. I have heard the case made out by the representatives of the country press, and I say that it is absolutely unanswerable. They showed that the dictaphone was of greater advantage to them than any other  3y  stern. In many instances, the country newspapers were obtaining the latest news in the evening and distributing it among the people the next morning. The country newspaper proprietors are business men, and they wish to know the final decision of the Government, so that if it is favorable they may develop their business to meet the requirements of modern society. I think that that assurance should be given to the country press. </para>

                <para>I come now to the actual postal services in my electorate. They are being abolished at a rate which, if continued, will abolish all the postal services in my electorate within 21 months. This policy of withdrawing postal privileges from "the rural dweller commenced during the regime, not of this Government, but of the Bruce-Page Government. I shall do my utmost - and from now the fight is on - to prevent any further curtailment of country postal facilities. The mail services of the people in the large centres of population could be considerably curtailed before they would suffer the disadvantages which the country people are now experiencing. The actual curtailment of services has not been fairly distributed among the community generally, and I protest against the inequality of sacrifice in respect of postal facilities that has been forced upon the country dweller. </para>

                        <para>- From the time that the Bruce-Page Government made available large sums of money to the Postal Department, members have, until recently, been absolutely satisfied with the treatment given to both the country and city people. The officials of the Postal Department are the same to-day as they were then. The policy laid down is the same to-day as it was then ; but the financial position has changed. The Postal Department is a business department, and is expected to pay its way. It has its own sinking fund, and is responsible for the provision of money for that fund so that loans made to it may be repaid within a certain number of years. This Parliament has never been unsympathetic towards the people resident in the country, and neither has the Postal Department. Many of the districts to which the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> and other honorable members have referred, are, from the postal standpoint, most expensive to operate. Many a letter on which a twopenny postage stamp is placed costs 15s. or 16s. to deliver to the addressee. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot do that now, but I can bring facts and figures to prove that letters are delivered to addressees in the outlying portions of Australia at a cost of from 15s. to 16s. each. Such profits as have accrued to the Postal Department in the past have come from the people in the large cities. They have paid for their services and are entitled to them, but this Parliament, and the department itself, have never treated the Postal Department as a cold business proposition. Had they done so there would be few facilities. </para>

                        <para>- I do not deny that. Honorable members who represent city electorates have, during the last  three  or four years, fought the Postal Department just as strenuously as have honorable members who represent rural constituencies. Take my own case. For years a sum has been on the Estimates for the erection of a post office at South Brisbane. The honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> referred to the post office at Hughenden, where people fall through the verandah flooring because of its decrepitude. I should like to show honorable members the post office at South Brisbane. It is a disgrace to the department. I have 57,000 electors in my constituency, and only .three official post offices in the whole area. The honorable member for Kennedy has fewer electors than I have, but he has a far greater number of official post offices. </para>

I want honorable members who represent country constituencies to recognize that other people besides their constituents are affected by these economies. When it becomes necessary to economize, the department naturally has to cut out those services that have resulted in the greatest loss. It must be realized by all that the department is not making these reductions willingly. The sacrifice is general. There is not one member from a metropolitan constituency who has not received letter after letter from the department intimating that no money is available to effect alterations or improvements. </para>

                <para class="block">Bayley) to indulge in joking. This is a matter of such great importance that I know that the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> would regret it if the estimates for his department were passed without my drawing attention to the needs of the important electorate of Corangamite. I have no desire to raise the issue of town, versus country, but if country postal facilities are being curtailed because of financial depression, I should like to know why the cities are not similarly treated. I asked  a  question  on  notice as to how many postal services  had  been reduced in Sydney during the past two years. I was informed that there has been no curtailment of such services in Sydney, and that only two centres have been affected in Melbourne - Glenroy and Blackburn - which are practically country areas. </para>
                <para>It is all very well for the honorable member for Oxley to talk about . the Bruce-Page Government, and the alleged generosity of its Postmaster-General. I point out that during its regime there was a loss on the whole of the Postal Department activities of from £100,000 to £300,000 per annum, with the exception of one year. Now that we are experiencing bad times, why should the country centres be the only \ ones to suffer? It cannot be denied that discrimination has been shown. References have been made to the Castlemaine post office clock. I draw attention to that at Maryborough, which costs £9 10s. a year to light. I understand that it would not cost more than £4,000 per annum to light the whole of the post office clocks in the Commonwealth. I know that if I moved that the item covering the salary of the Director of Post and Telegraphs be eliminated, it would have the approval of honorable members. It should also gladden the heart of the Postmaster-General as it would enable him to get rid of the incubus. If I do so, will the honorable gentleman give me an assurance that the money so saved will be devoted to the lighting of  post office clocks as before? The Postmaster-General remains silent. I am too meek; I make no threats and Ministers are therefore ' prone to leave my requests unnoticed until I exert pressure. It was stated by the Minister that the cost of lighting the Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide post office clocks will have to be borne by the respective municipalities. So far as I can gather that so far has not been done. Will the honorable gentleman assure me that the discontinuance of the government subsidy for the lighting of the post office clock at Maryborough will synchronize with the discontinuance of that for the lighting of the post office clocks in the three great metropolises that I have mentioned? As the Minister sits like a sphinx, in silence, without giving the slightest sign of a softening heart, I shall resume my seat. I have placed on record my protest against the unfair and unjustifiable discrimination between country and town. </para>

                    <para>. - I urge the Postmaster-General to be more sympathetic in his administration of post and telegraph services. I am not unmindful of the hard times through which we are passing, but I believe that unsympathetic treatment has been meted out to some country centres by the postal administration. In almost every direction postal deliveries have been reduced. I realize that the curtailment of railway services has had something to do with that, but the main feature is the change of government policy that has recently taken place. I am satisfied that the  Deputy  Directors of Posts and Telegraphs in Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> Little, and his predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Christie,</inline> have always been anxious to do whatever they could but they have experienced difficulty in carrying out their desires, because of the policy of the Government. I urge the Minister to reconsider this policy, and do everything possible to dispense evenhanded justice to both town and country. Mail deliveries mean much to country folk. They are the great link with civilization. I hope that this general appeal will cause the Minister to exercise that consideration and assistance to the country people to which they are entitled. </para>

Notwithstanding the hour, I cannot let the oppor tunity pass without registering my protest against the curtailment of postal facilities in rural districts. In my electorate some districts have undertaken to pay the expense of maintaining their old mail delivery, it being necessary for business men to have these facilities. Apparently that has been used against other centres when they have asked that their postal facilities should not be curtailed. That is most improper on the part of the department. </para>

                <para>Recently the train service on one of the railway lines in my electorate was curtailed. Instead of the train going to the terminus of the railway it stopped about 80 miles back, with the result that the mails were delayed for two days. Let me compare the enterprise shown by city newspaper companies with the lack of energy displayed by the Government. When the train service was curtailed, the newspaper companies of Melbourne immediately made arrangements for the conveyance of newspapers from the temporary terminus to the railhead. At a very small cost the Postmaster-General's Department could have arranged for the mails to be carried by the same vehicle; but, on the plea of economy, it did nothing. The result is that settlers beyond the present temporary railway terminus can get their newspapers daily, but not their letters. </para>

                    <para>.- I have done my best to pacify those persons in my electorate who have suffered because of the Government's policy- of curtailing country mail services. I have not brought this matter up before, although I could have done so on motions for the adjournment of the House; but now that the appropriate occasion has arrived, nothing but the application of the " gag " will prevent me from urging the claims of country settlers in respect of postal services. It cannot be said that I am urging the claims of country settlers merely because Angas is a country district, because one-third of the  Angas  electorate is in the metropolitan district of Adelaide. I can, therefore, speak on behalf of both metropolitan and country electors. Excepting to the extent that they have been refused official post office buildings, the metropolitan areas have had no curtailment of postal services, whereas in country districts there has been considerable curtailment. Where previously there were two mails a week, there is now only one; where, until recently, there were three mails a week, there are now only two ; and where there was a daily mail there are now only three mails a week. It cannot be gainsaid that the country districts have had to bear the brunt of the economy measures adopted by the Postmaster-General's Department. I realize that the Government must practise economy, and with some success I have represented that viewpoint to the people in the country portions of my electorate. If I were asked where economies could be made in connexion with postal services in metropolitan areas, I should take the risk of offending some of my constituents by saying that economies could he effected by having a morning delivery in one portion of a district and an afternoon delivery in the rest of it. Unfortunately, that might mean dispensing with the services of some men ; but it would be better that metropolitan areas should have only one delivery a day than that the department should reduce the already infrequent mail services in country districts. Perhaps if I were to go through the department I could suggest other ways of effecting economies. I think, however, that the suggestion I have made is a fair one. The honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bayley)</inline> suggested that the people in country districts were getting postal facilities beyond what they paid for. The honorable member does not need me to tell him that the prosperity of this country is based on its agricultural, pastoral, mineral, and viticultural industries. The 58 per cent, of the population of South Australia resident in the Adelaide metropolitan district, and the similarly large proportions of the population of other States living in the other capital cities, depend for their livelihood on the scattered settlers in outback areas. It is not right that those who enjoy the greater comforts of the cities should be given every postal facility, while those on whom they depend have their already inedaquate  services seriously  curtailed. </para>

                <para>The statement of the honorable member for Oxley is unfair; it is one of the reasons which have led me to make this protest. I hope that something will be done for these country settlers, otherwise there will be no alternative to raising the matter night after night on the adjournment in order to bring home the facts to the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree entirely with  all that country members have said regarding the curtailment of postal facilities. Reference has been made to the cost of delivering mails in outback districts, and it has been inferred that country mail services should, in consequence, be reduced. One honorable member mentioned that it sometimes costs as much as 16s. to deliver one letter. There are portions of my electorate in which it would probably cost several pounds to deliver one letter. In the area beyond  Thargominda,  and in the region beyond Birdsville, it would probably cost between £ 2Q and £30 to deliver a letter by special messenger. It is not fair to take the cost of delivering a particular mail and to divide that cost by the number of letters, and then to say that the cost of country mail services is too great.  In the same way that the mountain streams feed the rivers on which large cities are built, so the country mail services, which convey, perhaps, only a few dozen letters, help to swell the volume of postal traffic which, eventually, reaches the big cities and is essential to the proper conduct of business. If there is <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be any curtailment of postal services, it should not be in the country alone. In my electorate there has been one curtailment after another. The latest proposal of the Government is to eliminate the travelling post office on the western railway line of Queensland, which delivers letters to sidings. One honorable member said that postal services in country districts are worse now than they were 50 years ago. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The travelling post office to which 1 refer has been in existence for 40 years If it is removed, we shall go back to conditions which existed nearly half a century ago. A few days ago I received a letter stating that the Postal Department had effected a saving in a certain district by arranging with a dairyman to convey the mails in the vehicle in which he carted his cream to the railway. Unfortunately, there was a falling off in his cream supply, with the result that there was a curtailment of the mail service. The mail services of a country should not be dependent on such things. I ask the Postmaster-General to see that country mail services are not curtailed. I realize that economies are necessary; but they should not be effected by interfering with country mail services. I heard some honorable members speak of the hardships of their constituents who had a mail service only once a day. There are very few places in my electorate where there is a mail service every day. The services are mostly once a week, and, in rare cases, twice a week. Even then, settlers have to travel 30, 40, and as many as 50 miles for their mail. I know one man on the South Australian border who runs a private car 40 miles to the station homestead with the mail. It is then taken up, and carried another 60 miles to the head of the government mail route, and carried from thence into the town. The Minister should issue instructions that mail services shall not be curtailed at the expense of settlers in the outback. If it is necessary to save money, it should be saved somewhere else. </para>

                        <para>Dennis waa an experienced pig-farmer, and was chosen from a number of applicants (advertised for) to conduct the Canberra pig farm. The site was chosen by Brackcnreg on Woolshed Creek (which runs into the Molonglo River) and is between Duntroon Military College and the Kingston power house, and the area was about 125 acres. I am unable to recall what was the rent, but the definite inducement to Dennis was that he was to use (and to have for the mere carrying away) the kitchen edible refuse from the Commission establishments, and the piggery was to be erected and built on "the most modern, hygienic, and scientific lines, so that it would be a model ". The buildings, &amp;c, were erected (not without material delays, but I have not the details), and the cost was about £2,500, and Dennis went into occupation and was carrying on though he had not signed any lease (nor for very many months, was a lease submitted for his signature), and, ultimately, when a lease was submitted for his signature would he accept or sign it as he said it differed very greatly from the conditions offered to him. As Dennis refused to sign the lease, the matter dragged on, because Brackenreg would not consent to Dennis having the conditions agreed on in the first instance, and, ultimately, Dennis was told he could sign that lease or get out. </para>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <para>He refused to do either,- and then he had  a  visit from the veterinary surgeon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McKay)</inline> who informed Dennis that he must not feed his pigs on the kitchen refuse as it might breed disease, and he must grow food for them. Dennis protested and said that the very special inducement held out to him was the abundant supply of cheap pig feed which the kitchen edible refuse afforded, but the authorities insisted, and so Dennis fenced off more than half the area and put in a crop of maize. When the maize was a few inches above the ground - and his cultivation had been done very soon after he was told he must grow feed - a peremptory demand was made to know why he was not feeding his pigs on fodder grown for them. He said the demand was made personally by Brackenreg, and that he replied, " Don't be a- fool - its only a few weeks ago that </para>
                <para class="block">I was told 1 had to grow feed, and it must have time to grow ". Brackenreg was very insulted, and claimed to be the great pig expert and a very scientific farmer, &amp;c, and Dennis finally said that he was growing food as fast as he could and he must feed on the kitchen refuse until the feed had grown. Brackenreg said he could not possibly allow it, and it must be stopped at once. </para>
                <para>Dennis had saved a large quantity of stale bread from the refuse, and thereupon he stopped gathering the kitchen refuse, sold most of his pigs, and fed the remainder on the stale bread. The kitchen refuse began  to  accumulate as no one was carrying it away. Brackenreg asked Dennis, with much surprise, why he was not taking the refuse away, and Dennis replied, " Because you won't allow me to use it, it has no value to me, and I don't want it ". After some barneying, it was agreed that Dennis should cart the refuse to a destructor over  near  the Black Mountain, and should be paid £3 3s. per day for so doing, whilst a man was put on at £4 10b. per week to burn it with firewood bought and delivered at that site for the purpose. </para>
                <para>Dennis, by reason of the uncertainty of his tenure, never felt free to fully stock the farm, and when he had further reduced the num'ber of  hi3  pigs (as above-mentioned) Brackenreg complained that he was not stocking the farm as he should,  and  that if he did not do so he must get out. Meantime, he continued to cart the kitchen refuse, and to draw £3 3s. per day, or 21 guineas per week, but he did not pay any rent. </para>
                <para>Next, he had another visit from the veterinary surgeon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McKay)</inline> in "the company of Brackenreg, and McKay straight out condemned the site, as it would he dangerous to public health, and would contaminate the waters  of  Woolshed Creek  and  the Molonglo River. </para>
                <para>Dennis said the pig farm had been granted to him on that  Bite,  the buildings had been erected, and the pig conveniences also erected, but  as  they were very deficient and not of practicable value  as  they were delivered over  to  him,  he  had spent a good deal of his  own  money in making them serviceable, and  ho  would not get out unless he got a better site, and  at  least equal conveniences. Brackenreg then invited him to accompany him to another site which  he,  Brackenreg. had chosen, adjoining the present abattoir. "Dennis went,. and Brackenreg pointed out its many advantages most of which Dennis declared were imaginary, and particularly that a lot more water would be needed, that he would not be able to grow crops there, and that he must be covered for his personal outlay in making the pig farm capable of use. Brackenreg, he says, promised that he need not grow pig feed on the new site, but could use the kitchen refuse and slaughter-house refuse, that the water would be supplied in sufficient quantities, and that everything would be suitable, but Dennis must at once get off the farm he was occupying. Dennis said he would stay where he was till he saw the new pig farm ready and fit for use and occupation, and an argument about this continued for many weeks -indeed, months, all highly profitable to Dennis who had virtually ceased to be a pigfarmer, and had become a well-paid carter of refuse. Again a visit from Brackenreg to the pig farm, and he alleged that the farm must be closed immediately as the pigs had swine fever. </para>
                <para>Dennis said, " That is untrue, and you cannot bring one competent man to support the statement. Those pigs are as healthy as you, and there is no swine fever about them. . . . Anyway, bring the veterinary surgeon along and see what he says ". </para>
                <para>Brackenreg insisted, and declined to send the veterinary surgeon along, saying it was not necessary for that ho had condemned them himself, and that was sufficient. </para>
                <para>A few days after this, Dennis was put off carting the refuse, so as he had no income, had not grown more feed, nor stocked more pigs in consequence of the uncertainty of his position, he decided to get out, and sold his pigs to the local butchers, who slaughtered them, and the meat was duly passed, it being perfectly healthy, and Dennis departed leaving some " Rosemary for Remembrance " in the shape of a large unpaid rent account, and an angry lands officer. </para>

                <para>In March,  1928, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> received a telegram from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brackenreg,</inline> Lands Officer to the Commission, advising that he was the selected applicant for the proposed piggery, and requesting his presence in Canberra for the purpose of establishing his bona fides, as well as to have a general conference in regard to the proposal. </para>
                <para>In  April <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> arrived in Canberra, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brackenreg</inline> explained that the Commission wished him to continue on Dennis' farm until  a  new piggery was established. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> had, however, heard that swine fever had broken out on Dennis' farm, and he refused to have anything to do with that area.  It  was then agreed that a new farm site should be chosen outside the city area, and after inspecting several places, the present one was chosen. </para>
                <para>The reasons which decided <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> on selecting the present site were assurances given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brackenreg</inline> and  Colonel P.  Owen as follow :  - </para>

                </list>
                <para>The only objection  pointed  out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> to the proposed area was the absence of an adequate and permanent water supply, the visible supply of water being, in his opinion, inadequate for the needs of  500  hogs such as the Commission stated they would make provision to accommodate there. This objection was, however, definitely met by the gentlemen named with the assurance that the abattoirs would be erected forthwith, adequately supplied with town water and from which the piggery could secure connexion should local water prove unsuitable or inadequate. Upon this assurance <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> decided to go on with the proposition. </para>
                <para>Before returning to Sydney, on his first visit <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> had  a  conference with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brackenreg</inline> and the  Colonel at  the Commission offices, when he was shown a memorandum which had been furnished the Chief Commissioner, setting out the whole proposal, together with an estimate of cost. Copy of which is as under - " The Development Committee has for some time had under consideration the establishment of a hog farm with the dual objective of disposing of wet garbage from Canberra, and the establishment of a source of supply of swine to the abattoirs for the marketing of good pork in the Territory. </para>
                <para>The earlier deliberations were directed to the selection of a site, bearing in mind location within the proper zone, shelter from winter winds, water supply, suitable soil for raising crops, and proximity to the proposed abattoirs. In these deliberations the number of swine which it was thought would be on the farm was  500,  and it was thought that the number might eventually extend to  1,500. </para>
                <para>During the deliberations of the committee several authorities were consulted, who have given their view, for instance - </para>

                <para>One of the difficulties to overcome was the supply of water in sufficient volume at a location necessarily remote from the city services. Water supply will eventually be carried to the abattoirs, but in the meantime, to avoid heavy capital outlay, the site selected is not far from a goodspring, which will afford sufficient water for the purpose. That, however, involves a capital outlay, part of which is for water reticulation, inherent to the establishment of a pic farm on any site anywhere. </para>
                <para>The site, although  having a  westerly aspect is fairly well protected by the natural growth of trees. There is area of arable soil sufficient for the disposal of any effluents, and for the raising of some crops suitable for pig feeding. All the authorities consulted concurred in the site being a good one. </para>

Further, that when the piggery was complete, it would represent one of the most modern, hygienic piggeries  in the  Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> was then informed that a deposit would be necessary as proof of his bona fides to carry on the proposition when complete. Five months later he paid a deposit of £120, the arrangement being  that  rental would be 5s. 6d. per acre on 120 acres, plus7½ per cent. on constructional work done by the Commission, and was assured that  he  could at once proceed to order his stud stock for delivery in three months' time. </para>

He then proceeded to Tinamba and selected his purchase, arranging for delivery within three months - or before the end of July. He also arranged for the sows to be stinted in order that they may be in pig on arrival at Canberra. </para>
                <para>Towards the end of June, 1928, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles,</inline> not having heard further from Canberra, decided to visit the city and see what progress was being made with improvements on his farm.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Coles</inline>
                    paid his third visit to Canberra in October, 1928, and discovered that the farm had not even been surveyed - it was still in the same condition. He interviewed
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brackenreg</inline>
                    and, accompanied by two interested friends from Sydney, met  Colonel Owen,  Messrs. Brackenreg, Casboulte, Mousett, Fleetwood and others on the ground. A conference followed when, after consultation with all the officials present,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brackenreg</inline>
                    stated, in reply to a direct question asked by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles,</inline>
                    that accommodation would be ready for a consignment of pigs within six weeks.

A conversation followed with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Codzon,</inline> during which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> learned, for the first time, that the Commission had abandoned its original intention of having the improvements carried out by day labour and had called for and accepted a tender for executing one line of fattening pens only. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Codzon</inline> stated there were a dozen other contracts yet to be let to complete the work, but the Commission only had sufficient money available to permit his contract being proceeded with. In any case, even if the whole were let at once, it would take months before the work could be completed. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline>
                    returned to Sydney, and instructed his accountants to write a further protest to the Commission, with a request for a definite date when the farm would be ready for occupation.
                </para>
                <para>The Commission replied, definitely promising that occupation would be given in March, 1929. </para>
                <para>Accordingly, arrangements were made to cancel No. 2 deferred delivery of pigs, and a new order given for a similar number to be delivered during March. A prospectus was issued for the formation of the The Canberra Hog Farm Limited, to commence operations during March, 1929, with a nominal capital of £15,000, of which £5,000 was definitely assured to promote the enterprise. </para>
                <para>Between January and March, 1929, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> paid two further vists to Canberra for the purpose of making progress reports to the promoters of the intended company. During the first visit he found the first line of pig pens was well on the way to completion, and a second line had been commenced, but nothing had been done in regard to housing accommodation, boiling down plant and outdoor shelters for the pigs: Thesecond visit was made one week before the date the Commission had definitely promised delivery. He found that both lines of pens were nearing completion, but the homestead had not been started and no foundations laid for the boiling-down station, while much had yet to be done before stock could be placed upon the property. </para>
                <para>Owing to the fact that the Commission had again failed to keep its word as to the date of completion and delivery of the farm, those intending to join the company decided to withdraw their support. The Commission was notified by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> that, while it was his advice to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> that he should proceed against it for damages, his client was still willing to carry on if the Commission would immediately complete the farm. But in any case, it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles'</inline> opinion that the existing water supply on the farm would at no time be sufficient for stock requirements. </para>
                <para>Despite legal advice to the contrary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> arranged with the stock master in Melbourne to cancel his No. 2 deferred order for stock and to accept a similar order for future delivery. </para>
                <para>Correspondence proceeded between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> (accountant), the Commission, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maund</inline> (solicitor), during April, May, June and July in regard to the pig farm proposition, concluding by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> receiving the following letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brackenreg,</inline> dated the 30th May, 1929:- </para>

                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline>
                    promptly visited Canberra to verify
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brackenreg's</inline>
                    statements, but found there was not a single water or feed trough on the farm, many vital essentials were lacking, including no floors or backs to pig shelters, no workmen's quarters, no farrowing rails, that the digester boiler was second hand; n umber of coppers inadequate for sterilization of food and pump at the alleged spring, or water hole, was damaged, and would not work. On his reporting this to Sydney,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline>
                    brought under the Commission's notice the inaccurate nature of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brackenreg's</inline>
                    written representations.
                </para>
                <para>As a result of this letter  Colonel Owen  interviewed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> (accountant), in Sydney, and requested patience. The Commissioners were doing their best, and it would only be a few days when the farm would be ready for occupation. </para>
                <para>During July the stock master in Victoria advised <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> that he could no longer hold the pigs (No. 3 lot), and unless delivery was immediately taken they would have to be disposed of by public auction. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline>
                    inspected the farm a fortnight after  Colonel Owen's  visit to Sydney, and found that although the troughs had been delivered to the farm they were not in position, but that there was a limited supply of water on the farm, and that a start could be made in a limited way. He accordingly saw
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brackenreg,</inline>
                    who, apparently believing that the eighteen months delay and expense imposed on
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline>
                    had crippled him, demanded a bank reference, or guarantee, that he was in a position then to carry on the farm.
                </para>
                <para>This resulted in another visit by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> to Canberra, this time accompanied by his solicitor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maund),</inline> when the Commission withdrew its demand for a guarantee, and promised to send a draft lease to Sydney for completion, subject to certain special conditions - one asked for being a guaranteed supply of at least 1,000 gallons of water per day from the farm spring. This guarantee was not given, but a clause added setting out that if the local water supply failed, water could be supplied to the farm, providing lessee paid 50 per cent. of cost incurred. This lease was executed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> during August. </para>
                <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> was certain that delivery of the farm could take on a definite date, he requested the Melbourne stock master to defer delivery of No. 3 lot of pigs, but was informed that his consignment had been catalogued for public auction at the Melbourne show sales on 29th September, 1929, and if he wanted any he would have to be present and bid to secure them. This <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> did, paying as much as £40 for sows he had originally contracted to purchase for £8. The consignment purchased by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> comprised 25 brood sows in pig. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline>
                    officially took over the farm on 1st October, 1929, and the stock arrived early in November. In November he purchased from Victoria a further lot of store pigs for fattening purposes. They were consigned with a clean bill of health from both the Victorian and New South Wales authorities. On arrival they were placed in the outdoor shelters of the farm, which, at that date, were still incomplete. Heavy rain fell a day or two after their arrival, and, having no adequate shelter, they contracted pneumonic enteritis, and a majority had to be destroyed, only 20 per cent. surviving.
                </para>
                <para>In this connexion, it is interesting to note that on 19th June, 1929, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> informed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brackenreg</inline> in writing, in reply to an inquiry of his of 17th June, 1929, "that it was essential to have the pens floored and ends boarded." Moreover, owing to faulty construction, rain water ran into the pens off the semi-circular roof instead of outside -a defect that was not remedied until twelve months after occupation. </para>
                <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> was discussing terms of the lease,he learned that improvements carried out by contract had cost £6,700, instead of £4,300 as originally estimated, while the farm was still incomplete. </para>
                <para>Under the lease he undertook to collect daily the edible garbage from all government institutions according to schedule attached to the lease. These comprised over 30 houses and institutions, of which less than halfexist to-day. The Commisison had been paying £2,000 to contractors to have this garbage removed. Thus <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> relieved, and still is relieving, the Administration of that cost. The supply of garbage when the lease commenced approximated 3 tons per day, and was worth the cost of removal for pig feed. To-day, and under existing conditions, the quantity does not average half a ton per day, but the same removal charges have to be borne by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles,</inline> while the value of the garbage as pig feed is much less than the cost of collection. From a source of profit it has become a source of loss, and therefore a direct charge against the farm. </para>
                <para>The water supply, originally intended to provide for 500 pigs, has never warranted the keeping of 50 pigs, while on occasions it has totally failed. This has taken place in the slimmer months of 1930 and 1931. </para>
                <para>In 1930 several pedigreed sows in pig died from thirst, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> applied to the Commission for town water, as provided for in his lease, he was informed, " It has nothing to do with the Commission; it is your pigeon." Ho had to consult the police, who in turn had to threaten the Commission with proceedings under cruelty to dumb animals before the Commission moved in the direction of re-adjusting the pump to obtain a small supply still in the water hole. In 1931, water was supplied from town mains, and the Administration charged <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> £6 per week for 1,000 gallons per day over four weeks - or a total amount of £25 6s. 7d., being 50 per cent. of the total charges. If the farm had been fully stocked the water supply would have cost <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> £30 per week during the dry period. </para>
                <para>On 18th December, 1930, regulations under the Public Health (Piggery) Regulations were gazetted. These provide that the proprietor of any registered piggery in the Territory " shall  provide a sufficient and constant supply of fresh water," for drinking and cleansing purposes. Penalty, £100. It also provides for suitable drainage being attached to each feeding trough. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> paid his registration fee, a certificate has not been granted to him, nor can it be under existing conditions. Nor, at times, can the edible garbage supplied from the hotels be sterilized,  as  provided for in the lease, because of shortness of water. </para>
                <para>In order that there should be no doubt but that the Commission was fully acquainted with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles's</inline> opinion that the water supply would prove inadequate, it is interesting to quote the following letter sent by him to the Commission on 18th July, 1929, paragraph 13:- " There are also doubts as to whether the water supply, completed at a cost of £500, will be adequate, as on my inspection last week there were only 3 feet of water in the spring (about 250 gallons) notwithstanding the fact that I had been assured that it never failed, and was quite sufficient to provide the water to meet all my demands. I respectfully state my opinion that this spring will not at any time be sufficient to meet my requirements." </para>
                <para>In view of ( 1 ) the incomplete state of the farm when taken over; (2) inadequacy of water supply to stock upsufficiently to balance commitments; (3) shrinkage of edible garbage, and, therefore, pig feed; (4) losses sustained through inadequate shelter for pigs; (5) general uneconomic conditions imposed by the lease, as well as those prevailing onthe farm; (6) high rent; and (7) the staggering losses sustained by the lessee as a result of eighteen months' enforced idleness and travelling expenses, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> was compelled to ask for an inquiry during March, 1930, with a view to his being awarded compensation and redress. </para>
                <para>A general inquiry was allowed in March, 1930, and was conducted by the Commissioners, and as a result  a  drainage system was placed in operation on the farm; shelters were floored and boarded, and certain of the pig troughs were cemented in. Although the alleged spring had been proved to be a dud, several hundreds of pounds were wasted in trying to increase the flow of water. A rebate on the first twelve months rent was also granted, but no reduction in future rent. </para>
                <para>As the inquiry failed to give the lessee the relief and compensation he desired (a full statement of which was supplied to, and at the request of, the Chief Commissioner, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson,</inline> for and on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles's</inline> behalf), the Third Commissioner <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Alcorn)</inline> sought the advice of two world experts in regard to the general conditions and possibilities of the farm. They were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> H. Potts, late principal of Hawkesbury College, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. David</inline> Stead. These reports are in the hands of the Minister, and copies are being procured. </para>
                <para>As the inquiry afforded the lessee no real relief he found it necessary to execute a deed of arrangement with his creditors with the result that the farm has been carried on for the past twelve months under that deed. The trustee of the estate has been continuously impressing upon the Minister and the administration generally, the urgent need for a review of the rental and provision for an adequate supply of water. Finally the administration was advised three months ago that unless clemency and help was shown towards the lessee, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles'</inline> estate must be wound up. Four letters sent to the administration during that period remain unanswered, while a fifth has been acknowledged with an intimation that the rent would be reduced from £500 to £250 during the next six months - the next year to revert to the full rent charged. (See letter.) </para>
                <para>This offer is totally inadequate. Over £4,000 have been lost to date by the lessee and his supporters as a result of what the lessee claims to be unadulterated misrepresentation. </para>
                <para>Over £10,000 of public money has been spent on the farm and it is still incomplete. </para>
                <para>The object of the farm, viz., to supply Canberra residents with an adequate supply of edible pork at reasonable rates has not been realized and that through no fault of the lessee. </para>
                <para>As all appeals for a fair deal have been sidetracked by the administration, a demand is now made for a public and independent inquiry into the whole matter. </para>
                <para>The fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> has given proof both of his bona fides and ability to make good if given a fair chance. He has held on tenaciously to his job of winning through to success and can be relied on to make good if only given a fair deal. </para>
                <para>In March of this year a world's record and two Australian records were made upon the farm in regard to pork production when a litter of eleven pigs from one sow attained the phenomenal weight of 2,506 lb. within six months, while the second record was created this week, with another litter of eleven pigs attaining the record weight of over half a ton in fifteen weeks. </para>
                <para>The results of these records have brought forth favorable comment from world-wide authorities with innumerable inquiries for stud stock of the same breed from pig farmers all over the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> should fail through official mismanagement and apathy then it must react against the public in many ways. First, the capital cost will have to be written off; second, the Commissariat Department will have to find at least £1,500 per annum, now saved it on the collection of garbage by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles;</inline> third, the public will have to continue to pay high prices for pork, when, if given proper water facilities, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> could provide all Canberra's requirements in pork at 8d. per lb. as against1s. 3d. at the present time, and fourth, a necessary local industry will be destroyed capable of giving permanent employment to four men. </para>
                <para>What is required is a scheme for conserving surplus water now running to waste. This could be done for an outlay of less than £500. A further £500 would complete the farm in a way that would enable the original estimate of accommodating 500 pigs on the farm being realised. </para>
                <para>In any case and under all circumstances the rent charged should be set off against the known cost of garbage collection. The Government should not seek to have it both ways. </para>
                <para>The Public Accounts Committee would be the best tribune to submit the whole question to, and if that be done it does not require the mind of a seer to foresee that the result must be a damning indictment against the past and present administrations, and, perhaps, the discharge of some incompetent officers employed by them. </para>

                <para class="block">The purpose of the amendment is to grant Supply for only three months instead of twelve months. This proposal is made in view of the extraordinary circumstances existing in Australia to-day. The statement has already been made, in anticipation, that an amendment of this character is unprecedented. It may be; but many unprecedented things have been done recently. The financial condition of the nation is without precedent in Australian history. The circumstances in which the Government is carrying on are unprecedented. The Government is giving effect to a plan for the rehabilitation of the nation's finances with the assistance of the members of the Opposition, and in spite of the hostility of members of the Ministerial party. Those circumstances are extraordinary. I do not suppose that ever before in the history of Australia a government has been compelled by force of circumstances to jettison its own financial policy, substitute the policy of the Opposition, and give effect to it with the aid of the Opposition in spite of the hostility of members of the ministerial party. We, who are in opposition, have been associated with the financial rehabilitation plan from its inception. We assisted in formulating it, and we are now helping the Government to carry it out. We shall continue to assist the Government until the plan is completed. Honorable members may laugh ; but the fact is that this amendment will give to the Government sufficient time and Supply to give effect to that plan. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Previously the full responsibility rested on the Government and its supporters; but if the Government had depended upon the support of its own party it would not have dared to submit this plan to Parliament. It could do that only with the co-operation of the Opposition. Surely, therefore, it is right, and, indeed, a mere act of courtesy, that the Government should recognize that, with the exception of one small faction, the House is acting as one party in connexion with this plan. The Government does not need, at this stage, Supply for twelve months. We want to be able to see from week to week how the plan is working out. </para>

                        <para>- I have not, but these recriminations avail nothing. We are anxious in the interests of the country, to see the plan carried to a successful conclusion. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has stated that the Government will ask the House to adjourn merely for a few weeks. I accept that promise because I know that the right honorable gentleman will honour it, but we of the Opposition  are not so confident regarding the attitude of the ministerial party We know that it subscribes to a policy different from that which the Parliament has adopted, and the outside organizations, including the recent Labour Conference, determined that that policy should be pursued. The Opposition has supported the policy that emanated from the Premiers Conference, and I desire to make clear that we shall resist every attempt to substitute for it the policy of inflation to which the Government was committed a few months ago. Having helped the Government to place on the statute-book a policy in accordance with the rehabilitation plan, we want to be in a position to check any attempts to vary it. I may be told that without  refeusing  Supply for a full year we could still prevent the Government from retracing its steps. But once the Government has been granted Supply for twelve months it, and not the Parliament, is in supreme control of the destinies of the country. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; I mentioned the Labour Conference merely as an additional reason for the precautions I am taking. The Labour organizations had announced their attitude earlier. I give to the Prime Minister credit for having resisted their efforts, but I do not know how long his resistance oan continue. The Opposition has no confidence in a policy of inflation. Possibly, as on other occasions, the Government will delay action until this Parliament has no alternative but to agree to measures with which it does not agree. For instance, when the proposal to export £5,000,000 worth of gold to London was brought forward, the financial position had become so acute that we had no alternative but to agree to an expedient to which we had previously signified our uncompromising hostility. We are entitled to do what we can to safeguard the policy for which we stand, and for which the Government to-day also stands. That is all that we are doing. We have no guarantee that the other policy of the Government may not be introduced. Only yesterday the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin ) criticized the Prime Minister for withdrawing that other policy, and the right honorable gentleman turned to him and said, " If the honorable member will indicate to me how we can achieve that policy," the inference being that if there were some method of giving effect to that policy it would be adopted. We do not believe in that policy, and we do not want any opportunity given for its introduction. I say that frankly and honestly. It may be said that this amendment, if carried, will prevent the completion of the plan. I submit that it will not.</inline></para>

                        <para>- That is for the Prime Minister to say. In moving this amendment, I am adopting no hostile attitude to the Government. The position is that the leaders of the united party in this chamber, and in the Senate, interviewed the Prime Minister, and appealed to him to accept their suggestion. There was no hostility shown at all. In the past crises have occurred, and they will continue to occur. This Parliament is not the only trustee of the people. The State governments are equally responsible, and at least one of those States has not acted up to the promise that its representative gave at the last Premiers Conference in Melbourne. Another crisis may develop at any time, and in that event this Parliament as a whole should have the right to deal with it. I claim that right, as representing the Opposition for the reason that we have been parties to the present plan and are partners with the Government in its efforts to achieve it. Therefore if a State Government takes any action which jeopardizes the success of the plan, we claim an equal right with the Government to deal with it. We have, for the time being, given up' all opposition to the Government because of the plan. We are just as much concerned with it as is the Government, and we claim the same right to deal with it whatever the circumstances may be. The plan is practically complete so far as this Parliament is concerned. Within a few hours it will be disposed of, but only with the assistance of honorable members on this side of the chamber. I move this amendment on behalf of the united parties. </para>

                        <para>- I have no wish to waste the time of the committee. I have done everything within my power to facilitate the plan of rehabilitation. I have done nothing to hinder the Government, and if it will accept the amendment it can depend upon the support of the Opposition in regard to the plan. Even if the amendment is not accepted by the Government, we shall still stand behind the plan. There is no necessity to pass the whole of the appropriation at the present juncture. Only on rare occasions has the Appropriation Bill been disposed of within a few weeks of the beginning of the financial year. I admit that it is desirable in normal circumstances to pass the Appropriation Bill early in the financial year, but in the special circumstances existing to-day, we are compelled to watch the operation of the plan. If  Supply is   granted for three months, that will enable us to complete the plan, and at the end of that period supply can be granted for the remainder of the financial year.

                    <para>. - I have clearly indicated on a number of occasions that the Government will not accept an amendment of this description, and I repeat that statement now. I shall give to honorable members good reasons why the Government should not accept the amendment, which, despite all the camouflage with which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> surrounded it, is calculated to do one thing only, and that is to humiliate the Government in the eyes of the people of Australia. The proposal is to reduce Supply after this committee has agreed to the Estimates. Such an action is unprecedented in the history of this Parliament. On numerous occasions the Estimates have been delayed, but in every instance, so soon as the committee has approved of the various items of expenditure as set out in the Estimates. the House has passed the Appropriation Bill. There is a sound reason why there .should be limits to the amount granted under a Supply Bill. Parliament has a perfect right to control the national purse. I agreed with that principle when I was in opposition, and I agree with it now as head of the Government. Parliament must limit the supply granted by it under Supply Bills, because those bills are brought down before the Estimates have been passed. When the Estimates are passed, however, the Appropriation Bill is introduced and passed. Any Government that desires money to meet expenditure which has not been submitted to Parliament  must  be content with a limited Supply. Hence this Government recently asked for one month's Supply only to enable it to carry on until all the items of expenditure for the financial year had been agreed to by Parliament. The Estimates have now been agreed to, and the usual course is to pass the Appropriation Bill. There has never been a departure from that practice. We are living in a time of stress, but we have passed through other abnormal periods, and never before has the practice of passing the Appropriation Bill immediately after Parliament has agreed to the Estimates been departed from. The Leader of the Opposition has said that it is quite usual for the Estimates to be submitted to Parliament late in the year, but I remind him that, to some extent, it has been the practice to bring down the Estimates early in the financial year. I have before me a similar list to that which he read, showing the dates upon which previous appropriations have been passed. On some occasions the Appropriation Bill has been passed as early as in August, and on other occasions not until nine or eleven months of the financial year have elapsed. Does the- Leader of the Opposition suggest that we should now have three months' Supply, and at the .end of that period another three months' Supply, and so on until the end of the financial year ? The Estimates can be considered in another place only in the form of an appropriation bill, and, if the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition is agreed to, they cannot be passed by another place; they must be held up. Honorable members opposite have talked a lot about restoring confidence in the people., but how can we restore confidence in this country unless we bring down the Estimates early and obtain the appropriation for the financial year? It is the boast of the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> that' he was the first Treasurer in recent years to bring down the Estimates early in the financial year. Only in the most extraordinary circumstances should a government delay for more than a month the introduction of the Estimates and the Appropriation Bill. If, instead of obtaining appropriation for the financial year, the Government introduced Supply Bills at threemonthly periods, the departmental expenditure would hot be authorized until months after it had been incurred. Such a practice would not he sound finance, and would not tend to restore confidence in the people. At this critical time in the history of Australia, when we are asking the bondholders of Australia to agree to a conversion loan of £556,000,000, the Leader of the Opposition, in moving his amendment, has placed a stigma upon this Government. He has said, in effect, that it cannot be trusted, that if it gets twelve months' Supply it . will go into recess and play ducks and drakes with Commonwealth revenues. The Leader of the Opposition talks about his responsibility. I have acknowledged  the help that we have received from all sections in this chamber in giving effect to this plan. We have taken a course of action that has been most distasteful to us, but we have taken it honestly. I believe that there is no one in this country, whatever may be his view of the plan, who has any doubt about the bona fides of the Government with regard to it. It ill becomes the leader of a party which talks of being a partner in the plan, to throw mud at the Government, and to say, "We cannot trust the Government ", the inference being that the people must not trust us. What chance have we of converting loans amounting to £556,000,000 if that stigma is accepted by the Government, especially in the light of all the propaganda that has preceded it? As the head of the Government, I would not attempt, in such circumstances, to appeal to the people to support that conversion. This is an attempt to wreck the plan. I have been watching events, and reading carefully the statements that have been made in the last two or three days. One that is typical of many, was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> who was the head of the Government that left us this problem to solve. Last Tuesday's press contains a report of an address that the right honorable gentleman delivered to the electors at Bunyip, in the Flinders electorate. He then said that " it was unthinkable that the Senate should consider any proposal that the House should adjourn for twelve months." Who has suggested an adjournment for twelve months? It is the suggestion of honorable members opposite, and of these gentlemen outside, that this Government wants to rush into recess for twelve months. I have made the definite statement that before this House rises I shall move for its adjournment to a date to be specified, the only qualification being that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> may call us together at an earlier, not a later, date. The Leader of the Opposition has said that he accepts that statement. Let him, then, do so. On the next occasion also I am prepared to adjourn to a date to be fixed. I believe that Parliament should retain control over its sittings. The Leader of the Opposition suggests that wo would be in complete and supreme control, and that the Parliament would have no say; that we might change our policy and introduce something that he does not like. How could we do that without meeting Parliament and passing the necessary legislation? All this talk to the contrary is mere piffle. Let us look- at the record of this <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> who talks about this Parliament going into recess for twelve months. He was Prime Minister from the beginning of 1923 until the end of 1929. In 1923 Parliament sat for thirteen weeks, in 1924 for 25 weeks, in 1925 for thirteen weeks, in 1926 for 24 weeks, in 1927 for seventeen weeks, in 1928 for eighteen weeks, and in his last year for twelve weeks. Imperial conferences were held in only two of those years. During 1930. notwithstanding the fact that I attended an Imperial Conference in that year, we sat for 28 weeks; and in the seven months of this year that have passed, we have sat for twenty weeks. We intend to go on sitting. All the recess that I am asking for at this stage is, at the most, five weeks. I shall not have one week's holiday myself, because I shall be attending the Premiers Conference and meetings of the Loan Council, or shall be engaged in formulating the legislation that will arise out of them. </para>

                <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> says that the plan is complete. I say that it is not complete, but that so far as the Government is concerned, it will be completed. There are others to come into it, in addition to those who have already been reduced;- there shall be no mistake about that. If the plan is not completed we shall test the issue before the people of this country, and see that it is. We have put our hand to the plough, and are not going to turn back ; not because we like what we are doing, but because we have been forced into doing it. The Leader of the Opposition contends that we have been forced to adopt the policy of the Opposition. I deny that that is so. The Opposition has never put forward a policy for a conversion loan embodying the general reduction of interest. All that the Opposition ever suggested was to reduce governmental expenditure, to restore confidence. It claimed that if that were done, interest would automatically fall. Interest could not automatically fall on the £556,000,000 worth of loan securities. When asked what was the purpose of this amendment, the Leader of the Opposition said, " We want to watch the working of the plan week by week". So, also, do we. He then went on to say, " If we grant you too much Supply you will not meet Parliament; so we' shall grant you three months' Supply". Thus, he is not going to watch the working of the plan week by week, but quarter by quarter. I tell the honorable gentleman that we do not want three months' respite. </para>

                        <para>- In any case, we shall not be in recess for two months. The honorable gentleman talks about co-operation. This is not  co-operation.  Again and again" the statement has been made, " If we grant Supply  Ave  shall lose control, because Parliament will rise for twelve months. We want to watch the plan, and we wish to make sure that the budget does not slide ". The Government, surely, has shown unmistakably its earnestness in watching the budgetary position! We have done much that is distasteful to us. We intend to see that the plan is completed; but we are not going to ask the people of this country to show confidence in us while this stigma rests upon us. After all, it is the Government that is responsible, although the Leader of the Opposition may claim all the responsibility that he cares to assume. I have been prepared to co-operate with him or with anybody else in this national crisis. I have sat quietly under the sneer of some of my erstwhile friends that I have joined forces with the Opposition. L have stood taunts of that nature for months. I would be prepared to co-operate with anybody to help this country through the crisis with which it is faced. But because we have done that, we are not going to have our noses  rubbed  in the dust; our opponents are not going to be allowed to keep the chains on us. This is an unworthy proposition, and it has emanated from persons outside of this Parliament, who do not want to see the plan com pleted, as it is likely to touch them. I have learnt more than the honorable member suspects. I have heard the stories that have been going the rounds. I know some of the influences that are behind certain members of another place. We shall resist those influences, as well as this attempt to humiliate the Government. If it were true that this is the policy of the Opposition, and that we have adopted it, why try to thwart us? That is what is being done. </para>

                <para>I am inclined to think that the Leader of the Opposition does not realize what he  i3  doing, and that there are more astute minds than his behind this move. I invite honorable members to consider the consequences of this action in the present vital period of Australia's history. We are embarking upon something that is unprecedented in our history. We are proposing to put through the greatest Debt Conversion Loan that the world has ever known. Nothing approaching it has ever 'been attempted in Australia. I have joined with the Leader of the Opposition, and the head of our great financial institution in an appeal to the people to have confidence in the Government of Australia. It is the Government in which they must have confidence, whatever that Government may be. Yet, on the very eve of that appeal, the Leader of the Opposition, who is a member of the National Appeal Committee, makes the statement that he cannot trust the predominant partner in this scheme. I say to the honorable gentleman, that if this move is successful, the Conversion Loan is finished so far as we are concerned. He cannot have it both ways. An appeal to the people to trust the Government and to restore confidence cannot be made while a dagger is held behind the back of the Government, and the argument is used that we cannot be trusted. The Leader of the Opposition claimed that his party was entitled to take this stand. It is entitled to do so only if it can become the Government of this country. If it can command a majority in favour of this amendment, it can become the Government when it has obtained sufficient support in the country. This is one of the most vital amendments that has ever been moved in any Parliament. No more vital amend-  ment could be moved than one to reduce the amount in an appropriation bill by 75 per cent. No self-respecting government in any civilized country in the world would accept such an amendment as other than a motion of want of confidence. The Leader of the Opposition says that it has been moved in a spirit of co-operation. Probably he believes that that is so. Such an idea has been pumped into him by cleverer people than he ; and it is those people who are behind this move. The Government will treat the proposal as vital wherever it is put forward. It will not leave this Parliament until this stigma and humiliation have been wiped out. We shall not attempt to go out to the people with this hanging over us. Had it been suggested that we might adjourn the discussion of the Estimates with a view to meeting the views of honorable members, the atmosphere would have been different. There is now an atmosphere of suspicion and of criticism, the idea being that the Government cannot be trusted with twelve months' supply after its Estimates had been embodied in the Appropriation Bill. We refuse to be placed iu such a position, and shall treat the matter as vital. </para>

                    <para>. - The Country party does not see eye to eye with the Leader of the Opposition on this matter. The honorable gentleman has moved to amend the Appropriation Bill. The Estimates having been passed through the Committee of Supply with the concurrence of the Opposition, it was apparently recognized that they were framed on what is known as the Melbourne plan, for the consummation of which the Leader and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in this chamber, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate have accepted joint responsibility. To my mind, the action now taken is sufficiently unusual to warrant the Government in regarding it as a challenge. The Leader of the Opposition must have realized before he moved his amendment that the Government would regard it as such. That being so, it is evident that he must have so intended it. </para>

                <para>A fortnight ago, I moved as an amendment that the first item on the Estimates be reduced by  £1,  in order to direct attention to the necessity that exists for removing customs sur-taxes and of reducing customs duties generally, with the object of lowering the cost of living and of production. When I moved that amendment I did not expect that it would be regarded as a censure motion, and I did not intend it as such. I took that step as the only way open to me, to focus attention upon certain things which members of the Country party felt must be done; otherwise, the plan, in our opinion, would be incomplete. How did our friends of the official Opposition regard my motion? Let me quote the following extract from the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> of Monday last, under the headings " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Paterson's</inline> Amendment. Why it was not supported - United Australia Party Explains " : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The amendment was accepted by the Ministry as a motion of want of confidence. To have passed it would have put the Ministry out of office. Parliament was considering a plan to meet n national emergency. Members of the Opposition generally are pledged to assist the Ministry in putting into effect as soon as possible the substance of the plan that was agreed upon at the Premiers Con- '  ference  in Melbourne. That plan is a first step in the work of national rehabilitation. Its success depends upon prompt action by the Commonwealth and State Governments. Che result of defeating the Ministry, in cooperation with. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Paterson,</inline> would have been to wreck the plan. To support an amendment having that effect, even though many members of the United Australia party might have been prepared to accept the actual words of the amendment, would have been to run the risk of national chaos, and would have involved taking an unfair advantage of the position of the Ministry. To abstain from voting would have shown lack of courage. The Opposition was prepared to accept the responsibility of voting against the amendment, nut because it believed in the Ministry, but because it was not a proper occasion on which to defeat the Ministry and interfere with the national plan. </para>

                <para>To my mind, it is idle to say - and it has 'been said 'by interjection already by one <inline font-weight="bold">Dr two</inline> members of the official Opposition - that the plan legislation is complete; that it has reached a position in which it cannot be assailed. Is it complete? It is true that we have passed legislation with respect to that plan, measures for the reduction of pensions, and the wages and salaries of public servants. That part of the plan is in actual operation. There is, however, another part of it equally necessary and important, and that relates to interest reduction. It is true that this House has also passed that legislation; but it is not yet in operation. We are waiting for one State to pass the Debt Conversion Agreement Bill. All the States have signed the agreement, but all the Parliaments must ratify it before we can proclaim the Debt Conversion Act which is based upon the agreement. After we have proclaimed it, three weeks must elapse, during which time those who wish to dissent from conversion may do so. A great deal may happen  in that three weeks to ensure either the success or the failure of the conversion loan. I recall that, at the Melbourne conference, a committee was appointed, consisting, of three gentlemen who were to work together to make the conversion loan a success. They were entrusted with the task of making a- joint appeal to the better nature of the bondholders. These were the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson.

                        <para>- I can assure the Leader of the Opposition, for whom I have the greatest respect, that the party to which I belong cannot be accused of having any special liking for the present Government. We are taking this action merely because we believe it to be right at this particular juncture. If the Go*  vernment  were put out by this means at this time, it would put an end to any co-operation that could be looked for in regard to the conversion loan, and the situation that would arise could be described only as Gilbertian. </para>

                <para>It appears to me- and I speak for the whole of my party on this occasion - that by turning the Government out at this juncture, the Opposition would Unwittingly forge a deadly weapon to be used by opponents of the plan. I would like to submit these suggestions to members of the Opposition. It appears to me that if they give them consideration they must feel that this is not the right time to take the proposed step. Many things would be said by opponents of the plan if this were done. I do not suggest that these statements Would be true, or that many of them would have foundation in fact. For my own part, I believe that the members of the official Opposition are as earnest in their desire to carry out this plan as are any other members of this Parliament. But things would be said, and when mud is thrown a certain amount of it sticks. It would be stated, for one thing, that the Opposition was only anxious -  - </para>

                        <para>- No ; it would be said that the Opposition was only anxious about one side of the plan - the part already in operation. It would be pointed out by opponents of the plan that the. Opposition was the particular party to the plan which stressed the voluntary aspect of the conversion loan. Much would be made of that. It would he said that the Opposition was not keen about penalizing those who did not desire to convert. </para>

                        <para>- I am going to show what those who desire to put the plan into operation would be up against, and what they would have to refute, if the Government were put out of office at this time, and I submit that I am justified in making these statements. It would be said that the selfish bondholder - and we know that they are not all selfish, by any means, for many of them are most patriotic ; but some of them have a good deal of the old Adam in them - it would be said that the selfish bondholder, . whose only reason for converting was a fear of, possibly, worse things to come, might be encouraged to dissent by the hope that a new government might be more lenient to him than the present Ministry. It might also be said that certain banks, which have not yet announced all-round reductions on advances, might be encouraged to delay longer in the same hope. </para>

                        <para>- I refuse to regard it as such, and having moved it, I determined to stick to it. If we dismiss the Government by means of a motion of this kind to-day, each and all of these factors that I have mentioned must come into play to render' uncertain the prospects of a successful, nation-wide conversion. We are right in mid-stream at this very moment in putting the conference plan into effect; we have not yet completed the job. There is a wise old proverb to the effect that it is not a good thing to change horses while crossing a stream. The Leader of the Opposition mentioned in his speech the fear he had that the Government would perhaps reintroduce its former proposals for the inflation of the currency. I am as much opposed to that as he, and my reply is that there is still the same means of resisting that as there has been up to now, namely, the majority in another place. </para>

                <para>Nobody in this Parliament can accuse me of having exhibited any undue affection for the present Government. I told the Ministry eight months ago that Australia could not remain solvent as a nation, unless we reduced our expenditure by. 20 per cent. I waa hotly criticized, and, indeed, condemned, by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> for that statement. Then came the time when the Government realized that there was no escape from doing this very thing; it had to eat its own words, and it did so. It agreed with all the States to do certain very hard things, and, as the Prime Minister said, it had put its hand to the plough, and, so far, had not turned back, despite tremendous criticism. The official Opposition, as has been stated several times by its leader, was a partner to the arrangement. The views of the Country party when that plan was put into effect were not sought, and we, as a party, if we had wished, could have regarded ourselves as free to please ourselves in the matter; we were not pledged to the plan. But some months ago, before the plan was evolved, I told the Government, on behalf of my party as did also the Leader of the Opposition on behalf of his, that if it would take its courage in its hands, and make the necessary though unpopular reductions in governmental expenditure, we would stand behind it, and take our fair share of the responsibility. I frankly admit that I did not expect the Government to do that. But it has done it, and the Country party is prepared to make good its promise to support the Prime Minister until he has completed his task. We do not regard the task as yet finished. I repeat that we do not do this because we have any special liking for the present Government. We disagree with it on fundamental matters, especially with its economics, and at another time we shall cheerfully assist to turn the present Government out. I tell the Prime Minister this quite frankly; but we shall not do it at this particular period when the Government has half finished a thankless task in which we are supporting it, and in doing which it has received more kicks than commendation. </para>
                <para>The Country party asks from the Prime Minister a definite assurance that, when Parliament resumes, so soon as any pressing legislation arising out of the plan has been disposed of, full opportunity will be given to discuss the tariff in both Houses. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know that the speeches delivered by the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> and the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> leave very much to be said by others; but I have to acknowledge that in this matter there is something more in the minds of individuals than is involved in government solidarity. There rests upon the Opposition, and upon every member of this chamber, a responsibility to hig constituency, and I believe honestly that every well-wisher of the plan, and every well-wisher of his country, will regret profoundly that this amendment has been moved this morning by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons).</inline> I say this in all sincerity. The  Deputy  Leader of the Country party has, with becoming candour, pointed out that, in due season, he will renew the fight which he and the members of his party have carried on against the Government and its policy. We expect that. We expect so much also from the Nationalist party. And it is natural that it should be so, because of the many matters mentioned here which, from the point of view of each party are considered vital. There is a world of difference between the policy of the Opposition, the policy of the Government, and the policy of the Country party. I think we all realize that the success which has attended our efforts in connexion with the colossal task to which we are committed has been due, so far mainly, if I may say so without offence to the Opposition, to the extraordinary efforts and skill of the Leaders of this Government - the right honorable the Prime Minister and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore).</inline> But, having done that, we do not forget that it has also involved action on our part. Although the task is distasteful and, on the face of it, incongruous with the policy of the Labour party as a whole, we have acted throughout in the defence of those interests which, in a very special sense, we have always been called upon to defend, namely, the interests of the wage-earner, the pensioners and others who are least able to defend themselves. We were working in defence of those interests before this plan was adopted, and while inevitably we were driven back, we have not surrendered though we have given ground, and it is our proud boast to-day that, as a government, we are seeking to serve with determination and courage the best interests of those whose welfare is, in that special way, in our charge. In the fulfilment of this task we have been made the target for a bitter attack - some of it sincere and honest, some of it poisoned and dishonest. We have been held up before the electors as a government that has deserted its friends and its principles, and has made dishonorable alliances. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>We have not done those things. We realized the great responsibility that was involved when we accepted the obloquy of appearing to desert principles which we hold sacred, and which have been made to appear more so by the interested criticism of those who, outside, and, I fear to some extent inside, this Parliament, have valued more the passing applause of those to whom they look for applause than the interests of the country as a whole. But I do not wish, on this occasion, to make an attack on anybody. We have reached a stage at which, I hope, the great majority of honorable members desire to make this monumental work a success, because we realize how critical is the position in which we find ourselves, but from which we hope to emerge triumphant. Accordingly, we have looked round, and have extended the hand of friendship and cooperation to those who, in the past, have not worked with us, and to some who will not work with us now. But that is not our fault. We believe that we are serving the best interests of those who have the first claim upon us - the best interests of the majority of the people of Australia, and we hope to maintain to the limit the rights of our citizens. In doing this, wo are prepared, for the time being, to lay aside all thoughts of party conflict, and to work with any one who is willing to co-operate with us in serving this high ideal. </para>

                    <para>that this matter can be discussed without any bitterness. The action by the Opposition is perfectly straightforward. We believe that we are doing the right thing, and are prepared to go right ahead. Unnecessary heat was imported into the discussion by the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> who talked so excitedly about humiliation, and the support which he has received from this party in a perfectly genuine way. He can afford to take this stand, so long as he can play off the Country party against the official Opposition. But were he now in that position which he occupied on so many occasions during the last few weeks when, outside his Cabinet, he had only seven of his own party supporting him, when he never knew where his own whip was, or where the members of his party were, he would accept the support of the Opposition with the utmost cheerfulness and avidity. </para>

He spoke of humiliation ! Was there ever a government, within your knowledge, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that has suffered more public and parliamentary humiliation than has been imposed on this Government lately? Its vacillation regarding vital issues has been characteristic of its leader throughout this crisis. Although the Country party intends to support the Government upon this occasion, the  Deputy  Leader has definitely intimated that his party will do its utmost to eject the Government from office when it considers the time opportune to do so. The Prime Minister does not regard that as a humiliation. On the contrary, he sees in it some hope of continued existence as the Leader of this Government. The Attorney-General said just now that, in order to give effect to the economy plan, Ministers had eaten the leek. Of course they have, and they have had their noses well rubbed in the ground. Accordingly, it ill becomes the Prime Minister to talk about humiliation at this stage. He spoke of the need for confidence, and told us that this Government, trusting in the confidence of the people, was going forward with the conversion loan proposal, and that it would be successful, because the Government had the confidence of the public. This Government has not the confidence of anybody in Australia. Have honorable members of the corner party and the people they represent any confidence in this Government? Has the great United party any confidence in it? The thing that the people of Australia would welcome more than  anything else, even at this critical stage, would be the removal from office of this Government. Its defeat at the hands of the majority of members in this House would be an incident that would induce an unmistakable display of confidence by the people of Australia in the soundness of this country. </para>

                <para>I have listened to the abject apologies of the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> for what he did last week, and to his explanation that he did not mean his amendment to be a vote of censure. Although he was told that it was so regarded by the Government, he was prepared to go on with it. He was ready then to put the Labour party out of office, and he will try again, he says, as soon as he feels inclined. Yet he has the cool effrontery and audacity to-day to blame the United Australia Party for doing exactly what he did. Is the honorable member's attitude logical ? s Is it even fair? I submit that to every right thinking honorable member it is contemptible. Putting aside the apologies of the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party, and his declaration that he did not intend his amendment to be regarded as a vote of censure, and the fact that, although he was told by the Government that it was a vote of censure, he still persisted in going on with it, with the paltry support of five followers, what sincerity can be attributed to the honorable member's attitude, or that of his party at this particular juncture? I heard with surprise his statement that he intended to apply to honorable members of the United Australia Party certain epithets, or adverse criticism. He took great pains to explain that he did not mean them, and that they were not true, yet he went on with them.

He made that statement in his budget speeches and in the Ashfield fiasco. He has repeated it in every speech he has delivered throughout the country. Yet, because he has now some temporary support, he is prepared to swallow anything in order to retain office. </para>
                <para>The Government has asked for Supply for twelve months, but the people would have held the Opposition in this Parliament to be absolutely recreant to its trust if it gave the Government twelve months' Supply. The fact stands out as clear as the top of a mountain peak that the people do not trust the Government. Five out of six men chosen at random in Martinstreet, Sydney, or Collins-street, Melbourne, would say that the present Government should not be trusted with twelve months' Supply. The attitude of the Opposition is, therefore, a reasonable one in the circumstances, and particularly in view of' the assistance it has given to the Government to carry out its programme. It has played the game. Not for one instant has it ever considered the party aspect. First and last and all the time its consideration has been for the interests of this great country. Whether its action to-day be right or wrong, it  is solely dictated by the interests of the Commonwealth. It is doing what it thinks is best in. those interests. </para>

He says that not one person in the community trusts the Government, yet. as a member of the Nationalist party, he said some weeks ago that the bondholders could trust the Government in the £556,000,000 conversion loan. The step taken to-day by the Opposition is most despicable, they having declared that they are parties to the rehabilitation plan. The Prime Minister hit the nail on the head when he said that we have to look behind this move to find the astute and designing minds that are dictating it. There are certain men who are prepared to wreck the plan, a*nd even the conversion loan, to regain seats in Cabinet, and as the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> has said, there are some bondholders who believe that if they can overthrow this Government they can avoid making certain sacrifices under the plan. </para>

                    <para>In the existing circumstances, and after these months in which the Government has abundantly demonstrated its courage and its earnestness, any effort to thwart it would be the acme of party churlishness. Those Senators who are known to have been most active will doubtless think better of it. Some of them, indeed, might exercise their memory and challenge their conscience. They were once members of Governments whose persistent indulgence in recess attained to the dimensions of a scandal. In the" year 1927 the Rationalist Government had Parliament in session for little more than three months. In 1929 the Federal Parliament did not function during two-thirds of the working year. Men who were prominent Federal Ministers then are credited with being arch-conspirators in the plot designed to embarrass and humiliate a Government which is bravely struggling to cope with difficulties which the (government of these former years did much to create. If the current rumours prove to any degree true, they will constitute a most discreditable display of party intrigue. Happily, some of those senators who arc widely believed to be involved have the grace  to  show themselves somewhat ashamed; and, though willing to wound, are to-day less disposed to exhibit the malevolence of last week. The Australian people will hope that there are senators sufficiently capable of. rising above the mean- temptation to pick a quarrel with the Government. It would be madness to precipitate a struggle, but, if the Senate were misguided, a struggle there would be. No Government having so much good strenuous work to its credit could be expected to submit tamely to the futile indignity arrogant senators think to impose upon it. Most people are aware that some of these senators are secretly longing to enjoy power, are secretly fretting because they are not at the centre of the picture. They will be wise to keep their ambitions in check a while longer. The Australian people are in no mood to be tolerant of intrigue while their country continues in financial danger. </para>

                <para class="block">The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is not a Labour newspaper; it has always been a Liberal newspaper, but in a national crisis it is prepared to rise above party intrigue, and, certainly, above the intriguing that is now going on in another place to defeat the Government, in order that certain persons may get back into power. We know that certain persons were for a long time in office, and that they are prepared even to wreck the whole plan in order to conceal the real motive behind the step taken by the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber to-day. As has been said by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> the present Government has been obliged to do things most obnoxious to it. It would never have done them if it had not been impressed by the fact that the country was passing through a grave national crisis, and that if the Premiers' plan was not adopted, ensuring the payment of pensions and Public Service salaries, a more substantial evil would have fallen upon both pensioners and public servants. </para>
                <para>We have taken our political lives in our hands in accepting this plan. We realize that by doing so we must inevitably encounter much misunderstanding and criticism. Certain honorable gentlemen opposite have told us that they were prepared to help us to put the plan into effect; but now that we are half-way across the stream, so to speak, they want to throw us overboard. They think that this is a good opportunity to defeat the Government, and are doing all they can to bring that about. Is this because they fear that they are not getting enough limelight? Do they think that they are not getting enough kudos for their action in supporting the rehabilitation plan? They are undoubtedly trying to stick a dagger into the Prime Minister, while pretending to be a party to the plan. Perhaps they are doing this because they realize that the action the Government has taken is being acclaimed throughout the country as bold and courageous, and in the best interests of the Commonwealth in this hour of grave financial crisis. </para>
                <para>It is well known that all the members of the Government and many other members of the Labour party who are supporting this plan are doing so Vt the possible cost of political extinction. But we realize that the plan must be supported if the welfare of the people who sent us here is to be our prime consideration. The Labour party has not thrown overboard its policy, nor has it given up any cherished Labour principles; it has postponed them for the time being, realizing that under the existing circumstances they cannot be put into operation. We had to face facts and we simply decided that in a time of national crisis, such as this is, it is better to pay 17s. 6d. per week to our old-age and invalid pensioners and a reasonable salary to the members of the Public Service than to court financial ruin and national bankruptcy, with the inevitable result that ten times more people will he thrown out of employment. </para>
                <para>I am astonished at the attitude adopted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> for I gave him credit for being sincere in his desire to see this plan put into operation; but he has not taken the high stand of the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson),</inline> who is not prepared at a time like this to sacrifice the interests of the community in order to stab the Government in the back, and thereby wreck the plan. I, and every member of the Government, and of the Labour party, intend to support the Prime Minister's attitude on this amendment. The Opposition will make a great blunder if it forces the issue to an election, for it will thereby undoubtedly seriously endanger the success of the conversion loan. I urge the committee to vote against the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - I support all that the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> has said on this issue. The statement which he made was considered by the members of the Country party and endorsed in every respect. I regret that some heat has been imported into this debate, for there was no need for heat. I regret, also, that the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> saw fit to cast aspersions on the motives of the  Deputy  Leader of this party. Everyone who knows our  Deputy  Leader knows that he is incapable of doing anything that is mean or contemptible. Yet a fortnight ago when he moved a certain motion in this House, it was said that he was doing something mean, and now that he has taken action in the opposite direction it is being said that he is doing something contemptible. Such statements are not conducive to orderly debate and the peaceful settlement of a dispute. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>It has -also been said that the Prime Minister is trying to play off the Country party against the official Opposition. That is a ridiculous statement. Everybody knows that we have practically nothing in common with the Labour party, except the policy involved in the financial rehabilitation plan, while we have very much in common with our friends who sit on the same side of the chamber as we do. Nevertheless, when the Government is acting in a way which we regard as sound and desirable, it is our bounden duty to support it. If we did not do so, we should be dishonest. 1 entirely repudiate the suggestion that the Country party is actuated on this occasion by ulterior motives. We are supporting the Government because we believe thai it is the right thing to do. To-day we must be above party, and act only for the good of the country. No one can truthfully say that either I or the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party have any love for this Government. I have opposed the Labour party throughout my political life, and it has invariably opposed me and given me no quarter. I suppose that so long as I remain in politics I shall oppose the Labour party. There is, therefore, no reason why I should " smoodge  " to the Government, or why it should "  smoodge  " to me. My reason for supporting it on this occasion is that I think that it is acting wisely in the best interests of the country. </para>
                <para>It was stated quite clearly by the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party that our action in supporting the Government on this occasion was not to be construed as an intention to support it on every occasion. We shall fight it whenever we think it proper to do so. The honorable member for Warringah used a statement of the  Deputy  Leader of this party to that effect as a reason for attacking him and his party ; but he was quite unreasonable in doing so. It is proper that we should support the Government when it is doing what we think it ought to do; and it would be equally proper fbr us to fight it and do our best to turn lt out of office when it is doing something that we are opposed to. When that time comes, as it must come sooner or later, because the policy of the Labour party is different from our policy, we snail certainly fight the Government and do our best to defeat it. But while it <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> doing what we wish to have done, we must support it, if we are honest. We will fight the Government and attempt to put it out of office only when it is taking some action which we regard with disapproval. The honorable member for Warringah practically said that we would stab the Government in the back when an opportunity presented itself to us to do so. That is not the way the Country party fights its battles. We never stab people in the back, nor do we stand in ambush with a gun in our hands to shoot our enemies as they pass by; we fight fairly and openly. We shall not fight the Government at a time when it is doing its best to give effect to a policy which we have advocated for a long time, particularly as in doing so it has incurred the wrath and enmity of many of its own supporters and has torn its own party to tatters. The Government is acting courageously. We have no reason whateVer to question the purity of its motives, and we shall therefore, support it. There will be no stabbing in the back by the Country party. We aro sincere- in our desire to see the rehabilitation plan brought to a successful issue. We also wish to see the conversion loan successfully floated. It must be apparent to everybody that the loan could not be successfully floated during an election campaign. Such a campaign would be inevitable if the Government were defeated on this amendment. In my opinion the official Opposition has chosen a wrong time and a wrong issue on which to attack the Government. We are prepared to grant the Government the supply desired. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that I said what I did. Honorable members unfortunately do say things in the heat of debate which they are afterwards sorry for. I was led into making the remark about the honorable member for Warringah, because he attacked the motives of the  Deputy  Leader of my party, and abused him personally and politically. As I have already said, my  deputy  leader is incapable of doing a mean thing, either politically or personally. I endorse all that he said in his speech, and I will oppose the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - Another sham fight is being staged. It might appear that this amendment was sprung on the committee, but the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> has shown that that is hot so, for he has just delivered what amounted to a written speech, and has admitted that his extended notes were submitted to the Country party and approved by it. This proves that it was well known by most honorable members opposite that this amendment was to be moved. I therefore liken this debate to a sham fight, in which the contestants dress up in military uniform, equip themselves with bayoneted rifles, but carefully put corks on the ends of the bayonets so that it will be quite certain that nobody will be hurt. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hunter),</inline> who has just spoken, and the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson),</inline> and the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> are always asking the members of the group to which I belong why they do not throw the Government out of office. Here is an opportunity for them to help us to do so, but they have shown that they will not accept it. The plain fact is that  honorable members generally have not the courage to face the country. The honorable member for Maranoa has given the show away. </para>
                <para>The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> waxed eloquent and sarcastic this morning. Like the Prime Minister, he had a great deal to say about the interests of the country. I repeat a remark that I made a few days ago to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Johnson</inline> was quite right when he said that every act of treachery against a people was accompanied by a declaration that it was being taken in the interests of the country and for the country's good. He defined " Patriotism " as " the last refuge of a  scoundrel ". The Attorney-General talked a lot about honorable members who criticized this Government because they desired to win the plaudits of the crowd; but no one plays to the gallery more than he does. I may make some bitter remarks in a heated debate, but I could not, like the Attorney-General, bury myself in the library and, in cold blood, think out terms of invective and abuse to hurl at my opponents. Only a person with the cold-blooded mentality of the honorable gentleman could do that kind of thing. I, and other honorable members of this group, may make unwarranted remarks during the heat of a debate, but no one is more ready than we are to withdraw them a moment later. What has the Prime Minister to worry about? The Opposition has compelled the Government to accept its policy. The Government has been so humiliated that I wonder it is not devoid of all sense of shame. It is acting the part of the cat which, in pulling the chestnuts out of the fire for the monkey, had its paws burnt. In this instance it is the Opposition that wants the chestnuts. No one is hungering more for office than ' the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> who knows that he is playing with the Prime Minister as a cat plays with- a mouse. The Opposition is now ready to swallow the Government, which in the end will have no escape. The Governhas allowed the Opposition to drag it down the hill; but what is it now to do? The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> referred with great emphasis and emotion to those prin- ciples  which he says he holds so dear ; but will the Minister tell me of one which he has not sacrificed for the sake of office? Not one shred of any of those principles which he once so readily espoused is left. They have all been completely shattered. The Attorney-General has bartered his principles for the sake of office. This Government has bartered those principles which the Labour party has always cherished as sacred for a few months'  occupance  of the treasury bench. The Government is now getting what it deserves. The chickens are now coming home to roost. So far as I can see, this Government will continue to submit to humiliation after humiliation. The right honorable the Prime Minister, with all the eloquence and fire which he could command, said that he would accept the challenge of the Opposition, as the Government of which he is the leader could not allow itself to be humiliated. He said : " We will go to the country." What did the right honorable gentleman do in connexion with the Fiduciary Notes Bill, which was discussed some time ago in this chamber, and then rejected by another place. The Prime Minister said that if that measure were rejected in the other branch of the legislature, it would 'be again submitted to that chamber in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, and if again rejected, his Government would appeal to the people at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cusack)</inline> apparently does not know what courage means. Like a cockatoo on its perch, he uses words the meaning of which he does not understand. He has not the courage to stand up to his declarations. I predict that if the course now proposed is adopted in another place, as it is likely to be, the Government will not go to the country. </para>

It is useless for the group to which I belong to say what we shall do. Apparently the Government has too many friends. Having a surplus of support in this chamber, it can in the corridors arrange sham fights as it has done this morning. The members of the Country party are merely playing up to the crowd outside, and their actionin this instance is contemptible in the extreme. The Attorney-General, in referring to the crowd outside, hurled insults upon his electors. </para>

                        <para>- The brain of the honorable member is as dead as those of the people from the cemeteries, who voted for him. I should like to ask the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> whois playing up to the plaudits of the crowd, if he did not attain his present position and place on the votes of " the crowd " to which, when far away from his electorate, he now so Contemptuously refers? It is the electors of Batman to whom he is responsible. They are the persons who placed him where he is, and gave him position and power which he is utilizing in a most discreditable way. Of course he is entitledto refer to his electors in that way if he so desires;but I believe that when lite opportunity arises, they will have as much contempt for him as he now has for them. During the twelve years I have been in Opposition, or on this side of the chamber, I have fought for those ideals and principles which I have always enunciated, and that I shall continue to do so whether a Labour or Nationalist government is in office. Several hours have been wasted in a display of mock heroics. The attitude of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> who spoke with some fluency, the eloquence of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> and the contempt of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> are so much humbug. We know that the Attorney-General was only playing up to the crowd, and that he engaged in a sham fight merely for the benefit of those whom he hopes will support him. The amendment which will be rejected in this House may be carried in another place; and I shall watch with interest to see what action the Government will then take. </para>

                    <para>. - It would appear from the statements made in this House and upon public platforms that the Government is responsible for the financial plan adopted at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers to assist this country in its present difficulties. A good deal has been said on this subject, and without taking undue credit to myself I may say that I was always very keen upon the reduction of the interest on advances and overdrafts, as by that means greater relief could be afforded to this community than even by the reduction of interest on loans, which, of course, has a beneficial effect on the budgetary position. I wish to quote from an official document to show how this scheme was evolved. The official report of the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers shows that a sub-committee of the Loan Council was appointed to make certain recommendations. If some members of this Government had had their way, that sub-committee would not have been appointed, but because the Premiers were in a majority they appointed three members of the Loan Council to draw up and submit a report. That committee consisted of the  Hon.  J. P. Jones, Minister for Public Works in Victoria, who was the chairman; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> L. Hill, the Premier of South Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mitchell, the Premier of Western Australia.

                <para>It is the bad policy of the recent past that prevents us from having confidence in the Government. We believe that this scheme, in the propounding of which the Opposition has played a part, should be policed throughout. In the light of certain decisions that have been come to outside, it is hard to tell what may happen to the Government that now occupies the treasury bench. More than one Labour conference has recently declared its unflinching opposition to its propositions. Therefore, the Opposition is right in taking this precautionary measure of refusing to grant twelve months' Supply. Supply for a quarter, or for even two months, will enable the government of the country to be carried on. </para>

I believe that we are taking the right action, and  that  that will be realized by the sober-thinking section of the community. Whatever action may be taken in another place, I am certain that it will have the very solid backing of the people of this country. I have no fear on that score. I could have remained in the Government, but I preferred to leave it because I did not trust the man who was re-instated as Treasurer. That is my position to-day, and it has been my p081 tion right through the piece. Whether that honorable gentleman be guilty or innocent, it was not right to re-admit him to the Cabinet. I shall have no hesitation in voting for the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member who has just resumed his scat stated that he was prepared to go before the electors at any time. I suggest that, as he entered this Parliament pledged to support the Prime Minister whom he has abused to-day, he should have consulted his electors before deciding upon his present course of action. That would have been decent and honest. Because he has shown himself incapable of acting in that way, perhaps the best thing that we can do is to leave him to his electors. </para>

There is no need for anybody else to bother. I contest a seat only when the Labour men and women in an electorate select me to run. In the honorable member's electorate, those men and women who sent him here have now selected another man, and We can rely upon them to deal with the honorable gentleman when he goes before them. It ill becomes him, before meeting his electors, to say the very unkind things that he said to-day in regard to his former leader. It was left to men who are more honest than he is to say that they would accept the word of the Prime Minister. The Leader of the Government can afford to ignore the honorable member's jibes. The people of this country know the right honorable gentleman for what he is, and nothing that is said about him by honorable members opposite will cause them to think any the less of him. </para>

                <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> put his case without indulging in the abuse to which the honorable member for Maribyrnong has resorted ; but there was a remarkable inconsistency between his utterances and those of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill).</inline> The Leader of the Opposition denied that he wanted to embarrass or to belittle the Government, or to make it difficult for the Prime Minister to enter upon the campaign in support of the conversion operation; but he was followed immediately by the honorable member for Warringah, who could not get away from one remark, which he made over and over again. He seemed to be almost incapable of saying anything else. That remark was that no one trusted the Government, or had any respect for it. If that is the honorable member's belief, he should appeal to his leader to withdraw from the conversion campaign upon which he proposes to embark with the Leader of the Government. It would be interesting to know whether the Leader of the Opposition agreeswith the honorable member for Warringah that the Government is not trusted by the people. If he does, the honest course for him would be to withdraw from the campaign. </para>

                        <para>- It is good to have the assurance of the Leader of the Opposition that he does not agree with the irresponsible utterances of the honorable member for Warringah. That honorable member jibed at the Prime Minister, and said that he was glad to have the support of the Opposition while the Government was endeavouring to put the plan into operation. The Government stands to-day exactly where it has stood since the plan was first mooted ; but where does the honorable member stand? The Government wants to see every part of the plan carried out. It has stood for things that are distasteful to every honorable member on this side. But we found ourselves in the position of having to implement the plan, and we did so willingly. We have shown our preparedness to take all the risks associated with the restoration of the financial stability of this country. Having examined every alternative that was placed before us, we decided that this plan would pull Australia out of the bog in which it was floundering. We advocated the reduction of the old-age pensions to 17s. 6d. a week rather than see old-age pensioners placed in the position of having to accept 12s. a week. Those who opposed that proposal could offer no alternative ; and they cannot deny the accuracy of what I have stated. Public servants and others who have had to suffer a small cut would have been subjected to a much bigger one had the plan not been given effect. Therefore, I say to the honorable member for Warringah: we stand exactly where we stood when he supported us. But where does he stand? We are standing foursquare, not only for those things that were distasteful to us, but also for the principal portion of the plan, which is to secure relief from interest charges on behalf of the primary producers, the business community and the people as a whole. That measure of relief has been too long denied to them. It is remarkable that difficulties should arise when we have reached that portion of the plan. I say candidly to honorable members opposite that there is grave suspicion of collusion among themselves and certain outside parties to break down the plan at this very vital stage. No portion of the plan is more vital than that which pro,vides for the reduction of interest, so as to give relief to the great mass of the people of this country. Why is it that, having reached that stage, unprecedented action is taken in this chamber ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe that the action taken by the Leader of the Opposition represents his own considered opinion. If it does, it shows a lack of judgment on his part. There is more than a suspicion that this attempt at a hold-up by the Nationalist party was planned by the Leader of the Opposition in another place. There is a suspicion that it was devised in collusion with certain outside interests, which are adopting an attitude at this stage that does them no credit. I think that the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber has been used as an instrument to implement this sinister scheme, the idea being that, if it succeeds, well and good, and, if not, the Leader of the Opposition must take the discredit of it. In my opinion, the hand behind it is that of the Opposition Leader in another place, who is in collusion with outside interests. Those of us who know him, realize that he is the most disgruntled and sour individual in politics, because he has been out of office during the last twenty months. He is prepared to go to any length to. use the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber to further his own ends. Perhaps the most pitiful argument advanced this morning was that of those honorable members who endeavoured to excuse their attitude by saying that somebody else, 8 week or so ago, had done the same thing as they were now doing. One is reminded of the school boy, who, when he has done wrong, endeavours to avoid punishment by saying that another boy has committed a similar act. The Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> sought to excuse themselves by remarking that the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party had submitted a similar amendment a week ago. </para>

The Prime Minister told the Opposition that he did not intend to ask for a long recess. He has said time and again that the adjournment will not extend over more than five weeks. Whatever may be the reason for the tabling of the amendment, the action taken brands its sponsors as the would-be destroyers of the plan, and there is more than a suspicion that the Nationalist party is acting on behalf df outside interests that desire to prevent its successful operation. </para>

This amendment is of such grave importance, that the Nationalist party should, at least, have paid the members of the Country party the compliment of conferring with us, not to see how far we might embarrass the Government, but to determine the best course to pursue to promote the welfare of Australia. I cannot imagine at a time like the present any worse tactical move than that which has been taken by the direct Opposition when the rehabilitation plan, which is attracting the attention of all sections, has just been launched, and when members on both sides have committed their political fortunes to it. The Leader of the Opposition appears to have committed a prodigious political blunder, and has not given the members of my party a chance of considering carefully the probable result of his action. </para>

                <para>With two points that the Leader of the Opposition insisted on I totally disagree. I do not wish to import any heat into this discussion, because it would be dangerous for us towrangle over this plan. It is a pity that the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> did not continue his speech on the note with which he began it. The Leader of the Opposition based his case upon the definite statement that the plan was the plan of the Opposition.  His  other point was that it was the duty of the Opposition to police the plan, and he was strengthened in that contention by  the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> the tenor of whose speech was that the sole motive of the Leader of the Opposition was to see that the plan was policed. I maintain that the Opposition never heard of the plan until it was formulated at the Premiers Conference. If the Opposition did know that it was being evolved, and that it was to embody the final scheme of reconstruction, its knowledge was kept a deep secret from members of the Country party. I venture to suggest that the majority of the members in the Nationalist party did not know what the details of the plan were until they were published at the Premiers Conference.I do not know why the members of that party wish to father this plan when they have no sound claim to having originated it. Everybody knows that the Country party was not represented at the Premiers Conference. We have often been accused of a desire to promote our party interests at the expense of the rest of Australia. My answer to that criticism is that, although we had every reason to feel that we had been practically ignored in regard to the gigantic task of financial reconstruction, we decided that, as the plan had been adopted by the Premiers Conference, and by all the great parties in Australia, we, too, would stand behind it. </para>

                        <para>- We comprise the only party that has been consistent in our support of the plan.I think that the proceedings in this House in the last few weeks will show that the Country party has not receded from the patriotic position which it assumed when it committed itself to the plan. We do not claim to be responsible for it, and we do not desire to police it. The proper authority to do that is the present Government, which has assumed responsibility for it. All that the Opposition has been asked to do is to assist the Government to inaugurate the plan. While the present Government remains in power it is the only authority that has any right to police it; therefore, I consider that the Leader of the Opposition has based his motion on utterly untenable premises. In the first place he claims that it was the plan of the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>- No; but that party, and the Country party, gave an undertaking that they would support it, and up to the present stage we have honorably carried out our promise. The Government has admitted that it cannot carry out the plan without our support, and that makes it essential that we should " play the game " by the Government, because it was realized, after various other schemes had been explored, that this was the only possible way of averting the financial collapse of this country. I accepted the Prime Minister's assurance that the only motive that actuated him was the desire to avert financial disaster, and the Country party has not sought to make political capital over the matter. Certain honorable members on the Government side did not, at any time, support the reductions included in the plan for the restoration of financial stability. They may say that they could go to the country at any time and secure the endorsement of their constituents for their attitude. I admit, too, that they could put those honorable members who do support the general scheme in a difficult position so far as a portion of their electors are concerned.I am not under any delusion in regard to this matter. I believe that it will be extremely difficult for many honorable members to satisfy their electors in regard to all that has been done in connexion with this plan. As I have said, the plan is the production, not of any particular party, but of this Parliament. Therefore, it is not fair that any one section of the House should endeavour to persuade the people that the plan is their particular scheme. Responsibility for it rests upon the whole Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Then why did the honorable gentleman, some time ago, give the Prime Minister a definite assurance that his party would loyally co-operate with the Government in giving effect to it? The motion before the House implies a lack of trust in the Government; a proclamation to the people that something has happened to make the members of the party which he is leading dissatisfied with the attitude which the Government is likely to take up. No member of this House can say truthfully that the Government is likely to default in the carrying out of the plan. In the absence of such evidence, it is impossible for the Leader of the Opposition to justify his declaration of lack of trust in the Government's bona fides. Although it is true that honorable members on this side brought pressure to bear upon the Government to reduce expenditure, nothing was ever said about the reduction of the interest burden until that proposal was dealt with at the recent Premiers Conference. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the matter was mentioned in that way, and 1 believe that the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> was the first to foreshadow the plan which was adopted by the conference, because he was the first to declare definitely that nothing short of a 20 per cent. reduction in all governmental expenditure would meet the situation. But, as an Opposition, we did not at any time consider the practicability of a proposal to consolidate the whole of our internal debts into a new issue of securities bearing a lower rate of interest. That scheme emerged from the Premiers Conference, and was adopted by the party to which I belong, and other sections of the Opposition, as an inescapable part of the general scheme of reconstruction. We realized that it would not be possible for us to approve of and advocate a reduction of pensions, Public Service salaries, and other forms of governmental expenditure unless we were prepared to go a step further and approve also of that part of the scheme relating to the reduction of the interest burden. Accordingly, we have no right now, at this critical stage, to make a gesture which may be regarded as an invitation to the people to withdraw their confidence, not only from the Government, but also from the Parliament, because surely it is obvious to all that if now we withhold cooperation in giving effect to the plan, the public will believe that members of Parliament as well as the Government are not to be trusted. Isuggest, therefore, that the course adopted by the Leader of the Opposition is an extremely dangerous one. </para>

                        <para>- I have no information about the action of the banks in Victoria towards the plan, but I hope that it has no relation to the move made in this House this morning. The banks in Victoria have dealt a severe blow at the plan, and if they persist in their present attitude, it will be practically impossible for those members of this House who support the plan to go out and fight for it. But it is now too late to retreat. Since the plan has- been approved by both Houses, surely honorable members will not now discredit themselves by indulging in party warfare. Whatever we may lose by the surrender of political advantages, in our advocacy of the adoption of the plan, we will more than make up in the long run by the knowledge that wc have played the game, not only to the Government, but also to ourselves and the people whom we represent. If we allow party bitterness to intrude at this critical stage in our history, very few of us will survive an appeal to the people. Our places will be taken by others who will have no political sins to answer for, and who, for that reason, will make a wider appeal to the electors. I think it is necessary to utter this word of warning to those who approve of the dangerous course that has been adopted by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

                <para>This morning the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> again twitted members of the Country party with being always ready to make a demonstration in a sham fight. The honorable member, like the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> appears to be obsessed with the idea that members of my party decline to join issue with other parties in anything but a sham fight. I believe also  that one member of the corner party has declared that I made overtures for concerted action against this Government. I emphatically deny that allegation. In any case, such overtures would be foredoomed to failure. Moreover, because members .of the corner party have," on more than one occasion,  lately,  revealed themselves in their true colours, wc do not wish this Government to bo put out of office. I do not see what we could gain by joining forces with the Lang group to challenge the Government, and certainly I would not think of doing so while the Government is endeavouring to give effect to a plan which has our endorsement, and which I believe to bc in the host interests of the people. Even if I had an opportunity to eject this Government from office with the assistance of the Lang group, I would not take advantage of it because members of the corner party are the political creatures of the revolutionary Australian Labour Party Executive in New South Wales, and stand for the destruction of all that we hold most dear in public life. </para>

                        <para>- I dispute the accuracy of that statement. The honorable member for Gippsland, as I am sure all honorable members who heard him will admit, spoke temperately, and with a genuine desire to prevent the intrusion of the bitterness of party politics. But it was his duty to direct attention to the seriousness' of the step which had been taken by the Leader of the Opposition, and it was obvious that the task which he had set himself was extremely distasteful. Nevertheless this did not prevent the honorable member from making a bitter attack upon the  Deputy  Leader of my party, charging him and his following with a desire to engage freely enough in sham fights, but never in a real one. </para>

                        <para>- I regret if I have improperly credited the honorable member for Warringah with the interjection, but I know he has made that charge against our party on other occasions. The honorable member did, however, say that we were now the allies of this Government. We are to the extent that the Government adheres to its pledge to give effect to the rehabilitation plan, and I think we need offer no apology for our support under those conditions. We cannot, therefore, be accused of being the allies of the present Government, any more than honorable members on the other side can be accused of being allies of the Nationalist party. The object of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> was to make out that the Country party had changed its political tactics, and for the time being, was virtually part and parcel of the Labour party. That is not so. We believe that the present Government, with its knowledge of the situation, is best equipped to carry out the task of rehabilitating the finances of this country, which has been thrust upon this Parliament, and that a new Government, lacking in experience of the present situation, would not be similarly equipped. Indeed, we think it would be a disaster if the present Government left the treasury bench before this task is completed. It will take a long time to carry out that task, and although it will be the duty of this Parliament to see that the period is not unduly prolonged, it must give the Government a reasonable chance. In the meantime we do not expect the Government to introduce any measures likely to meet with violent antagonism from this side of the chamber. It is true that we opposed the Government's fiduciary notes policy, because we did not believe in it, and in fact regarded it as a much more dangerous method of solving our financial problems than any other method yet put forward. The Government realized that it had no chance of getting away with that policy, and dropped it. In doing so, </para>

When a Government says that it does not propose to go on with certain bills, advancing no reason other than that it does not consider that it is practicable to do so in the present situation, I think we ought not to pursue the subject further. In any event the Government has intimated that it will not bring forward its fiduciary policy again during the life of the present Parliament. I take that to be the meaning of the assurance given by the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- We should regard it as a breach of faith so far as the plan is concerned, if the Government reintroduced its fiduciary notes policy. At any rate, the Country party will reserve the right to oppose that legislation, and any other measure which it considers inimical to the plan or to the welfare of Australia. Should the Government intro-  duce tariff duties which we consider too high, we shall reserve to ourselves the right to oppose them, even to the extent of bringing about the defeat of the Government. We do not agree with the present high tariff. We say that it is iniquitous, and is causing a tremendous amount of damage to industry. We shall at every available opportunity stress that view. </para>

In the final stages of the Premiers Conference, when these decisions were being arrived at, leading members of the Opposition were called in, and, from what I can gather, were given a status equal to that of the Premiers and leaders of the Commonwealth Government. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, they had as much influence as anybody else at that conference. The point at issue to-day seems to be: To whom does the plan belong? I think we can dispose of any claim on the part of the Government very quickly. A perusal of the bulletins issued by it a few months ago shows conclusively that, at that time, its policy was entirely the opposite to this plan. Ministers stated in fairly strong language that in no circumstances would they surrender to the ultimatum of the Commonwealth Bank Board that salaries, wages, and pensions of all kinds must be cut before the board would give any financial assistance to the Commonwealth Government. The declaration of the </para>

                <para class="block">Government, in which it refused to accept that ultimatum, is conclusive evidence that, up to a few months ago, the Premiers' plan was not the Government's plan. Indeed, we can safely say that the Leader of the Opposition is responsible for a large portion of the plan, because, when he was Acting Treasurer of the Commonwealth in October last, his policy was on lines similar to what has been incorporated in the plan. He says himself that his proposals at that time were net so drastic as those which have been put before us by the Melbourne conference. </para>

Tracing events down to the present time, we can come to no other conclusion than that this plan is acombination of the proposals of the present Leader of the Opposition and those of the banking institutions. </para>

                <para>I believe that the purpose of the move by the Leader of the Opposition to-day is to demonstrate that his party is still desirous of maintaining the same grip upon the plan that it has had up to the present time. The Government cannot deny that effect could not have been given to the plan if it had not been for the support of the Opposition in this House. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> division lists indicate how few were the supporters of the Government who voted for it. The Government depended entirely on honorable members opposite. Those honorable members, therefore, can rightly sustain their claim to maintain their hold upon something with which they have been associated prior to the Premiers Conference and from then to the present time. Of course, the Prime Minister in the strongest language at his disposal has denounced the Opposition for its move to-day, saying that the purpose behind it is to wreck the plan, and we gather from the Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> what is meant by the suggestion that the plan will be wrecked. There is said to he a move on  the part ofbanking institutions in Victoria that are now being called upon to reduce their rates of interest to prevent any further effect being given to the plan, now that wages and pensions have been cut, so that they will not be called upon to reduce these rates. But honorable members onthe Government side who use that argument should themselves give serious attention to their own consciences. They have agreed to all the other reductions proposed in the plan, but have no guarantee from the banking institutions that they will reduce interest rates. </para>

                        <para>-They have been given a way out. Effect has been given to all the other parts of the plan. Although we were told that the plan in all its parts was to operate simultaneously, this Labour Government is cutting pensions and wages, knowing all the time that it has no grip at all upon the financial institutions. The obligation rested on it before it gave effect to any part of the plan to see that all interests, particularly the banking interests, bore their equal responsibility. The people least able to defend themselves have been adversely affected ; their remuneration has been arbitrarily reduced, whereas others have been allowed to work out their reductions in their own way and in their own time. As a matter of fact, there is considerable doubt whether they will ever give effect to their cuts, and according to the Government the move of the Leader of the Opposition to-day is to provide them with a loophole of escape. The  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> followed closely upon the Prime Minister, but, of course, the Prime Minister already knew the intentions of the Country party. He knew that the Government was safe. That is why I look upon this move with amusement. </para>

                <para>The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> in the abusive speech which he delivered, accused certain honorable members of playing for the plaudits of the crowd outside. For my own part, I would far rather gain the plaudits of the crowd outside, as they arecalled, who are responsible for my political position, than accept the plaudits of my political enemies, and the backing of a press which almost always is totally hostile to the Labour movement. I have no doubt that the Attorney-General was glad to accept the applause of the banking institutions when he agreed to advocate the adoption of this plan. But I remind him that the large industrial organizations of Australia, which are principally responsible for the existence of the political Labour party, have, during the last two months, made many declarations in condemnation of this plan. Only a few days ago the Prime Minister attended a conference of the Labour party in Melbourne, which, despite his defence of the plan, declared itself to be totally hostile to it. There is no doubt about the attitude of the rank and file of the Labour movement towards this plan. I am afraid that some honorable members consider that after they have been elected to this Parliament they can bring to bear a greater degree of intelligence upon the problems of national finance than when they were private citizens. For this reason, insufficient as it is, they are inclined to regard with scorn any opposition to their own views. I do not adopt that attitude. I realize that the rank and file of the workers, because of  the adverse circumstances which they have to meet day by day, are more fitted to form a fair estimate of the effect of this plan upon their own circumstances than are honorable members of this Parliament, and for my part I intend to be guided by the views of the rank and file of the workers. </para>
                <para>As I have said, the test of the sincerity of honorable members of the official Opposition and the so-called Labour supporters of this Government will be determined when the attitude of another place is known. The plan is being supported by the traditional enemies of the Labour party, and by a few honorable members who were elected as pledged Labour men. In these circumstances, it seems to me that the electors might well exclaim, like Mercutis, " A plague o' both your houses." </para>

                    <para>.- I am very sorry that the members df the Country party have intimated that they are not prepared to support the amendment. A week or two ago I was one of the few members of the official Opposition who supported an amendment 'of the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson),</inline> the object of which was to improve the fiscal system of the country. I am prepared to support any section of honorable members which desires to take effective action in that direction, even though some risk may be incurred thereby. It is a groat pity that intriguing interests outside of this House have been able to cause some degree of estrangement between the various parties which sit on this side of the committee in opposition to the Government, for I believe that we should be able to cooperate in a very large measure. The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson),</inline> in his speech, said that political tacticians outside of the chamber were bringing influences to bear upon the parties which sit on this side of the chamber. It will be very unfortunate if highly desirable financial and other reforms designed to improve the economic position of the country are delayed on this account. </para>

But the right honorable gentleman had certain unofficial warnings some time ago that a move, of this kind by the Opposition was probable, and he could then have intimated that he was prepared to consider meeting the Opposition in some way. The fact that he is now riding the high horse is no reason why we should give him a blank cheque for the next twelve months. </para>

                        <para>- I know that there would be some restriction on the Government; but I remember that the Prime Minister signed an agreement in Melbourne about this time last year, in which he undertook that his Government would effect substantial reductions in expenditure. It is true that the expenditure of the Government has not exceeded the amount voted in last year's Estimates; but it has been guilty of wilful neglect to fulfil the terms of the Niemeyer agreement. In consequence of the financial drift that has since occurred, additional treasury-bills have had to be issued, and a large amount of our gold has had to be shipped abroad. If the Government did not spend more than was voted on the Estimates last year, it certainly spent a great deal more than it was justified in spending in view of the changed conditions of the country. If the Prime Minister had given effect to the agreement which he signed last year, it is possible that we could have overcome our difficulties by making a 10 per cent, cut in adjustable government expenditure, instead of the 20 per cent, cut which we have now been forced to make in order to prevent a total collapse. Not only did the Prime Minister fail to give effect to the August agreement of "last year, but he has also failed to carry out the anti-inflation policy which he advocated in certain cablegrams which he sent to his former colleagues while he was ra. </para>

                <para class="block">England. So far from doing that, the right honorable gentleman, when he returnedto Australia, actually reconstituted his Cabinet and allowed those who were his firm supporters in his absence to be turned out of office in order that Certain inflationary schemes could be submitted to Parliament. It is proposed that fiduciary notes should be issued. This had a serious effect upon the finances of the country, and severely shook the confidence of the people. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 27th July, published a table detailing the Australian banking aggregates. It showed that the issue of Commonwealth notes increased from £33,464,328 at the 30th June, 1930, to £46,795,724 at the 31st March, 1931, and to £51,160,531 at the 30th June, 1931. This serious increase in the note issue was necessaryin order to meet the needs of the Commonwealth and State Governments. Although we have not yet reached the statutory limit of our note issue, we are coming dangerously near it. This is revealed by figures published in to-day's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> which indicate that our note issue has been increased by another £500,000, and our gold holdings have been largely reduced. It is the duty of honorable members to do everything in their power to prevent a continuation of this financial drift, and that is one of the objects of the amendment. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> said that if the Government introduced another fiduciary notes bill the Country party would regard it as a breach of faith; but if we reach the statutory limit of our note issue it will be' extremely difficult to prevent the issuing of more notes. If this amendment is agreed to, it will make it extremely difficult for the Government to give effect to any inflationary ideas that it may still desire to put into operation. The only way in which Parliament can prevent the continuance of the drift in Commonwealth finance is by retaining some control over appropriation. It was not until we were approaching the end of the financial year that the Government, realizing that it would need Supply, began to consider the plan proposed by certain State Premiers. The Government then dropped for a time its Fiduciary Notes Bill, and entered into negotiation with the State Premiers,and eventually adopted what is now known as the Melbourne Agreement. The right honorable the Prime Minister said that if Parliament keeps control over appropriation it will place such a stigma upon the Government that the approaching Conversion Loan it not likely to be the success which we all hope it will be. The right honorable gentleman knows perfectly well that if the course proposed by the Opposition is adopted, the public will have much more confidence, as the Parliament will still retain control over appropriation. The Government, which is being supported by some of our occasional friends, would be able to act as it desired, and may destroy the public confidence, which is so essential to financial stability. The credit of the Commonwealth, which has been seriously affected by the actions of One government, depends now upon the course to be followed by the States and the Commonwealth. If the right course is followed our position will be assured. I believe that the Conversion Loan will be a complete success, because the people of Australia, realizing that Parliament is exercising its proper authority, will convert their holdings. I emphatically deny that behind this amendment there is the slightest attempt to evade the reduction of interest. </para>

                        <para>- I have never declared myself in favour of a compulsory pooling system ; every one knows whereI statid on that subject. The reduction of interest is largely a matter for the State Parliaments. If the banks do not reduce interest in accordance with the undertakings they have given, the State Parliaments have sufficient power to deal with them effectively. The bill introduced by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> earlier in the session, provided only for the reduction of interest on new holdings. I have not the slightest doubt that if the banks do not act fairly in this matter, the State Parliaments will take action to secure the interests of those whom it is their responsibility to protect. But if this Parliament does not retain control over the spending power of the Executive, the difficulties will become greater than they are to-day. If the Country party assists the Government in defeating this amendmend, I trust that the representatives of the States in another place will insist upon Parliamentary control over the finances in order to ensure the stability of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - Owing to the extraordinary action taken by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> I feel impelled to speak to this amendment, though I have no desire to delay the committee, particularly in view of the fact that we have gone through an all-night sitting, and that a great deal of business still remains to be done. A lengthy discussion on the amendment means that honorable members who have to travel long distances in order to reach their constituencies will be considerably inconvenienced. No one can deny that the Leader of the Opposition has adopted what is a most extraordinary attitude at this particular juncture. He was a party to the agreement formulated at the Melbourne conference; he knows that the success of the Conversion Loan means a saving of £6,500,000 in the internal Government interest burdens of the taxpayers of Australia, and that the adoption of that plan and the reduction of interest rates by the private banks means the saving of millions of pounds to homepurchasers and men on the land. If the policy of the Leader of the Opposition is followed in another place a general election must follow. This would mean delaying for a considerable time the proposals now in hand, as a new government would not be bound by the decisions of the Melbourne Conference, and in any case could not function promptly on a matter of this nature immediately after a general election. In a leading article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of yesterday, which is read so extensively by honorable members opposite, the following paragraph appears: - </para>

                        <para>- What I have read is a complete statement, and if further confirmation is requiredI refer the honorable member to an article which appears in the same newspaper, written by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> who emphasizes the fact that the Opposition is pledged, so far as its leaders can pledge it, to support the Government in bringing the Melbourne plan into operation. Yet, at the most vital moment this act of treachery is taken by the Leader of the Opposition and those who oppose the Government. These are the gentlemen who will be responsible for vitally affecting the interests of business men, home purchasers, persons with overdrafts at the bank, landholders and the 400,000 unemployed in Australia to-day who are looking to this plan to relieve them from the unfortunate position in which they are placed by the general depression. I cannot understand the point of viewof the Leader of the Opposition, who is allowing himself to be led this way at a time when his name of "Honest Joe", if it stands for anything, should stand for honouring his undertakings in connexion with the Melbourne Conference decisions. He cannot possibly reconcile his past actions with the amendment he has moved. I say emphatically that if honorable members search the history of this Parliament they will not find an instance in which similar action has been taken in connexion with the appropriation resolutions. The Leader of the Opposition is attempting to defeat this party whose co-operation in this plan he sought and which he expressed a desire to assist.  His  attendance at the Melbourne Conference, his agreement with what was decided on, and his assistance in passing the measures based on the Melbourne plan, surely indicate that he wishes it to reach fruition. The recent statements of Victorian representatives of the great financial institutions in this country have indicated that the interest reduction proposals embodied in the plan are a bitter pill for them. It is well that the people of Australia should realize the position. Personally, I would not be affected by the breaking down of this plan, so far as it proposes the reduction of interest, but there are thousands of persons to whom a reduction in interest is of vital importance. Honorable members opposite have emphasized from time to time that a restoration of confidence and the creation of an atmosphere of security is necessary. A new government would not be pledged to the Melbourne plan. </para>

His  leader said that the members of this party should search their consciences in this matter. I ask them if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> should not also search his conscience. He is a party to the agreement, but by his present actions he is striking a more severe blow at the workers of New South Wales than could possibly be struck by any one here. He has been forced to realize, as this Government realized long ago, that neither the Commonwealth nor any individual State can stand out and carry on. </para>

                        <para>- I deny that absolutely. I can supply the honorable member with information, so far as the events leading up to the closing of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales is concerned. I do not exculpate Messrs. Bavin and Stevens from the charge of having commenced a run on that bank. That run, however, was not sustained, and confidence in the bank was restored; but a fresh run commenced immediately following the announcement by the Premier of New South Wales that he would not pay overseas interest. I say emphatically that he did that without consulting his Ministry or his party, and must accept the responsibility. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> concluded his remarks by saying, " A plague o'both your houses ", showing that he and his colleagues intend to " sit on the rail ". That attitude is all very well for people who have no responsibility and who will not accept any. But this Government is charged with the responsibility of carrying on the affairs of the Commonwealth, and to do that it is necessary to make arrangements in this Parliament for the meeting of statutory payments on the due dates, otherwise the country would he discredited. Under the financial agreement, for which we were not responsible, we have to assume responsibility for debts that have not been paid by the States. This Government, in its relations with the Commonwealth Bank, occupies the same position as any private individual, and in the face of reduced revenues it has had to cut its suit according to its cloth. It is ridiculous for honorable members who sit in the corner to say that the Government has gone on bended knees to the financial institutions, that it has sacrificed its principles, and that it has betrayed Labour, because it has been obliged to agree to terms that have been forced upon it by circumstances over which it has had no control. I ask those honorable members, where is the logic of their attitude in condemning us for doing what their champion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> is also doing to-day? I have no doubt that this action is just as distasteful to the Premier of New South Wales as it was to members of this party. But why should we be condemned and he be lauded as the champion of the people for doing exactly the same thing? That is the most illogical and ridiculous position that one could possibly imagine. What could be more farcical than the expulsion from the New South Wales State Labour party last week of eighteen men for not supporting the Lang plan, by a body that immediately afterwards carried a resolution directing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> to abandon that plan and to adopt the plan of the Premiers Conference? It is easy to imagine where this country would find itself in a very short space of time if we acknowledged rule of that description. To deal properly with the problems of Australia, the Commonwealth Government should be untrammelled and the States should be wiped out at the earliest possible moment. To-day the Commonwealth has to assume responsibility for expenditure in which it has no direct voice. Any State to-day can carry on a wild orgy of spending. It need not make provision for its overseas interest payments, which thus automatically become the responsibility of the Commonwealth. The task of this Government has been made heavier because of the defaulting tactics of the Premier of New South Wales. We have had to shoulder the responsibilities of that State because, under the financial agreement, we have been tied up with the States, over whose policy we have no direct control. A considerable portion of the debt that we are carrying to-day was built up during a period in which there was semi-political control of the Commonwealth Bank. That semi-political control enabled <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> as Treasurers in the Hughes </para>

                <para class="block">Government, and later <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, to finance on wrong lines. They were enabled to build up huge debts both in Australia and overseas. Then the prices of our primary products overseas fell substantially, and this Government found itself shouldered with a tremendous responsibility and faced with reduced revenues. We had not that semi-political control that would have enabled us to extend credits and thus ease the burden upon the shoulders of our people, consequently, we have had to meet our commitments from current revenue obtained by means of very heavy taxation. I regret that during the fourteen years of Nationalist misrule in this country, when there were bounding revenues and when the highest prices ever paid were received for our wool and wheat, adequate steps were not taken by means of taxation, the tariff and the control of exchange, to effect a reduction of our external and internal debt. This Government is endeavouring to-day to clean up the mess that was left to it by its predecessors. The fact that it has been prepared to co-operate with the States in an endeavour to obtain a solution of the difficulties confronting Australia, should prove to those honorable members who have a mind of their own that at least it is entitled to be given a fair run in the working out of the problems before it. I trust that the attitude of honorable members in this chamber will be reflected in another place - which, I believe, at the instigation of financial interests, is trying to embarrass and to destroy the Government, thus causing a breakdown of the plan, to which thousands of our people are looking as the agency through which relief may be afforded from the depression in which we find ourselves. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with  that  remark. This tax was introduced by the Government when I was a member of it. and I have no excuse to offer on  that  score. It was imposed reluctantly by the Government, and I was particularly loth to support it, because I have long recognized that heavy taxation confers no real benefit upon the community, but rather hampers trade and industry, and checks prosperity. Industry already has to carry heavy income tax, land tax, and the unemployment' taxes imposed by the various State parliaments, and however irksome these taxes may be, none is so burdensome as the sales tax. From its inception, it has created difficulties, and has operated in a vexatious way, because of the lack of understanding of it on the part of the Government and the people. The measure was rushed through, in the first instance, and it caused misunderstanding throughout the length and breadth of the country. From the day it was imposed, rulings had to be issued by the Commissioner of Taxation on the many points that were raised, which were not anticipated before the introduction of this legislation. As the budget figures show, the amount of revenue yielded by the tax is not so great as was expected. Generally, the tax has proved most unsatisfactory, but I recognize that it is inevitable that we should not only continue to impose it, but should increase the rate from  2½  per cent. to  6  per cent. That alone is sufficient to indicate the unfortunate financial position of Australia. I had hoped, from the beginning, that the time might soon come when the whole matter could be reconsidered, and the taxpayers relieved of this additional burden, but that hope is not likely to be realized for a considerable time. All that we can do is to endeavour to make its incidence as equitable as possible. Representations have come from various sections, particularly traders,  as  to the effect of the tax, and one hopes  that  full consideration has been given to them by the Government. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> and also the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> have declared that an undue increase in the number of exemptions will mean a reduction of revenue, and render necessary an increase in the rate. We should also consider the probable effect of this further taxation upon industry, and unemployment. Every section of the community has been asked to make some sacrifice, but I suggest that it would be extremely unwise to add to the burden already resting upon our primary producers. The expert committee of Under.Treasurers, appointed by the Loan Council to report upon the possibility of restoring budget equilibrium, made a number of recommendations, and added this special comment with reference to the sales tax and primage duty - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Prime Minister has been urged to give some relief to our .primary producers in these taxation measures, and a special plea has been made for exemptions in connexion with the jam and fruit canning industries, which are suffering severely from the present depression. Every investigation that has been made into taxation methods has pointed to the need to encourage the expansion of our primary industries, which will be severely handicapped by the imposition of extra primage and higher sales tax. Figures which have been prepared by those associated with these industries show that while fruit and sugar separately were exempt under the old rate of tax, the sugar content of jam and canned fruit, as well as the fruit content, were both subject to taxation, and in the case of jam the tax was greater than the actual amount paid to the primary producer for the fruit contained in the tin. Other products, including butter and condensed milk, which come into competition with jams and canned fruit, are exempt from the sales tax. Another primary industry, of major importance is mining. It has been established that costs in this industry must be reduced if it is to sur- vive overseas competition. To this end strong representations have been made that mining machinery shall be exempt. I trust that serious consideration will be given to this request so that steps may be taken to further expand the industry, and widen the area of employment. </para>
                    <para>In considering the effect of these taxes upon industry generally, we are, I think, inclined sometimes to overlook the actual burden represented by certain definite rates. For example, the sales tax of <inline font-style="italic">2\</inline> per cent, under the present act is paid on the total of value for duty, including the 10 per cent, statutory addition, plus the duty paid and primage 4 per cent., plus 20 per cent, of such total, and represents 3.41 per cent, on free goods. An average has been taken out over a representative range of merchandise landed in Australia during the past six months, and it has been found that the average sales tax payments amounted to 5.02 per cent. The proposed sales tax increase from <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> to 6 per cent, actually means that free goods will be subjected to a sales tax of 8.71 per cent. There are very few items now free of duty. All cotton goods being subject to 5 per cent, duty would incur a sales tax duty of 9.11 per cent. Every additional 5 per cent, duty paid would mean .40 of 1 per cent, added to the sales tax. The following table shows how the sales tax at the new rate of 6 per cent, operates upon the cost of certain imported goods after giving effect to the provisions which require certain additions to be made to the invoice value of goods for duty purposes: - </para>

                    <para class="block">This table shows that £4 8s. primage and £6 16s. lOd. sales tax, or a total of £11 4s. 10d., is paid on £100 worth of apparel imported, under the existing rates of primage and sales tax. Under the 6 per cent, sales tax and 10 per cent, primage proposal, the payments would be £16 18s. Id. in sales tax and £11. in primage, or a total of £27 18s. Id. These figures are, to say the least, staggering. </para>
                    <para>Dealing now with goods generally, the rate of duty of 5 per cent., and sales tax of 6 per cent, on invoice value, mean an -actual tax of 11 per cent, on every £100 worth of goods. Because of the present difficult financial position, we are now obliged to adopt taxation schemes which, in ordinary circumstances, would not be entertained by any government. We should, however, remember that the purpose of the plan is to re-establish confidence among all sections of the people so as to ensure a release of credit for investment in industry, and the employment of our people. If the taxes imposed are of such a character as to be a burden upon industry, we shall not attain our objective. Although I do not see how it is possible to avoid this further taxation at the present time, I consider that the Government might have given more consideration to the probable effect of these increased rates upon industry generally. The estimates of revenue from the original sales tax were not realized. This was due partly to the depression, and partly because of the adverse effect of the tax upon industry. The rates are now being substantially increased. I am afraid that the higher taxes will re-act unfavorably upon industry, and that the revenue will fall short of the estimate. In the past the Government has frequently been compelled to revise its Estimates in order to achieve the financial equilibrium which it sought. Having had some experience of the officers in the department who are dealing with this matter, and having no doubt as to their ability, I realize that it is idle for me to pit my estimate of the revenue likely to be secured against theirs, but notwithstanding their knowledge of the situation, and the facts at their disposal, the present circumstances of the country have made it difficult for them to give an accurate forecast of the revenue likely to be derived from this source. I fear that from this tax we shall not get the revenue anticipated. In that case we shall have to come "back to Parliament for a revision of this taxation. For the burden of taxation on industry will become so great that it will have a reactionary effect upon the revenue of the country. I had hoped that we could reach the stage at which we could do away with the sales tax altogether, but the object of this tax is to spread the burden, so that every section of the community will pay week by week throughout the year according to its ability to  do so. With the exemptions proposed we are possibly getting as near as we can to equity in that regard. </para>
                    <para>According to the Prime Minister, the Government has already given very serious consideration to the representations made by various industries ; but even now, if a sufficiently good case is made out, I hope that it will not be refused consideration. I hope the Prime Minister will not refuse to listen to suggestions made in committee. We must accept the bill, but I hope that the Government will not ask us to accept it in all its detail. </para>

                        <para>.- This bill means an addition of  6  per cent, to the cost of living, and with the basic wage about £3 a week many people will find it difficult to live. If the revenue derived would be the means of providing additional employment, one could have no complaint against the measure; but an increase in the sales tax will not bring about that result. It is probable that no industry in Australia has provided more employment than has the mining industry. To-day, however, with explosives, which can be bought for 30s. a case, in America, costing 70s. at Cairns, though the protective duty is not more than 15s. per cent., and with mining machinery which is absolutely necessary for producing gold from low grade ore bodies costing considerably more than it ought to, because of high rates of duty, I am afraid that there will be a decrease of employment in mining enterprises. The man who is willing to prospect a likely piece of country is handicapped at the outset if he has to pay 70s. a case for gelignite, and the mining companies are likewise handicapped by the fact that they have to pay exceedingly high customs duties on machinery which is not obtainable in Australia. Furthermore, the price of the metals they produce is exceedingly low. I am very much afraid that, so far as Queensland is concerned, the industry must practically cease. Construction work in every direction throughout the Commonwealth has come almost to a standstill. Government loan expenditure on works has dropped from many millions of pounds to nothing. What is to become of the workers? Under this bill the purchasing power of their earnings is seriously decreased.  Australia's  position will become worse instead of better. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline></para>

                    <para>Whether the sales tax will produce the £12,000,000 required to provide for unemployment and assistance to necessitous farmers or whether the money will be raised by a loan, I do not know. Up to date we have seen  jio  move in the latter direction. This amount is required to balance the budget, but what has become of the £12,000,000 provided in the plan for the relief of the unemployed and necessitous settlers? </para>
                    <para>In regard to the bill clause 2 proposes to strike out the words "in an amount not less than £25, and not more than £1,000," and to replace them by the words " in such an amount not exceeding £1,000 as the Commissioner considers reasonable." The provision relates to owners of small businesses, and I am anxious to know if the amount to be charged for registration is to be left to the discretion of the Commissioner. It is very difficult for people in small towns to get into touch with government officers, particularly Federal Government officers. When the sales tax of <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> per cent, was first imposed » great irritation was caused to small business people, because they could get no information regarding the tax. I think that persons who are required to register should be informed by circular what is expected of them under the new legislation. </para>
                    <para>It is plain that the Leader of the Opposition is now inclined to run away from what a few weeks ago he claimed to be his own baby. There is now a lot of back pedalling on the part of many who formerly supported a sales tax. From reports to hand, I am inclined to agree with those who say that the Premiers' plan is doomed, to failure. The Leader of the Opposition hopes that we will not he obliged to come back to this House and pass legislation in order to secure further revenue. I can understand the anxiety on the honorable member's part, because he has a very unpleasant recollection of the last occasion, when he had to come back to Parliament. It was when he and the honorable member for Maribyrnong began strutting the political stage, putting into operation a portion of this plan. The main thing the honorable  member did not like was his inability to interest the members of his party in it. I recollect the night he left the caucus, with the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> hot-foot at his heels, calling, " Joe, Joe ; don't go." To-day the Leader of the Opposition declares that he cannot accept the word of the Government in connexion with this legislation, but, just before the close of last year, he was himself making strenuous efforts to put a portion of it into effect. The boys in caucus were too strong for him, and every time they looked like scoring a win over him he acted on the policy that " he who fights and runs away may live to fight another day." </para>

                        <para>.- The object of this bill is to increase the sales "tax by 6 per cent. Everyone agrees that this is a. form of taxation which is passed on, and, therefore, ultimately affects the cost of living. ' The figures quoted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> show that by the time the goods will reach the consumer the taxwill amount to considerably more than 6 per cent., although the people will expect to pay only 6 per cent. It has been suggested that in order to avoid this, a turnover tax at a lower percentage should be charged by means of stamps. But there would be great difficulties in applying such a scheme. It would become most cumbersome in the case of small sales at Id., 1½d.  and 2d., and so on. It would be almost impossible to get stamps to cover these small amounts. </para>

                    <para>If this taxation is to be retained, and that seems unavoidable at present, the earlier in the process of trade in which it is put on, the better it will be for the Government from a collecting point of view, and for the taxpayer from the paying point of view. We have had twelve months' experience of the working of this tax, and it has been shown to be so easy to collect that I doubt whether any government will ever abandon it, It is much more easily collected than income taxation, because books have to be kept in such a way that they can be easily checked by a checker. The person who pays the tax compiles his own return, makes his own assessment, and pays the cheque. The percentage eaten up in collection must, therefore, be very much smaller than the percentage eaten up in the collection of income taxation. </para>
                    <para>One of the greatest inconveniences of this taxation is caused by the provisions of the regulations and rulings with relation to the quoting of certificate numbers. It may be that a person telephones a manufacturer or wholesaler and  quotes  his certificate number in ordering goods, if he is the holder of a certificate under the Sales Tax Act. Certain regulations apply to him in this connexion, but the onus is always on the seller to determine whether the person who quotes a certificate number is acting correctly. ' When a person quotes his certificate number, he is not charged the sales tax. There are cases, of course, where the registered buyer may be forced under the act not to quote his certificate number, but in most cases he is not prevented from doing so; yet the onus is always on the seller. Taxation specialists have suggested a good way out of the difficulties created in this connexion, although for some reason the Taxation Commissioner has hitherto shown no intention of adopting it, notwithstanding that the adoption of' it would probably mean a saving of several pounds a week in some businesses. I know of business men who are involved in extra expenditure of £7 or £8 per week in bookkeeping through the imposition of this taxation. The suggestion of the taxation specialists is that the registered person shall be required invariably to quote his certificate for all his purchases, whether for material to sell again or for expense purchases. If this were done, many difficulties could be avoided, for the commissioner could keep a list of registered . persons, and make it available to the general public. The result would be that in the course of. time the manufacturer would know who were registered persons, and who were not. If he did not know, he could easily find out. It is suggested that under this scheme the first seller or manufacturer should not bc charged sales taxation, but that the registered buyer would be liable to pay it on all the materials used in his business, whether for re-sale, maintenance, or otherwise. </para>

                            <para>- No; the idea is that he should pay on nothing that he buys, hut on everything that he sells. He could later re-charge the taxation to his customers. Taxation paid on his ordinary materials for use on the production or selling side of his business, and taxation imposed in respect of overhead, could be shown in special columns in his books, and could, ultimately, be included in his sale price to the retailers. If this system were put into operation a great deal of bookkeeping could be eliminated. I do not know why the Taxation Commissioner has not seen fit to adopt this proposal, which was first made to him nearly a year ago. It is certainly necessary that some method should be devised of reducing the bookkeeping involved in the imposition of this taxation. There would bo no danger of the Government losing anything ; in fact it would be much more likely to get more than it is getting under the present arrangement. </para>

                    <para>I \/ish now to make a few observations in regard to the regulations and rulings which have caused a good deal of opposition to this method of taxation. At present there is no appeal against a regulation or ruling provided that it clearly comes within the purview of the act. In my opinion provision should be made for affected persons to be supplied with more detail in this connexion. The department should, as soon as possible, issue an indexed booklet of all the rulings to date. </para>
                    <para>I also consider that provision should be made for the exemption from this taxation of certain transactions which are sales in a legal sense, but not sales in the sense that the layman understands the term. For instance, a man may own certain assets in a business, and he may desire to convert the business into a company. He may convert £5,000 worth of assets which he holds as an individual into 5,000 shares in a company, and he may be the company. There is actually no sale in the ordinary sense, although there is a transfer of assets from private ownership to company ownership. Such a transaction is liable to sales taxation, and, in my opinion, it should be exempt from it. If this point can be covered by regulation, I hope that the Government will issue a regulation in regard to it; but if an amendment of the act is necessary to meet it, I trust that the Government will introduce such an. amendment. Transactions such as I have described are not sales in the ordinary sense of the word. </para>
                    <para>I am glad that the Government is making provision for the amount of sales taxation in respect to all transactions affected by this legislation to be shown in the invoice covering the transaction. That is a highly desirable amendment. Hitherto, it has been a common practice for this taxation, to be included in the cost of the goods. The result of this has been that the buyer has frequently not known for certain whether ho has paid taxation at 2£ per cent, or at some higher percentage. In Queensland the buyer is protected by a State Act which insists on what  the  present bill now demands. If the amount of taxation is shown clearly at the foot of each invoice, buyers will be much more satisfied.  Under  the existing "conditions, big buyers have been able to take advantage of sellers, for they have been able to disregard any amounts specified for sales taxation because competition has become so keen. Small men cannot, of course, hold the manufacturers up in this way. Under the existing conditions there is no doubt whatever that a larger amount is often included for sales taxation than is justified. </para>
                    <para>I am afraid that the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White1)</inline> was misled to some extent by a reply given to him in all good faith by the Prime Minister respecting the application of sales taxation to old contracts. Thu right honorable gentleman said, I believe, that old contracts were exempt from the new taxation, but would continue to be liable to taxation at the rate of <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that that is so. I think there is some misunderstanding. There is a further desirable proposal to reduce the security below £25. In many country towns there are bakers, soft drink manufacturers, and others who have been compelled to make fixed deposits for £25 with the bank as a security against the payment of the tax, when in many cases the total amount of sales taxation for the year would not amount to more than £6 or £7. I consider it desirable to dispense with the limitation of £25, with a maximum amounting to £1,000.' I heard the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> say that there are many persons in the business who are unaware of their liability to pay the sales tax. I am sure that there are many blacksmiths, soft drink manufacturers, and bakers in small country towns who, until they receive an intimation from the department, do not know that they are liable. I also know of persons who did not know that they were liable until a prosecution was lodged. To-day, there are many people who do not know that they are liable. There is another provision to which I wish to refer. Tho Income Tax Commissioner does not allow the amount paid in sales tax as a deduction from income, as he contends that the amount of tax can be added to the price of the goods. That may sound all right. If a tax of £6 is imposed on £100 worth of goods, the selling price would be £10C. A seller, in compiling his income tax return, would not show the value of the sale as £106 only, but as £106, less £6, leaving the net amount of the sale at £100. There may be a number of cases where, owing to special circumstances, such as keen trade competition, the seller is actually carrying a certain amount of the taxation. For instance, instead of charging £106, he may charge £103. In that case, the Commissioner of Taxation would say that he was only to deduct £3, thus making the sale price of his goods £100, with the result that £3 is being paid by the unfortunate seller, who is not allowed to make that deduction. That is entirely wrong. In selling £100 worth of goods, a person may have sold them for £103 to include, say, half the tax, but what would really happen would be that he had sold them for £97 with the whole tax, £6, included, making £103 in all. </para>

                            <para>- No. I have a letter from the Commissioner of Taxation to the effect that the seller is not allowed to do that. If a seller is wise, he will say that he can show anything in writing. There is power to compel a seller to produce particulars in writing before a deduction is allowable. A person carrying a certain amount of taxation has to reduce the price of his goods by the amount of that tax. Supposing a person sells £100- worth of goods and carries the whole of the sales tax, he has to pay income taxation on the full amount as he is not allowed to deduct the tax. But in reality he has reduced the price, of the goods and sold them for £94 and charged a tax of £6 to make up the total. The ruling given on this should be amended. It cannot be denied that the price of goods has been reduced by the amount of the tax, which the seller is carrying. A person can, in certain circumstances, appeal with respect to the value placed upon goods; but that is the only instance in which he has the right of appeal. I contend that under this measure taxpayers should have the same right of appeal as they have under our Income Tax Act. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that it is. I should not be surprised if in  a  few months' time the Government finds that its revenue is insufficient, and then the rate may be increased to 8 per cent. The action of the Government consists of draining the national reservoir without making the slightest attempt to replenish it. This measure will have a most depressing effect on trade in this country, and further prevent a rehabilitation of economic and financial security. Apart altogether from that aspect of the question, the measure is wrong in principle, and is contrary to the main canon of taxation, that taxation should be imposed only upon those who are best able to bear it. This tax will have to be paid principally by the poorer section of the community, for whom the Government does not appear to have any regard. The introduction of this measure is due, not to our financial position, but to absolute dictation by the. banks.. Economically the measure is unsound, and although the Leader of the Opposition said it was  a  measure for consideration in committee, I do not believe that it is. likely to be amended. If pressure is relieved in one direction, it will be increased in another, and instead of this bill providing a means to assist in establishing budgetary equilibrium, it will result in budgetary depression. I realize that those honorable members who excuse their action in supporting the measure will eventually admit their mistake. The financial proposals introduced by the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> when Acting Treasurer, were found to be totally inadequate, and this measure is now brought into operation in an attempt to relieve the position. A drug addict cannot be cured' of his evil habits by taking more of his drug, nor can a drunkard become temperate by increasing the quantity of intoxicating liquor he consumes. Our position cannot improve by increas ing an obnoxious tax. For the reasons I have indicated, I intend to oppose the second reading of the bill. </para>

                    <para>My. WHITE.- That is not  so,  as. I shall show the right honorable gentleman. The bill provides that pastry isexempt, but cake is not. The principal act has been amended to exempt certain kinds of biscuits, but scones, crumpets and buns and other such articles of food, which are used by the poorer sections of the community, including working girls, are taxed. It has been stated by pastry-cooks that it is impracticable to add a fraction of a penny to the price of the commodities they are selling. In this connexion, I will read the following letter from the Caterers' Association of Victoria:- </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Pastrycooks manufacture scones, buns, crumpets and small fancy pastries, and the Commissioner has ruled that these are taxable. These goods are sold retail by the manufacturers in their shops, and90 per cent. of the sales do not exceed an amount of 9d. In fact, the people who buy scones, buns, crumpets and small pastries buy in sixpennyworth and threepennyworth. There is no possible hope of the pastrycook passing the 6 per cent. sales tax on to the purchaser of these goods, because there is no coin of the realm small enough to charge them with. Six per cent. sales tax on sixpennyworth of scones or buns would amount to·36 of a penny, and it cannot be passed on. These goods generally make up the lunch of thousands of school children and many workers. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That answers the Prime Minister's interjection that basic foods are not taxed. The cost of living must increase correspondingly, and the poorer people will thus be penalized. It is rather a ludicrous anomaly that a ham sandwich is taxable, but if the ham is put on one plate and the bread on another neither is taxed. This is the most irritating legislation that has ever been inflicted on a suffering public, and now that it is under review, its application should be entirely altered. In. spite of the difficulty that has been mentioned by the honorable member for Maranoa, the application of the stamp tax to the last retail sale definitely could be brought about.This has been done in continental countries, and if it were done here, a good deal of accounting and book-keeping would be saved. Thetax was a considerable impost evenat 2½ per cent., but the increase to 6 per cent. represents a raising of it by 140 per cent. Many protests have been made regarding the reductions that have been made in salaries and in other directions, but what of the burden that has to be carried by the business world, which already is severely hampered, and many of the members of which are faced with insolvency? A stamp tax, if instituted, would remove many of the existing difficulties. I repeat that this taxation was not unanimously agreed upon as part of the plan. On the contrary, twoundertreasurers definitely protested against any increase in the sales tax and the primage duty. Therefore, we should be perfectly justified, even though we support the plan generally, if we opposed this increase in the sales tax, because it will definitely result in raising the cost of living of persons whose earning capacity has been reduced. Although the trading community suffer from, and find it very difficult to pay the tax, they are prepared to accept it. All that they ask is that it be made as simple as possible in its application. </para>
                    <para>Some months  ago  I asked the Treasurer whether he would request the department to issue a compilation of the rulings in regard to the act. It is an astonishing fact that there is scarcely a person in any business, or even in the department  Who  is able to satisfy inquiries about this tax. The reply of the department is " See the <inline font-style="italic">Argus"</inline> - or some other newspaper - " of such and such a date". It is difficult enough to find the money to pay the tax, without having tosearch old newspaper files to ascertain how the Commissioner has interpreted the regulations. It is high time that a complete compilation of rulings was made, so that no doubt Oruncertainty would re main. As the honorable member for Maranoa has said, many traders have only just discovered that they are liable to thetax and they are experiencing difficulty  in  paying the amount that they owe.  This  bill is a distinct improvement on the measure that was brought down last year. As it proposes a higher rate of tax, it was necessary to insert certain provisions that were then rejected. I am pleased to learn that it is to be made compulsory to show the plussage at the foot of the invoice. Previously that was optional. When the rate was 2½ per cent., many traders were prepared to pay rather than argue concerning it. In future there will be no possibility of hiding it. It is a very fortunate firm which earns 6 per cent. in these difficult times. After all, this is a tax on turnover, not  on  profit. Firms that are struggling along with  big  stocks, of which there are thousands, are anxious to liquidate those stocks even at cost price. The 6 per cent., however, will still have to be paid even if goods are sold at cost pride  of  less. </para>
                    <para>Another alteration that is deemed necessary is that 30 days be allowed for payment. Originally it was intended to make traders pay the tax seven days after the month's transactions were completed, but as the result of a protest by the Opposition the time has. been extended to 21 days. Even that is far from satisfactory. Ordinary business practice, except in chain and cash stores, is on a monthly basis. In the case of some big firms, such as those that deal in oil and sugar, it is cash in 30 days. The usual monthly practice averages approximately 45 days, for if goods are bought on the 1st or the 2nd June, the statement is issued on the 1st July, and need not be paid until the end of that month. Similarly, goods bought on the 30th June would  be  invoiced on the 1st July for payment on the 31st July. In difficult times, such as those through which we are passing at the moment, a firm will give almost any terms in order to obtain business, even to the extent of sending goods on consignment on the basis of settlement within 60 or 90 days. Wholesale houses that have country storekeepers on their books experience the greatest difficulty in collecting their accounts. They may have to carry storekeepers for six months, or even longer. Yet the Government insists upon the payment of the tax on these goods within 21 days. I have received from the Victorian Merchants Association a protest in the following terms : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>We strongly urge that a clause be included whereby this tax would be made payable at the end of the month following delivery of goods.  Our reasons for this are as follows: - In the first place, we do not receive payment from our customers until the end of the month at the earliest, and, in many cases, in the country, wc have to carry the tax on our books for many months. </para>
                        <para>You will readily understand that this amount becomes, in course of time, a very considerable load for us to bear, and is costing us the; bank rate of interest until paid. Under the present trade conditions, you are quite aware that we have an enormous amount of money stationary on our books, and this extra tax is something which we do not think is intended should bc borne by us. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Protests have been received also from the Chamber of Manufactures, the Hardware Association, and practically every other trading body, all of which agree that at least 30 days should be allowed for the payment of the tax. Seeing that the Government is increasing the tax so greatly, it should at least make it fall as lightly as possible on the people who have to pay it. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Maranoa has said that a ruling which was given by the Taxation Department to me as well as to the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn),</inline> is wrong. I asked the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore),</inline> and later the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> whether contracts for sales that were definitely entered into prior to the 11th July - the date on which the increase was enforced - would hold good at the old rate. The reply of the local branch of the department was in the affirmative, provided that the order had definitely been written, and the goods were in existence. If the department is going back on that ruling, a serious situation will confront a number of firms 'who have been informed that it would hold good. I hope that the Prime Minister will clear this matter up in committee. </para>
                    <para>Another matter that will require adjustment concerns builders. I have received from the Builders Exchange in Melbourne a telegram asking that some provision" be made for builders to pay for their supplies at the old rate in cases where they were engaged on contracts prior to the increase coming into force. That is only fair. If they can pay at the old rate on houses that they are building, the subcontractors and the merchants who supply the materials also should be allowed to do so. Otherwise, the additional 3£ per cent, may more than offset the profit likely to - be made. </para>
                    <para>Newspapers, which generally are the property of big companies, are not to be taxed; but periodicals, which, in many cases, are run by small publishing houses and printers, will be liable for not only the additional sales tax, but also the higher primage rate, because the paper that they use is different from that used by newspapers. This matter, I suggest, might well be cleared up. </para>
                    <para>As the Prime Minister has stated, this is essentially a committee bill. I hope that it will be made as easy as  Possible  in its machinery provisions, so that the business community, which already is harassed by taxation and regulations, will feel it as little as possible. </para>

                        <para>.- Of all the taxation measures that have been introduced in this Parliament, none have been brought forward in such a way as this, nor have they been so mischievous in their effects upon the tradespeople and other sections of the community. It will be remembered that when this tax was originally brought in it was specially stated that it would be imposed at the source, first upon the manufacturer, and then on the importer, on the one sale. But after it had been working for a while, although the promise was made that it would be policed, timber merchants and others openly added the tax to their accounts. In Sydney, some small millinery businesses work up hats for individual customers. They purchase the material from the importers, not at the lower rate given to an ordinary manufacturer, but at the higher rate. Those who made up an average of two or three hats a week were subjected to this taxation. </para>

                    <para>Fresh meat is not liable to this tax, but when placed 'between slices of bread, and sold to shop and office girls for midday lunches meat is taxable. The application of the act has not only been irritating, but has forced a, number of small people out of business. I do not think k is right that, in giving effect to any plan, we should carry on as we are doing under this particular legislation. We have reduced wages, and thus lessened the purchasing power of the people; yet, under this measure we shall increase the prices that they, will have to pay for the articles of food and clothing that they require. The Government should have policed this legislation,' as originally promised, and should have prevented the tax from being passed on to the poorer classes of the community. I hope that the sales of sandwiches for midday lunches will be exempt from the tax. The employees of large firms now club together and purchase their sandwiches in large quantities. It was never contemplated that a tax of this nature should be part of the rehabilitation plan. </para>

                        <para>. - When this measure was introduced last year, I think we all anticipated that, with its complications and anomalies, it would prove a veritable nightmare to ordinary business people, and it has certainly proved so to most honorable members. I wonder how those who have been responsible for the administration of this legislation have managed to survive the last twelve months. The increase in the tax from 2-J per cent, to 6 per cent., which we" are now considering, is naturally causing the business community a great deal of anxiety, and, notwithstanding the statement of the Prime Minister^ <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> that food prices will not be affected in any way by this increase, I fail to see how it can do other than increase the cost of living and of production. Therefore, it must delay the financial and economic recovery of the nation. I have previously contended that the most feasible and businesslike method of bridging the gulf between receipts and expenditure, after the economies that have been agreed upon have been given effect, would be by lifting the tariff embargoes placed upon the importation of certain articles. This could he done without putting one man out of employment, or inflicting hardship upon a single manufacturer. Last year I submitted an amendment in a sincere effort to do away with an anomaly which the Brisbane Merchants Association had pointed out to me was created under the present sales tax legislation, in arriving at the basis of the value, for the purpose of tax, of goods imported by a retailer, and similar goods imported by a wholesale merchant. The amendment that I then submitted was supported by the then Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> and other honorable members, and on the Prime Minister giving me an assurance that this anomaly, which the Commissioner of Taxation admitted, would be removed, if possible, in another place, I withdrew my amendment. But the anomaly was not removed, and I would like the Prime Minister to take some steps to deal with the matter even at this stage. I have received the following communication from the Brisbane Merchants Association, dated 6th July last: - </para>

                            Sales Tax. - You will recall that last year, when the above bill was before the House, you were good enough to take up the matter of the anomaly which exists in arriving at the basis of value for sales tax on goods imported by a retailer and similar goods imported by a wholesale merchant, and, as an amending act is shortly to be introduced, we are asking your kind assistance in dealing with the above matter. We are enclosing for your information a concrete case furnished by one of our members which shows that the -wholesale merchant has to pay in sales tax 38.4 per cent, more than the retailer on exactly the same item. This, of course, is not only an injustice to the merchant, but, as he passes the tax on, is a still greater injustice to the small retailer, who has to compete with the larger retail houses. No remedy which would involve merchants in having stocks in their warehouses, some of which had paid sales tax on importation and some upon which sales tax has to be paid when sold, would be practicable. An amendment which is suggested in the attached memorandum, namely, that the basis upon which the retail importer pays sales tax should include every cost of importation, as well as a percentage for profit, seems the only practicable and satisfactory one.

                        <para>The only amendment which occurs to us as at all practicable is that importers who pay their sales tax through the customs should be required to pay same on invoice value plus freight, f .o.b. charges, marine Insurance, buying commission, bank exchange and landing charges in Australia, plus duty and primage, and with an addition of 20 per cent, over all for profit . . . </para>
                        <para>It may be pointed out that since the matter was debated in the House lust year, the anomaly mentioned has been made more serious by the fact that bank exchange, which is not included in the value upon which the importer pays, but is in the value upon which the wholesale merchant pays,' has increased by more than 25 per cent. </para>

                    <para class="block">I hesitate to move an amendment to the measures before the House, because the matter is so complicated that I might urge an alteration which would not be fair and equitable; but I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister will indicate whether anything can be done to remove an admitted anomaly. </para>
                    <para>I desire to refer briefly to a communication which I have received from the university of Sydney and the Queensland university in connexion with the sales tax and the increased primage duty on library matter, as well as upon such materials as scientific apparatus, which these institutions are obliged to import from abroad from time to time. The Prime Minister has pointed out that, if this House insists upon exemptions other than those Which have been agreed to after the fullest consideration, such action will make it necessary to increase the present rate of the sales tax. I cannot help feeling that the Universities have a definite claim to special consideration.  University libraries should at least be placed on the same basis as public libraries,  which are  now exempt from this taxation. I believe that an arrangement has been made between the University Libraries of Sydney and Melbourne and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library whereby books required for the Canberra University College, and books asked for by honorable members, may be procured from those institutions. I cannot see that there would be much loss of revenue if the books of all universities were exempt from the sales tax. I have received innumerable telegrams, urging the exemption of all books, magazines, and periodicals. Various libraries in Queensland, the School Teachers Union, and the School of Arts Association, and the Queensland Booksellers Association, urgently request that, owing to the financial depression, the books that they have to import into Australia should be exempt from the tax. I would like to know what the loss of revenue would .be, if all such books were exempt, so that in the committee stage I may move an amendment to the bill. There" are other matters to which I might refer, but I think they can better be dealt with in committee. I again ask the Prime Minister to see if some action can be taken to remedy the anomaly to which I have directed attention, to exempt all books, magazines and periodicals, and, if possible, place university libraries on the same footing as public libraries, which, as I have shown, are exempt from the operation of these taxes. </para>

                        <para>. -  I have never been in favour of this form of taxation; hut since it has been engrafted upon our taxation system, it is now my duty to see {hat, in its incidence, it does not press too heavily upon any particular section.  At  the committee stage, I intend to submit a number of amendments, which I hope will be accepted by the Prime Minister, who will be in charge of the proposals. When the original sales tax measures were before this House, there was considerable argument about the desirableness or otherwise of entering the sales tax at the foot of the invoices. I endeavoured to persuade the Government to agree to this proposal, but was unsuccessful. It was contended that there might be certain constitutional objections, and, following the Government's decision not to sanction this procedure, a number of wholesale and retail firms introduced altered business systems, under which they were able to include the tax in their price-lists. Now that the Government has decided to insist upon the amount of the tax being added to the invoice, those firms will be obliged to scrap all their price-lists, and attach to the foot of their invoices the amount of tax chargeable. They regard the alteration as unfair, and point out that it will inflict upon them a great deal of business inconvenience and expense. It is contended, further, that it will operate unfairly in the case of a considerable number of small storekeepers in the suburbs of our capital cities, and in country towns, because the majority of these business people sell low-priced articles at fixed retail prices, and it will be impossible for them to recover the tax by charging increased prices for their goods. This will apply particularly to haberdashery, ribbons, confectionery, small grocery lines, household hardware, and chemical goods. It is also argued that those firms which adopted special business systems under which the price-lists included the <inline font-style="italic">2\</inline> per cent, sales tax, will now merely add the additional  6  per cent, to their present prices. These views are being canvassed generally in business circles in connexion with these measures. It is stated that the proposed change will give further protection to manufacturers at the expense of retailers, and that if merchants' profits are further reduced, many may be placed in a difficult position. As the Government insisted on the amount of the sales tax being included in the purchase price, it should now consider the position of those traders who obeyed its instructions. In committee, I propose to submit an amendment, the purpose of which will be to make the procedure optional. I cannot see how any great hardship _will be inflicted on traders generally, and as the Government originally insisted that the tax should not be placed at the foot of the invoice, traders should not now be put to the additional expense of introducing new systems and of revising their price-lists to comply with this later decision of the Government. Another amendment which I propose to submit when the bill is in committee, is to deduct from income tax assessments the amount paid as sales tax. This proposal has been considered by various taxpayers' associations, but as it is a matter for the committee stages of. the bills, I shall not say more about it at present. </para>

                        <para>.- I feel inclined to oppose the whole of these measures unless the Government is prepared to give some relief to coal-miners by exempting explosives. The miners purchase their explosives from the company, which will now add the increased sales tax of  6  per cent, to the price charged. Representations have been made to me by the combined miners' organizations that explosives should be placed on the list of exempted goods. Metalliferous miners are in a more favorable position. Miners, except those working on tribute, are provided with explosives by the company, which does not pass on the tax. In the case of coal-miners, however, the explosives are sold to the employees by the company, and each fortnight the amount of the sales tax, which, at the higher rate will be approximately 8s. $d. a fortnight extra is deducted from the miners' pay. </para>

                            <para>- Coal-miners work in pairs, and each pair of men use about  10  lb. of explosives per day in hard sections of the mine. When I was engaged in mining, not long ago, the cost was1s. a lb., and there has recently been a slight increase of the price, but taking it at1s. a lb., with detonators at 3d. or 4d. each, the powder bill for two men is approximately 14s. a day. Sales tax of 6 per cent. on 14s a day equals10d. The fortnightly pay of two men is thus reduced by 8s. 4d. or 4s. 2d., for each man. That is an additional hardship on men who undeniably have suffered greater hardship than the average citizen of the Commonwealth. Recently, they went through a long, drawn-out struggle. They were locked out. Their only sin, if it were a sin, was a desire to obey an award of the Federal Arbitration Court. Eventually, they were starved into submission, and had to submit to a 12½ per cent. reduction of their earnings. When it was suggested to the Prime Minister that the explosives used by men working in mines on contracts or tributes should be exempted from the payment of sales tax, his reply was that the tax does not amount to more than 5d. a day per man, and is, therefore, only a small matter. It represents, however, the price of a loaf of bread, and it is a penalty which is imposed upon the minersand upon no other class of worker. They cannot deduct from their income tax this sales tax payment because their earnings are from personal exertion. They are called upon to pay sales tax before they receive their earnings. When I approached the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> on the matter, he suggested that it should be brought up in committee, and that, in all probability, provision would be made for the exemption claimed. Although the Prime Minister does not feel disposed to give any consideration to their request, I hope that he will view the matter in a different light when he learns of the additional hardship these miners will be called upon to endure under the provisions of this bill. </para>

It was a sufficiently serious matter when the tax was 2½ per cent., but now that the rate has been increased to 6 per cent., it may have the effect of closing certain branches of certain businesses.

                    <para>. -  I regret that the Government cannot accept the amendment. We have had many applications for exemptions which are far more justifiable than this one. We have been asked to exempt books for libraries and for educational purposes, but if we did so, the revenue would suffer to the extent of £60,000.I have every sympathy with those who wish books to be exempt from sales taxation; but the granting of exemptions must inevitably have the effect of substantially increasing the rate of tax. </para>

                    <para>.- I  trust that the Government will give some consideration to the advisableness of exempting from sales taxation books for educational purposes. We have always prided ourselves upon the fact that education in Australia is free; but in these days the burden involved in the purchase of books which is placed on parents of children who are attending schools, from the primary grade upwards, is extremely heavy. Surely the revenue would not suffer very seriously if educational books were exempt. The parents of children attending our schools are the best citizens that we have, and we should not place any burdens upon them which can be avoided. As one who has had experience as a school teacher, and as a Minister in charge of a State education department, I know that the cost of school books has increased very greatly in recent years. I therefore hope that the Government will give further consideration to my proposal to exempt books for educational purposes. </para>

                <para class="block">Representations have been made to the Government by the Master Builders Association with the object of exempting from the new taxationcontracts entered into before the proposal to increase the sales tax was announced. It was pointed out that unless relief of this kind were granted, many builders would be forced into the Bankruptcy Court. The association submitted alternative proposals to the Government, the first of which provided for a rebate of the extra taxation, which could not be adopted; and the second of which provided for the passing on of the additional imposts. The association will be quite satisfied if the Government accepts the second alternative, and it is prepared to do so. </para>

                <para>In the hope that it may be rectified, I desire to bring under your notice what appears to be an unjustifiable charge made by the reporting branch of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department, for transcript of shorthand notes of proceedings in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The ordinary charge for transcript is 3d. per folio per copy, or1s. per folio for six copies, and a further reduction is made for a larger number of copies when required. Since the passing of the Sales Tax Act last year,2½ per cent. has been added to the accounts rendered by the reporting branch; but as the added impost did not represent a very large amount of money, no particular exception was taken to the charge. Since the introduction of the amending bills, however, the reporting branch has adopted the practice of adding6 per cent. to the ordinary charge presumably to cover the sales tax though not so stated. This is a material advance on the already high cost incurred both by employers and labour unions for transcript of Arbitration Court proceedings. I am not aware that the department will be liable to pay tax under the amending bills, and the charge is, therefore, unwarranted and should be discontinued. . . </para>
                <para class="block">If the Attorney-General's Department does not pay the sales tax it is scarcely justified in increasing charges to the extent mentioned in the letter. </para>

                        <para>- Is it provided by the owners under the Coal Miners Regulation Act, and as its use is imperative it should not be subject to the sales tax if it is desired to assist this industry. When speaking on the second reading, I foreshadowed this amendment, and also directed the attention of the House to the hardships experienced by miners owing to the fact that they have to meet the additional cost, resulting from the imposition of the sales tax on explosives. A pair of miners using 10 lb. of explosives with detonators  have to pay 14s. a day to which 6 per cent. has to be added, which brings the amount up to 14s. 10d., or, in other words, a reduction of10d. a day in their earnings to that extent. At the end of a pay period the return per pair of miners is consequently reduced by 8s. 4d. That is a hardship which should be removed by the Government. Exemptions are provided on firewood, coal, crude and fuel oil for the production of power, which means that the owners of industry who use these products do not have to pay the tax, while the miners whose duty it is to win the coal from the bowels of the earth, have to pay the tax on the explosives they use. Explosives are absolutely essential in the production of coal or other minerals, and should be treated in the same way as fuel used by the owners of industry in the production of other power which is exempted. It is grossly unfair that this Government should exempt commodities used by the owners, and at the same time impose a tax on commodities used by the miners. Wine, which I suppose, is consumed chiefly by the employing class, is also included in the list of exemptions. </para>

                        <para>- The coal-miners who have recently suffered a reduction in wages should receive the same consideration in the matter of the sales tax as the coal-mine proprietors. It may be said that explosives are a big item, as they are used extensively in the mining industry; but other mining operations are not in the same position as the coal-mining industry. With the exception of metalliferous mining on tribute, the men employed in most of the metalliferous mines are paid a daily wage. In such cases the owners purchase the explosives, and consequently pay the tax, while in coal-mining the coal-owner purchases the explosives, and when charging them up to the coalminers, includes the sales tax. The sum of £50,000 has been provided to assist the coal-owners to obtain additional export trade, £25,000 of which has been placed in a trust fund to be allocated at the rate of1s. per ton on the actual quantity of coal exported. The Government's proposal savours of assistance to him that hath, while the poor unfortunate coal-miner who has suffered a reduction in wages, is to be compelled to pay the sales tax. For sixteen months they had to submit to a lock-out, and in addition have had a reduction of 12½ per cent. is their wage. The action of the Government in reducing the salaries of public servants by 20 per cent. will in all probability result in private employers adopting the same attitude. I have no desire to ridicule the idea of assisting the mine-owners by the payment of a bounty of1s. a ton to capture the overseas coal trade as I recognize the export trade in coal requires building up; but it is only reasonable that miners, who have to use power in the shape of explosives to obtain minerals from the earth, should be given this exemption. </para>

The whole field of explosives has to be surveyed. It has been worked out that the cost of the sales tax which is added to the price of explosives used in hewing coal, amounts to about id. a ton. On the honorable member's figures it is more than that, but still is less than½d. a ton. The honorable member figured out that the cost to two men who worked together would be 10d. a day. He estimated that two men would hew with machines approximately 25 tons a day. On the basis of 2s. 6d. a ton, their earnings would be £3 2s. 6d., while on the honorable member's figures, the tax would come to 8s. 4d. </para>

                        <para>- That would bring it down to 2s. 2d. a ton, which would amount to approximately £3 a day. The honorable member went on to say that the cost of the tax in the case of each man would be 4s. 2d. a fortnight, assuming that they worked ten days. On that basis each man would earn £15 a fortnight. There are cases of equal, if not greater, hardship under the sales tax as well as under other taxation. We are not using a  feather duster on the people of this country. We are dealing with a very grave emergency. We have endeavoured to exempt from the tax basic foods that effect the cost of living of the mass of the people, and to a very large extent we have succeeded. ' The exemption of this item would mean a loss of revenue amounting to over £15,000; and if the whole of the exemptions sought were granted, the loss would be well over £750,000 per annum. I am not lacking in sympathy towards the miners, but there are stronger claims that we have had to reject. </para>

                    <para>.- I intend to support the amendment to exempt explosives used in mining. The £15,000 which the Prime Minister says would be lost, is an over-statement. I presume that that figure relates to explosives that are used for every purpose. I consider that the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> has made out an unanswerable case. I could quote figures to show the right honorable gentleman that the treasury could obtain perhaps £200,000 if the timber, coal and fuel that are exempt, were made subject to the tax, although I will not support the sales tax on such items. There is a question of abstract justice that has to be considered, quite apart from the amount of revenue involved. If the Government is working on the assumption that coal, fuel and oil are basic commodities, because they enter primarily into the manufacture of the goods .on which the tax will be levied, I cannot see how those things which are used by the miners could be exempt. The mineowners buy the explosives in the first place. They hold them in secure places, and supply them to the miner, deducting the cost from his wages. A record of the transaction has to be kept. Only a distinguishing mark would be necessary to indicate the explosives that were sold to miners, and that should be exempt from the tax. No difficulty would he experienced in tracing every such transaction. Possibly, only a couple of thousand pounds at the most would be lost if the amendment were agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want to limit it to coal-mining. But there is a difference between explosives that are used in coal-mining, and those that are used in metalliferous mining. When other articles that are used in the production of coal are exempt, it is only reasonable and just that the explosives used by the miner also should be exempt. Miners are obtaining so little work at the present time that a deduction of 6d. from their wages means depriving their wives and children, not of some luxury that they could do without, but actually of something that they should have. Within the last twelve months, coalminers have been getting only two or three days' work a fortnight, and sometimes even less than that. If the industrywere flourishing, and the miners were working ten days a fortnight and drawing from £6 to £10 as the Prime Minister says, I would not worry about this impost. There is not a miner on the south coast who has worked full time since I have been the representative of that district.- That dates back to long before the commencement of the depression. Within the last couple of years, not a miner has averaged four days a fortnight, and some of them have averaged only one day reckoned from the weeks when the mines actually worked. In those circumstances, the loss of even 5d. or 6d. is a real hardship. A couple of shillings a fortnight may not seem much to honorable members, but its loss causes real concern to these men. The Prime Minister ought to meet us in this matter. I feel sure that the loss of the small amount involved would not cause the plan to break down ; but it would be a small concession to men who have had a very hard row to hoe. During the last four years, no man in any industry in the Commonwealth has had such a rough spin as the miner has had. The conditions are becoming worse every week, and it is not fair to impose this extra burden. </para>

                    <para>.- For some considerable time, I have made representations to the Treasurer in regard to the price of explosives in Australia. Last May, I asked a question on the subject, and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> who was acting for the Prime Minister, promised that certain inquiries would be made, and that I would be furnished with a reply.  Up to date that reply has not arrived. In the intervening period, however, I have been in touch with the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> who at the time had charge of labour and industry. That honorable gentleman wrote me a letter saying that he would request <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Gunn to make inquiries respecting the substantial difference that exists between the prices of Australian and American explosives. I believe that Nobels are the only manufacturers of explosives in Australia; yet the price charged for the local explosive is altogether too high compared with that charged for the American. The price of metals is abnormally low, and the mining industry has been at a low ebb since 1920. Yet, it provides employment for a considerable number of men. With the aid of explosives, miners can prospect rich patches in old " shows ". Even with tin, copper, silver and lead at their present prices, a considerable amount of employment is- provided at places like Mount Isa, but an extra 1,500 men will probably be reduced to the dole in Western Queensland, as a result of putting the Government's financial plan into operation. If the mining industry is burdened with additional taxation, as surely as night follows day, disaster will overtake it. A bounty of ls. per ton is given to the coal-owners on export coal, and if £10,000 were deducted from the £50,000 now received by them by way of bounty, the Government would be able to remove the sales tax of 6 per cent, to be imposed on explosives for industries other than coal-mining. I notice that a number of exemptions are provided for under the bill, such as road metal, furnace slag, gravel and sand. </para>

                        <para>- The companies own- . ing the quarries that produce those commodities practically live on the ratepayers; but the miners, under great difficulties are carrying on a valuable producing industry, and they are not able to meet the proposed increased sales tax. If the mining industry received as much encouragement from governments as has been given to the butter and sugar industries, it would soon become equally valuable to the community. Timber, boxes, bibles, cheese, coal, kerosene, cream, crude and fuel oil, crude tar and a hundred and one other articles are on the exempt list. Yet an industry which is at a low ebb is to be called upon to pay an unjust tax of 6 per cent. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment, because it would be unfair to apply the sales tax to explosives required for mining operations. Much of the expense incurred in coalmining in New South Wales is caused by the provisions of the State Mining Act, which requires the owners to provide brattice for the ventilation of the mines. Reference has been made to the quantity of explosives used in mining a ton of coal; but I point out that that cost is but a fraction of the total expenditure incurred by miners. Coal-miners in 95 cases in 100 are contractors. They have to provide their own light, and, in most cases, their own explosives. They must also supply tools, and these articles are subject to the sales tax. We exempt mining timber which the mine-owners are compelled to provide in order to keep their properties safe. Yet the Government is unwilling to exempt one of the commodities used by the contracting miners in the production of the coal. Australian timber used in mining operations is exempt from the sales tax, particularly in coal-mining. In the large  metalliferous mines, Oregon timber is employed. It is easy for the Prime Minister to say that, if the men do not work the mines, they will not have to pay the tax. Explosives are used more extensively today in the big mines than they have been in the past, and the Government should be prepared to exempt this commodity. </para>

                    <para>.- I join the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> in urging that explosives for gold-mining should be placed on the exempted list, because this will be a direct incentive to those who are engaged in the search for gold. The Victorian <inline font-style="italic">Y earBook</inline> for 1930-31 states that the revenue obtained from miners'' rights in Victoria for that year amounted to £2,062, and as miners' rights cost 2s. 6d.' each there were last year in Victoria 16,496 holders of miners? rights searching for gold in the backblocks and among the hills. A plug of gelignite three or four inches long costs, in some country towns, 3d., so if a man is working off gold and uses three or four plugs of gelignite to open up some rock the cost for the gelignite alone is ls., and as a coil of fuse costs ls. 9d., and detonators 12s. 6d. a tin, it will readily be understood that this business of searching for gold in hard ground might easily prove very costly. I hope that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> will give the request further consideration, and agree to place this commodity on the exempted list, at all events as far as the gold-mining industry is concerned. Within twelve months, the Commonwealth Government shipped overseas gold to the value of £27,000,000, and as the average annual yield in Australia is under £2,000,000, that year we sent away thirteen years' gold production estimated on the present average yield. Recently, we exported an, additional £5,000,000 worth, and if two similar shipments of a like amount have to be made in the near future practically the whole of our currency will be on a fiduciary basis. I am not sure that our position then will be any the worse. I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister will give sympathetic consideration to this appeal. </para>

                    <para>.- This request from various members interested in the mining industry is interesting, but not very convincing. If explosives used in, say, the coal-mining industry arc placed on the exempted list, the case for the inclusion of explosives of gold-mining will be strengthened, and the Government might as well lift the tax ofl all explosives for mining purposes, because explosives are largely used by men working in metal quarries, and even by our primary producers for 'the clearing of heavily timbered land. I have every sympathy for the miners. I worked for some considerable time in a mine myself, and I know that the men earn all they get. But I remind the House that the same urgent appeal can be made, and has been made, in respect of other industries, but the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has told us plainly that if our requests were granted the loss of revenue would be too great. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> in his reply this evening, stated that it would be difficult to check the amount of explosives that is used in the mining industry. That remark was not quite correct, because the mine-owner, in his returns for taxation purposes, is expected to show expenditure incurred for explosives used by the company and by contract miners. The right honorable gentleman also urged that if the request were granted the resultant loss of revenue would be too serious. I have suggested that the exemption apply only to contract minei'3 who are compelled to buy their own explosives. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but he hands it on to the consumer - the contract miner. If shift-workers in the employ of the company use explosives then the right honorable gentleman is correct, and the owner does pay the tax. I do not suggest that the Prime Minister has deliberately  imposed this taxation upon the mining industry, but the provision could not have been drafted with greater precision if it had been left to mine-owners themselves. Timber, which is largely used in the mining industry, is on the exempted list, so why should not explosives be treated similarly? But timber is a charge upon the owner of the mine; it has to he paid for by the boss. </para>

                        <para>- We might risk them. The people engaged in this industry have had a very dark and trying experience. The man who hews coal takes enormous risks.  His  life is constantly endangered.Without him coal could not be produced. The suggestions put forward by the honorable member for Hunter to overcome the difficulties mentioned by the Prime Minister justify the granting of this concession. We always understood that King Cole was  a  merry old soul, but for a long time King Coal has been a very sad old soul. The approval of the Prime Minister to this amendment might transform him into the merry old soul King Cole has always supposed to be. If that should happen, I have no doubt he would call for his pipe and other comforts, and for his fiddlers five - the members of this group, who are only too glad to put in a word for him on this occasion. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> in his plea on behalf of the people he represents, and with whom he has worked for many years. No one knows the coal industry better than does the honorable member. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has mentioned that there would be difficulty in administering the concession asked for. The right honorable gentleman is guided by the knowledge of departmental officers, who are, no doubt, efficient in their particular spheres, but cannot be expected to possess &amp; practical knowledge of the application of a concession of this kind upon allindustries likely to be affected. Their very competence in their departmental work connotes a limited practical experience. Any advice that they can give a Minister upon the difficulty of administration of any matter must be purely speculative. Particularly is this so in the case of an absolutely new tax. Plenty of evidence could be adduced to prove that it is almost humanly impossible to police this sales tax, even in its present form, and I claim, therefore, that the Prime Minister has not answered the arguments advanced by the mover of the amendment by raising an objection based on the difficulty of administering it. No difficulty is anticipated in policing the exemption of crude oils and such like lubricant's, and there should likewise he no difficulty in policing the exemption of explosives used by contract miners. In any case, why should the difficulties of administration be raised only in respect to the articles which the honorable member for Hunter is seeking to have exempted? The Prime Minister has said by interjection that assistance for the mining industry by the medium of the concessions given to the owners  means assistance to the workers engaged in the industry. That argument might just as well be applied to the reduction of men's wages. Such a step would very likely assist any industry. We know, however, that the effort of Labour has always been to secure for the worker a greater share in the distribution of the profits made by industry. If we carried the Prime Minister's argument to the fullest extent, all efforts on the part of Labour to improve the lot of people engaged in industry by bettering the conditions or increasing wages would be contrary to the interests of the industry concerned. Such a contention is, of course, ridiculous. Surely some means can be devised for helping this large section of workers! Perhaps the Prime Minister will give his assurance that he will inquire into the administrative difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- The workers in all industries to-day are suffering great hardships, and, no doubt, it is difficult to pick out one section of the community for special commiseration, but we must admit that the section engaged in coal-mining has had a particularly bad time. Their occupation is one in which they suffer risks which do not touch other workers, and any means we can apply towards easing their burden or towards making their wages go as far as possible should be applied. </para>

Binder twine is an essential material which primary producers must use for harvesting their hay and for other purposes. Seeing that kerosene for use in traction engines has been exempted, I think that it is not unreasonable to ask that binder twine shall also be exempt. </para>

The attitude that they adopt irritates me. I would he quite willing to eliminate -sales taxation altogether, but, on account of the inconsistent attitude of some honorable members opposite, they cannot expect much sympathy. Their vote of a few minutes ago shows that they are animated by sectional interests. They were not willing to vote in favour of relieving the men who delve in the depths of the earth of a slight impost, but they expect us to help the farmers every time. </para>

                    <para>That the item " Arrowroot " be inserted. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">When the original sales tax proposals were being dealt with I appealed to the Treasurer to add arrowroot to the list of exemptions, but he said that he was unable to do so at the time. Subsequently I repeated my request to him, and I have on numerous occasions asked that arrowroot should be exempt from this taxation. The Treasurer intimated to me on one occasion that when the sales tax measures were being reconsidered, he would regard favorably my representations in respect to arrowroot. The arrowroot industry is not extensive. I suppose that the total annual value of the production would not be more than £12,000. About 800 persons are engaged in producing arrowroot. The margin of profit in the industry is so small that the imposition of sales taxation at the rate of 6 per cent. would probably render the industry entirely unprofitable. Flour made from wheat is exempt from this taxation, but flour made from arrowroot is not exempt. Arrowroot biscuits are exempt, but the arrowroot from which they are made is not exempt. Arrowroot is a very important food for children, invalids and others. The Prime Minister has pointed out when application has been made for other exemptions that they could not be granted because the loss of revenue would be too great; but that argument is not applicable to arrowroot, for the total production is very small. This industry is carried on only in my electorate, but if it is encouraged it will no doubt extend. In view of the promise that the Treasurer made to me some time ago, I confidently ask the Prime Minister to accept this amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- Some days agothe Government promised that it would furnish honorable members with a list of all the commodities for which exemptions have been asked, and intimate which applications could be accepted. I understood the Prime Minister to say that a list of the appli- cations for exemptions and also a list of the exemptions actually granted would be made available to honorable members. So far as I am aware, that has not been done. </para>

                    <para>.- On the 10th July, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> submitted certain resolutions providing for the imposition of primage duties, under which materials used in the manufacture of spraying preparations are exempt. Apparently, there was some reason for exempting these materials, which are used in production, and if the Prime Minister wishes to be logical, such materials should also be exempt from the sales tax. Bluestone is used, not only in connexion with spraying operations, but for pickling wheat. The original tax, quite apart from the increased rate, increases the price of spraying preparations, and, therefore, must have an important bearing upon the cost of production. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> said just now that he had been busily engaged in adding various items to the list of exemptions; and he gave reasons for their addition. I should like to help him to add one or two more, and to give reasons why they should be added. I therefore moves - </para>

                <para>That the item " Canned fruit, jam " hi inserted. </para>
                <para class="block">I wish to illustrate the operation of the sales tax on canned fruits, based on the average Australian retail prices per dozen, less cash discount. The basis of the tax on apricots, based on a price of 8s. a dozen, less a cash discount of 2-J per cent., would be 7s. 9£d. The old sales tax of 2-J per cent, represented 2-Jd. a dozen, equal to £1 6s. 3d. a ton of fresh fruit. Under the new tax of 6 per cent., the amount per dozen will be  5½d.  equal to £3 3s. a ton of fresh fruit. The basis for sales tax in the case of peaches, based on a price of 8s. a dozen, less a cash discount of 2-J Der cent., would be 7s. 9-Jd. The old sales tax would amount to  2¼d.  a dozen, equal to £1 ls. a ton of fresh fruit. Under the new tax, the amount will be 5-Jd. a dozen, equal to £2 103. 6d. a ton of fresh fruit. The basis for sales tax on pears, based on a price of 9s. a dozen, less a cash discount of 2£ per cent., would be 8s.  9¼d  The old sales tax would amount to 2£d. a dozen, equal to 19s. a ton of fresh fruit. Under the new tax, the amount would be 6d. a dozen, or £2 5s. 6d. a ton of fresh fruit. Last year, the suppliers to two of the largest canneries in Australia, excluding Shepparton, received only £5 a ton for peaches, pears, and apricots. That was probably the finest fruit in the world, and was picked specially for processing purposes. On jams, the 2-J per cent, tax averaged about lOd. a case of 1-i-lb. jams, equal to 45s. a ton on the fresh fruit used. If the increase of 6 per cent, applies, it will mean 2s. a case of four dozen tins, or £5 8s. a ton on the fresh fruit used. Compare this with the £3 a ton paid for plums, and the £4 paid for peaches, apricots, and quinces, and it will be seen that the increased rate will inflict a tax of more than the original price per ton payable to the grower of jam fruits. The Prime Minister said, earlier, that it was not proposed to tax basic foods. I believe it can be said that jam is a basic food to-day. It has become an absolute necessity on the daily menu. As a matter of fact, the list of articles obtainable on dole tickets, in some States, includes jams. We can see the effect if the 6 per cent, tax is passed on to the public. It appears to be an impossibility to obtain an extra price for jam from people who to-day are depending on dole tickets for their existence. To my mind, the whole thing seems to be an atrocious injustice. Definitely, if the tax on canned fruits is passed on, the demand for these products will be decreased immediately. No jam manufacturer or canner to-day can stand extra taxation, and in all probability an attempt will be made to pass on the tax. I am exceedingly doubtful whether the purchasing power of the people will enable sales of canned fruits and jams to continue at anything like the rate required to keep in employment the workers who are now engaged in our factories. </para>
                <para>I should like to quote a few statistics in regard to jams. In the case of the cheaper varieties that are used in every "home, such as apricot, peach, plum, and quince, each ton of .fresh fruit delivered from the orchard produces, on the average, 212 dozen tins, each containing \\ lb. of jam. There are 4 dozen tins in each standard case sold in Australia. Therefore 53 cases, each of 4 dozen 1^-lb. tins, are produced when one ton of fresh fruit is added to one ton of  cane-sugar and  made up into jam. An extract of  the average selling prices of jams on which sales tax has to be paid at 6 per cent, shows that 6. lid. a dozen will be collected on the 212 dozen tins of jam which are the out-turn from one ton of fresh fruit. This means a sales tax of £5 8s. on each ton of fresh fruit used in jam-making. In most cases, fruits which are used for jam, such as .plums and apricots, are sold for about £3 or £4 a ton. The taxation on the more expensive jams, such as raspberry and black currant, is slightly heavier per ton of fresh fruit, because of the higher sales value. The average tax on these varieties is about 7d. a dozen on the 212 dozen tins to each ton, which is equal to £6 3s. 8d. a ton of fresh fruit; consequently, the berry fruit-grower is also very badly hit. I have no berry fruit-growers in my electorate; but in the southern parts of Victoria and in Tasmania hundreds of tons of berry fruits are grown. A fair overall sales value for each ton of jam in the usual l£-lb. cans would be £90 a ton. Reliable statistics give the annual consumption of canned fruits as 18,250,000 cans for the six years up to 1929. In 1930 the consumption fell to 15.750,000 cans. In 1929, about 22,000,000 cans were distributed; so that there was a decrease in 1930 of 6,250,000 cans, which was equal to 28 per cent. Unquestionably the attempt which was made to  pas3  on even the 2-J per cent, sales tax last year, made a great difference to the housewives, many of whom erased canned fruits from their buying lists. The effect will be even more serious under the 6 per cent. tax. I do not believe that the Australian consumption of fruits in 1931 will exceed 12,000,000 cans. Unfortunately, I have not the statistics for 1930 and 1931 -in relation to jams; but the evidence contained in the report of the sugar inquiry committee discloses a very serious decline in the consumption, equal to 6 J lb. per head of the population, or a total of 41,000,000 lb. less than would have been consumed had jams been available to the housewife at a fair value. To add 6 per cent, to the sales value of jams, in view of the decreased spending capacity, is to invite a still further decline in the consumption. Yet, if the additional tra <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> persisted in, the manu- facturers will not be able to bear it, and will endeavour to pass it on, with serious consequences to the fruit-growers. </para>
                <para>I direct the attention of the Prime Minister to another primary product. There is no tax, and rightly so, on the products of milk, such fis cream, butter, cheese, whole milk, preserved milk, powdered milk, &amp;c. Nor is there a tax on dried, fruits. In one of the large factories in the Goulburn Valley, on the 'one side apricots, peaches and pears are processed and canned; while on the other side, the same fruits, but not of as fine a quality, are put through dehydrating machines and turned out as processed dried fruits. Because they are dried, they are not liable to be taxed; but in the case of the prime fruit, which is processed and canned, this-heavy impost has to be borne. Canning fruit is in a special class. It is grown almost exclusively for canning purposes. It is perishable; but so that the consumer may have the equivalent of fresh fruit all the year round it must pass through a preserving process. Because it is preserved, it is taxed; although other processed articles are allowed to go free. </para>
                <para>I hope that the Prime Minister will give this matter his earnest and serious consideration, because it affects a very large and deserving body of primary producers. </para>

                    <para>. -  This item has given me more concern than any other request that I have received. Tho honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> has approached me in regard to the matter, and in addition a number of requests have been made and letters received urging that it be considered. It would have been considered more than favorably but that the loss of revenue would amount to £145,000. That is too serious a loss to contemplate. It is an industry that one would feel inclined to encourage; but if we open the door there will be requests on behalf- of tinned honey, golden syrup, treacle, fish and many other things. I am sorry that  I  cannot accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I  support the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> in hig efforts to assist primary producers. In my electorate is one of the largest jam making factories in the southern hemisphere. About 2,000 men are employed in this establishment in the season, and about 10,000 tons of jam fruit are dealt with annually. The proposed sales tax will reduce the market for jam. Commodities such as preserved milk are exempt from the tax.Fresh fruit and sugar also escape it, but when these two commodities are combined in the form of jam, the tax is applied. The demand for jam is decreasing each year, because the price of sugar has been raised of late years, owing to the special protection received by the sugar industry of Queensland. </para>

When they were asked by members in this corner to support the exemption of explosives from the sales tax, they declined to do so, because they had no special interest in the mining industry, although precisely the same principle was involved. The National Parliament is no place for parish pump politicians, who are chiefly interested in their own electorates. </para>

                    <para>.- I object to the imposition of the sales tax on any article, because this measure is part of the " Premiers' plot." We were told that there was to be equality of sacrifice. The invalid and old-age pensioners, and the workers have already suffered a reduction of 20 per cent. in their incomes, and since they comprise the section which eventually pay all taxes they are required to bear a double impost, in order that sufficient revenue may be obtained to give the international financial interests overseas their pound of flesh. The sales tax represents an attack on the cost of living, and that is tantamount to a tax on the workers' wages, the relative value of which depends upon their purchasing power. Therefore, I intend to vote against every clause of this measure. </para>

                    <para>.- I appreciate the Government's desire to obtain additional revenue, and I realize that the greater the number of exemptions granted, the smaller will be the amount of revenue received; but I wish to renew the claim that I made to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> last year for the exemption of a certain commodity. The granting of this request would not seriously reduce the revenue, because only a couple of hundred pounds are involved. The commodity which I desire to have exempted is mutton birds, which are captured on Flinders Island, in Bass Strait. These birds are collected by halfcastes, who earn their living chiefly in this industry. Calculated on a yearly basis, the incomes of these individuals would not exceed £1 per week. The present sales tax of 2½ per cent. has made their living a particularly precarious one; but, if the tax were increased to 6 per cent., they would be ruined, and the industry would pass out of existence. Undoubtedly, the men now engaged in it would be reduced to the dole. The amount of revenue collected in sales tax on the 2½ per cent. basis is about £100, and if the tax were increased to 6 per cent., it would be about £240. Basic food stuffs and primary products are on the exempted list, and although the mutton bird may not, strictly speaking, be regarded as a basic food, the business of mutton birding is a primary industry on Flinders Island, and the only process they go through is that of being salted, which evidently brings them within the scope of the tax. Mutton birding, so far as the islanders are concerned, is their primary industry, and numbers of them are absolutely dependent upon it for a livelihood, just as much as is the man engaged upon the land in the production  of  cereals  or  meat. I hope that the Prime Minister will give sympathetic consideration to my request. </para>

                    <para>.- Before the committee disposes of this clause, I should like the Prime Minister to indicate whether any decision has been reached with regard to the exemption of metal, blast furnace slag, gravel and sand for road-making, sold to a public  authoritycharged with  responsibility  for  the formation and maintenance of public roads. During the second-reading debate I inquired of the Prime Minister, by interjection, if these commodities would be placed on the exempted list, and he said he could not give a ruling off-hand. I raise the question now in the hope that the right honorable gentleman has had time to examine the position and, if roadmaking material is not on the exempted list, I suggest that the necessary amendment be made to the bill. Representations have been made on this subject to me by the Municipal Tramways Trust  of  Adelaide, which is a public body. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member was good enough to give me a rough draft of the proposed new clause, and I asked the taxation department to examine the proposal. The departmental view is that plant and machinery purchased by a manufacturer is subject to sales tax, which is payable by the vendor. When a company reconstructs and a new company buys its plant and machinery from the old company, the new company is not permitted to quote its certificate of registration for the purchase, so that the selling company, being a registered person under the Sales Tax Act, is taxable on the sale. If the new company were to purchase new plant and machinery from some other source, the vendor would be taxable on the sale, and would pass on the tax to the purchasing company. When a reconstructing company sells plant and machinery, on which sales tax has been passed on to it, it receives a rebate of that tax from the tax payable on the sale by it of the plant and machinery; but not exceeding the latter amount of tax. I think that, to a large extent, meets the position which has been stated by the honorable member. If it does not, I shall have a look at the amendment, and if it is an equitable proposition, it can be re-drafted and considered when the bill is in another place. </para>

                <para>This amendment is designed to grant relief to wholesale merchants who have obtained all their trading stock without payment of sales tax at the customs on their imported goods, or without having sales tax passed on to them in respect of their purchases. These merchants are obliged to pay sales tax on all their sales on the actual sale prices whether those are wholesale or retail prices. Wholesale merchants whose wholesale sales are less than 50 per cent. of their total sales obtain their stocks subject to payment of tax at the customs on their imports, and to having tax passed on to them on their  purchases, but they are not required to pay additional tax on their sales by retail. They merely pay additional tax on their sales by wholesale. The trading stocks which those merchants had on hand on the 11th July, 1931, will have been subject to sales tax at 21/2 per cent. Additional tax of 31/2 per cent, will now be payable only on the wholesale sales made out of that stock. In regard to retail sales by those merchants, they will be in the same position as retail sales by exclusively retail merchants. But, in the case of the wholesale merchants whose wholesale sales predominate, they will be required to pay 6 per cent, tax not only on their wholesale sales, but also on their retail sales. In order to place the retail sales by those merchants on the same footing as retail sales by exclusively retail merchants, and by wholesale merchants whoso retail sales predominate, it is now proposed to provide for the allowance of a rebate of the additional tax of 31/2 per cent., which is payable on the retail sales out of the stocks on hand at the 11th July, 1931. It is considered that this course is the simplest for the purpose of effecting the desired end. </para>

                    <para>.- I am afraid that the anomaly can be removed only by increasing the percentage added to goods imported by retailers. It certainly places some traders at a disadvantage compared with . others, because an arbitrary rule has been adopted to add 20 per cent, to the import value of anything imported by retailers. In some cases it may be higher, and in other cases lower, than the value added in the case of goods imported by wholesalers. However,  I  shall have the matter looked into with a view to seeing whether an alteration is possible. </para>

                <para class="block">The object of this amendment is to give traders the option of stating the amount of sales taxation at the foot of the invoice, or of including it in the price of the goods. After the passage of the sales tax legislation last year many traders were put to considerable expense in altering all their prices to comply with the law, and unless they are given the option which I am now proposing to provide they will be obliged to again alter all their prices. The present system is giving comparative satisfaction. If the traders are allowed the option that I desire them to have, business will be facilitated. The activities of small storekeepers, particularly those who sell haberdashery and small drapery lines, will be helped. Moreover, if the option is granted there will be more competition among the shopkeepers, and this may have the effect of causing some firms to pay a portion, if not all,of the taxation, which would, of course, result in the public being charged lower prices for their goods. </para>

                    <para>. - The  president  of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia has recently written to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> with the object of ascertaining whether sales tax may be deducted in preparing income tax returns. I quote the following paragraph from their letter :  - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <quote>
                    <para>The Commissioner of Taxation has recently ruled that the taxpayer will be able, under certain circumstances, to deduct the tax from his financial figures, but in other cases proofs will be required before its deduction will be admitted. It would be inequitable were business houses called upon to pay income tax on sales tax.I would therefore strongly urge that it be made clear by legislation that sales tax is a deductible item in trading and/or profit and loss accounts before the ascertainment of taxable income. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I understand from the officials of the Taxation Department in this connexion that the Commissioner of Taxation has ruled that while sales tax is not a permissible deduction in an income tax assessment under the Income Assessment Act, the majority of persons who are liable to pay taxation will not be required to pay income tax on the amount of sales tax paid by them. I quote the following statement of the position as set out in the commissioner's ruling: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Persons liable to pay sales tax  may be  classified as follows: - (1) Those who add the full amount of tax to the sale price; (2) those who add portion of the tax to the sale price, and bear the balance themselves; (3) those who do not add the tax to the sale price, but bear it wholly themselves. In the first class of case the tax does not form part of the sale value of the goods, which is to be shown in income tax returns. In the second class, the actual amount of sales tax passed on is to be excluded from the income tax returns, which should include only the actual amount for which the goods would have been sold but for the sales tax actually passed on. Any person who falls within either of these two classes must submit with his income tax return a certificatethat the prices at which he sold the goods upon which he was required to pay sales tax included that tax. The  certificate will be required to show, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> the percentage included in the sale price in respect of sales tax, e.g., whether it was the full percentage of 2½ per cent. or something less. It will also be required of the vendor to show that the purchasers to whom he sold the goods were aware and agreed to the inclusion of the tax in the sale prices, and of the percentage being so included. In any case in which satisfactory evidence of the above is not forthcoming the department will refuse to allow any deduction in respect of sales tax in the income tax assessment. In regard to the third class of case, the taxpayer must include in his income tax return the actual sale price of the goods, and is not entitled to any deduction in his income tax assessments in respect of sales tax absorbed by him, as the Income Tax Assessment Act does not permit the deduction. Persons in this class may overcome the position by endorsing their invoices that the price charged for the goods therein is net, after deducting 2.439 per cent. discount, and adding sales tax at 2½ per cent. on the discounted price. Provided this endorsement appearson all relevant invoices, the taxpayer is entitled to deduct sales tax when ascertaining the total sales to be shown in his income tax returns. </para>
                    <para class="block">I should like to know from the Prime Minister whether he will confirm this ruling? I should also like to receive his assurance that this amendment making it mandatory for the taxpayer to state upon every invoice the amount of sales tax payable in respect thereof will enable its deduction to be made on income tax returns. </para>

                    <para>.- I am glad that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has refused to accept this amendment. I gave certain reasons in the earlier debate on this measure why the amendment which the Government has made to the bill should be adhered to. I pointed out, among other things, that under existing conditions a person who bought £100 worth of goods could be charged £106 or more for them. Actually, he had no means of ascertaining exactly how much sales taxation had been charged to him. The honorable member for Brisbane (Mr.D. Cameron) has now given another reason why the amendment of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> should not be agreed to. If the amount of salestax is stated clearly at the foot of invoices, it may bo deducted for income tax purposes; but it would not be possible under the present regulation to allow such deductions if the amount of such taxation were not clearly shown. </para>
