                            <para>- The Government, when increasing the primage duties generally from 4 per cent. to 10 per cent., allowed stud stock to remain dutiable at the old rate. When the primage rates were under consideration several honorable members urged that stud stock should be exempt. Realizing that the introduction of new blood is of paramount importance for the improvement of our flocks and herds,I promised to reconsider the matter. The Government has now decided that cattle, sheep, pigs and draught horses, shall be admitted without payment of primage duty, but race horses will still be subject to the rate of 4 per cent. The necessary legislative action will be taken to give effect to thisdecision. </para>

                        <para>- The Government has been constantly reviewing these items, because it desires to remove the embargoes as soon as that can be safely done. The prohibition of certain imports is not part of the protectionist policy of the Government; it is a financial emergency measure. The Commonwealth is not yet in a safe position, for although the trade balance has shown a wonderful improvement, we must have a considerable credit balance in order to meet our liabilities overseas. As soon as it is possible to do so, the embargoes will be removed ; first from the goodsmost urgently required. When imposing the embargo, the Government was careful to select goods that were not essential to Australian industry, and goods that could be produced in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The Government proposes  to  ask the House  to  adjourn  to  the 25th  of  November, or such earlier date as Mr. Speaker shall notify  to  honorable members. By that time the tariff schedule should be almost disposed  of  in the Senate. One  of  the measures  to  be dealt with  on  the re-assembling  of  the House is a bill for the appointment  of  a commission  to  control broadcasting. There willalso be a small amendment  of  the Income Tax Assessment Act. </para>

If the honorable member were not present in this chamber a week  or  so ago, let me inform him that I then stated that the Government intended to reintroduce the three bills that were previously debated" by this Parliament.

I suggest that if that were done, and the 25 th November turned out to be a suitable date, it would still be within his power to assemble honorable members then. </para>

            <para class="block">The fact that, for financial or other reasons, the order has not yet been placed does not affect the accuracy of my statement. The honorable member has placed too trusting a confidence in his correspondent. Before taking upon himself to say that my reply was " to some extent misleading," he might at least have taken the trouble to verify what I had said. The facts of the case may be simply recited: A concern was started for the manufacture from fish of fish-meal for stock food. Having received advice of a British plant suitable for the purpose, the concern applied for relief from the customs duty payable on it. The concern was brought into contact with a Melbourne engineering firm which claimed to be able to supply a suitable plant. After a number of interviews with the engineering firm - W. J. Stamp - the managing director of the fish meal concern informed the department that he was satisfied that the Melbourne firm could supply a suitable plant and that it had been definitely decided to place an order with that firm. Acting on the long and well-established conditions in respect of which exemption from duty is granted under the by-law items of the tariff, I could not, in the circumstances, do otherwise than refuse the application. It depends on the evidence whether or not a suitable plant can be supplied by a local manufacturer. The evidence placed before me up to the present indicates that a suitable locally-made plant can be supplied. If later evidence invalidates that previously furnished, the matter will be re-considered. It has been my experience that the honorable member for Gippsland is usually very fair; and I feel sure that he would not knowingly misrepresent me. </para>

                        <para>- This subject was thrashed out in this " chamber. If we accept the amendments, there will be on the committee practically as many senators as members of this chamber. We have to try to distribute equitably between the various parties' representation on the committee. There would not be much saving in expenditure effected in reducing the membership from seven to five. If the membership consisted of five, and three members were absent through illness, a quorum of the committee, would be lacking, and it might be compelled to neglect matters of urgent importance. From our experience of these committees, we believe that a membership of seven is reasonable. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am in favour of the Senate's amendments. As I have said previously, I regard these committees as entirely unnecessary, particularly in this time of depression when there is every need for economy. If the membership of the Public Accounts Committee were reduced from seven to five, and the expenditure reduced from £2,000 to £1,000 a year, that would be a distinct economy. The amendments should, therefore, commend themselves to honorable members. There is no work for the Public Works Committee, and its operations should be suspended temporarily, and if the Public Accounts Committee is not prepared to give its services voluntarily in this time of depression, its services also should be suspended. It has departed entirely from the terms of the arrangement under which it was appointed. It was never intended that it would be peripatetic. It was appointed to consider the budget proposals, and to make recommendations with regard to them. It has taken to itself other duties simply for the purpose of providing "perks" for parliamentarians. The committee is a gross extravagance, and I am opposed to its continuance. </para>

                    <para>.- This subject was exhaustively discussed a week or two ago. If the cost of the discussion an both Houses were analysed, it would ie found to exceed the cost of the activities of this committee for about three years. Unfortunately, some honorable members seem to suffer from political myopia, and it would do them good to indulge in a little introspection. Honorable members discussed this subject fully, and by a vote of about three to one decided to retain both the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. The committees are under the specific control of this Parliament, and if anything goes wrong, their appointment can come up for review. The Public Accounts Committee is not peripatetic, as the honorable member for Warringah has suggested. We must excuse the immaturity of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Parkhill), who has not long been a member of this House, and has not been appointed to either of its standing committees. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has not given a great deal of consideration to' the various activities of Parliament. If the committee has gome outside the limits of its primary statutory authority; it is because the Government has referred to it matters which in the past were referred to extra-parliamentary authorities. Rarely has the committee exceeded its statutory allowance. In any case, its expenditure is automatically limited by the number,'and the nature, of the inquiries entrusted to it. There is no reason why there should be any curtailment of the statutory appropriation; but that is not the matter now under consideration. That the committees are too cumbersome "is not the fault of the present Government, for in 1921, during the Hughes administration, the membership of the Public Accounts Committee was increased from nine to ten, in order to give each party proper representation on it. The right of the several political parties to be represented on these committees has been discussed on previous occasions. The issue now is whether the committee shall have seven, or five, members. This chamber agreed to reduce the number to seven; but the Senate has asked that it be further reduced to five. If the committee were composed of the members of one chamber only, as is the case in the House of Commons, five members would be adequate. </para>

                        <para>- There is a similarity between the recognized constitutional powers of the respective Houses. All sections in this chamber could be represented on a committee of five members; but if the Senate is also to be represented on the committee, it must be so constituted as not only to give the several parties representation, but also to preserve the balance between the two Houses. Of the ten members of the Public Accounts Committee, seven were representative of this House, and three of the other branch of the legislature. Recognizing that the committee was too large, the Government proposed that it should consist of five members of the popular chamber, and two from the Senate, thus preserving as nearly as possible the ratio of representation that is normally given to both Houses. The Senate would have the House of Representatives represented by only three members, while not altering its own representation. If the other chamber wants to set an example of patriotism, it should reduce to one its own representation on the committee. In this instance it has interfered, not only with the rights of this branch of the legislature, but also with the basis of representation. </para>

                        <para>- Some honorable members who have not been here long make innuendoes. Having a warped mentality themselves, they think that other honorable members cannot rise above fees and rewards. If we are to examine r,bv extravagance of Parliament, let us start with Parliament itself, and pay members  attendance fees only. Were we to establish the principle of payment by results, many honorable members would not earn the basic wage. I have indicated one direction in which greater economies could be made than by cutting out comparatively small items of expenditure such as those now under review. </para>

                <para>Parliament has never displayed a particularly keen interest in the budgetpapers and Estimates which are presented year after year. Last week we had an example of a lack of vigilance on the part of Parliament, and also on the part of Treasury officials and officers of the Auditor-General's Department, when Supplementary Estimates, covering a period of three years, were passed through both Houses without any discussion. Yet t he Constitution requires that Supplementary Estimates shall bo brought before Parliament annually. Honorable members will admit that 98 per cent. of the discussion which takes place on the Estimates and budget is composed of generalities. Only one or two honorable members subject the financial proposals to a more critical examination. </para>

A few months ago, when examining the act governing the Public Accounts Committee, I realized that it was the duty of the committee to examine the budget and Estimates. An inquiry along those lines is now nearing completion, and I feel certain that when the committee's report is presented, it will convince the people of Australia - even if it does not satisfy one or two honorable members who are always hypercritical in these matters - that there is need for a closer and more continuous examination of the finances of the country. I do not accept any responsibility for the failure of the Public Accounts Committee to examine the budgets and Estimates in the past. Undoubtedly, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, as Treasurerin the Cook Administration, had in mind the creation of a standing committee modelled on the British Public Accounts Committee Act, to which the </para>

Should there be a dispute between the Auditor-General and the Treasury officials, the matter ends there, no honorable member feeling that it is his duty to interest himself in it. These things do. not happen in Great Britain, because there the Auditor- ' General's report is examined by the Committee of Public Accounts, which determines whether the Treasury officials are right, or the criticism of the Auditor-General is justified. The result is that, in Great Britain, economies have been effected and efficiency has increased. </para>

                    <para>. -  I strongly support the amendments of the Senate, and hope that the Government will accept them. Listening with interest to the speech of the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman),</inline> I learned a good deal about the working of the Public Accounts Committee, not all of which was to its credit. According to the statement of the honorable member for Reid, the committee was appointed originally to exercise a general supervision over the budgetary position of governments. I submit that it has entirely failed to discharge that function, because it was an impossible task for a committee of that calibre. It seems to me that the committee has come to be regarded, not as a necessary part of the machinery of government, to obtain a general and impartial surveillance of the finances by members of all parties, but more or less as an appurtenance of the party machine, and, to that extent, 1 think, it is no longer necessary. If it is to be retained, it should be given a, new constitution, and the matter of party representation should bc considered from an altogether new angle. The practice has been to appoint to the committee a certain number of Government supporters, and members of the Opposition. The Country party comes last. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and great heart-burnings are often caused in the party rooms. I am glad to say that, once the members of the committee are appointed, party considerations are swept aside. The honorable member for Reid said that the Senate had exceeded its rights in its amendment for the reduction of the membership of the committee to five - three from this chamber and two from another place. But there is nothing in the constitution of the Public Accounts Committee requiring that the representation of the Senate should be limited; and 1 contend that the other chamber has acted entirely within its rights in making iti amendment. There is practically no work for the committee to do at the present time, and no advantage is to be gained by maintaining it. Therefore, the other branch of the legislature is perfectly justified in trying to limit the expenditure on the committee to the lowest possible amount. </para>

                <para>So far as I am aware, the activities of the committee have never proved very useful to the Government. It has admittedly failed to carry out the work, for which it was established, and that is probably because the job was too big for it. Having watched its work for the last nine years, I see no justification for maintaining it. A committee of three could, perhaps, produce just as valuable results  a3  those obtained by the present committee. Although extraordinary claims have been made, in general terms, about the needless expenditure which the committee has prevented, we have no proof of the amount actually saved. We are told that the work of the committee has resulted in a saving of millions annually, but I question that statement. I do not know that it has saved thousands, or even hundreds of pounds. </para>

                        <para>- Past experience shows that a committee with a large personnel does not produce good results. I consider that the importance of this body has been much over-rated. As the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> remarked, appointments to the committee have been made largely for the purpose of providing consolation prizes for members of different parties. The Government has a good opportunity in the amendment sent down from another place to reduce the membership of the committee to the lowest number acceptable to the Parliament. ..Acceptance of the Senate's amendments will create a good impression among the general public, and show that the Government is genuinely anxious to economize. It has always claimed that it desires to abolish unnecessary boards and commissions. A smaller membership would enable the committee's utility to be tested.I was associated with a committee of five which did very good work. </para>

                    <para>. - When the bill was previously under discussion, an intimation was made, I think, that the committee was then inquiring into a certain matter, and there was a probability of it completing the inquiry before an alteration was made in the present personnel. In my opinion, valuable service would be ren dered to this Parliament if the committee were permitted to present that report.I am in favour of a reduction of the membership of the committee to five, but I certainly disagree with the amendment providing for three members from this chamber and two from another place. If the membership is' to be reduced to five, the other chamber is entitled to only one member. This chamber should have a preponderance of representation on financecommittees.Anopportunitymay be taken on another occasion to discuss the subject of the fees paid to members of this committee; but I venture to say that when the full history of the Public Works and Public Accounts Committees is made known, it will be fully established that they have rendered exceptionally useful service. Those who are most critical concerning their work know least about it. </para>

                <para>It will be seen that these provisions describe what an unlawful association is in the eye of the law. But there is nowhere any provision of law which enables the Government by proclamation or otherwise to denounce an unlawful association as such. An unlawful association has no kind of corporate existence recognized by law by virtue of which it could be made a party to legal proceedings, apart from proceedings against an individual. Under the Unlawful Associations Act 1916-19 - a wartime measure aimed at the I.W.W. - the Governor-General had power to declare any association which advocatedor encouraged the taking or endangering of human life to be an unlawful association. This act expired six months after the end of the war. The following provisions of the Crimes Act, however, have persona) application, and may be applied to various kinds of offenders and offences in one way or another related to unlawful associations :  -  " 30b. Any member over eighteen years of age and any person who -occupied or acts in any office, or position in or of an unlawful association, or who acts as its representative or as a teacher in any such school is liable to imprisonment for one year. </para>

                <para>In order to bring into being the communist system of society the proletariat must have all power in their hands. They cannot destroy the old order so long as they do not possess this power. In order to accomplish their task they must become the ruling class in the State. It goes without saying that the bourgeoisie will not surrender their position without a fight. For them communism means the loss of privilege and of place, the loss of " freedom" to coin money from the blood and sweat of the workers, the loss of rent, interest, and profit. The communist revolution, therefore, will meet with the fiercest opposition from the exploiters. The task of the dominant working class, therefore, consists in the merciless suppression of this opposition. As the resistance of the exploiters will inevitably be strong, therefore, the rule of the proletariat will have to be a dictatorship. In a "dictatorship " there is a strong form of government, and men must agree to a high degree of resoluteness in the work of suppressing an enemy. It is evident that in such a situation there can be no talk of " freedom " for everybody. The dictatorship of the proletariat is incompatible with the freedom of the bourgeoisie. The dictatorship is, in fact, necessary to deprive the bourgeoisie of their freedom, to chain them hand and foot in order to make it absolutely impossible for them to light the revolutionary proletariat. The more stubborn the resistance of the bourgeoisie, is the more desperately they muster their strength, the more dangerous they become; the harsher and more bitter must be the proletarian dictatorship, which, in an extreme case, dare not cease till the terror is overcome. Only after the complete overthrow of the exploiters and the crushing of their resistance; when it is no longer possible for them to injure the working class; only then will the dictatorship of the proletariat become milder. The bourgeoisie will gradually be merged in the proletariat, the workers' state will gradually die away, and society will become a communist society in which there will be no class divisions. </para>

It is said to be administered by a head-quarters of ex-service "men, comprising all the necessary branches and sub-divisions of a staff organized and ready to mobilize. Greater Sydney is divided into four zones, and each unit is officered and staffed by men who have seen service. Members of the New Guard are classified in three groups as follows: - </para><quote><para>A Class, are those who volunteer as shock troops. </para><para class="block">B Class, are chiefly technicians. </para><para class="block">C Class are householders detailed for the defence of their own residential suburbs. </para></quote><para>One person holds himself out as an authoritative exponent of its objects which, divested of certain counsels of perfection and abstract ideals, may be set out as follows: - It is the organization of a force on military lines pledged to support, if called upon, the duly constituted authorities of law and order; to take the initiative in maintaining law and order; to safeguard the lives and property of the people, and to maintain essential service, should the police be overwhelmed. This exponent states that it is organized on sound military lines; that its functions are purely protective, and that it will not act unless called upon to do so by constituted authority, or until it is apparent that the forces of disorder are in complete control. In addition, it interests itself in a number of political and ethical questions. </para><para>It is claimed for the New Guard that in certain contingencies it would act without request from the police, and that it would be guided in the exercise of force by a council of action composed of various so-called divisional commanders. Meaures of force would not be entered upon without the authority of a substantial majority of the members of this body. </para><para>Certain provisions of law relate to these matters. By the Unlawful Drilling Act 1819-60 Geo. III. and 1 Geo. IV. - it is provided that meetings and assemblies of persons for the purpose of training or drilling themselves, or of being trained or drilled to the use of arms or for the purpose of practising military exercises, movements or evolutions, without any lawful authority from  His  Majesty, are unlawful, and that a person attending such meeting for the purpose of training or drilling other persons to the use of arms or the practice of military exercises, movements or evolutions, or who commits acts of a like character set out in the statute, are liable to heavy punishment. Section 118 of the Defence Act provides that any person who induces or attempts to induce any other person to enlist or engage to serve in any military force, the raising of which has not been authorized by the Governor-General, is liable to six months imprisonment. Unlawful drilling is dealt with under section 27 of the Crimes Act. </para><para>The question of how far, if at all, a member of the New Guard has, up to the present, offended against the law is a matter of evidence in each case. Propaganda, self-advertisement and verbal filibustering indicating an intention to break the law are not necessarily breaches of the law. The facts necessary to be proven are indicated by the provisions of law quoted and the sections referred to. As a citizen, each member of this organization would, in proper circumstances, be justified in coming to the assistance of the police, but this right and, indeed, duty, would be shared equally withevery other citizen, and would not imply licence to exercise a greater measure offorce than that which would be legallypermissible in the case of persons generally. Each member wouldcome under the provisions of the law relating to the unauthorized carrying of fire arms. This organization does not appear to fulfil the conditions necessary to constitute an unlawful association. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1412</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KX7</name.id><electorate>East Sydney</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">WARD, Edward</name><name role="display">Mr WARD</name></talker><para>.- Last Friday, during the absence from the House of members of the group to which I belong, on account of urgent business, the Prime Minister stated that they were absent at a time when a matter affecting depositors in the old branch of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was being referred to.

Yesterday the Prime Minister indicated that, if the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales were granted the right to withdraw £10,000,000 from the Commonwealth Bank, that money would be required to meet a rush that the right honorable gentleman anticipates, the moment that the bank re-opened the door of the " old business " division. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1413</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KVU</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">THOMPSON, Victor</name><name role="display">Mr Thompson</name></talker><para>-  His anticipations are sound. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1413</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KX7</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">WARD, Edward</name><name role="display">Mr WARD</name></talker><para>- We shall see. In 1924, the Commonwealth Bank granted the associated banks the right to draw £15,000,000. They were supposed to pay 4 per cent. interest on any notes that wore withdrawn, and on that right they established credit to the extent of £60,000,000. What happened? Not one note was withdrawn from the Commonwealth Bank, and the  transaction was carried through as though that £18,000,000 in notes were in the vaults of the associated banks. In the case of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, not one note would be required. That institution simply wants to be treated as were the associated banks d few years ago. Even if the notes were withdrawn, they would find their way back to the bank within a week or two. That is the usual practice. Assistance was granted to the associated banks, because those institutions practically declared a financial lockout. </para></talk.start></continue><para class="italic"><inline font-style="italic">Attention called to the state of the House.
