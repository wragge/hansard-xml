If not, in view of the alleged necessity for securing Australian unity by " equality of sacrifice ", how can the Government justify its action in making class distinctions by according more favorable treatment to Australian money-lenders than that given to war widows, limbless soldiers, old-age and invalid pensioners, and wage-earners generally ? </para>

Does the Government subscribe to the view that to refuse or fail to honour any contracts with bondholders would be an act of repudiation, and, therefore, dishonorable? 2. Is it not a fact that the most solemn promises were made and repeatedly re-affirmed to Australian volunteers, who enlisted for service in the world war, that those who survived, and the families and dependants of all who served, would be amply and generously provided, for during the remainder of their lives? 3. Is it contended that their present pensions are excessive; if not, are not the proposed compulsory reductions thereof a partial repudiation of those promises, and as affecting the lives and health of thousands of crippled and diseased ex-soldiers, much more dishonorable than any possible default to bondholders ? </para>

            <para>- It was my intention to inform the House that the Commonwealth Government had made representations to the Government of Canada to the effect that it would not be convenient for it to be represented by a Minister at Ottawa in August of this year, as had been suggested, and I regret that, owing to my detention in Melbourne at the Premiers Conference, I was unable to do this, and omitted to ask the Minister in charge of Government business to do it. Prior to that I had learned that a similar reply had been sent by the Government of New Zealand. The cables on the subject that have appeared in the press state that the Government had taken this course owing to " political uncertainty ". The word " political " was not used, and I do not understand how it crept in. There is, of course, no "political uncertainty" in Australia at present. The Government felt that, because of existing conditions, it would not be convenient for it to be represented at Ottawa. It also believes that the conference would be a greater success if the proposals to be submitted to it receive more consideration in the light of recent negotiations between the respective countries concerned. </para>

          <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,</inline></para>
          <para>May I call your attention to a very urgent matter. There are hundreds of unemployed families in Sydney who realize that the chance of obtaining work is hopeless, and who are, therefore, exceedingly anxious to get a small block of land on which they can grow fruit and vegetables, keep some fowls, and perhaps a cow. It is possible to secure materials for shelters, tools, seeds, &amp;c, but the land is the difficulty. </para>
          <para>There is, however, at Liverpool, an area of between CO.000 and 70,000 acres belonging to the Defence Department. About 5,000 acres of this is not utilized at all for manoeuvring or big gun practice, and this is the very part which would be eminently suitable for placing families on two to five-acre blocks. I would respectfully urge you to approach the Prime Minister and other members of the Cabinet to get this area devoted immediately for this purpose. A value could bo fixed for the land, and this could bc paid off after a few years. The committee with which I am connected would be willing to organize the settlement if the land were available. I am confident that you will treat this as <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> matter of extreme urgency. </para>

            <para>- The only suggestion that has been put forward by various committees with regard to. the provision of small allotments of land for the settlement of unemployed has been that the Defence Department should make available certain land at Liverpool, which was purchased for military purposes at a cost of approximately Â£15 an acre. It has been urged that the land should be made available to unemployed in allotments of about two acres each. After carefully considering the proposal, it was decided that the land was unsuitable for the purpose, and the request was rejected. A similar project has been considered by previous ministers for Defence, including the present Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green),</inline> but the idea was deemed impracticable. However, the Government has offered the whole of the Liverpool Camp to the New South Wales Government, with the exception of the hospital block, to he used for the purpose of housing the unemployed. That Government has asked the Commonwealth Government to defer the offer, as it is trying to make other temporary arrangements to house the unemployed through the medium of the Sydney Unemployment Relief Committee. Should the New South Wales Government take over the Liverpool Camp for this purpose, it is possible that it may he able to make use of a portion of the area for growing vegetables for the men in the camp. </para>

Catherine Hill Pay, which is inaccessible except by boat. Consequently it is still there, and cannot be used by destitute persons either in the Newcastle or Hunter River districts. Will the Government make available a quantity of coal at Newcastle, or provide the services of a warship to transport the coal from Catherine Hill Bay to Newcastle, so that it may be taken to the railhead, and used as was originally intended? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Also, will the Minister for Defence make available to the relief committees that are providing soup to the destitute in northern New South Wales, the travelling kitchens and coppers that are now stored in military buildings ? </para>

            <para>- The 10,000 tons of coal referred to by the honorable member was under the control of the Prime Minister's Department, and the Prime Minister entrusted me with the work of making what arrangements might be necessary to enable this coal to be distributed to the unemployed. Six thousand tons were made, available from the Catherine Hill Bay stock, under the condition that the Government would not be responsible for the cost of transport. We said that if local authorities would make arrangements for transporting the coal, it would be made available. Later, it was made known to me that the coal was far away from some of the districts in which it was needed, and that the cost of transport would make it unreasonably dear. In order to meet the requirements of the Newcastle and Waratah districts a quantity of 400 tons, supplemented by a further 200 tons, was made available from the stores of my department. If the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> knows any council or authority which is prepared to make itself responsible for the distribution of coal, I shall consider sympathetically any application he may put before me. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honorable member asked whether the Government would agree to make available cooking utensils to unemployed relief committees. The Defence Department has already made available large quantities of such utensils throughout the States, including New South Wales. We made it a condition, however, that some local authority must take charge of the materia], and be responsible for it. I am not prepared to hand out public property to any one who may come along and ask for it. If the honorable member will nominate some authority which will undertake to make proper use of the material, and be responsible for it, I shall consider sympathetically any request made for its use. </para>

            <para>- Owing to the pressure of work in the Bankruptcy Office, the compilation of statistical information, other than in connexion with the annual report of the Attorney-General, can only be undertaken at the expense of other urgent work. I refer the honorable member to the annual report of the Attorney-General for the year 1928-29, and to the report for 1929-30, recently circulated. These reports contain a great deal of the information as to bankruptcies, deeds of arrangement, &amp;c, asked for by the honorable member. The report for the year 1.930-31 will be tabled shortly after' the end of next month. Under the circumstances, I would ask the honorable member not to press his question. </para>

In reply, I indicated that the ground was treated with sludge residue, and that the actual top-dressing was soil and sand. In view of the apprehension expressed, I undertook that an expert opinion would be obtained on the subject. This has now been received, and indicates that there may be a danger if woundswere to become infected with bacteria from the sludge. In the circumstances, I have given instructions for the discontinuance of the use of sludge in connexion with . playing fields. </para>

At this conference the position of Australia was discussed seriously and earnestly. </para>

            <para>.- The members of the Country party offer no objection to the proposed adjournment until Wednesday, in view of the circumstances mentioned by the Prime Minister. It has been stated that representatives of the Government and of the Opposition have been in consultation in Melbourne, but I would draw the Prime Minister's attention to the fact that a not inconsiderable section of the Opposition was not consulted in any way on this occasion. We shall await with a good deal of interest the information which the Prime Minister proposes to place before us on Wednesday next. I understand that the conference which has been sitting during the last three weeks gave full consideration to proposals for the reduction of interest rates and of various forms of governmental expenditure, and I ask if any consideration was given to the possibility of reducing the cost of living by a similar reduction of tariff duties ? </para>

            <para>.- The needs of the country at the present time are desperate. Our greatest hope lies in the production of more wealth in Australia, and to induce better use of the land it is essential that we should endeavour to make the cost of all primary production as low as possible. Therefore, I urge upon the Prime Minister the necessity for doing everything possible in the direction of revising the Government's tariff policy. Only by encouraging the men on the land by lowering the tariff duties can we ensure a speedy return to prosperity. </para>
