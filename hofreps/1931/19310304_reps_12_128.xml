McTiernan a letter dated the 19th December, 1930, resigning his seat as member for the electoral division of Parkes, in the State of New SouthWales.

          <para>.   -  As you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have announced, since we last met, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Edward West, who represented the electoral division of East Sydney in this House, has passed from our midst. The news of his death on the 5 th February was, I am sure, received with very great regret by every member of this Parliament. Of each of us he was an esteemed and honoured colleague. Entering this Parliament in 1910, he was continuously a member until his death. From 1920 to 1925 he was a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and for many years before he entered this Parliament he was prominent in the public activities of a good citizen. In the early days of the Labour movement he was actively associated with its organization throughout Australia. The deceased gentleman was a greatly valued and honoured member of the party I have the honour to lead in this House, and was held in high regard in his constituency, which he served faithfully and well. Conscientious and enthusiastic in the discharge of his public duties, even in his failing years he insisted upon taking a full share of the work which devolves on all members during the sittings of Parliament, when he might reasonably have spared himself. He was a kindly man.  His  likeable disposition and his cheery outlook made him popular with all members of this chamber. The sympathy of this House goes out to the members of his family in the great loss they have sustained. I move - </para>

He was a very faithful supporter of his party, and was particularly earnest in the advocacy of principles in which he believed. Essentially good natured, his relations with other members of the House, irrespective of the parties to which they belonged, were always of the most cordial character. I join in the Prime Minister&#39;s expressions of regret at the passing of a respected colleague. </para>

The members of the Country party desire to be associated with the Prime Minister&#39;s expressions of regret and sympathy with the bereaved relatives. </para>

I can remember him when, as a young man, he was associated with the trade union movement, in advocacy of principles to which he still adhered when he became an employer of labour. He was a member of this Parliament for many years, and his quiet demeanour endeared him to all of us, but it did not prevent him from being a sturdy fighter for the principles for which he stood. By his death I have lost a life long friend and this Parliament a legislator who commended himself to the kindly feelings of all. </para>

        <para class="block">Since the House last met, the death has also occurred of one who was a member of this House for many years. I refer to the late Honorable E. K. Bowden, who passed away on the 13th February last at his residence at Parramatta. The news of his death was received with the greatest regret by all who were privileged to know him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowden</inline> was first elected to this Parliament in 1906, and, with just one break, he continued a member until 1929. He was Minister for Defence from 1923 to 1925, and in 1926 was  chairman  of. the select committee which inquired into the Commonwealth electoral law and procedure. Although zealous in upholding his own political beliefs, he always paid due regard and respect to the opinions of his political opponents.  His  sincerity and his zeal in the discharge of his public duties gained for him the respect of not only his fellow members in this Parliament, but also the members of the public who knew him. Personally, I feel that a good man has gone from our midst, and I am sure that the sympathy of all honorable members will be extended to his widow and family. </para>

          <para>.- I second the motion. It is just 24 years since the late Honorable E. K. Bowden was elected to this chamber. He therefore had a long political career, during which he rendered real and valuable service to the people of Australia. Particularly useful was the work he did as Minister and as  chairman  of the select committee on electoral law and procedure, and also as a member of the Royal Commission on the Constitution. He was always on friendly terms with his fellow members, and enjoyed their esteem and respect.  Those  who knew him well feel that they have lost a valued personal friend. I associate myself with every word that the Prime Minister has uttered. </para>

In spite of chronic ill health for many years, the late Honorable E. K. Bowden was a very active man in office and in Parliament. Unquestionably, his activities tended to shorten his life. As a colleague of his, I know that he was an assiduous worker. He was an easy man to work with, and as a constitutional student, he built up in this House a reputation which it will be hard for others to achieve. </para>

I cannot claim a long acquaintance with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowden,</inline> but I met him frequently at social functions, and was always on friendly terms with him. As a matter of fact, since my election to this Parliament, I think those terms have been even more friendly.

        </quote>
        <para class="block">The death of Dame Nellie Melba is in the fullest sense of the word a bereavement of the nation, and  I  am sure, therefore, that it is the wish of every honorable member that this House should give expression to the loss which Australia feels. To honorable members who had the privilege of hearing Dame Nellie Melba sing, either in her prime, or in her later years, the regret that the supreme gift which was hers in such full measure can charm us no more, will be keen. Dame Nellie Melba was one of the greatest artists of the world. As she herself once said, she was born with a natural trill. But even when nature is bountiful, no artist can hope to achieve the eminence of Dame Nellie Melba without great effort. For her, as for most, the path to fame was strewn with thorns. That she surmounted her , difficulties, glorying in the struggle, is proof of the indomitable will and courage that she possessed. </para>

          <para>.- I  second the motion. The name of Dame Nellie Melba has for many years been a household word far beyond the confines of the British Empire. By her voice and by her personality she achieved the rare distinction of winning the homage of fellow musicians, critics, and public alike. Yet, although thus acclaimed by the world, she was above all an Australian. Her music and her love for her country were unquestionably the greatest elements in an exceptionally full and vivid life. Reference, too, must be made to her generous and whole-hearted assistance to the musicians of this country. Her personal efforts smoothed the path for very many musical students. For her great-hearted enthusiasm, for her personal simplicity, and for her glorious voice, her name is loved by the people of our nation, whose sorrow at her passing is tempered with pride in the career of a great Australian. </para>

          <para>.- I  knew Dame Nellie Melba from the time she was a girl until she died. She was a friend of my sister. The friends of her youth admired the indomitable energy with which she pursued her studies. She began with the organ, under the tuition of the gentleman who was then the city organist of Melbourne. He,  I  believe, later married her sister. Her splendid heart and her perseverance made her the greatest singer of the world.  I  respect the memory of Dame Nellie Melba, too, for the splendid work she did during a terrible time when, as now, Australia was plagued with unemployment. She was then woman enough to write to some of her rich friends in England and America for assistance ; but the absurd persuasions of a bank manager, a schoolmaster, and another person, all of whom have since passed away, caused her to cease her efforts to secure help from that quarter. However, she personally gave great assistance to the unemployed at that time. Another thing for which we must be grateful to her is for keeping the name of Australia before the world. She was never ashamed of her country, and through her name, &#34; Melba which was derived from Melbourne, she made Australia famous throughout the whole world. Her end was a sad one. The cause of her death is uncertain. Possibly, while in Egypt, she was infected with a germ. It is particularly sad that a woman of such energy, capacity, and goodness should have died so soon and in such a manner. Peace to her ashes ! May the memory of her divine gift, her charity, her indomitable courage, and her pride in her Australian citizenship, as well as her fine efforts to further the interests of Australia, live in the hearts of her countrymen &#163;rv ever. </para>

        <para class="block">Every member of this House will desire to associate himself with this motion of sympathy with the victims of and sufferers by the recent earthquake in New Zealand. When the news of the disaster was received in Australia, a wave of sorrow spread throughout the Commonwealth. The earthquake occurred shortly after 10 o&#39;clock on the morning of Tuesday, the 3rd February, and was felt most severely in the neighbourhood of Hawkes Bay, on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand. Napier, a large and flourishing commercial centre, with a population of 20,000, was wrecked by the shock, and the earthquake was followed by fires which raged throughout the city. Similar devastation occurred in Hastings and other towns in the Hawkes Bay district. This earthquake, was by far the most destructive visitation of its kind that has been experienced in New Zealand. The loss of life, personal injury, and damage to property were very great. The people of Australia have been filled with admiration at, the prompt measures of relief taken by the Government of New Zealand, and by the local authorities.  A3  soon as news of the damage done by the earthquake was received in Australia, I despatched a message of sympathy to the Prime Minister of New Zealand on behalf of the Commonwealth Government and the people of Australia; and I also offered, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to despatch one of the ships of  His  Majesty&#39;s Australian Navy to assist in relief work. To this offer the Prime Minister of NewZealand, after ex-Dressing the thanks of his Government, replied that it was considered that the relief measures already taken were adequate. </para>

One of these passed away recently, the Honorable Donald Norman Cameron dying on the 17thFebruary last. Few members now present were associated with him in Parliament; only three in this chamber were his colleagues. He was elected to the House of Representatives at the general election of 1901, and sat until 1903. He was out of Parliament for a year, but was re-elected in 1904, and sat until 1906. On behalf of the people of Australia, I telegraphed to his widow a message of sympathy. I am sure that all honorable members feel regret at the passing of one of the pioneers of the Commonwealth of Australia. </para>

            <para>.- I wish to protest against the motion for the adjournment of the House, and I hope that my action, in so doing, will not be taken as evidence of any want of respect for the memory of our late colleagues. It is strange that we should seek to mark our respect by adjourning the House. Surely the postponement of the work that lies to our hand now is not to be taken as the measure of the respect in which we hold our late colleagues. Never was there greater necessity for doing away with make-beliefs, and getting to grips with the realities of a situation of unparalleled difficulty in Australia. I suggest, with bated breath, to the Right Honorable the Prime Minister and those associated with him, that any attempt to justify a course of action that, from the point of view of reason and common sense seems to me unsupportable, by saying that it has invariably been followed in the past is the most stupid kind of conservatism. We have been summoned from all parts of the Commonwealth to tackle a very difficult job ; and the sooner we get to work the better. Surely, by standing in our places as we did, and then getting on with our job, we shall pay respect in the fullest measure to the memory of our late colleagues, and at the same time conserve the interests of those who sent us here. </para>

            <para>. -  Some time ago the exPrime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> discussed with me the subject raised this afternoon by the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell),</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> agreed to consider, at a later date, the desirability of adjourning the House for less than a full day as a mark of respect for deceased members. We did not, however, reach finality in the matter, owing to an election taking place. I suggest that if any change is made, it should not be on a specific occasion such as the present, since that might be interpreted as exhibiting a lack of respect for the member whose death was the subject of a motion before the House. Should Parliament, in its wisdom, decide on a shorter adjournment than that which has hitherto taken place on such occasions, I . suggest that the decision be arrived at when no motion affecting the death of a member is before the House. The suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> is a good one. I shall certainly consider the advisability of appointing a small committee, representative of all parties, to consider the question raised by the honorable member for Fawkner. </para>
