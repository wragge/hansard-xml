            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave -</inline> Before the recent adjournment of  the  House, the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> had recorded  in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a statement dealing with the Canberra Hog Farm, which, in the main, was an attack on an officer of my department. The whole of the assertions contained therein have been personally  investigated  by me, and  1  find, as a result of this inquiry and a perusal of the departmental papers, that on the whole, the allegations are either a distortion of facts or untruths. In respect of the farm occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dennis,</inline> the statement included about  25  definite allegations of which, I find, not one is correct. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>With regard to the farm occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles,</inline> I find that the officer named was not responsible for the establishment, of the farm, or for any constructional work other than fencing. On the administrative side, there is no question that everything possible was done by him, both during the time the farm was being developed, and subsequently to assist the lessee and to protect the interests of the Commonwealth and the lessee. The documentary evidence in the departmental papers in support of this includes tributes from the lessee immediately prior to his occupation in  1929  and recently, and there is no evidence that any matter bearing on the farm has been neglected by the officer concerned. </para>
          <para>It is admitted that some delay in the development of the existing farm occurred. This was recognized before the lessee went into occupation, and at a conference with him and his solicitor, it was agreed that as compensation for this delay, the lessee should receive a rebate of rental for a period covering the first three months of his occupation. Some time after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles</inline> entered into occupation, he revived the subject of the delay in granting him possession of the land, due, in my opinion, to the depression  in  the pig industry, and also to the fact that the lessee&#39;s financial backing had not been realized. In order to meet the lessee, and recognizing that the Administration was obtaining a service in the removal of wet garbage from hotel and boarding establishments, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles&#39;</inline> rent-free occupation  of the farm was extended until the end of 1930. It was also agreed to refund the amount of &#163;121 6s. lid. paid by him- as a deposit  when  he accepted the lease. At a later stage, the Administration agreed to remit the rental due to the 31st December, 1931, and in addition, waived its claim to an amount of &#163;25 6s. 7d., due to it under the terms of the lease for the supply of water to the farm. It will be seen that, up to date, no rent has been received by the Commonwealth from this undertaking. A considerable amount has also been expended by the Administration in endeavouring to supplement the water supply and in alteration of the feeding system, and at the present time further representations by the lessee are receiving consideration.. </para>
          <para>I do not doubt, for one moment, the bona fides of the honorable member for West Sydney in bringing this matter before the House. I do, however, take - the greatest exception to the honorable member&#39;s informant supplying him with particulars which are proved to be false, apparently with the object of damaging the reputation of one of my officers. Officers of the Service have no means of refuting allegations made against them in the House, and I feel I would be remiss in cay duty to my staff if, after satisfying myself that the allegations are false, I did not refute them in this House. The statement made by the honorable member on information supplied to him is damaging to the reputation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brackenreg.</inline> 1 take this opportunity of assuring the honorable member that he has been misled, and  of making public the fact that all the allegations regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brackenreg</inline> are groundless. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brackenreg,</inline> who is a reliable officer, has carried out his duty as a government servant in- a most creditable and honorable way, and there is not the slightest justification . for the attack which has been made upon him. </para>

            <para>- There has been a full discussion between the Prime Minister and myself, and representatives of the Commonwealth Bank Board. At present it would be inadvisable to make a statement as to the nature of the discussion and the points that were under consideration ;. but a representative of the Commonwealth Bank Board is to consult with the representatives of the trading banks, and some action will be taken later with regard to the exchange rate. An announcement will then be made. The Government and the Commonwealth Bank Board agree that it would be inadvisable at the present time to make any change that would cause too sudden a change in the existing rates. </para>

            <para>- The matter mentioned by the honorable member has been under consideration. It is not strictly accurate to say that there has been discrimination between taxpayers of the various States in respect of allowable deductions for federal income tax purposes. There is a wages tax, or impositions in the nature of a wages tax, operating in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, and so far such  payments  have not been allowable deductions for federal income tax purposes. In South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, the additional revenue required to finance unemployment relief is incorporated in the ordinary income ta* law. Therefore, payments made in thai way are allowable deductions. Thi1 matter has been brought under the notice of the Federal Commissioner for Taxation, who has undertaken to reconsider the decision which he gave with regard to unemployment relief tax payments in Victoria and the other States. </para>

            <para>- There is no foundation whatever for the newspaper statements that the appointment of a committee is contemplated to consider the matter mentioned by the honorable member. A sub-committee of Cabinet is dealing with the whole position. An inquiry into individual cases is necessary, and, as the Assistant Minister in charge of war service homes has already announced, every case of individual hardship is being dealt with on its merits. Every case of hardship is being met, and, where possible, relief will be given. The sub-committee of the Cabinet is going into the question of whether general relief is possible; but a complete and permanent writing-down of the capital cost of war service homes, amounting in the aggregate to about &#163;28,000,000, at a time when nobody can say with any degree of accuracy what is the real value of property, is not contemplated, because such a suggestion is unsound. I agree that a position of great difficulty is arising, and we are considering that aspect of the matter with a view to making the burden as light as possible for all concerned. We have already reduced the rate of interest by 1 per cent. </para>

              <para>- It has been reduced by 1 per cent, in the case of loans to the States for soldier settlers, and by&#189; per cent, in the case of purchasers of war service homes. The interest charged to the various State Governments in respect of advances to soldier settlers is now 4 per cent., and the State Governments make an additional charge for administration. The Commonwealth Government is charging 4 per cent, interest on war service homes and&#189; per cent, for administration. The relief by way of reduction of interest by &#189; per cent, is undoubtedly going to returned soldiers in the case of occupants of war service homes, and some relief will, 1 believe, be given to returned soldier settlers. </para>

              <para>- It is impossible, under existing conditions, to value war service homes in a. way that would be fair to the buyer, the Government, and the community. I also remind the honorable member that municipal valuations for rating purposes may rise and fall from year to year ; whereas a writing down of values of war service homes for Commonwealth purposes would be permanent. There is therefore no analogy between municipal valuations for taxation purposes and Commonwealth valuations for repayment&#39; purposes. The Government is considering the whole question of capital costs, but I do not see how it is possible to write them down permanently at this stage. Values are fluctuating so greatly that no government, with a sense of responsibility, would undertake the task. </para>

          <para>- Consideration has been given to that matter. The Government desired to divide the schedule into two parts, and submit the business to another place in two separate bills with the object of facilitating the discussion there; but when the proposal was carefully investigated it was found that the practical difficulties were too great. It would impose a very great strain upon the departmental officers concerned in this business to watch the passage of the schedule through two Houses at the one time. I am afraid, therefore, that we shall have to abandon that idea. But, with the co-operation of all honorable members, this House could complete its discussion of the schedule in about two weeks. </para>

            <para>- Is the Prime Minister aware that at least one State Minister has announced that there is no obligation on State governments to passon the reduction of 1 per cent, in the interest on loans for soldier settlement in cases where the interest charged to the settler does not exceed 5 per cent? If so, is that statement in accord with the decisions of the Premiers Conference? Will the right honorable gentleman also say whether there is any honorable understanding or agreement among the members of the conference to the effect that the full reduction in interest will be passed on to the settlers? </para>

            <para>- When the reduction was made in interest rates the Commonwealth Government reduced by 1 per cent, the rate of interest on all moneys advanced by it to State governments for soldier settlement purposes. It was pointed out at the Premiers Conference, that some of the governments had not been charging for administration, and it was felt that they were entitled to do so ; but I did not understand that that charge would in any case exceed one-half per cent. My impression was that at least one-half per cent, reduction would be made in the interest charged by State governments on all moneys which they had advanced for soldier settlement purposes. </para>

            <para>.- I have moved the adjournment of the House because of the statements that have been made that, as a result of the recent Premiers Conference, it is proposed to distribute &#163;3,000,000 in relief to the wheat-growers of Australia, as a bounty upon the coming crop. I am aware that legislative proposals will come before the House which will give honorable members full opportunity to discuss matters relating to the wheat industry, and I do not intend to anticipate them. My reason for sponsoring this motion is to ask for a definite statement from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> in answer to a question that is being asked by wheatgrowers from one end to the other of the Australian wheat belt : &#34; Why is the Government coming forward with proposals for relief in connexion with the comingcrop before it honours its obligation to growers with regard to the last wheat crop?&#34; </para>

            <para>- If the honorable member will listen I shall try to make clear what I think the wheat-growers want. A brief review of the attempts of the Government to assist &#39;the wheatgrowers of Australia is necessary in order fully to assess the position. In February, 1930, the Prime Minister made an appeal to the growers of wheat throughout the Commonwealth to &#34; Grow more wheat.&#34; That was backed by a &#34; Grow more wheat&#34; campaign sponsored by the various State governments. Associated with the appeal was a projected guarantee of 4s. per bushel of wheat, cash on delivery at railway sidings. A bill to give effect to that guarantee was brought before Parliament and passed this chamber, but was rejected in another place. </para>

              <para>- I am not going, into details. I am merely mentioning facts. I make no party issue of this matter, and am not speaking in any party spirit. As a result of &#39;the failure to provide that guarantee of 4s. a bushel, a serious position was created in the wheat belt. At  the time I moved an adjournment of the House, and appealed to the Government to take action to give some relief to the growers, pointing out that, otherwise, a disastrous state of affairs would arise. I was supported by honorable members on both sides of the House, also by the leaders of all parties. As a result a bill was drafted which provided for the payment of 3s. a bushel f.o.b., of which 2s. a bushel cash was to bc paid at local sidings. The subsequent payment, on the basis of 3s. a bushel f.o.b., would have given to the growers an average of 2s. 4d: <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> bushel at country sidings. That measure passed both Houses, on the voices. Certainly there was criticism regarding details of the bill, but the main principle - that of granting assistance to the wheat-growers - was supported by the leaders and members of all parties in this House and in another place, lt received the Royal Assent on the 23rd December last, and is still upon the statute-book, but its provisions have not yet been honoured by the Government. Not one wheat-grower has received a penny as a result of the passage of that legislation. The reason given for the non-fulfilment of the terms of that act is that the Commonwealth Bank stated that, under the provisions of the measure, it could not adequately secure itself for repayments of any advances made. I am somewhat hazy, and I think most people are, as to the actual reasons which prompted the Commonwealth Bank to refuse to provide the money, but I shall not go into details. All I and the growers of wheat are concerned with is that the money has not been paid. </para>

              <para>- I do not intend to do so. The Prime Minister or the Minister concerned will have an opportunity to reply to my motion, and I am confident he will not attempt to glide over the difficulties. A definite authoritative statement should be made in connexion with the non-fulfilment of the terms of that measure. </para>

          <para>There is a further bill, of which notice appears on the business-paper. This, the Prime Minister has definitely stated, will not be proceeded with further. </para>
          <para class="block">It is a short measure to provide for an advance of &#163;6,000,000, &#163;2,o00,000 of which was to go to necessitous wheat-growers, the remaining &#163;3,500,000 to be &#39;paid as a bounty at the rate of 6d. a bushel. </para>
          <para>The latest proposal emanating from the recent Premiers Conference is a projected bounty of 6d. a bushel on export wheat. The point that I desire to emphasize, and that governs ray action in moving the adjournment of the House, is that it refers only to the coming crop, and makes no reference whatever to that of last season. As a result of the appeal to the growers of Australia, a crop was produced last year estimated to be 212,628,699 bushels, of which approximately 198,000,000 bushels was marketed by the growers at au average price of about ls. 9d. a bushel at country sidings. The difference between that price and the 4s. a bushel guarantee that had the approval of this House is 2s. 3d. In other words, the farmers received less than half the amount that they expected when the crop was sown. Assuming that the growers lost 2s. 3d. a bushel on the 198,000,000 bushels marketed last year, their collective loss on that crop amounts to &#163;22,275,000. The trouble is that the debts incurred by the farmers because they did not receive that money have not yet been liquidated. Unfortunately, many hundreds of them in all parts of the Commonwealth have been driven off the land, their properties have been sold, and there is no more pitiable sight than the mortgagees&#39; sales in the wheat belt to-day. There we have the spectacle of hard-working men, who need never har,been sold up, going off their properties practically without a penny, because the assistance promised them by the Government has not been forthcoming. Th? land and farming plant are, in most cases, sold for much less than their value, because, everybody being in an impoverished condition, no&#34; one can afford to pay much for anything. </para>
          <para>The farmers cannot get credit, and they are now faced with the task of taking off the coming crop, an expensive undertaking which is beyond their resources. I have here two telegrams received from different areas in my constituency, and the condition described in them is typical of that prevailing throughout the wheat belt, not only in Victoria.  but in the other&#39; wheat-growing States of the Commonwealth as well. My friend, the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> has informed me that the same state of affairs obtains in Western Australia, and I know that things are no better in New South &#34;Wales and South Australia.

          <para class="block">The farmers need money to harvest this year&#39;s crop. Apparently a sum of &#163;3,000,000 is available for the assistance of growers, and I urge the Government to make that money available in respect of last year&#39;s crop, so that the farmers may be able to use it to defray harvesting expenses this year. There is a moral obligation, not only on the Government, but also on this Parliament, to see that the farmers receive some assistance in accordance with the terms of the Wheat Advances Act passed last year. The honour of Parliament is involved. I suggest that the Government should proceed with the bill now on the notice-paper, but of which notice of withdrawal has been given. With some amendment of its machinery clauses, that measure would furnish a means of distributing the sum of &#163;3,000,000 which is supposed to be available. Such legislation would be a fair substitute for the 1980 Wheat Advances Act, and would enable the Government to carry out the promises made to the growers. Governments in every other country in the world where wheat is grown have come to the assistance of. the growers. In Canada to-day the Government is making an advance of 5 cents - a small sum it is true - towards trans.portation costs in connexion with the crop now being taken off. In New Zealand the wheat-growers have been protected. On the Continent of Europe, France, Germany and other countries have taken steps to protect and assist the growers. In the </para>
          <para class="block">United States of America, action has been taken by the Federal Farm Board to help the wheat-growers. In no other country in the world have the wheat-growers been promised so much, and received so little, as in Australia. Now the Government suggests that the money available should be paid on the coming crop, and regards this, presumably, as honoring the promise made last year in respect of the previous crop. Such a proposal cannot be permitted to pass without protest. </para>
          <para>By our action in passing the previous wheat bills, we have created a feeling of expectancy among the growers, most of whom are now smarting under a keen sense of political injustice. If the Minister would adopt my suggestion, it would give the growers finance at a time when they badly need it. To-day, a spirit of indifference, amounting almost to despair, prevails among settlers in the wheat belt.  The  land is not being fallowed, and the farmers are becoming demoralized through repeated disappointments. </para>

              <para>- I am glad that the honorable member asked that question, because he has reminded me of a point which I was in danger of forgetting. We know that a definite loss was incurred by growers in respect of the last crop, but  we  do not know what the price will be for  the  coming crop. Last week the price of wheat rose 6d. a bushel in the overseas markets, and at the seaports of the capital cities of Australia there was a rise of 4d. to 4&#189;d. a bushel in one week. It is possible that this upward trend may be maintained. I make no predictions, but it is possible. Conditions are unsettled in the Far East to-day. I mention this only as a contingency which may arise. There are rumours of trouble between Japan and Russia in Manchuria. A declaration of war would send wheat prices soaring, in a night. That is a powerful reason why this money should be made available to the farmers to repay them in some slight degree for the definite losses which have occurred. As for the coming crop, we shall have to deal with that when the time comes. </para>

          <para>If the banks have made certain stipulations regarding the advance of this money, the Minister should inform honorable members what they are; whether the Government has protested against them; whether it acquiesces in them; what further negotiations are proceeding, or whether it is necessary to approach the banks again. 1 suggest that the leaders of all parties in this House, and in another place, should confer with the Government, decide on a common policy, and should together urge upon the banks the necessity of enabling the Parliament to honour its promises in respect of last year&#39;s crop. This is a matter in which the responsibility of, not only the Government, but also the Parliament is involved. At present, there is an act upon the statute-book that has not been repealed, and to which effect has not been given. This is unparalleled in the political annals of this country. From one end of Australia to the other, the wheatgrowers are asking why effect has not been given to the Wheat Advances Act of 1930. I urge the Minister to make a definite statement to the House regarding the actual position, more particularly with respect to the developments which have occurred since the last conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, li is true that, brief paragraphs have appeared in the newspapers from time &#39;.o time, and that the Minister, in reply to a deputation which I introduced to him in Melbourne, outlined the position as it was at that time; but no official pronouncement has been made in Parliament. I have submitted this motion to enable the Minister to make a complete statement regarding the position, ai&#60;d to say whether it is not possible to make the sura of &#163;3,000,000 available in connexion with the 1930-31 harvest, and thus assist the wheat-growers in financing this season&#39;s crop. </para>

          <para class="block">Government&#39;s inactivity seems to savour of something in the nature of repudiation in its ugliest form. I am speaking, not only on behalf of those who have suffered so severely in the past, but in the interests of those who are now faced with tremendous responsibilities. I honestly believe that if action is not immediately taken Australia will find it exceedingly difficult to retrieve its position. Acute distress was prevalent in the new wheat areas in Western Australia in 1912, when the harvest was a failure. In traversing the district at that time I could not help but admire the steadfastness and determination of the wheat-growers, and thu courage and fortitude of their womenfolk. In some instances, I found that the children were being fed on grain and clothed in bags. The majority of those settlers have, in consequence of their determination, since made good; but it was because of the conditions of these people and the high cost of their requirements owing to our tariff policy that I became determined to resist the demands to exploit them further. Since that time further new areas have been opened up for wheat-growing, but owing to the heavy cost of commodities, due largely to the fiscal policy of the Commonwealth, the settlers are faced with difficulties similar to those experienced by others in earlier years. These settlers, who did wot have the slightest opportunity to take advantage of the high pi-ices which ruled after the termination of the war, are now in the wretched position of the growers in 1912 to whom I have just referred. History is repeating itself. The position of many of our wheatgrowers is hopeless. Many of them are bankrupt, and desperate, and unfortunately, others have forsaken their holdings upon which they had hoped <inline font-style="italic">u&#62;</inline> make homes for themselves and their families. No country can afford to forsake settlers of this class. Their present position has been greatly intensified by their loyalty to their country and their desire to assist the Government.. They listened to the pleadings of the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> who exhorted them, on many occasions, to produce more wheat, and told them that if they did they would receive the benefit of a guaranteed price. Since this Parliament passed an act providing for the payment of 3s. a bushel f.o.b. the Government has found that finance is not available. A proposal submitted by honorable members on this side of the chamber, to impose a sales tax upon flour, which would have provided sufficient money to pay 3s. a bushel^ did not meet with the approval of the Government. At the time the proposal was- made, I urged the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> to issue negotiable bonds equivalent to 6d. a bushel which would have shown the farmers that the Government was endeavouring to honour its promises. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Martens)</inline> believes in repudiating the pledges made to the wheat-farmers, I do not. An increase in our wheat exports, it was pointed out, would assist in reducing our adverse trade balance, and, consequently, the farmers were urged to produce more. The wheat-farmers loyally responded to the Prime Minister&#39;s appeal and, as a result, their losses are much greater than they otherwise would have been. A record area was placed under crop last year, but this year the area will be reduced at least 25 per cent. In travelling through portion of my electorate, I found many instances in which farmers who had commenced fallowing had later abandoned the work. When I questioned them as to their reason for so doing they replied, &#34; If we continue it will only mean getting further into debt. Look at the market &#34;. They stated that they were fed up with promises, and demanded the honouring of the Wheat Advances Act. The area under crop this year will probably be 25 per cent, less than last year, and in the following year the reduction may be still greater. At the present price of wheat it is impossible for the wheatgrowers to purchase their requirements or to employ labour, and this is accentuating the financial difficulties confronting the country. The members of farmers&#39; organizations in- Western Australia and South Australia have definitely stated that owing to the failure of the Government to redeem its promises they intend to hold this season&#39;s wheat. I do not wish to harass the Government  iD  this connexion. I know the difficulty it has had in connexion with financial matters; but a determined effort should be made by it to honour its promise. The small area that is being placed under crop this year, and which will be further reduced in the following year, is of more significance than the threatened hold-up of next season&#39;s crop. It is the responsibility of Parliament to act promptly in this matter, and I trust that the motion will receive the support of the Government and a majority of honorable members. H; is very easy for the Minister to say that &#163;3,000,000 is to be made available in connexion with the coming season, but payments based on last year&#39;s crop would enable the farmers to place land under fallow as well as to make purchases to assist them in taking off the coming crop. In that way additional employment would be available; more money would be in circulation, not only in the country, but in the cities, and trade generally would be stimulated. The fate of the agricultural industry is largely in the hands of the Government, and in the interests of the nation, it should give immediate effect to the Wheat Advances Act passed last year. It may be advantageous to make a promise with respect to next season&#39;s crop; but the present position of the wheat-growers^ particularly in the new areas in Western Australia and South Australia, where they have experienced several years of drought, is exceedingly precarious. I am hopeful that, as a result of this debate, the Government will make a special effort to see that something is made available to the farmers this year. If the money cannot be advanced through the Commonwealth Bank, I think the Government would be justified in issuing bonds up to, say, 6d. a bushel payable in nine or ten months. If that were done it would not only tend to increase production and make &#39; a considerable addition to the number of people employed this year, but would also give the farmers an opportunity to make preparations for next year. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member for Wimmera wants the statement to be made again, I have no objection to making it; but it will be merely telling the wheat-growers what  they have been told many times. The honorable member for Wimmera said that the Prime Minister had appealed to the farmers to grow more wheat, and the Government was, therefore, under an obligation to assist them. I said from the beginning, and the Government recognized it, that because the Prime Minister had appealed to the farmers to grow more wheat it was under an obligation to them; and in order to give them some recompense for having responded to the Prime Minister&#39;s appeal, we introduced our first Wheat Marketing Bill. It embraced what was the definite policy of the Government in regard to wheat, and that was to establish a compulsory pool. The honorable member for Wimmera was with me in that; he has been generous enough to admit it; and I also called to a conference other honorable members from all parties in this House. They stood by me throughout all the debates on the bill. To the proposal for a compulsory pool were tacked provisions to provide for a guarantee of 4s. a bushel, and if those provisions had become law, there would have been no further difficulty. The responsibility for any failure to give assistance to the wheat-growers of Australia rests, not on the Government, but. on those senators who rejected the first Wheat Marketing Bill. The Government would have been justified in going no further when that bill was defeated, because it represented its definite policy; but., in view of the fact that the farmers were in a very serious plight, and because the Government was anxious to help  them,  the then Acting Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> after conferences with wheat-growers and honorable members opposite, brought down another bill, which provided for a payment of 3s. a bushel. </para>

The Government realizes that the farmers are in a serious plight, and nobody could be more willing than the Government is to provide all the money that is considered necessary to help the farmers out of their difficulty; but we cannot produce money by turning a handle. </para>

              <para>- Earnest representations have been made to the banks that the money should be paid with respect to last year&#39;s wheat. That was the unanimous opinion of the conference that was held recently in Melbourne. But those who are providing the money say that they cannot advance it for last year&#39;s wheat. Therefore, the Government had no option but to accept what it could get. </para>

          <para>No one knows better than the honorable member for Wimmera that, even after the bank would not provide the 3s. a bushel, the Government endeavoured to relieve the farmers by other means. As honora&#39;ble members know, the bill introduced by the Government to provide for a fiduciary note issue was rejected in another place. Had that bill been passed, the Government proposed under it to raise finance to the extent of &#163;6,000,000 for the relief of the wheat-growers, &#163;3,500,000 to be paid in the form of a bounty, and &#163;2,500,000 to be distributed among necessitous farmers. After the rejection of that measure, the original Wheat Marketing Bill was re-introduced, and although it did not provide for a guarantee, if it had been passed, as honorable members opposite admitted when &#91; was discussing the matter with them, it would have enabled the Wheat Board to fix the price of wheat for local consumption which, on the estimate of this season&#39;s production, would have provided the equivalent of a bounty of 6d. a bushel. That would have meant 6d. a bushel in addition to the &#163;3,000,000 proposed to be advanced by the banks, so the farmers of Australia would have received an extra ls. a bushel for their wheat. But the Wheat Marketing Bill was again rejected by the Senate. When the honorable member for Wimmera spoke of the failure of the Government, he might have tried to show that tho responsibility lay at the door of those who frustrated every attempt by the Government to help the farmers. The first and second wheat marketing bills, and the proposal for a fiduciary currency, were rejected by the Senate. </para>

              <para>- Upon the passage of the Government&#39;s fiduciary currency proposal depended the fate of the scheme to raise &#163;6,000,000 for the wheat-growers. That fact was definitely stated in this House by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin).</inline> Those three bills were rejected by the Senate, :ind in regard to the other measure, referred to by the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> in submitting his motion to-day, my reply is that when the Commonwealth Bank was approached for the money, it said that its advice was that it could not constitutionally be protected against loss. I remarked to the honorable member at the recent deputation which he introduced to me, &#34; Suppose you were in my place, and the banks said to you, &#39;We cannot provide this money,&#39; what would you do in the circumstances,&#34; and he replied, &#34; I realize the great difficulty that you are in.&#34; He knows that if he had approached the bank, as the Government had, and if the bank had declined to advance the necessary money, he might have objected, as the Government did ; but, when we get down to tin tacks, what further could have been done? </para>

          <para>The honorable member for Wimmera now has an answer in which the Prime Minister and the Government concur. Everybody can see that it would not be right to build the farmers up with false hopes. They ought to be told definitely, and I wish to make it known to them, that so far as the 33. per bushel is concerned, the position is that the Commonwealth Bank was asked for the money, and it replied that its legal advice was that it should not make it available under the circumstances. I would do anything whatever to relieve the position in which the farmers find themselves to-day. The honorable member for Wimmera admitted at the deputation that I could not have done more than I have done. He has now asked me to make known the present position. My reply is that this Government, in conjunction with the State governments&#39;, has asked the banks to do their &#39;utmost to afford relief, and their response is that they will make &#163;3,000,000 available for distribution on the basis of next season&#39;s crop. That is the most that we can get at the present time. I only wish the amount was three times as great. </para>
          <para>My final word is that this Government had a definite policy in regard to this matter, and has  done  everything humanly possible considering that it has control in only one house of this legislature. Had we had control in both branches of the Parliament, the legislation that we have brought forward with the object of assisting the farmers of Australia would have been passed, and they would now be much better off. The failure in that direction must be placed, not at the door of the Government, but at the door of those who have frustrated every attempt that has been made by the Government to relieve the position. </para>

            <para>.- The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> brought forward and dealt with his motion to-day in terms to which no exception could be taken. He handled the matter &#34;on purely non-party lines, and made an appeal to the Government to come to the assistance of those whom he directly represents. The Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney),</inline> on the other hand, has, as usual, grasped the opportunity to make a purely party political appeal. The whole of his time was devoted to that object, and he has failed to make the position any clearer than it was before he spoke. Such an utterance will not get us anywhere, nor will it afford relief to those for whom the honorable member for Wimmera has made his appeal. That honorable member made absolutely and emphatically clear the serious difficulties under which the wheat-growers are trying to carry on today. He has shown unmistakably that they are not in a position to undertake the harvesting and marketing of the next crop, and has asked the Government to make the &#163;3,000,000, promised by the banks, available in such a way that the&#39; farmers will be able to harvest and market that crop. </para>

              <para>- This assistance is of only a temporary nature, and only touches the fringe of the question. The proposition that has been advanced appeals to me, and I believe that it is a practical one. But it is not sufficient merely to provide &#163;3,000,000 to help the wheat-growers over a temporary difficulty when the market price of wheat is below the cost of production. We have to do something more than meet the position from crop to crop. Honorable members on both-sides of the House have urged that the wheat-growers be put on a better basis for the future. Since the previous proposals of the Government were discussed, it has appointed a secretariat committee on employment and production, and that committee has reported on this very question. After pointing out the serious position of the wheatgrowers - which needs no emphasis - the committee declared that while most export industry was more or less unprofitable at present, it was hoped that much of it would contrive to hold out on credit in the hope of future recovery.

              <para>- That is so. The Minister has argued that it is useless to talk about making money available if there is no responsibility in connexion with it; that we have to go to the banks for it; that it cannot be obtained by the turning of a handle. A little later, however, he indicated that the Government could have raised the required amount in that way, but that the Senate would not provide the handle to turn it out. The committee from whose report I have quoted has made certain recommendations; and those recommendations* have been largely backed up by a conference of Victorian wheat-growers which met at Bendigo recently, and urged that the Federal Government appoint immediately a committee of agricultural and economic experts to -determine the added cost borne by the wheat-growing industry in Australia, due to legislative action in support of sheltered industries; to report on means of reducing handling, transport, and marketing costs; and to determine the assistance required by the growers to return to them the cost of production pending the resultant effect of the recommendations made. </para>

The banks might fairly make the money available to the Commonwealth Government to pay a bounty to the growers of last year&#39;s crop, in accordance with the promise of the Government and the legislation of this Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition was Acting Treasurer in December of last year, and knows what happened then. </para>

That attitude is wrong. The bounty should be paid on last year&#39;s crop,  because many hundreds of the farmers who produced that crop have not an acre under wheat this year. Many were prevented from sowing by the wet season; Others had not the money with which to buy seed and manure. </para>

              <para>- I do not think so. The Wheat Marketing Bill embodied a definite scheme for the marketing and financing of the wheat; the principle of compulsory control, which it contained, is in accordance with the policy of the Labour party. If the Senate had not rejected that measure the necessary money to finance the growers would have been found, the Australian people would not have felt the small levy they would have been required to pay in respect of the exportable surplus, and certainly the wheat-growers,&#34; and the community generally, would have been better off if the primary producers had received an increased price for their grain. Every man must recognize that if the primary producers collapse, business people, workers, and all sections of the community will suffer. Therefore, the aim of the Government is to assist the primary producers in every possible way. Had it had a majority in both chambers the guarantee of 4s. a bushel would have been paid. But as the Minister for Markets pointed out, the Commonwealth Bank shut down absolutely when its legal adviser, who is an opponent of wheat pools and of government enterprises generally, advised that the Wheat Advances Act was not valid. </para>

            <para>The announcement that the Federal Government intends to pay the proposed export bounty on wheat on next year&#39;s crop has caused consternation among growers in the district, and yesterday I forwarded to you a telegram, setting out their disapproval of such a course. The opinion generally held is that as lust year&#39;s crop was the one grown in response to the Government&#39;s appeal to grow more wheat, and was also the crop on which so many promises were made, and none of which were fulfilled, it is only right that any bounty now proposed should be paid on that, and not on the incoming . crop. . Under the present proposal hundreds of wheat-growers will receive nothing whatever, as the extreme wet at sowing time prevented them from getting any crop in. in this district it is safe to say that not more than 30 per cent, of the crop was sown. It also seems certain that if the bounty is to be paid on the exportable surplus it will bc at least fifteen mouths before it can be paid at all, as it is obvious that the wheat must be sold before they know what the exportable surplus is. In fact, so fed up are the growers with the promises of the present Government, that they have made up their minds that if this bounty is to be postponed to next year&#39;s crop it will undoubtedly prove another dud which will be about dud No. 4. Under the circumstances, I have been asked to write to you setting out our opinion on the matter, and would like you to let us know whether anything can be done to have the bounty distributed among last year&#39;s growers. </para>

          <para class="block">I support the request of the honorable mcm her for &#34;Wimmera that the bounty be paid on last year&#39;s crop. There is no difficulty in paying a bounty on production, and it. could be more easily paid on last year&#39;s crop than on that for next season. If the money were made available on, say. the 1st November, in respect of last year&#39;s crop, it would go a long way to pay for cornsacks and- other necessaries to enable the next crop to be harvested. To-day many farmers in all States are in such desperate circumstances that they are unable to purchase cornsacks or other necessary commodities for the next harvest, and they would have appreciated assistance much more this year than in respect of next year&#39;s crop. </para>

Most of last year&#39;s crop has been sold, and, as nearly as we can ascertain, the average price received has been ls. 8d. per bushel, so that, assuming the cost of production to be 4s. per bushel, our growers have lost about 2s. 4d on every bushel reaped.

              <para>- I am convinced that the Government could not have found the money to finance its proposal to pay 4s. per bushel. As a matter of fact, it was unable to operate its later scheme to pay 3s. a bushel, which really was ls. 7&#188;d. per bushel less, because the original proposal provided for 4s. a bushel at country railway stations, whereas the later bill stipulated for the payment of 3s. f.o.b., which, as I have explained, was really 1s. 7id. below the return to be guaranteed to the farmer under the original sell erne. It was the duty of the Government, before introducing those measures, to ascertain definitely if finance could bo made available to meet its obligations. </para>

              <para>- I could understand the reluctance of the Commonwealth Bank to undertake financial responsibility in respect of a product that has already been sold; no doubt it is this objection that prompted the bank to take up the present attitude. But I cannot dispel from my mind the lurking thought that, in this debate honorable&#39; members opposite wish it to be inferred that the Government is not sincere in its endeavours to help our wheat-growers. The failure of the Government- to give effect to- its proposals has been due largely to the legal objections raised by the Deputy Loader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Latham) whose attitude in this chamber profoundly influenced the members of another place in rejecting the bill which provided for the payment of a guaranteed price of 4s. per bushel to our wheatgrowers. It is, however, significant that the financial policy for which the honorable gentleman and his supporters stand has been abandoned now by almost every European country. The Commonwealth must, if we are to assist our wheatgrowers, come into line with them. If the fiduciary notes issue proposal had been adopted, it -would have been possible for the Government, with the assistance of the banking institutions, to provide the necessary finance to maintain the solvency of our wheat-growers. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I am prepared, at all times, to justify the Government with respect to the many measures which it has introduced in the interests of our primary producers. Since the rejection of its original proposal, despite the fact that finance could not be obtained for the payment of a guarantee of 3s. per bushel, the banking institutions of this country are making credit available to the extent of &#163;32,000,000 to maintain the solvency of the nation, and I now submit that, if the Government&#39;s original scheme had been adopted, and if credit had been allowed to flow in the ordinary channels of commerce, the actual measure of inflation necessary would have been less than half that which has taken place since then. The policy adopted by the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks is in accordance with the financial ideas of the majority constituting the Opposition in the Senate. The banks have maintained the solvency of our governments to the. extent qf &#163;50,000,000, but have, at the same time, withdrawn from industry credit necessary for the maintenance of employment and the solvency of those engaged in our primary avocations. Responsibility for the maintenance of that policy, and for the rejection of the Government&#39;s financial proposals, rests with those in this House, and especially with the Opposition in another place. Had the necessary additional note issue been authorized, it would have been possible for the Government, without unduly straining the credit of the country, to pay our farmers 4s. per bushel for their wheat, &#39;and so to have assured their solvency. Reference has been made to the &#39; fact, that at a recent meeting of farmers in Bendigo, a resolution was carried in favour of a fiduciary note issue with a view to financing next season&#39;s wheat crop. But what is the position to-day? The British &#163;1 note is worth only 15s. In other words, there has been an inflation of British currency to the extent of 25 per cent. This will affect all sales of Australian primary production. </para>
          <para>The depreciation of British sterling to the extent of 25 per cent, will increase the purchasing power of those who buy our primary products. If we had departed from the orthodox methods of finance by adopting the scheme outlined in the proposal to pay our wheatgrowers 4s. per bushel, would not that have increased the purchasing power of our consumers, so that our farmers, and our wool-growers, would have received higher prices for their products? The members of the Opposition party, and some members, of the Country party, so far as the guarantee of 3s. is concerned, together with the Senate, must accept responsibility for the position in which our people are to-day. I am as familiar with the position of our farmers as is any other member of this House. Not long ago, a farmer in my district, when about to commence hay-cutting, applied to the Rural Industries Board for three bales of twine, but because his credit was absolutely exhausted, his application was rejected. The desperate position in which that farmer, in company with thousands more in the various States find themselves, is largely due to the action of members of another place in rejecting this Government&#39;s legislative proposals for the maintenance of our credit and the solvency of our people. It is high time that we ceased worshipping this fetish of the gold reserve, the calamitous effects of which have been evident in the Mother Country ever since the House of Commons, in 1925, passed a measure authorizing the return to the gold standard. That measure brought Great Britain, as well as other countries which followed the example of the Mother Country, to a condition bordering on bankruptcy. </para>

            <para>.- The honorable member who has just re sumed his seat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibbons),</inline> has had much to say in criticism of those who were responsible for the rejection of the Government&#39;s proposal to pay our farmers a guaranteed price of 4s. per bushel. In that regard I have only to remark that they would have been still better off had the Government been able to honour the other impossible promise of 6s. 6d. per bushel made by the honorable member during the 1929 elections. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The temperate speech of the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart),</inline> and the moderation of his proposals certainly deserve more sympathetic consideration than has been given to them byMinisters .and government supporters. I except the sympathetic reply given by the Minister for Health, but the Minister for Markets seemed to take the attitude that, because two of the colleagues of the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> voted against the first wheat pool, the Government was absolved from even considering any proposals emanating from the Country party. For my part, I make no pretence that I ever gave any support to the compulsory pool proposal. When the Government found that the strength of opinion was against , it, there was, in my opinion, an obligation upon it to find other means of helping the farmers. &#34; I believe that when the Government introduced the Wheat Advances&#39; Bill it made an honest effort to help the farmers. There was, on the whole, a sincere attempt by honorable members in all parts of the House to discover a &#34;way by which help could be given to this hard-pressed section of primary producers. While I admit that the Government on that occasion showed some goodwill, and a sincere desire to help, I cannot go so far as to say that it went about the matter efficiently. The Minister has stated that there was a consultation between the Government and the Commonwealth Bank Board before the bill was passed. It is evident from the speech of the Minister who introduced the bill just what was the extent of the consultation. </para>

          <para>The bill provides for a guaranteed price of 3s. per bushel for wheat of the 1930-31 season, of f.a.q. quality, less dockage in respect of wheat below f.a.q. quality. </para>
          <para>So now we know how much consultation there was. The Minister was apparently leaving it to chance. Honorable members on this side of the House are complaining, not that the Minister did not jump before he came to the stile, but that when hecame to it he lay down in front of it. The Minister for Markets has said that the  chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Boardstated that it would be contrary to the provisions of the Constitution for the bank to make the advances according to the terms of the bill; whereas the Minister who represented him when the bill was introduced stated subsequently that the hitch occurred because of the manner in which the bill was drafted, or words to that effect. I know that the bill was drafted in a great hurry during the last few days before the Christmas recess; but, if a mistake had been made, it could have been corrected. That is what honorable members on this side of the House complain of. We do not particularly enjoy calling attention to the shuffling which has been indulged in by members of the Government; we want to see whether anything can be done to make good the Government&#39;s omission. This sort of bungling is merely increasing the misery and destitution prevailing in the farming districts. </para>
          <para>I have before me newspaper reports of statements made by the Minister between the 17th December, when the bill was finally passed by both Houses of Parliament, and the time when the measure was finally abandoned by the Government instead of being amended. During that interval marketing conditions in Australia became chaotic. Nobody knew what was going to happen. A great many farmers held their wheat while the price was falling as much as 3d. and 4d. a bushel. I know neighbours of mine to whom the loss of those few pence a bushel made all the difference between solvency and being placed in a position in which they could carry on only at the mercy of their creditors. There is undoubtedly an obligation on this Parliament to make good some of the losses incurred by the farmers. </para>
          <para>I do not entirely agree with the honorable member for Wimmera that it would be justifiable to divert the money which the banks are able to make available from a bounty on next year&#39;s crop to a payment in respect of lastyear&#39;s crop. In my own district the crops were good last year, but in some other districts that was not the case, while there are good prospects this year. On the other hand, there are districts where no crops have been sown this year on account of floods. It is important- that the farmers should be given to understand that funds will be available for marketing and fallowing expenses, ana that those who make the money available should be given a reasonable assurance that they will get their money back. </para>

              <para>- I believe that it would be a better economic proposition for the country to make the money available in such a way as to enable the farmers to keep going. If it is paid on last year&#39;s wheat, I am afraid that the great bulk of it will merely go to the farmers&#39; present creditors, and will not help the growers for the future. Of course, in those cases in which the farmers had a good crop last year, but have been unable to sow this year because of floods, it would be not only just, but also a good business proposition, to divert a portion of the funds to a payment in respect of last year&#39;s crop, so that the farmers may have finance for fallowing this spring, and for seeding next year. </para>

I remind honorable members that the Government promised to raise &#163;18,000,000 to relieve distress; &#163;6,000,000 to be allocated to the farmers, and &#163;12,000,000 to relieving unemployment. I represent a city electorate, and I know something of the hardship occasioned by unemployment. There are 110,000 persons on the dole in New South Wales, and the number is increasing. . It is necessary that the Government should obtain money to solve the unemployment, problem, and it is desirable that it should get assistance from the banks. </para>

              <para>- The Government promised to provide work for the unemployed. It tried to get the money from the banks for this purpose, and it failed. I do not blame it for that. A bill was passed through this House, and submitted to another place, which rejected it. I am pleased to learn that the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> favours the proposal to issue bonds to help the farmers out of their difficulties. In my opinion, neither the wheat-farmers nor the unemployed can be effectively helped unless we have an emergency currency. The gold standard has been proved to be a myth. As a matter of fact, we have had no gold standard for years. The banks oppose the issue of an emergency currency, but there is plenty of wealth in the country to back such an issue. If, at the present time, I had a property worth &#163;12,000 or &#163;15,000, the banks would probably not advance me anything on it. They are tying up credit. The farming community is suffering from the same thing, the banks having foreclosed on many farmers, who have been put off their land. There is loud complaint because the farmers have been forced off their land; but. in the cities thousands of persons have been put out of their homes, and are living&#39; in camps. The Government has a responsibility towards these people. We must strike out on new lines. We cannot content ourselves with saying that we have had a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, which carried certain resolutions that cannot be put into effect because the banks -will not agree. We are in the midst of a crisis, and must grapple with it, and one way of doing this is to increase the currency issue. If war were declared to-morrow we should not hesitate to do it. If we would be justified in issuing new currency to defend the country, surely now that the country is over-run by a vast army of unemployed, we would be justified in adopting similar measures. I sympathize with the man on the land. I know the bad position he is in, and my vote went in favour of giving him a guarantee of 4s. a bushel for his wheat. Unfortunately, that projectwas rejected by another place, to its everlasting disgrace. Had that 4s. a bushel  been granted and the money put into circulation, the farmer would have benefited, and Australia would have overcome many of its difficulties. </para>

              <para>- It could have been found. It is strange that any honorable member should claim that Australia is too poor to give a guarantee to find a few million pounds to pay for wealth produced by the country. Certain hon-  orable members are too prone to utter jeremiads decrying their country. Had the Labour party a majority in both Houses, 4s. a bushel would have been paid to the farmers. I believe that the primary producers of Australia could be relieved of much of their distress if we expanded our currency and increased the purchasing power of the community. </para>

On the other hand, it has, through the medium of tariff schedules, loaded them with staggering burdens. Hitherto, the farmers have been mulcted in order to provide for the people of the .cities. To-day the farmers have nothing: consequently there is much unemployment in the metropolitan areas. The man on the land is over-burdened,  30  our cities are languishing. Yet the Government persists in placing further penalties upon the farmers to provide profits for Lysaght Limited and such concerns, while it neglects to fulfil its promises to our primary producers. No other government in the world has been guilty of more disgraceful conduct&#39;. </para>

The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> complained that </para>

          <para class="block">Although <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Government declared that it could provide 4s. a bushel for wheat iri the early part of 1930, it was unable to find 3s. a bushel in December of that year. The reason is that early in 1930 wheat was bringing from 4s. to 4s. 6d, a bushel, whereas in December it had; dropped to 2s. 6d. a bushel. I cannot, understand why honorable members opposite persist in nullifying&#39; the efforts of the Government on behalf of a community so worthy of assistance. I fully believe that the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> is sincere in his desire to help the farmers, but it must be recognized that it is quite impossible to persuade the Commonwealth Bank to provide 3s. a bushel for wheat at this juncture. The Government has exploited every avenue in an endeavour to assist the farmers. It introduced a Fiduciary Notes Bill. Honorable members opposite found fault with that. They know very well that it was no wildcat scheme, but that it would have returned a tenfold benefit to and indirectly assisted many unemployed workers in Australia. The Government is on the eve of making another endeavour to assist the wheat-farmers. It realizes that the scheme will not do half as much as is needed, but it is the best that can be done now. One great drawback is that prices have fallen disastrously. I am confident that when they are restored to something like normal, Australia will hark back &#39;to the good times. Until then, our path will continue to be bestrewn with difficulties. All should do their utmost honestly to assist the farmers and the  country generally. I urge honorable members from now on to set aside party issues and endeavour to make brighter the lot of our primary producers. </para>

In all the circumstances, I regret I am unable to. provide for the relief desired. </para>

            <para>. - The duties recommended in each of these cases are similar. The duties on the machinery covered by sub-item 176 f 1 were 45 per cent., 55 per cent, and 60 per cent.&#39; under the 1921-28 tariff, and those now proposed are 55 per cent., 65 per cent, and 75 per cent., respectively, the increases thus being 10 per cent. British and intermediate, and 15 per cent, general. The additional imposts have been designed for the purpose of rehabilitating one of our principal key industries which has fallen on very evil times, The engineering industry has never been in such a perilous condition since the inception of federation, and as it is of very great importance to Australia, it is desirable that it should be afforded adequate protection. Whenever a depression occurs the engineering industry is the first to be hit hard. The history of the present depression shows that the first section of industry to-&#34; be adversely affected is that which has to do with capital costs. The installation of machinery is, of course, capital expenditure involved in establishing a factory. Machinery production is essentially concerned in capital costs. The conditions that have been created by the tariff are such that with the upward trend of prices, due to a trade recovery, there should be a considerable expansion in machinery manufacturing in Australia. The upward trend in the prices of our exportable products will make more money available for industry, and this will enable manufacturers to buy machinery. An examination of the conditions of the machinery trade, even during the depression, shows that machinery manufacturers have received orders for aconsiderable quantity of machinery which will be needed for the manufacture of goods which have been granted adequate protection. Take, for example, the manufacture of wireless sets. The prohibition of the importation of wireless sets into Australia has caused great activity in the local factories which manufacture these sets, and they have placed orders for the machinery they need to turn out sets to meet the demand. The tariff has definitely enabled machinery manufacturers to widen their range of designs and types of. machinery. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As the result of my inspection of many factories throughout Australia, I have learned that manufacturers generally are well satisfied with the efficiency of Australian-made machines. The average man in the street has no conception of the wide range of machinery that is being manufactured in Australia. It was a revelation to me to find that such a high percentage of the machinery in operation in our factories lias been made here. </para>
          <para>The granting of adequate protection to the engineering industry must have an immediate effect on other key industries, such as the coal, iron and steel, copper and  timber industries, all of which are closely allied to our engineering enterprises, and depend on them, to a large extent, for prosperity. The engineering industry as a whole has been subjected to very keen competition by overseas manufacturers. A large amount of the work obtained by engineering establishments throughout the Commonwealth of late years has been secured as the result of the policy adopted by government departments, semi-government bodies, and municipal councils of granting a measure of preference to local tenderers when deciding to&#39; let contracts. The preferences accorded have usually, amounted to from 5 per cent, to 15 per cent, over and above the duty payable under the tariff. This policy is very patriotic. That additional degree of preference has frequently made all the difference in determining whether particular work would be done in the Commonwealth or overseas. A large number of establishments have been kept supplied . with work on account of the additional preference extended to them in this way by government bodies. But owing to the curtailment of loan moneys, government expenditure throughout Australia has been reduced to a minimum, with the result that our engineering establishments have been affected more than any others. It is now essential that this industry should obtain orders from private firms which, in the past, have, in a large number of cases, shown a distinct apathy towards the local metal working trade when they have required machinery for the extension of their factories or for replacement purposes. This disinclination on the part of private enterprise to purchase its requirements from local machinery manufacturers is not new. It has been our experience, unfortunately, that while certain private firms desire 100 per cent, protection in respect of their products, they also wish to be free to b uy the equipment for their factories in , any country in the world. </para>

              <para>- It has been the practice for manufacturers generally to ask for adequate protection for their products, and for freedom to buy their machinery in Germany, the United States of America, or any other foreign country. Many firms have shown a complete ignorance of the fact that much of the machinery that they required could be produced in Australia. Often manufacturers have learned only when they have applied for the admission of certain machinery under departmental by-law, that three or four Australian engineering firms could provide their requirements, and have been manufacturing such machinery for a number of years. The Tariff Board, in its annual report for 1927, commented upon . this subject in the following words: - </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline>was Minister for Trade and Customs for about twelve months, and was conversantwith the apathy shown by many Australian manufacturers to the welfare of the Australian engineering industry. There has always been a tendency to place machinery orders abroad. With manufacturers who will not support local industries, the current of protection flows in one direction only. It is useless to appeal to them to change their policy, particularly as a 5 per cent, or 10 per cent, difference in price in favour of an overseas machine has, in a large number of cases, been a sufficient reason for them to refuse to patronize the local industry. The only method by which they can be brought to a realization of their duty to other Australian industries is to increase the duty and compel them to support the local - machinery manufacturers. </para>
          <para>In the engineering industry the proportion of labour to material is very high, the approximate average ratio being 70 per cent, to 30 per cent. The industry, therefore, offers potential employment to a large number of skilled Australian workmen. The skill and efficiency of the Australian artisan is beyond question, and the Government, therefore, feels that it is incumbent upon it to take such measures as will provide work for them.

              <para>- Machinery covered by item 176 f 1. Motor cars are not included. The value of the machinery admitted under by-law in 1929-30 was &#163;1,163,636, or 43.3 per cent, of the total. These figures indicate that when definite evidence is produced that necessary machinery cannot be commercially manufactured in the Commonwealth, the Minister does not hesitate to exercise the power conferred upon him by Parliament to admit it at concessional rates of duty. On the basis of the 1929-30 importations, after deducting the value of machinery admitted under by-law, there existed a potential market for Australian machinery manufacturers to the value of &#163;1,500,000. Through the imposition of these increased rates of duty the Government trusts that this trade will be diverted to the Australian engineering industry. </para>

          <para>With respect to item 178D, &#34; motive power machinery and appliances, excepting electric,&#34; the duties were increased from 45 per cent. British, 55 per cent, intermediate, 60 per cent, general, to 55 per cent. British, 65 per cent, intermediate, and 75 per cent, general. The importations under this heading in 1928- 29 totalled &#163;1,048,386, and in 1929- 30, &#163;1,139,290. This sub-item now includes goods previously covered by subitems 178B and 178 c of the 1921-28 tariff. These goods comprise cylindrical boilers, water tube boilers, furnaces for boilers, gas producers, steam condensers, and ships&#39; propellers. From an analysis of the importation figures, it has been ascertained that, of the total value of the importations for 1928-29, machinery to the value of &#163;248,089 was admitted under departmental by-law either free of duty or at a duty of 10 per cent. This figure represents 26 per cent, of the value of total importations. For the year 1929 the value of the machinery admitted under by-law was &#163;390,374, representing 34.2 per cent, of the total value of the importations. These figures indicate that the by-law provisions of the tariff are sympathetically administered, when it can be shown that machinery of the type under consideration cannot be commercially manufactured in Australia. If an importer applies to the Minister or to the Comptroller-General of Customs with respect to importations, an officer of the Department of Trade and Customs is instructed to ascertain whether machinery of the typeproposed to be imported can be manufactured in Australia. If that officer finds that it can be commercially manufactured in the Commonwealth, he submits a report to that effect to the tariff branch. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> knows as well as I do what is meant by those words. The head of the tariff branch of the Customs Department then submits a recommendation to the Minister, stating whether in his opinion such machinery should . be admitted under departmental by-law, or whether the duties stipulated under the tariff should be imposed. In view of the substantial quantity of the machinery, admitted under departmental by-laws, it should be evident to honorable members that a sympathetic view is taken with respect to such importations without in any way depriving Australian manufacturers of the protection which Parliament intends should be afforded to them. After deducting the value of the machinery admitted under departmental by-laws for 1929-30, a total of 748,000 remains. As, this machinery can be manufactured in the Commonwealth, the Government has imposed the increased rates with the intention of forcing purchasers to obtain their requirements in the Commonwealth. As previously mentioned, it requires, in a large majority of cases, an increase of 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, in the rates to divert this trade to the Australian engineering industry, which the Government is determined to do. As the ex-Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> said to a gathering of Australian manufacturers in 1929, while many of these people require adequate protection for the commodities they manufacture, they are prepared to absolutely disregard the Australian manufactures of the goods they require for their own equipment. 1 trust that this item will receive the support of a majority of the committee. </para>

            <para>.- I am. glad to learn that it is the intention of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> to include the discussion of this subitem, which relates to motive power machinery and appliances with machinery included in other sub-items, as I am thus afforded an opportunity to test the feelings of the committee on the question of extending greater preference to Great Britain. Everything that the Minister has said indicates the wisdom of dealing with this item in the manner that I shall indicate in an amendment which I intend to move. If that amendment is carried, it will force the Government . to re-classify all these sub-items, and will thus ensure that machinery of the type covered is really being manufactured commercially in Australia. If, it is not, it should be placed in a separate item instead of being grouped in what may be termed a nondescript collection. The Minister said that during the year 192S-29 roughly 43 per cent, of the machinery imported into Australia under sub-item 176 r was admitted into Australia free of duty. That is to say, that the Customs Department, after carrying out the fullest investigation, admitted that the equipment was not being manufactured in this country. A careful investigation of the whole position would show that fully one-half of the remaining 57 per cent, should also have been admitted free of duty for the same reason*, that should be dont if Australian industries are to be cheaply and efficiently equipped. I hope the committee will adopt the amendment I propose to move, under which the rates would be 25 per cent. British, 55 per cent, intermediate, and 60 per cent, general, instead of the existing rates of 55 per cent. British, 65 per cent, intermediate, and 70 per cent, general. The adoption of that amendment would necessitate a reclassification of these sub-items. </para>

              <para>- I am satisfied, from my own investigation, that, in view of the peculiar circumstances which have since arisen, this Parliament must reduce the duties in the interests of the Commonwealth and of Great Britain. What is the present position in Great Britain ? It is one of great difficulty. &#39; Great Britain has been forced off the gold standard, and is experiencing great trouble in providing employment for over 2,000,000 persons in that country now out of work. Great Britain can speedily be placed upon a better economic basis by those units which comprise the British Empire diverting to Great Britain the maximum volume of trade that is possible at this juncture. Not only can Great Britain be assisted out of her present difficulties, but I venture to- assert that, by the adoption of the proposal I am now submitting with respect to the duties on machinery, the dominions and other pol tions of the Empire can also be assisted to overcome the financial and economic problems now confronting them. The British Empire, which controls onequarter of the world&#39;s services and has one-quarter of the world&#39;s population within its territory, produces 70 per cent, of the total production of gold, 60 per cent, of rubber, 47 per cent, of tin, and 90 per cent, of nickel, as well as immense quantities of other raw materials. The British Empire, while endowed with such magnificent resources in the matter of raw materia^ finds herself short of &#163;100,000.000 worth of gold to meet her external short-term indebtedness. We must develop and manufacture customs machinery required by the whole of the Empire, in order to utilize the resources of the Empire, and thus ensure that in each of the dominions, especially in Australia, we have the machinery to enable them to utilize these resources to the best possible advantage. </para>

              <para>- Great Britain was the leader of the great industrial revolution, and is one of the principal producers of metals and machinery.  Her  scientists and inventors have been the leaders in practically all the mechanical development that has taken place throughout the world. In Australia we need cheap and efficient mechanical equipment, and we can get it. The figures quoted by the Minister show conclusively that we have to import a great deal of the machinery required in (.his country. An extraordinary feature of the figures quoted is that for many years the quantity of machinery n.e.i. has remained practically stationary, showing that a continual market is developing for this particular class of machinery in Australia that is not covered by local Manufacture. The inclusion of items 174, 404, 405 and &#34;219 in the schedule was made to -ensure that particular types not manufactured commercially .in Australia shall be admitted free of duty. That principle is recognized in our customs tariff, and I am now suggesting that we shall carry out the principles to the fullest possible extent. &#34;What is the position with respect to the importation of machinery? Very high duties are imposed, and as a result only those articles which are not being commercially manufactured in Australia are imported. Yet in 1929-30 we imported no less than &#163;.14,730,000 worth of machinery. </para>

              <para>- I am referring  in  ( he value of the whole of the machinery imported, as set out in the customs figures and classification. If we dissect the figures we find that, of the &#163;10,600,000 imported under one group, Great Britain secured only 34 per cent, of the trade, but nf the &#163;4,069,000 worth under another group she secured 81 per cent, of the trade. I am satisfied that if our tariff schedule were amended in the direction I suggest Great Britain would receive a decided advantage and would be able materially to increase her proportion in that big group of which she now only receives 34 per cent. I shall point out shortly how the position could be materially improved tinder this particular item. Although the figures from which I am quoting are not so complete as those which the Minister used, I find that the total importations of machinery in 1928-29 were valued at C1,S0S:000, of which Great Britain supplied &#163;853,000 <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> foreign countries &#163;955,000. </para>

              <para>- Although 45 per cent, of that trade was obtained by Great Britain, I believe that, under a revised tariff schedule, fully one-half of the r&#39;mainder could also be supplied by the Mother Country. In this belief I am supported by the opinion of British manufacturers, who contend that by an amendment of the tariff they could obtain a large proportion of the trade. It is quite evident that some of this machinery has been manufactured in Australia only because it has been too costly to import it; but as I previously stated, the value of importations has not varied to any extent, year by year. There is every reason that at this particular juncture we should endeavour to give Great Britain &#39;.... maximum share of our trade, li. 1927-28 the total importations under thi.&#39; particular item, so far as I have been able to gai ker, were valued at &#163;1,559,000, of which Great Britain supplied &#163;840,000 worth, mid foreign countries &#163;719,000 worth, as compared with the subsequent year in which Great Britain supplied &#163;853,000 worth and foreign countries &#163;955,000 worth. In that, period Great Britain&#39;s exports of machinery to Australia decreased from over 50 per cent to less than 45 per cent. &#34;When 1 came to examine the items I found that in 3927-38 there Was admitted free of duty &#163;332,000 worth of machinery out of Great Britain&#39;s contribution of &#163;840,000. and &#163;265,000 worth out of .7.19,000 worth imported from foreign countries-, and that the duty paid totalled well over 50 pgr cent, on the remainder. What is the result? This machinery was noi really competing with ordinary Australian machinery. It had to <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> bought overseas; but, as a result of these high duties, such machinery installed in Australian shops has actually been overcapitalized to the extent of 50 per cent. The effect has been to increase production costs generally and the cost of establishing new industries. It has also meant an increase in the prices at which good? generally can be sold in Australia. </para>

              <para>- I am not discussing the fairness or otherwise of the customs officials. 1 am arguing that the officials and the Government - and not&#39; merely this Government, because the figures I am quoting relate also to the period when the Bruce-Page Government was in power - should not be put in an unfair position in regard to these matters. There should be a proper reclassification of the items so that the attitude of the customs officials should be perfectly clear to every one, and if Australian manufacturers could successfully establish their claim to be able to manufacture certain machines commercially in Australia, they could have special items in the tariff schedule protecting their machines. That would be the right way to manage the business. The present system puts an undue and unjustifiable strain upon the intelligence, ability, and capacity of the Minister for Trade and Customs and his staff. In this connexion I am speaking of governments in general. The more I have seen of the matter, the more I am satisfied that this change should have been made earlier, and the more I regret that the late Government did not do what T am now advocating. It did take steps to make certain goods duty free under bylaw. What I am saying now is not in condemnation of the Government or the officials; I am merely indicating what I think should be done. When we find that &#62;i course we have been following is unduly penalizing the industries of Australia by piling up their costs, it is useless to continue upon it, particularly at a time when prices are falling. </para>

              <para>- The Customs Department is quite capable of seeing that the law is obeyed in that direction. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten</inline> was Minister foi Trade and Customs, he made certain that goods purporting to be British would be British in fact, by insisting that 75 per cent, of the value must be of British origin. </para>

          <para>Of the total value of &#163;4,572,000 worth of goods imported from Britain in the year of which I am speaking, &#163;1,226,000 worth was imported duty free, leaving &#163;3,300,000 worth on which over 50 per cent, duty was paid. In the last seven years approximately &#163;100,000,000 worth of machinery has been imported to establish and equip new industries in Australia with capital plant. The Labour party talks about the adverse trade balance. If it would look at the page of the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> on which the trade figures are given, it would find that the Statistician says that the adverse trade balance is largely offset by the introduction of private capital due to the establishment of new industries because of the protective policy which was being pursued during the period of which I am speaking. The adverse trade balance is really more than covered by the new machinery imported, which as the Statistician points out, has not yet had the opportunity to produce exports commensurate with ii&#62; capital cost. Nor could we expect ii to do so immediately. The additional capital cost of installing thi? machinery in Australia over its actual cost in the country of origin&#39; was &#163;45,000,000, leading naturally to an increase in the cost of goods generally.  extra transport charges, and extra wages. I should like to illustrate the point by quoting some figures relating to the export mutton trade. This is one of our great industries, and. one we must extend, yet, because of the increase in the general cost of living, as the result of the over-capitalization of our industries by the imposition of these high duties, the cost of exporting mutton has increased by 6G per cent, since pre-war years, making if, almost impossible for the man who is growing sheep to carry on an export trade at a profit. It is worth while to try to ascertain how the increase in cost has been brought about. Not long ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tout,</inline> speaking in Sydney, pointed out that the cost of shipping J 2,000 sheep from the station to London was &#163;3,668, or 6s. 1&#189;d. per carcass, in 1914. whereas in 1930 the cost was &#163;6,15S, or 10s. 3d. per carcass, an increase of 66 per cent. The details are exceedingly interesting, and are also relevant to the other item which the Minister is including in this discussion. They are set out in the following table: - </para>

              <para>- The machinery used in freezing works is charged the exorbitant duty of 50 per cent. The Tariff Board has reported that locomotives made in Australia cost 20 per cer.t. more than the imported locomotives, on which duty has been paid. One of the causes of this high cast is the high cost of installing machinery in the various shops which turn out locomotives. Throughout the whole gamut of costs generally we find that they are increased by reason of the fact that the capital cost of the machinery installed to make goods for general use in Australia, whether for export or local consumption, has been enlarged, and as the result the costs are ever so much higher. </para>

Otherwise, why should it be necessary to import &#163;42,000,000 worth of machinery and manufactured metals, and pay such a heavy duty upon it, when there was a reduction of imports generally amounting to &#163;20,000,000 ? Why should the Minister have admitted 43 per cent, of the importations duty free? He did so because there was no chance of having it manufactured in Australia. </para>

It will be found that Great Britain imports 43 per cent, of it? machine tools, because it does not pay  ii  to specialize in those particular lines.  Iti  the year before last Germany sent 6,263 tons of machine tools into Belgium, 7,193 tons into Great Britain, and 11,854 tons into Prance.

              <para>- In looking through the tariff, one sees the need for a complete reclassification of the duties.For instance, there is a duty of 60 per cent, an die heads. Nobody makes die heads in Australia, yet dies should be made here as cheaply as possible.For blacksmiths&#39; hammers, a special steel is required, and it does not pay to make them in Australia, yet the heavy duty of 60 per cent, is imposed on them. Onbrickmaking machinery there is an impost of 65 per cent. No doubt  a  reduction of that duty would bring down the cost of bricks and the cost of houses and so stimulate the building trade. A plant costing &#163;51,000 at a European port was required in Australia for the purpose of converting coal into fuel oil. We do not produce oil at the present time, and the plant to which I refer was a complete one, yet&#34; an average duty of 60 per cent, was imposed, because certain parts of the plant could be made in Australia. Owing to those heavy duties that industry has not been established, and a tremendous economic waste continues. On a great proportion of the imported machine tools used in Australia high rates of duty are charged, despite the fact that there is a special provision in the tariff for admitting, them duty free if they cannot bo commercially made in this country, and it is not possible to convince the Minister that they cannot be made here economically. Many articles that are admitted practically duty free at the present time could be made here commercially if the necessary machinery for their manufacture were allowed in free of duty. The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> referred to certain stamping machinery, and pointed out that a statement by men who had not seen that type of machinery that it could be commercially made in Australia hud prevented the establishment of a local industry. The object of the amendment that I am about to submit is to extend tariff preference to Great Britain, to a much greater degree than has been possible in- the past,by reducing the British preferential ruth. That would force a reclassificationof the series of sub-items with which the committee is now dealing. If an articlecould be made in Australia, it should be put into a special class for duty purposes, and articles that cannot be made commercially in this country should be admitted duty free.

            <para>.- I support the amendment. It seems to me that these duties, which were too high_ before, and which will be still higher if the rates in the schedule are agreed to, are the last that should be increased at the present time. If there is one thing that should be as cheap as possible in Australia it is the machinery of production, whether in the factory or on the farm, because it is highly desirable that the overhead costs of manufacture and production should be kept as low as possible. When a new enterprise is started in Australia, and a person wishes to manufacture goods which have never been made here before, he naturally looks -round for the best type of machinery for the purpose, but he is tremendously handicapped, in many cases, by the Customs Department.He begins with the initial handicap of having to pay a good deal more than is charged in any other country for the cementused in thefloor of his factory, for the glass in the windows, and for the iron on the roof. On proceeding to install his machinery,he finds, possibly, that Great Britain is the best place in which to buy the particular plant required, or, if his purpose be to establish a fruit-canning factory, for example, he may find that the United States of America is the only country in which efficient machinery of the desired type can be obtained. Then, because a particular engineer who has probably never seen such a plant before, and could not guarantee that a similar plant made in Australia would work satisfactorily, declares that such a machine could be produced in this country, the business man has to choose between a plant which could not be guaranteed to work satisfactorily and an imported plant on which the duties are - 55 per cent. British preferential, 65 per cent, intermediate, and 75 per cent. general. The heavy duty on machinery has brought about the failure of many an enterprise that should have resulted in the establishment in Australia of a new industry. I shall give a concrete illustration. </para>

          <para>The fishmeal industry nourishes in Europe. In Germany, so much of this material is used for stock food that the local supply is insufficient to meet the demand, about 100,000 tons being imported annually. I understand that this meal is made from the cheaper classes of fish, and also from fish offal. Proposals for the establishment of the fishmeal industry were made recently in, I believe, more than one State, but they have been abandoned, owing to the particular duties which we are now discussing, despite the fact that the makers of the plant required - a British firm - were prepared to take three-fourths of the payments in fishmeal, which could have been exported after the plant was in operation. Yet, we have such a distorted sense of proportion, apparently, that we throw away <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> mackerel to catch a sprat. In order to provide a little temporary employment for a few men in the engineering trade, we lose an opportunity for the establishment of an industry which would provide work for a larger number of persons.  Owing to the general depression, the fishing industry is in sore straits. A considerable section of the public are now unable to purchase fish, being compelled to depend on cheaper forms of food, and the demand for fish has fallen off to such an extent that fishermen have been forced to restrict their catches. If the fishmeal industry were now in existence - and I claim that it would have been established, had the tariff in. respect of the machinery required been administered in a sane way - those fishermen who find difficulty in making a living to-day would have had an additional outlet for a consider able part of their catch. Those who contemplated establishing the industry required a plant capable of processing 25  ton3  of fishmeal per day. They approached the Customs Department, and asked whether they would be permitted to bring the plant in from Great Britain duty free. They stated that they believed that such a plant had never been made in Australia before, while it was being manufactured satisfactorily in Great Britain, and could be guaranteed to give the desired results. The cost of the plant f.o.b. Great Britain was &#163;3,150, and it was capable of processing 25 tons of fishmeal daily. The Customs Department made inquiries, and it was- ascertained that certain engineering firms in Australia were of the opinion that they could make some parts of this plant, such as elevators and so forth. Naturally, the British makers were not prepared to guarantee that the plant would work satisfactorily unless they provided the whole of the parts; nobody could blame them for that. A good deal of correspondence ensued between the promoters of the enterprise and the Customs Department, but I shall not weary the committee by reading the letters. The department held the view that as some parts of the plant could be made in this country, duty would have to be paid on it if it were obtained from Great Britain. I shall show the committee what the increased price  would  have been if the present duties of 55 per cent., 65 per cent., and 75 per cent, on &#34; Machinery n.e.i. &#34; had been paid. I have already remarked that the f.o.b. price of the plant in Great Britain was &#163;3,150. Freight and insurance would have amounted to &#163;588; the duty under the British preferential rate of 55 per cent., &#163;1,906; the primage duty of 10 per cent., &#163;346 ; the duty of 20 per cent, on the cost of packing, &#163;30; the landing  and delivery charges, &#163;75 ; the exchange at 30&#163; per cent., &#163;1,140; and the sales tax of 6 per cent., &#163;434. That would have brought the total cost to &#163;7,669. Some of these items, such as insurance, landing and delivery charges, would have been the same if the plant had been admitted duty free. Part of the sales tax would have been charged, but it would not have amounted to nearly so much if  these duties had not been imposed, because the sales tax is assessed on the total cost, including all the duties. The price that the plant would have cost was so great that the project for the manufacture of fishmeal in Australia was abandoned. I believe that the dried fish weighs only about one-fourth qf the raw material; therefore, about 100 tons of fish would have been required daily to produce 25 tons of fishmeal. </para>

              <para>- It was claimed that certain parts could be made here, if the specifications were given. But specifications could not be supplied. It was known that a plant capable of producing 25 tons of fishmeal daily was required, but they did not know the exact measurements of&#34; the machine. Strangely enough, the Department of Trade and Customs would not permit them to import one plant so that it might be copied by Australian engineers, and thus make possible the building of further plants in Australia. The following letter was written to the Controller-General of Customs on the 6th July last by the firm who desired to import this machine: - </para>

            <para>The correspondence submitted by us discloses that this plant is not, and, under present conditions of small demand, cannot be, commercially made in Australia. The number of plants which might be used in this country would not be sufficient to reimburse local manufacturers for their preliminary expenses, such as the cost of patterns, dies, &#38;c, or to repay the cost of drawings provided by overseas manufacturers. </para>
            <para>Moreover, a first Australian-made plant could hardly be completed in less than eighteen months, and meanwhile large numbers of fishermen would continue to suffer unemployment. Moreover, the number of men employed in manufacturing the plant in Australia would be comparatively tew - probably not more thantwenty, which figure bears no comparison with the number of fishermen , and operators to which these plants would give employment. </para>
            <para>Under the circumstances, it is difficult to understand the decision of the Minister, specially in view of the anxiety of the present Government to relieve unemployment and to* create new industries, and the attitude of the Minister in this direction would not appear to compare favorably with that of the British manufacturers of this plant, who have expressed their willingness to accept 75 per cent, of their payment - spread over a considerable period - from the proceeds of the sale of  fishmeal  in Great Britain produced by the plant. </para>

          <para class="block">That is one of the most glaring examples that could be quoted to show the folly and the short-sightedness of the policy that apparently is being adopted by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> in connexion with the admission of plant that is required by a new industry in Australia. I could add illustration to illustration; but I shall content myself by supporting the amendment of the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> because I consider that we should give a much more substantial preference to Great Britain than is given by the duties that appear in the schedule. It is all very well to say that a duty of 55 per cent, against Great Britain, compared with 65 per cent, intermediate and 75 per cent, general, gives a preference to Great Britain. Undoubtedly it does; but what is the advantage of any such preference if the duty itself is so high that it is practically impossible to compete against it? It is like loading on a man a burden that it is impossible for him to carry, and urging that the treatment meted out to him is very favorable because another person is asked to carry a burden that is twice as great. The amendment is an eminently reasonable one, and should be accepted by the committee. </para>

            <para>.- I, also, support the amendment of the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> I consider that this is one of the most ill-considered duties that has ever been applied. If we are to bring down production costs, whether in primary or secondary industries, we must at least make machinery for production as cheap as possible. I am an advocate of the principle of establishing Australian manufactures, so far as that is reasonable and economically possible. In this case,  however, industry is being taxed unnecessarily, by the extortionate duty that is imposed. The amendment proposes that the duty on British machinery shall be 25 per cent. I point out that tie present duty of 55 per cent., being on an ad valorem basis, is equal to 60 per cent. Then there is a primage of 10 per cent., an exchange of approximately 30 per cent., a packing case duty which approximates 2 per cent., and shipping, insurance and other charges, which vary from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent. Adopting the former figure, it will be found that the total is 112 per cent., which, added to the price of an engine costing &#163;100 f.o.b. in Great Britain, would make the price landed in Melbourne or Sydney considerably over &#163;200. The cost to the primary or secondary producer would be raised proportionately. No more flagrant example of the effect of the application of this duty can be quoted than is to be found in the case of engines of the crude oil type, particularly those of larger horse-power. Those large oil engines comprise a variety of designs and types. A common design of any type could not be made to suffice for all purposes; standardization is not possible. Any honorable member who is at all acquainted with machine shops knows that, in order to produce machinery, drawings have to be prepared, patterns made, and certain tools manufactured. If made for one machine only, the cost becomes ridiculous and out of all proportion to the usefulness of the machine. In the case of engines, some of these machines&#39; may be of horizontal type and others of vertical type, some heavy running at low speeds, others light running at high speed, some on the two-stroke, and others on the four-stroke principle. In order that the most suitable type may be obtained to meet the particular circumstances of the case, and the purpose for which it is required, it is necessary that the whole of the above range should be available within Australia, because at the moment all types are being used. .No country in the world has reached a higher standard of quality in engine manufacture than has Great Britain. In that country are established numerous firms which are noted for their production of a particular type of engine. If a provincial town in Australia wishes to install its own lighting plant it must purchase a certain type of engine to drive the dynamo ; but simply because one firm makes a certain type of engine in this country, the Government endeavours to compel that municipality, which may be hard-pressed for funds, to purchase its engine from that particular manufacturer, even though that engine may be unsuitable. Unless the council can induce the Minister to allow the duty to be lifted for the occasion, it is obliged to suffer that enormous- penalty. Is it to be wondered at that we cannot bring about decentralization, and that there are thousands of unemployed in our cities? The people will not live in our country towns because they are penalized in regard to their transportation charges, first, on the goods that they obtain from the cities, and, secondly, on the products that they send to the coast. In addition, they have to pay excessive duties on the equipment that is necessary to provide them with some of the benefits of civilization. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One of the worst features of this duty on machinery or that type of engine is that, under a by-law, either the Minister or the department may be induced to lift the duty so as to allow the machine to come in free. Let us consider how that by-law may be applied. I have particulars of goods that were landed in Melbourne in February last for tariff decision. In the case of a vertical oil and gas engine of 400 horse-power, the duty was lifted for a day and the engine was allowed in free. On the same day another &#39;300 horse-power engine of the crude oil type also was allowed in free. The ordinary honest firm that is asked by an urban or country municipality for a quotation for an English or continental engine that cannot be made in Australia, would estimate the cost on the basis of, the English f.o.b. price, to which it would add all the other charges that I have enumerated. But another  indentor  who felt that he was on good terms with the Customs Department would say, &#34; I can get the duty lifted in your case &#34;. I do not say that there is anything dishonest in that practice. But what is the result? An engine worth something like &#163;1,000 or &#163;2,000 would, in the case of the straight-out trader, cost&#34; an additional 112 per cent., while the other  indentor  who knew that the Customs Department would allow the machine to be imported without payment of duty, would be able to quote .a figure so much lower. Is that any inducement for factories to equip themselves with uptodate machinery, and is it fair to the importers or even to the manufacturers of machinery? </para>
          <para class="block">The purpose of the amendment is to make the Minister enumerate the different types of machines, and to state specifically the duties that apply to each, instead of having a drag-net item with power in the hands of the Minister to say, when the occasion arises, whether the duty shall be applied or not. Some honorable members must know how the process works; I do. An importer places an order with a firm on the other side of the world. When the goods arrive he interviews an official of the Customs Department. Two or three other machinery firms in Australia are shown a catalogue of one of the best-known makers of engines overseas, and are asked to say whether they could make, the particular type of engine on which it is sought to have the duty lifted. In 90 cases out of 100 the reply is : &#34; We could &#34;. The question asked should be : &#34; Could you make it economically, at a price that would pay the man who buys it?&#34; The customs official, knowing very little about the quality of the machine to be imported, accepts the word of the local manufacturers. The manufacturers of machinery in Australia, if we exempt agricultural machinery, employ only a handful of people; yet on their assurance that they could make the machines, a 55 per cent, duty is imposed. There are thousands of firms in. Australia who could copy most machines, but could not make them economically, or turn them out on the same scale or of the same quality as .those turned out by overseas manufacturers. This would be admitted by any manufacturers who did not want to see the public fleeced by excessive costs. If, when the matter was placed before them, they had the courage to say: &#34;We could make them, but not at a reasonable price &#34;, the imported article would be admitted duty free. They are rarely frank enough to make that admission, especially in these depressed times when they want work at whatever cost. Because both primary and secondary producers are being penalized, and on the ground that costs would be reduced if our machinery were available at as cheap a price as possible - a condition that must be present if we are to regain economic equilibrium - I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment. </para>

            <para>.- The immediate effect of a reduction of the tariff upon machinery has been belatedly realized by certain honorable members who have preceded me; but the principle which the amendment embodies is absolutely opposed to the practice that has been adopted in the past by governments that have not hesitated to impose revenue tariffs against the particular items that have been discussed this evening. The Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> said that he had moved the amendment with a view to helping British manufacturers and encouraging trade with Great Britain, at a period when it is suffering extraordinary economic distress. My knowledge and experience of the manner in which the department exercises its right to waive the duty cm machinery that cannot be commercially manufactured in Australia, convinces me that the administration is absolutely efficient and sensible. Unfortunately, this debate is degenerating into a general attack upon the protectionist policy. The contention in favour of a reduction of the duties on railway_ rolling-stock might be all right if we could expect reciprocal treatment from the countries likely to be benefited. If such duties were removed, we might get our rolling-stock from the United States of America ai slightly cheaper rates, but we have to remember that that country imposes a duty of 13&#188;d. per lb. on Australian wool, a prohibitive tax which makes it impossible for us to sell our wool in America. Yet honorable members opposite have pleaded, ostensibly for the benefit of the primary producers, that we should admit free of duty the machinery manufactured by a country that deliberately excludes one of our primary products. As for the plea on behalf of the manufacturers of the United Kingdom, the fact has be&#171;n convincingly demonstrated that some of the goods imported from Great Britain are the products of other countries, and it would be impossible for the Customs Department to police imports in such a way as to ensure that the preference granted to Great Britain applied only to goods manufactured there. I have expressed on other occasions my view that the tariff is not scientific, and that it . places on industry direct burdens that could be avoided, especially having regard to the changed economic conditions  thai have resulted from the adoption of the financial emergency plan. Therefore, I regret that honorable members opposite, instead of concentrating on those items which could be immediately amended without detriment to the policy of protection, are making a general attack upon the tariff. The machinery produced within the Commonwealth, particularly agricultural machinery, is designed to suit Australian conditions, and its efficiency has been proved. I have always maintained that the interests of primary and secondary industries interlock. Our fiscal policy should be designed to hold, the balance evenly between those two sections, but the scales are in some respects weighted unduly in favour of the manufacturing and urban interests and against the primary producers. Such injustices which result from the unscientific application of the tariff could be removed, but I can see no justification for the proposal of the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> that Australia should &#34;adopt a flexible tariff which would enable it to exchange its primary products for machinery and other manufactures of America. Such a policy would disregard the general development of the country, and would tend to break down the tariff barriers behind which our young industries are establishing themselves. Machinery that can be commercially manufactured in Australia and sold without increasing the burden on industry should be manufactured here. The elimination of such manufactories or any other secondary industries that are on an economic basis must reduce the consuming power of the community by lessening the market for other products. In regard to the claim that greater preference should be shown to the product? of Great Britain, leading economists in the United Kingdom hare admitted recently that one reason why she is losing trade in machinery and in other manufactures, i3 that she is 25 years behind some of her competitors. That contention has been advanced by those who advocate that Great Britain should alter her fiscal system in order to protect and develop her manufacturing industries. I f Great Britain is manufacturing machinery which is necessary to the development, of Australian industry- and such machinery cannot be commercially manufactured here no duty on it is charged. Surely that preference is ample. When we are asked to lower our protective duties in order to relieve the economic distress in the Mother Country, I remind honorable members that we are dealing with an emergency tariff, formulated to cope with an extraordinary economic position in Australia. Those who fail to realize that the present tariff policy has been rendered necessary in order to maintain the solvency of Australia are ignorant of facts which should be known to all students of public affairs. </para>

            <para>. - The items in this particular section of the tariff furnish the clearest evidence of the slip-shod methods adopted by the Government in the compilation of the schedule. Articles covered by some items undoubtedly should be protected - every honorable member approves of the protection of legitimate Australian industries - but others which cannot be manufactured in Australia should not be subject to the heavy rates of duty that have been imposed. It is remarkable that, in respect of 108 items, the ra&#39;te of duty is to be &#34; as prescribed by departmental by-laws &#34; - further evidence of the ruleofthumb method followed in the classification of these items. In many instances the Minister, or a departmental officer, will determine whether or not certain articles can be manufactured in Australia. Upon his decision will depend the rate of duty to be levied and whether those engaged in the industry concerned will get a fair deal. This is a singular and, I submit, altogether too great a power to place in the hands of the person who, for the time being, is Minister for Trade and Customs. The trading community is entitled to know where it stands, and what rate of duty is payable upon certain classes of machinery without having to appeal to the Minister or the department for n decision. The tariff, and particularly this section of it, is, I repeat, full of  absurdities.  In  some  items the rate of duty will depend upon whether the  article  in question pmu he &#34;commercially manufactured&#34; in this country. I have asked the Minister for a definition of this  term, but the honorable gentlemanhas declined to say just what is meant and,  as  we all know, his interpretations and  definitions  are as variable as the winds  that  blow during the equinox. </para>

              <para>- Exactly. On several occasions when applications have been made for the admission of machinery or other commodities duty free on the ground that they cannot be manufactured in Australia, the persons making the applications have been required to produce blue prints or plans. These have been shown to local firms, who thereupon alleged that the articles could be manufactured in Australia, with the result that the duties have been imposed and the public of Australia penalized. I have in mind a case which aptly illustrates my point. Recently &#39; the Manly Gas Company obtained quotations from Chicago for a spherical gasometer, the landed cost of which was &#163;3,129.When application was made for its admission duty free, the Minister made inquiries and informed the company that the gasometer could be manufactured locally by the Cockatoo Island Dockyard for &#163;6,520. Apparently, this is the Minister&#39;s interpretation of the phrase &#34; commercially manufactured &#34; which appears against so many items in the tariff. As a result of the Minister&#39;s activities in this matter, the Manly Gas Company was compelled to pay duty amounting to &#163;2,005 on a gasometer costing &#163;3,129, making the total cost &#163;5,134, which was still &#163;1,386 below the quotation obtained from Cockatoo Island Dockyard. The Manly Gas Company will  be  unable to show any tangible assets in its capital account for the &#163;2,006 duty paid on the gasometer, and, in addition, the users of gas in the Manly district will  be  forced to pay for all time approximately &#188;d. per foot more for all gas consumed. This is the direct result of the absurd fiscal policy of this Government. </para>

              <para>- Evidently he did not think of that; otherwise he would have done so. All honorable members agree that the costs of production must come down ; but, when supporters of the Government make use of this argument, they have in mind the costs, not of secondary, but of primary production, and in- continuance of its policy to assist manufacturers, this Government persists in imposing duties which work the greatest harm to primary producers. Apparently Ministers and their supporters fail to realize that, unless costs are reduced in our secondary industries, it will not be possible for our primary producers to reduce their costs  to a material extent, and yet this is essential if they arc to market their products overseas on a competitive basis. I could cite many instances to prove the harm which this Government, through its tariff policy, is doing to Australian industries. Although the Diesel engine provides the world&#39;s cheapest form of engine power, it is subject to the same duties in Australia as the ordinary petrol and . kerosene engines. One well-known British Diesel engine reduces the cost of running, as compared with a petrol engine, by 75 per cent. This particular engine represents the very latest developments in engineering, and experimental work, which is still proceeding, has already cost the makers more than &#163;30,000 on the new model alone. Similar engines are admitted free of duty to New  Zealand. As 90 per cent, of the importations are for the use of primary producers, one has not far to look for at least one of the reasons why the primary producer in Australia is so much  worse  off than - the primary producer in other parts of the Empire. This item is typical of the treatment accorded to the primary producers in hundreds of items in the tariff. There is no justification whatever for these particularly heavy duties upon articles which are not manufactured in Australia. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ARCHDALE</inline>PARKHILL.That is not denied ; but, as I have shown, at what price! The Australian price obtained by the Manly Gas Company was &#163;6,520, as against the Chicago quotation of &#163;3,129 landed at Manly. It is hopeless to expect anything from a Minister holding such an oblique, and, I suggest, idiotic view on tariff matters. </para>
          <para>It has always been a rule, when machinery has been allowed in duty free on the ground that it cannot be manufactured in this country, to permit local manufacturers to inspect it with a view to its reproduction in Australian workshops. And yet I have a case in which the Minister has withheld permission on the ground that, if it were permitted, he would be favouring one competitor at the expense of another! The Minister has altogether a mistaken conception of his position. That particular machine was admitted duty free on the understanding that it would be open to inspection by Australian engineers with a view to its manufacture in Australian engineering establishments. The Minister said that the person who desired to inspect this machine was entitled to do so provided he made arrangements with a certain manufacturer. The necessary arrangements were made, even to the fixing of the day and hour; but when the time came, the manufacturer refused to allow the inspection to take place. A report to that effect was made to the department, and the gentleman was informed that he was entitled to inspect the machine. The manufacturer again agreed to allow the inspection to take place, but later again withdrew his consent. For some inexplicable reason, the Minister, who is a Czar for the time being, issued a ukase that, no one was to inspect the machine. I do not know whether he has since made an order that the machine must be kept covered for fear some one might surreptitiously inspect it; but those are the facts to which I direct attention. The Minister has my correspondence with the department, and to that extent has the advantage over me, for I am speaking from memory. I have, however, given the salient facts of the case. </para>
          <para>I entirely repudiate the absurd suggestion of the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibbons)</inline> that honorable members on this side of the committee are discussing the general fiscal policy of the Government. Under the able direction of the Chair, the debate is being kept close to the items under discussion, which throws up in bolder relief the nonsensical statement of the honorable member. The hard, cold facts are that, although this honorable gentleman is supposed to be representing the primary producers, he very rarely has. sufficient courage to support his sentiments by his votes. As his constituents are almost wholly wheat-growers and other primary producers, it would be reasonable to expect the honorable member to champion their interests, and do his utmost to see that they obtain their&#34; machinery under reasonable .&#39;conditions; but he is full of inconsistency. He had something te say about holding the scales evenly between the secondary and primary industries. Everybody desires to do that, of course, but it will hot , be done by the methods which the honorable member has adopted. We are not here to talk as he has been talking. The Minister may laugh, but. that does not alter the fact that it is our business not to talk aimlessly around the subjects before the Chair, but to make some useful contribution to the discussion with the object, of assisting the community at large. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>In Ford&#39;s opinion a high tariff will not stimulate industry but will slow it down by s process of stultification. It will not do away with unemployment, but will  eventually  increase it by limiting or killing world trad* without, which business cannot properly expand. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ford</inline>then goes on to make some apt remarks about the value of competition in business. It appears to me to be the ambition of the Minister and some of his colleagues to put an end to all competition in business in Australia, and to make impossible the adoption of new ideas and progressive business methods by creating monopolies. In this connexion <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ford</inline> says - </para>

I am unable to understand bow it is that our wage-earners do not realize that the result of the piling up of high prices must mean the scaling down of their wages. The pushing through of this tariff schedule is neither more nor less than a base attempt on the part of a Labour government to reduce the wages and the scale of living of the workers of this country, without pro viding them with a single compensating advantage. </para>

Such protection, plus the primage duty of 10 per cent., exchange of 30 per cent., and freight and insurance charges, should be sufficient for any purpose. But all through the items of this tariff schedule one finds anomalies and evidence of injustice and unfairness. No honorable member has any desire to deal unfairly with the manufacturers of this country; on the other hand, we wish to do everything we can reasonably do to help them. But we also have a duty to the men living in the bush who have to struggle foi a living without any protection whatever, They have to sell their products at world parity prices without the adventitious aids which those engaged in secondary industries receive. Then, too, we are surely under an obligation to consider the interests of the mass of the consumers who constitute the majority of our citizens, and who, while receiving the rawest deal that any government has given them since the consummation of federation, are eing entirely  forgotten  by honorable members opposite. </para>

            <para>I desire to inform you that in dealing with applications for admission of goods under by-  laws the fundamental fact to be established is whether the article&#39; is or is not being commercially made in Australia. If the article is not being made in Australia, the Minister may then admit such goods under the appropriate by-law item of the tariff.

In the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten&#39;s</inline> time it was laid down that although the importer would be required to furnish satisfactory evidence that he had endeavoured to obtain future supplies in the Commonwealth before a further concession would be granted, it was not intended that any importer or manufacturer should bc forced to disclose to a competitor the details and knowledge which he had spent money abroad to obtain. </para>

No department could d&#39;-al more sympathetically with such rases than mine has done. </para>
          <para>The right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> said that during the last seven years Australia had imported over &#163;100,000,000 worth of machines and machinery. Unfortunately, for purposes of analysis, the statistical item &#34; machines and machinery,&#34; covers a wide range, including cash registers, cooking appliances, cable wire, electric fans, lamps, telephones, wireless sets, lawn mowers, typewriters, and so on, all of which can hardly be described as machinery necessary for the production of consumable commodities. When it comes to a matter of production of highlyspecialized articles, my department takes a most sympathetic view of the matter. The right honorable gentleman said that we should seek by preferences to give Great Britain orders for machinery that is now purchased from the United States of America and Germany. Later in his speech, he declared that British manufacturers were not foolish enough to manufacture highly-specialized machinery that could be bought to greater advantage in the United States of America and Germany. The right honorable member&#39;s speech was illogical. The Government is making every endeavour to have these machines made in Australia, bin, where that is not possible, it is realized they must be brought in from overseas - at times from the United States of America and Germany. </para>

            <para>.- This is one of the most important items in the tariff. It is a drag-net item, providing that all machines and machinery n.e.i. aru to bear a duty of 55 per cent., 65 per cent., and 75 per cent. The British preferential rate is being increased from 45 per cent, to 55 per cent. As the Minister said, it is a very general item, which applies to many articles. </para>

          <para>We have to draw certain distinctions in order to arrive at a wise conclusion on the proposal of the Government. In the first place, as the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> pointed out, ii is very important to do everything in our power to reduce the capital costs of industry. There have been examples where, owing to. the imposition of heavy duties upon machinery imported to make consumable goods in Australia, very heavy costs indeed have been permanently imposed upon an industry* I agree, in a general way, with the idea that we ought to remove the duties from the capital assets where we import for the purposes of further production. That, however, is only one side of the matter. The other side is that &#34;it is quite impossible for Australia to obtain any real success in manufacture unless there is an efficient and effective engineering industry here. An engineering industry cannot be efficient if it is confined to casual repair work. There must be an opportunity for manufacture, as well as for repairs. Any one who is interested in the matter must be aware that - and I do not reflect upon anybody - the engineering industry in Australia is a deplorable one. It has been so for some years past. Recently, there was an in quiry in the Arbitration Court into this industry which showed the need for some rationalization, and indicated that the engineering industry in Australia required overhauling. It is a pitiful thing to see how Australia is losing engineering work. Speaking generally, no ship repairing is now being done in the Commonwealth. Owners prefer, if possible, to have the vessel towed to another country to have the repairs effected. </para>

              <para>- No. I say that our costs are so high that our ship repair work has gone. Everybody who has any information with respect to the engineering industry in this country, knows that. At the present moment, a leading Melbourne firm that used . to do thousands of pounds worth of repair jobs  a  year is in liquidation.  Cockatoo  Island Dockyard and Mort&#39;s Dock are also in an unfortunate position. The costs are too high. It is all very well to deplore that fact, but that does not make jobs for men. This work has practically vanished. So long as the costs remain high in Australia, the work will not be done here. &#34;&#34;&#34;What are we going to do about it? Are we going to remain at zero point, or try to recover this and other work? Certainly, we should try to recover it. Higher duties have been imposed upon machines, machinery, and machine tools. Is it likely that the result is going to be  a  diminution of costs in engineering work done in this country? It is hardly pretended that that is likely. I urge that there should bc a very careful reconsideration of the duties which affect the engineering industry. Take the New South Wales figures of work in engineering shops. I have not the precise figures in my mind, but I know that they are in the proportion that a factory which three years ago had 850 hands, to-day has only 12; another factory which a few years ago employed 1,400 hands now has only 300. In dealing with this item, we ought to consider the .engineering industry and other in- dustries  which are dependent essentially upon it. Is it going to help those industries t Probably some honorable members opposite believe that the imposition of .these additional duties will provide more work in the engineering trade. It is a sad thing that there was far more work in the trade many years ago, when the duties were considerably lower than is the case to-day. This has to be borne .in mind. Many of the products of the engineering industry are  implements  of production, not consumable articles themselves, so that when costs are high the articles are simply not produced, because they are not ordered. The question then arises whether we are not going exactly the wrong way about effecting a revival in one of the most depressed industries in the Commonwealth. The number of men out of work in the engineering industry is probably proportionately greater than those unemployed in any other industry. There arc one or two honorable members here with special knowledge of this matter. I do not profess to any special knowledge, but those who do will, I think, agree with me that unemployment is worse to-day in the engineering industry than in any other. The condition of many former employees is&#39; pitiable. When the Arbitration Court inquired into the industry, this fact was recognized, although the inquiry was held before the present depression had become acute. The position is worse to-day, and I do not think that we shall help matters by imposing these&#39; duties. They will serve merely to aggravate the slackness of industry in general, and of the engineering industry in particular. </para>

          <para>This ha&#38; always been a general item. In ray opinion, the time has arrived when wo ought to differentiate between those machines which can be made perfectly  well  in Australia, and which there is no need to import, and other types of machinery which cannot be made here on an economic basis. Under this item, machinery is dutiable at 55 per cent., 65 per cent., and 70 per cent. I have here a pamphlet which illustrates lathes made by McPherson&#39;s Proprietary Limited, Melbourne, and I have been interested to ascertain the reputation they have in the trades in which they are used. I find that they have an admirable reputation; they are apparently first-class machines. </para>

          <para>Let us give protection such as is fair and reasonable in respect of those and similar articles; but do not let us mix up machines like that Avith other machines of an entirely different kind. Owing to the high duties imposed, some machines are, in effect, being excluded from Australia to-day, to the detriment of various industries. They  will  probably never be made here, yet they are most necessary to certain Australian industries. If they are imported, such heavy duties are imposed that they amount to a handicap on our own industries, and our  own  people. It is true that item 415 a provides for the admission, free from duty, as prescribed by departmental by-laws of manufactures imported for use &#34; in the development of an Australian industry&#34;, aud I particularly draw the attention of honorable members to that phrase &#34; or of the natural resources of Australia, or for use in public hospitals, or public educational institutions, or for use by public utilities established under Commonwealth or State law, and not conducted for private gain &#34;. The item provides that such machines may be brought in duty free, if they are of a &#34; class or kind not commercially manufactured in Australia or the United Kingdom &#34; or of a &#34; class or kind not commercially manufactured in Australia &#34; and not admissible under certain other items. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Park</inline> hill)  referred to a case in which a machine had been admitted under this by-law, and the Minister replied to the honorable member&#39;s statement. Ever since I have been a member of this House I have had a quarrel  Avith  the Customs Department as to the interpretation of this provision. My quarrel has been, not  Avith  the present Minister particularly, but  Avith  all -those who have administered the department since I have been in Parliament. I take the present opportunity of referring to the matter, because it has a particular bearing on the item we are considering. In the first place, I have always understood that, as the honorable  member for Warringah pointed out, when a specialized machine was admitted duty free under this item to a particular manufacturer, A.B., so that he might use it to develop an Australian industry, it was a condition that the machine could be viewed, and used as a model by other manufacturers engaged in the development of an Australian industry. </para>

              <para>- Undoubtedly ; that is  the whole purpose of the provision. If A.B. is allowed to import the machine duty free, why should X.Y., his competitor, have to pay 55 per cent, or 65 or 75 per cent, duty on a similar machine? Surely A.B. is not to be given the benefit of a duty-free machine for his own private profit! The essence of the provision is that a machine is to be used in the development of an Australian industry, and the Customs Department has generally interpreted that as meaning that, if if allows A.B. to import the machine free of duty, he must allow his competitors to see it. </para>

              <para>- I shall content myself with re-stating my contention as follows: If a person is allowed under item 415 a to import a machine duty free, either everybody else who wants to import a similar machine should be allowed to do so without payment of duty, or the first importer should be compelled to permit any one who desires to do so to inspect that machine. </para>

          <para>My real quarrel with the department is over the interpretation of the phrase, &#34; being of a class or kind not commercially manufactured in Australia &#34;. It appears to me that, both under the present administration and past administrations, the Customs Department has interpreted the phrase &#34; not commercially manufactured &#34; as if it were &#34; not commercially manufacturable &#34;. This Parliament has not authorized the Customs Department to say to manufacturers, &#34; Can you make this machine here if you get an order?&#34; Such an inquiry is irrelevant to this provision. The only inquiry authorized is whether the machine&#39; is already being commercially manufactured in Australia. That is the plain meaning of the item. The present Minister and his predecessor have accepted, the interpretation of the officers of the department that if a machine can be made - which is often a matter of opinion - on a commercial basis, item 415 a cannot be applied in favour of an intending purchaser of a machine from another country. Plainly, the words of the item  refer to articles now actually being made, or which have been made, and there is a great deal of difference between the phrases &#34; not commercially manufactured in Australia &#34; and &#34; that cannot be commercially manufactured in Australia&#34;. The first phrase refers to a matter of fact, the second to a matter of opinion. The best test of what I may call &#34; commercial manuf acturability &#34; is whether the article in question, is, in fact, being manufactured at the time. If a machine or article has never been manufactured in Australia, it is unlikely that it can be manufactured here in any quantity on a payable basis, because there are so many persons out to make money that if it could be manufactured commercially some one would have already begun to do it. The question whether a machine can be manufactured here commercially is disputable and doubtful, and has led to many injustices in the administration of the Customs Department. If the words were applied in what seems to me to be their plain meaning, many of the difficulties which have arisen in the administration of the law under item 415 a would disappear, and the intention of Parliament would be carried out. This is a discretional item. There has to be a departmental by-law before there can bo an admission, and citizens are not in a position to test the matter. I urge the Minister&#39;s earnest consideration of what I suggest is the plain meaning of the phrase. The true intention of Parliament should be carried out in the administration of the tariff. </para>

              <para>- It has been 45 per cent, since 1928, and at present I feel that a reduction to 25 per cent, over all is rather heavy. On the other hand, I feel, as I have said, that over the whole range of articles covered by this item, the duty is absurd. With the knowledge that has been gained by years of administration it will be admitted that a reclassification is necessary. On some articles this protection may be justified ; on others it is not. In many instances, we arc only injuring Australian industries by imposing these duties. It is not as if revenue were obtained from them. Often their operation frequently means that manufacturers have to do the best they can with inefficient plant, and therefore find it more difficult to compete with imported goods. The real remedy is to be found ina reclassification. I therefore ask the Minister to consider whether it would not be practicable to select&#39; some articles on which high protective duties can be justified, and in the interests of all sections of the community to reduce the duties on the others. Although I feel that at the present moment there ought to be a real reduction in many of the duties imposed, I am inclined to think that a reduction of 20 per cent, is rather heavy. I should like to hear more on the subject before definitely making up my mind on that aspect of the question. I shall listen with interest to the debate before I finally determine how I shall vote. </para>

            <para>. - I do not profess to be an authority on mechanical engineering, but I know something of the difficulties encountered by those who have to install different types of machinery. During the last eighteen months, applications were made by the City Council of Cairns and the Town Council of Thursday Island in my electorate for the free importation of certain machinery which they desired to install. I unsuccessfully endeavoured to obtain a remission of duty on those two particular plants, as the Minister contended that they could be manufactured in Australia. In each case, reputable machinery merchants called for tenders for the supply of these plants, and in one case an incomplete tender was submitted, but in the other no tender at all was forthcoming. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the complete plants could not be manufactured in Australia otherwise those engaged in the manufacture of such machinery would have submitted tenders. Although some parts of the plant may be made in the Commonwealth, the fact that no tenders were received was a clear indication to me that the complete plant could not be commercially made in this country. In the two instances I have mentioned, machinery was required by public bodies which cannot raise revenue very readily} and which have to conserve the interests of the ratepayers. I do not suggest that these plants could not be manufactured in Australia, but the fact that no offers wore received surely suggests that their manufacture was not a commercial proposition to Australian engineers. I am anxious to encourage Australian manufacturers, and I admit that in some cases very generous treatment is meted out to those controlling Australian industries. But, in the cases 1 have quoted, great hardship was inflicted upon two public bodies. I understand that&#187; when a tender is submitted by an overseas manufacturer the whole plant must be taken, otherwise a higher rate of duty is imposed, which naturally  presents  a difficulty to those who wish to install machinery. If duties are imposed for the purpose of raising revenue&#39; the people should be told. The late Government imposed duties purely for revenue purposes, and, in fact, obtained most of ils revenue from that source. I am opposed to this or any other Government imposing duties merely for the  purpose of  raising revenue unless it distinctly states that that is its intention. </para>

            <para>.- This is a dragnet item in which all classes of machinery which are not covered by other items are included. The reason for the increase of duties under this item which embraces an enormous quantity of machinery and parts has not been given. I am not one of those who approve of the Minister for Customs possessing the extensive powers which he now enjoys of increasing or remitting duties, lt places too much power into the hands of influential people. The imposition of these additional duties is having a most disastrous effect upon production throughout Australia. It has not even been contended that as a result of these unnecessarily high rates the number of persons engaged in industry has increased. When we reach electrical machinery I shall direct&#39; the attention of the committee to the opinion expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Julius, in Hobart, some time ago, who said that rather than have these heavy duties it would be better to pension off every electrical engineer in Australia, and allow electrical machinery to come in duty free. The first inquiry made by a British or American manufacturer who proposes to establish a factory in Australia is the price at which he can obtain power,- the first essential for cheap production. Honorable members opposite and . some on this side of the chamber seem to think that anything that is cheap is inferior. The honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibbons),</inline> who is pleased to think that the Government of New South Wales pays a higher price for the rails and locomotives used in his electorate merely because they are&#39; manufactured in Australia, apparently, disregards the additional burden which is placed upon the primary producers in the matter of freight. In connexion with the contract let to Messrs. Thompson and Company, of Castlemaine, some years ago for the supply of fourteen locomotives for use on the Port. Augusta to Oodnadatta railway, the extra price involved in giving the work to an Australian manufacturer necessitated an additional interest payment of 6 per cent, in the &#163;1 and 10 per cent, in the &#163;1 sinking fund which is equivalent to &#163;570,000. Notwithstanding these unnecessary additional imposts, some still ask for lower freights upon our railways. A little while ago an American engineer who came to Australia submitted an adverse report upon a big mining venture, because the necessary plant which  could have been obtained in the United States of America for &#163;250,000 would cost &#163;525,000 in Australia. He said that the amortization was so great that the proposition was unprofitable. The tender of a Melbourne manufacturer for a plant capable of boring an 11-inch hole to a depth of 4,000 feet was &#163;11,800, whereas that of an American plant capable of boring a 20-inch hole, 9,000 feet was &#163;6,322. Imagine a government imposing a duty of &#163;1,950 on the American plant that was to be used for boring for oil in Australia ! The </para>

The*  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> says that the metal trade is more depressed than any other industry in the country. As a matter of fact the depression in this industry is due to a change of conditions in the engineering world. Formerly, the steamers which visited Australia from overseas ports were of comparatively small tonnage, and a great deal of their repair work was done in Australia. Those steamers have now been replaced on the Australian trade by vessels of considerable tonnage, which carry their own engineering staffs, and undertake their own repairs. Modern, engineering methods have led to the adoption of standardization and mass production, and spare parts are produced by the thousand. This has had a depressing effect upon the Australian engineering shops, but the Australian metal trade would have been in a very much worse position if it had not been for the protection afforded by these duties. </para>

            <para>.- - I intend to reply to certain statements of the Minister regarding the importation of machinery. He said that he was willing to admit, free of duty, machinery that cannot be made in Australia, and the honorable member  for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. Riley)</inline> remarked that we should do nothing that would  result iri sending work out of Australia to cheap-labour countries; but, owing to the duties now under discussion, the Minister has actually caused work that Could have  been  done in Australia to be given to Japan. There was an opportunity for the erection of seven fishmeal plants at various points on the Australian coast. The Minister has been considering this matter since the 19th November last, and as I understand the last letter on the subject is dated the 10th June, the correspondence has extended over a period of eight months. The Minister now states that an order for one machine has been placed in Australia ; but I shall shew that this machine is of an obsolete type, and will prevent the success of the industry. The seven other plants, which would have provided work in Australia for hundreds of men, are not in operation to-day, because they could not be imported under present conditions, and fishmeal, which might have been  made  in this country by Australians, is being imported from Japan. The Minister has prevented the importation of certain machines, the manufacture of which in Australia, would have provided work for only a few mcn, but. hundreds of men would have been employed continuously in operating such machines. The sole effect of the Minister&#39;s action has been to make a certain amount of extra work in Japan in  the  manufacture of fishmeal. </para>

              <para>- The Minister speaks as though the manufacture of this machine was completed. Apparently, in despair, after trying for months to import suitable machines, somebody has given an order for a plant to be made in Australia, which, I shall show, will be obsolete when finished, and will hamper the industry from the beginning. In the first place, permission was desired to bring in, duty free, a machine which would work continuously with the solvent process. Various manufacturers were written to, but none had seen such a machine working in Australia. The Comptroller-General of Customs had suggested that certain, firms be written to, and every one of them replied that they could not make this machine unless they received a licence from Messrs. Hose, Downs and Thompson Limited, who hold the patent rights. In the event of that permission being given, they were willing to pay a 5 per cent, commission on all machines manufactured by them. An importing company, which was also a machinery manufacturing company in Australia, had a right under licence to manufacture a certain type of fishmeal plant which was not up to date. In a letter dated the28th January, 1931, this firm stated - </para>

          <quote>
            <para>We know these firms, and would state that hitherto they have only made abattoir machinery for turning out manure, but the plant underconsideration is of a different type, and is for producing meal for feeding stock, and, possibly, also for human consumption. </para>
            <para>This type of plant has only been evolved within the last few years, and hitherto there has not been a demand for it in Australia, so that Australian manufacturers have not had cause to study the problems attached to the successful production of fishmeal. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The company sent to the Minister copies of the correspondence that it had received. It was stated that the correspondence showed that one firm was not in a position to quote for the plant required, and admitted that no one in Australia had made a plant for the manufacture of fishmeal by these methods. The letter continued - </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">From the latter letter it is evident that these people have never made a fishmeal plant, and are not in a position to quote for a plant of the type required. They state that the continuous type of plant has not, in their experience, proved satisfactory. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>But this type of plant has been in use in Great Britain, having been made by Messrs. Rose, Downs and Thompson Limited. The Australian manufacturers said that they would not turn out a continuous machine but one similar to that which was used in the making of manure, and added that the solvent process was not used. Horrocks, Roxburgh Proprietary Limited, however, pointed out that in England and Germany, where this industry is carried on successfully, the solvent process which the Australian manufacturer says is impracticable is the standard process. The letters that &#93; have in my possession demonstrate conclusively that, had the request of the firm been acceded to, there would be operating at the present time in Australia - on the Clarence, in Gippsland, in Sydney, and in Western Australia - from five to seven plants employing several hundreds of men, producing what we have now to import. It is not right for the Minister to suggest, in view of these letters and their dates, immediately a request is made, that there is a satisfactory answer to it. </para>
          <para>I wish to place on record, also, the position in connexion with another machine that is used in the production of oil from copra. At the present time copra is somewhat of a. drug &#34;on the market, yet coco-nut oil, which is extracted from it, finds a ready sale, and is worth twice as much. If we had copra mills in Australia we should be able to procure practically the whole of the copra that is grown in our island dependencies, and the other islands adjacent to Australia, and be able to sell the oil readily in Canada and the United States of America; but, when application is made for the admission duty free of a special  type of oil-making machine, it is refused on the ground that certain portions of it can be made in Australia. Thus we are prevented from establishing a new industry and of doubling the value of the exports from Papua and New Guinea. Is not that a stupid position for us to be placed in? </para>
          <para>I trust that the Minister will reclassify the whole of this item in such a way that protection will be given only to those machines that are actually being made in Australia, so that the. development of new industries will not be impeded by the exclusion of those the manufacture of which in Australia is merely problematical. </para>
          <para>I understand that there is a feeling in the minds of some honorable members that, notwithstanding the present primage duty, a British preferential rate of 25 per cent, would not afford sufficient protection to those machines that are made in Australia. I therefore ask that leave be granted to amend my amendment to make the rates read, &#34;British, 35 per cent. ; intermediate, 55 per cent. ; general, 60 per cent.&#34; </para>

            <para>.- The Minister has assured the committee that sympathetic consideration is given to every application for admission under by-law of machinery for specialized purposes. I shall give an example which I consider reveals anything but sympathetic consideration by the honorable gentleman. There is in Western Australia a company named Plaimar Limited, which has most successfully exploited a number of the local industries in the direction of producing chemical products and synthetic compounds, having been particularly successful in connexion with extracts from boronia and sandalwood. Its exports amount to approximately &#163;120,000 per annum ; therefore it may be taken to be thoroughly bona fide. Its efficiency, and the capacity of its managers to deal with different industries, aro undoubted. Some years ago, with a view to extending its business, this company laid- down at a cost of &#163;5,000 a farm for the growing of herbs, from which to extract essential oils and the like. Last year, when the farm was approaching the productive stage, the principal expert of the company visited Europe, and selected machinery suitable for the purposes of the new industry which if was intended to establish; and an application was made to the Minister, for permission to import the machinery free under by-law. Following . his usual practice, the honorable gentleman sent out his scouts to ascertain whether any manufacturer was prepared to undertake the manufacture of this particular type of machinery; and it was not surprising that some one was found who was prepared to take the risk-. A firm of metal workers in Adelaide whose business was connected with motor cars, having been given a general idea of the class of machinery required, and being incited by the prospect of securing a monopoly and of making high profits, expressed its willingness to undertake the manufacture of this machinery. It had the impudence to request that the specifications, which it was necessary for the overseas manufacturer to lodge with the department with his application for the admission of the machinery under by-law, should be handed over to it in order that they might be copied. It was unacquanited with the type of machinery in question, but felt that if supplied with the specifications it could make a success of the venture. It is to the credit of Plaimar&#39;s that they refused to be a party to this piracy of other people&#39;s ideas, and the specifications were, not handed over. Nevertheless, the Adelaide company persisted with its claim that it could manufacture this machinery. Later, I believe, the Minister discovered some Melbourne manufacturers who said that they, too, were prepared to take a chance on it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marr,</inline> the technical manager of Plaimar Limited, went to the trouble of making a special trip to Adelaide to interview those who claimed that they were able to make this machinery; and he was absolutely satisfied that they were not competent to undertake the work. This machinery is in a highly specialized class; it is used in connexion with a new chemical business, in which Australia, and indeed Great Britain, is not able to specialize. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marr</inline> was not prepared to run the risk of paying for the experiment, to be performed by the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Adelaide manufacturer. The Minister after delaying the applicant from October, 1930, until March of this year, refused the application, on the ground that there were in Australia manufacturers who were prepared to undertake&#39; the manufacture of this machinery, the result being that &#34;Western Australia was deprived of a promising industry, and neither the department nor the manufacturers have derived any benefit from their dog-in-the-manger policy. The Minister and many other honorable members have expressed a pious desire to give every facility to industry in order that work may be provided for the unemployed ; but the manner in which the tariff is administered precludes all possibility of that desire being realized. Machines are amongst the tools of trade of industry, and we cannot expect to be able to produce in Australia a very large proportion of the many classes of machines used here. Some oil engines and the less intricate classes of machinery may be made locally, but the more specialized machines, which are the product of extensive and costly research, and are required in only small numbers, cannot be economically manufactured here. Unfortunately, the administration of this schedule is controlled by a Minister whose enthusiasm for high protection amounts almost to an obsession. I commend that portion of the amendment which seeks to give a more effective preference to British products. Great Britain is Australia&#39;s best friend and customer, and to her more than to any other country in the world must we look for the restoration of our prosperity. But effective preference to Great Britain is not conferred by the present .schedule. When tariff duties are so high as to operate prohibitively the preference which the schedule purports to give becomes a mockery. I agree that the Minister should exercise his discretion, particularly in the direction of excluding American goods. Australia loses on almost all of its transactions with the United States of America, and the ministerial discretion should be exercised iii the direction of curtailing imports from that country. But with Great Britain the administration should be more sympathetic. Moreover, when persons are trying to establish new industries, the Minister&#39;s first consideration should be, not the interests of a few employees in some small factory, but the larger interests that will be promoted by assisting the establishment or development of some other industry. I cordially support the amendment. </para>

            <para>. - &#34;Machines and machinery n.e.i.&#34; excludes locomotives, tractors, internal combustion engines and all sorts of other machinery specifically mentioned in the schedule. Therefore, the item relates only to undefined machines and machinery which, so far as we know, are not made in Australia at the present time. The Minister may at any time propose a duty which he regards as essential, or admit duty free any machines that are not commercially manufactured in Australia. Therefore, the amendment moved by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> does not introduce any important principle. Although the right honorable member made a great onslaught on the tariff policy generally, and appealed strongly for greater preference to the products of Great Britain, his remarks were not particularly applicable to this item. Of course, every part of the Empire deserves to get the benefit of preferential duties, and how the amendment would help the Empire I cannot understand. The schedule provides for duties of 55, 65 and 75 per cent., and the amendment proposes that they be reduced to 35, 55 and 60 per cent. I fail to&#39; see that American goods will be excluded by reducing the duty on them from 75 to 60 per cent. I would prefer that the general tariff duty proposed by the Minister should be doubled against the United States of America. If the arguments that&#39; have been advanced by the members of the Opposition were applicable to the item? I would oppose the amendment. We have been told that &#163;100,000,000 worth of machinery was imported into Australia during the last seven years. Presumably the importers were influenced by the knowledge that the tariff would protect the product of such machinery, and I shall not be a party to removing that protection, and thereby possibly rendering the machinery useless. I shall support preference to Great Britain wherever it does not involve the denial of adequate protection to those industries which can be, and should be, established here in the interests of the country, and for the employment of our people. There are many items that need all the protection that this schedule provides. That applies to some articles of machinery, but in respect of unspecified machines it is safe to leave to the administration discretionary power to collect duties or grant free entry, as the circumstances may dictate. I cannot support any general move for the reduction of the tariff duties, for I know that many primary as well as secondary industries would suffer considerably if the present policy of protection were tampered with. There are many who would reduce the duty on our primary products to favour importations. </para>

          <para>Mr.FORDE (Capricornia - Minister for Trade and Customs) &#91;10.50&#93;.- The rates on locomotives and road rollers have been increased by 15 per cent, in the British preferential and intermediate tariff, and. by 20 per cent, in the general tariff. There are several engineering shops in Australia quite capable of producing all the locomotives and road rollers required. It will be noted that the importations of locomotives are of considerable value. The increased rates are proposed in an endeavour to secure to Australian engineers work which  should undoubtedly be undertaken in this country. The duties imposed on these goods arc part of the Government&#39;s plan to rehabilitate the engineering industry. Provision exists under the tariff for the ad mission of machines, machinery, &#38;c, under by-law where it is proved that certain types cannot be manufactured in A ustralia. During 1928-29, locomotives to the value of &#163;74,721 were admitted under by-law, and in 1929-30 importations so admitted were valued at &#163;79,847. The administration of the by-law items enables the railways to import at nominal rates of duty any locomotive of a special design, or of a type not manufactured in Australia. </para>

            <para>.- This item deals with various forms of motive power machinery concerned with generating other than electrical power. Practically every argument that was advanced against the increase in the rates of duty in connexion with item 176 f 1 applies with equal force against the increase in these duties. I shall quote what the Minister for Agriculture in the Labour Government of New South Wales stated regarding the action of machinery, firms generally when they were put in the position of monopolies by this Government. I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Guardian,</inline> Sydney, of 26th January, 1931- </para>

            <para>To-day&#39;s Australian Labour Party country conference was remarkable for an outburst by the Minister for Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dunn),</inline> directed against Australian machinery firms. They had held a gun at his ear to get financial guarantees, and were he said, &#34; worse than Ned Kelly.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunn</inline> was particularly caustic in his criticism of Australian machinery firms. After the Federal Government had wiped out their competitors with prohibitive tariffs they held a gun at his ear to extort financial guarantees, he said. They demanded that the Government guarantee one-third of the cost, otherwise they would not deliver machinery to farmers. &#34;Their actions have been reported to the Federal Government,&#34; he said, &#34;but in order to help the farmers we made the necessary guarantees so that the crops could be harvested.&#34; </para>

            <para>. -  This item covers, among other things, diesel engines, which are now being manufactured by Walkers Limited, of&#39; Maryborough. This engineering firm has been established for the last 60 years, and has manufactured, with credit to itself and to Australia, a great&#39; many of the railway locomotives used by the various Australian governments. During recent years the firm has given consideration to the manufacture of other heavy machinery as there is but little demand to-day for railway locomotive construction. The general manager of Walkers Limited, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BE.</inline> S. Goldsmith, toured the world in 1928 to acquire information, and, as a result, decided to make arrangements for the construction of diesel engines at the works in Maryborough. He visited various overseas works at which such engines were being made, and concluded an agreement with Messrs. Mirrless, Bickerton and Day Limited, of England, for their manufacture in Aus tralia. Upon his return to this &#34;country, a request was made to the last Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> whether he would afford the new industry adequate tariff protection if the company proceeded to establish works here, and was given an emphatic answer in the affirmative. Since then honorable members have received literature supplied to them by the Australian Association of British Importers urging that this tariff protection should be withdrawn. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> has even used in this committee some of the arguments supplied to him by the association. Honorable members have been furnished by a section of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce with similar literature, which misrepresents the position in regard to the manufacture of diesel engines. Since receiving the promise of tariff protection from the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> Walkers Limited sent to Britain two of its engineers to study the manufacture of these machines. These gentlemen have now returned, and the necessary plant has been installed for proceeding with the work. Both the former Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> and the present Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> have honoured the promise given by the honorable member for Henty. In the literature supplied by the Australian Association of British Importers, it is stated that the imposition of the duty provided in this tariff schedule on the importation of diesel engines would be a hardship on the primary producers. The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> agrees with that. Let me inform him for his edification, and in order to contradict the statements which have been made, that &#34;Walkers Limited has no intention under its agreement to manufacture engines of less than 100 horsepower. </para>

              <para>- Up to 1,000 horse-power. In the literature which has been distributed here, it is stated that no diesel engine of 1,000 horsepower has ever been manufactured in any part of the world. It is stated that no diesel engineering firm turns out fixed engines of 1,000 h.h.p. It goes on  to say that the local manufacturers, Walkers Limited, have undertaken to do what the more experienced engineering firms of the world do not attempt to do. That statement hasbeen placed before honorable members in the hope that they will oppose this item. I have here an engineering journal dated 30th April, 1931, advertising a Crossley heavy oil horizontal diesel engine of 1. 000 horse-power; yet the Association of British Importers state that such a thing has never been made. </para>

          <para>It is stated that this firm cannot manufacture diesel engines of over 200 horsepower, but it is clear that they are able to do so. The first diesel engine manufactured by the firm was of 200 horse-power. Yesterday I received a telegram to the effect that orders for diesel engines have just been received from Sydney, Melbourne, and from Central Queensland, and that the firm is hopeful of the immediate future. I have a copy of the tender by Walkers Limited for the supply of a diesel engine of 720 brake horse-power which shows that the information supplied to those opposed to the encouragement of Australian industry is incorrect. This is an Australian matter. I am not opposed to assisting British industries, and intend to support them whenever necessary; but this is an instance in which we can assist an Australian industry and provide employment for our own artisans, who are equal to those in any part of the world. The Australian firm producing diesel engines, Walkers Limited, has been in operation for 60 years, and is co-operating under licence with Mirrless, Bickerton and Day Limited, a British firm which has been manufacturing diesel engines for the last 30 years. </para>

          <para>The Mirrless diesel engine manufactured in Australia is equal to the best that is manufactured in the world, and it was for that reason that Walkers Limited selected that design. The Mirrless Company has had the longest and best experience in diesel engine building in Great Britain. If it is in our interests to protect the manufacturers of Australian locomotives, why should we not protect the manufacturers of other types of machinery? Such machinery  cannot be profitably manufactured unless fairly heavy customs duties are imposed. The Australian workmen must- be protected. We have also to remember &#34;.hat, in Australia, the raw material costs more than it does in other smaller and more compact countries.

          <para class="block">At present, 85 per cent, of the engine turned out by Walkers Limited has been made by that firm. Of the later engines, 95 per cent, will be completely manufactured by Walkers Limited, and by the time the present contracts are completed lOO per cent, of the engine will be manufactured by it. The firm would not rush in to carry out the whole of the technical work on the first engine, and possibly bring about a failure. lt thought that its best policy was to look before it leaped. It is to be hoped that&#39; most people, whether they are opposed to a protective policy or hot, will agree that there are some essentials which can be manufactured with advantage in Australia, and surely there is nothing more essential for Australian development than the manufacture of crude oil engines which it is possible to turn out in Australia up to <inline font-style="italic">1,000</inline> horsepower. For marine purposes, these engines are built up to 10,000 horse-power, and there is no reason why Australian artisans who have been associated with engine construction for 50 or 60 years should not be protected to enable them to undertake the construction of diesel engines now that steam is going out of favour as a motive power. I hope that the propaganda which has been distributed among honorable members will not bring about a vote hostile to these duties. </para>

            <para>. -  I would not have risen hut for the extraordinary speech of the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser).</inline> It was a series of incoherent and unconnected statements. Although Walkers Limited has not been mentioned to-night; although no word has been said against the firm, he has referred to what he called a statement, and has proceeded to tilt at what it contains. The honorable member constitutes himself the advocate for Walkers Limited. He cares more for that firm than for any other interests in Australia; but it would have had a higher reputation in the committee and in the country generally if the honorable member had not spoken in its defence. We are told that it has now started to manufacture diesel engines. On the strength of an order for three engines, the honorable member has claimed that no one should say a word against the duty. But he has told .us that when this great establishment was asked to manufacture an engine of 100 b.h.p. it said, &#34; We can manufacture everything except the external parts and the internal parts; in effect, we can merely put a case around it.&#34; At any rate the honorable member produced a statement to that effect. He has therefore actually done damage to his clients&#39; canst&#39;. No one would have known of the firm&#39;s disability if the honorable member had not mentioned it. I pointed out in an earlier speech that British firms had spent &#163;30,000 in perfecting, these engines, but all that the honorable member can say is that his firm has an order for &#34; three whole engines &#34;. If the firm for which the honorable member makes so many appeals to the committee is such a wonderful concern, why does it need 100 per cent, protection? </para>

              <para>- It gets 70 per cent, under this tariff, 10 per cent, primage and 30 per cent, exchange. The honorable member talks unconvincingly about the merits of a firm which has been in .existence for 60 years, and yet still needs prohibitive protection ! The object of tariffs is to protect embryonic industries, so that on reaching maturity they may be able to do without duties, and withstand the competition of the world. After an industry has been in operation in his electorate for 60 years, the honorable member now wishes to give it a protection amounting to over 100 per cent., to enable it to carry on. That firm might well say - &#34; Save me from my friends!&#34; The honorable member belongs to the Country party, I understand ; but,- judging by his utter disregard &#39; of the interests of the primary producers, including those in his own electorate, I should say that his proper place is among the disciples of extreme protection. The firm in question will wish that he had not spoken on this matter, because lie has done neither it nor the Country party any good. </para>

            <para>. - The Minister has a discretionary power with regard to admitting into Australia engines designed for the purpose of assisting production. One of the most successful power undertakings in Australia is the Nymboida hydro-electric scheme, and a 1,000 horse-power diesel engine is required in connexion with its work and extension. Tenders have been called in Australia and overseas, and it is found that the tenders from the Australian companies are 2D per cent, higher than the cost at which a suitable engine from overseas could be landed in Australia, after paying all costs, including exchange; customs and primage duty. Surely it cannot be contended that these engines could be commercially made in Australia, when there is such an enormous disparity between the local and overseas prices. If the Government insists* on the payment of the high duty imposed* on engines of this type, the primary producers will have to pay a higher rate than would otherwise be necessary for the electric current required by them for their ordinary undertakings as the Nymboida undertaking supplies hundreds of farms, and will not, in any case, spend the additional 20 per cent, to get an untried Australian machine. Before tenders were called for, I urged the Minister that he should use his discretionary power  in  this matter. The undertaking to which I have referred is carrying on a work which will give employment to 360 men in the next two years at a time when unemployment is rife. If it is forced to pay an excessive price for this engine, it will not be able to provide the employment that would otherwise be given in the extension of its work. I am satisfied that, if the Minister looks carefully into this matter, he must give it favorable consideration. </para>

            <para>.- I was rather surprised and amused at the speech of the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser).</inline> I had supposed thai members of the Country party were low tariffists, but, judging by the honorable member&#39;s speech, and hie support of bounties on cotton and certain other primary products, they may  be  more correctly described as primary and geographical protectionists. The honorable member said thai members of the Nationalist party had  beer  guided in their attitude by certain literature, but 1 say emphatically thai I have not read any of the literature to which he referred. I am sure- that, the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> when Minister for Trade and Customs, made no promise of a 55  per  cent. duty. Such an impost would  give  an actual protection of 112 per cent.,  or  more. The engines under consideration&#34; are used for pumping plants  for irrigation  work, and in butter factories, and the heavy duty imposed on them will penalize the man on the land just as much as the duties on engines of a smaller type. The honorable member for &#34;Wide Bay spoke as though diesel engines were used only for particular purposes; but I point out that they will shortly be employed even as the power units of aeroplanes. I give the firm at Maryborough full credit for enterprise, and it well deserves to be classed as a first-rate engineering concern. It has survived adversity, and has turned out efficient, work. The honorable member remarked that this firm is making engines in all sizes from 100 to 1,000 horse-power. On referring to the Tariff Board&#39;s decisions, Nos. 221 to 227, I find that on the 6th February, 1931, an engine of 400 horse-power was admitted free. On the same day another engine of 300 horse-power was admitted duty free. </para>

            <para>. - This item deals with switches, fuses, and lightning arresters, the duty on which is 65 per cent. British, 70 per cent. intermediate, and 75 per cent, general. I have no objection to a duty being imposed on certain types of switches which are very simply made, and can be turned out in large quantities, and the price of which has been reduced; but there are other types of a highly technical and very expensive character, which are not being made to any extent in Australia, and which it is absolutely* necessary should be thoroughly guaranteed because on their integrity depends the safety of thousands of pounds worth of machinery. I desire an undertaking from the Minister that duty will not be imposed on that particular type of switch. </para>

            <para>.- The duty on switch gear was increased in 1926 by 5 per cent, under the British preferential tariff, and 10 per cent, under the general tariff. The hulk of the importations have been from the United Kingdom. As a matter of interest,&#39; it may be stated that apart from the home market Australia in the past has been Great Britain&#39;s best customer for electrical goods. There are ten manufacturers in Australia to-day making this switch gear. They are in a position to supply practically all types of industrial switch gear, and a substantial percentage of switch gear for power stations and substations, particularly that with voltages under 33,000. </para>
