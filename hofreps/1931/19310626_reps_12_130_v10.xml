            <para>- Has the Prime Minister seen the monstrous income tax proposals of the Government of New South Wales, published in to-day's news papers? In view of the grave crisis which is likely to be precipitated in that State by the imposition of such confiscatory and cruel taxation, will he confer with the Premiers of the other States to decide what steps can he taken to safeguard the new federal taxation proposed under the reconstruction plan against the buccaneering attacks of this irresponsible Premier? </para>

            <para>- Last week I asked the Prime Minister whether he would consider the advisability of recasting the Government's financial proposals in view of the fact that the Hoover plan would relieve Australia to the extent of approximately Â£3,920,000 this year. His reply was that the Hoover plan had not yet taken shape and that he had no information as to when it would. To-day's <inline font-style="italic">Canberra- Times</inline> reports that the Chancellor of the Exchequer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Phillip Snowden)</inline> has announced in the House of Commons that the Imperial Government was offering to the dominions and India the same war debt concessions as  President  Hoover proposed to offer to other nations. He added that he thought that he was interpreting the country's wishes by deciding to offer to the dominions the option of postponing the whole of their war debt to Great Britain for one year, beginning from the 1st July next. Having regard to that statement, will the Prime Minister now consider a revision of the proposed vicious cuts of pensions and wages ? </para>

              <para>- The information which the honorable member has read from the newspaper report is that which was contained in a cablegram I read to the House yesterday. My answer to the honorable member's previous question still applies.  President  Hoover's proposal has not yet materialized, and we do not know when it will. In any case we do not anticipate that the Commonwealth will receive any cash benefit from it until the next financial year is well advanced, whereas we have serious financial obligations to meet next month. </para>

              <para>- Not entirely. Each government was allowed discretion as to the method of applying the principles agreed upon by the' conference. For ' instance, there was unanimous agreement that a  20  per cent, reduction of all adjustable governmental expenditure should be effected, but the best means of effecting the reduction was left to the discretion of each government. The representatives of all the governments submitted to the conference their proposals for applying the reduction, and these were approved as being in accordance with the spirit of the general resolution. On certain specific matters discretion was not left to the Governments, but drafts of uniform legislation to be introduced into the Commonwealth and State Parliaments were submitted to the conference and accepted. </para>

As Prime Minister, I have checked this expenditure, and have ascertained that on many occasions, not more than one-third of the amount that Ministers were entitled to charge has been collected. The official duties of some Ministers require them to do more travelling than others.

            <para>- The newspapers of to-day contain an announcement by the Commonwealth Bank that it has reduced the interest rate on fixed deposits and advances by a flat rate of 1 per cent. This flat rate means in respect of fixed deposits a reduction of approximately 22Â½ per cent., whereas, in respect of advances, the reduction is only from 14 to 16 per cent. Will the Prime Minister draw the attention of the Commonwealth Bank Board to the anomaly? </para>

            <para>- It will be generally admitted that in relation to private incomes the taxable field has diminished this year as compared with last year and is likely further to diminish next year. Whether an increase- of income tax will affect the amount of income received by taxpayers depends upon the nature of the plan under which the tax is applied, but normally the taxation of incomes does not affect the earning capacity of the taxpayer. </para>

          <para>- It will be necessary for the House to give direction for the publication in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of questions on notice and the replies to them; the authority of the  Speaker  will not be sufficient. If this new Standing Order is adopted, the course that I shall follow is that, when questions without notice have been answered, I shall ask for papers and any statements that Ministers may desire to make. There will, of course, be no call for questions on notice. Replies to questions on notice will be handed to the  Clerk  by the Ministers to whom the questions are addressed, and copies of the questions and answers will be distributed to the member, concerned. </para>

          <para>. - Some time ago I asked the Prime Minister whether the practice of making oral answers to  written questions was likely to cease. The New South Wales Parliament at one time followed the custom that has hitherto been adopted by this Parliament, but an alteration was subsequently made. I suggest to the Government that, instead of answers to questions on notice being handed to the  Clerk,  and copies of them given to the members concerned, we might follow the New South Wales practice of printing the questions and answers on the notice-paper, and, in that way, make them available to all honorable members. At present we are able to get from the member concerned the information contained in an answer to a question upon notice, but it will be most inconvenient if we are obliged to wait for such information until the publication of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> For this reason I suggest that both the questions and the answers to questions on notice should be printed on the business-paper for the day. </para>

          <para>.- I support the suggestion of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cusack).</inline> I had intended to make it myself. Sometimes questions of very great interest to all honorable members appear on the notice-paper; but, if the replies given to such questions are not available to us until two or three days after they have been given, the interest in them may evaporate. There may be some technical difficulty in printing the questions and answers on the same business-paper, but surely that could be overcome. The proposal of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro is in accord with the practice of the New South Wales Parliament. If the replies to questions on notice are made available as soon as they are given, honorable members can make much more use of them than if they have to wait for them for several days. Every day our notice paper contains two or three pages of matter, principally notices of motion which may never be discussed by the House, which is kept in type. If the room that these notices of motion occupy on the business-paper were taken up by answers on notice, it would be much more useful to us. </para>

If work is piled up in other directions by the adoption of this arrangement, no economy will be effected. As the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R.

          <para>.- The object of this proposal is to facilitate business, but I doubt- whether it will have this effect. In my opinion, it will tend to greatly increase the number of questions asked without notice. At present, if a question appears on the notice-paper in relation to a subject upon which another honorable member desires information, he is not entitled to ask a question upon it without notice. If the replies to questions on notice are- not made available promptly to honorable members, difficulties will be caused. I do not see any particular virtue in this proposal. </para>

The practice of answering questions upon notice orally is in many cases a farce. Frequently such replies contain numerous figures, and permission is asked that they be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> unread. On every occasion the  Speaker  must obtain the permission of the House for this to be done, but I have never known leave to be refused. </para>

            <para>- Honorable members are sometimes very impatient to obtain answers to the questions they ask upon notice. Frequently it is necessary for Ministers to obtain from Melbourne or elsewhere the information desired. Many years ago it was the practice of another place to print both the questions and the answers in the <inline font-style="italic">Journals,</inline> but that was abandoned. I point out that the notice paper is printed in a different measure from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> in order to meet the convenience of honorable members. The printing of the notice-paper involves an expenditure of about Â£3 per <inline font-style="italic">diem.</inline> If a great deal more type-setting is involved in the printing of it, as would be the case if questions and answers alike were printed, the expenditure would be a great deal heavier. Moreover, all the questions and answers would have to be reset in the measure of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

          <para class="block">The reduction of interest rates on our public debt is an outstanding feature of the rehabilitation plan agreed to in the recent Premiers Conference. The conversion of this debt is a colossal undertaking, the magnitude of which has rarely been exceeded in the history of the world. It may be compared with the great British debt conversion -submitted to the British House of Commons by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goschen</inline> in 18S8. If the object of this conversion is attained, the interest burden on the community will be lightened, and the loan market steadied for the future. This will undoubtedly lead to the improvement of the national credit of Australia. </para>
          <para>The bill is part of a general scheme for the sharing of the loss occasioned by the prevailing economic disturbance. It is clear to all who have given serious consideration to the problems of Australia that we cannot get back to financial stability until considerable readjustments have been made, and in the making of such re-adjustments, it is the duty and obligation of governments to see that the sacrifices involved are evenly and equitably spread over the whole community. The reduction of the interest on our internal indebtedness is a necessary part of the plan agreed to at the Premiers Conference. As that plan involves reductions in wages and salaries and social services, no fair-minded person would attempt to defend the exemption of the interests of bondholders and others with fixed monetary claims, who hitherto have borne no part of the general sacrifice. The plan is indivisible; the carrying out of any one part of it is dependent on the carrying out of every other part of it. </para>

              <para>- Yes. If any of the parties to this plan failed to discharge the obligations resting upon it, undoubtedly the whole rehabilitation scheme would be wrecked, either permanently or temporarily. If there is a failure by one of the major parties to the scheme to perform its obligations, neither the plan nor any major part of it could be given effect until the conference had been re-convened, and the situation re-surveyed. </para>

              <para>- What I am about to read will show what the governments committed themselves to before the details of the plan were settled. In order to make it effective, the Leaders of the Opposition in the Commonwealth Parliament were invited to attend the Premiers Conference in Melbourne, and, after a full discussion, and in the presence of the representatives of the Commonwealth Opposition, the following resolutions were agreed to on the 10th June, towards the termination of the proceedings :  - </para>

            <para>The conference, including the Leaders of the Opposition in the Federal Parliament, having most carefully considered the financial position of the Commonwealth and the States, and recognizing the national inability to meet existing government charges, is unanimously of the opinion that to prevent national default in the immediate future, and a general failure to meet government payments, all expenditure, including interest on government securities and other interest, and expenditure upon governmental salaries and wages, pensions, and other social services, must be substantially reduced. These measures, drastic as they may appear, are the first essentials to the restorafi'on of prosperity arid the reemployment of our workless people. The necessary sacrifice is due to national inability to pay, and it must, therefore, be shared <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> all. The conference has accordingly provided a conversion plan under which bondholders may make their contribution to the general sacrifice by themselves accepting the lower rate of interest which the existing position mates unavoidable. </para>

          <para>The proposed conversion is a colossal undertaking, hot only because of the immense sum involved, but also because of the complexities caused by the number and variety of the stocks affected. The number of government loans maturing in Australia and outstanding at the present time, allowing for the variety of conditions, the difference of dates of maturity and the difference of interest rates, totals, approximately, 1,250. These securities are divided into the following classes: <inline font-style="italic">-</inline></para>

          <para>Fixed deposit stock. </para>
          <para>The securities are divided between securities having fixed dates of redemption, some of which are redeemable at earlier dates under certain circumstances, and securities which are interminable, or have no fixed date of maturity. They are, again, divided into securities the interest on which is subject to taxation, and certain State securities, the interest on which is exempt from taxation. </para>
          <para>The object to be attained by this conversion and by the bill, is, in itself,  a  simple one. It is to secure a reduction of the interest rate by 22Â½ per cent., and to establish a new consolidated Australian governmental stock, based; generally speaking, on a 4 per cent, interest rate; but the action involved in the conversion operation is far from simple. There are many difficulties and Complexities, and these have been multiplied by the limitation of time at the disposal of the Commonwealth Treasury in making provision for so gigantic an undertaking. </para>
          <para>I am greatly indebted, personally, to certain officers who have been working upon this plan, almost day and night, since the rising of the Premiers Conference, and particularly to the Assistant Secretary to the Treasury, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sheehan-,</inline> and to the Under-Treasurer for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr-. Stuckey,</inline> whose services have been lent to the Commonwealth by the South Australian Government for the purpose of assisting us to solve some of  the problems connected with the conversion scheme. These two officers have been indefatigable, and, without their assistance, we certainly could not have circulated the bill at so early a date as to-day. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth and State debts that will come under the scheme amount, in the aggregate, to Â£556,000,000, of which Â£400,467,000 is represented by Commonwealth securities, and Â£155,533,000 by State securities. The details are as follow: - </para>

          <para class="block">There is a large number of holders of this great variety of stock. It is known, of course, that on each issue of a large loan in Australia, in recent years, there have been very many applicants. How much of such stock remains in the hands of the original subscribers it is impossible to say, all we know is that, in the numerous Commonwealth loan issues, a vast number of subscribers throughout the Commonwealth have participated, and, no doubt, many of these have subscribed regularly to successive loans. The Commonwealth stock inscribed at the Commonwealth Bank is owned by 101,000 stockholders. There are 189,000 owners of Commonwealth treasury-bonds, whose bonds are lodged for safe custody with banks and savings banks, whilst it is estimated that there are, approximately, 100,000 persons whose Commonwealth treasury-bonds are in their own hands. </para>

On certain securities the existing rate is already low, and, as it would not be fair to ask the original holders of these securities to make a further sacrifice of interest on their specially low  interest-bearing  securities, it has been decided that the holders of securities which bear interest rates of 3 J per cent, or less, who acquired them prior to the 4th August, 1914, shall not have the rate of interest reduced below 3 per cent. </para>
          <para>The new securities will be issued in the form of a common stock, which will be known as "Australian consolidated inscribed stock," or "Australian consolidated treasury-bonds," as the case may be. The new stock will be issued at three different rates of interest, namely, 4 per cent., 3$ per cent., and 3 per cent. It is anticipated that holders of existing securities which bear interest at a rate in excess of 5 per cent, will convert into the new 4 per cent, securities at a premium, that  existing  securities bearing interest at 5 per cent, will be converted into new securities at par bearing interest at 3Â£ per cent., while holders of existing securities bearing interest at less than 5 per cent, will convert into new 3 per cent, securities at a premium, or, if they so desire, they can convert into new 4 per cent, securities at a discount. It is necessary to have a variable rate instead of adhering to 4 per cent., as originally intended, in order to overcome difficulties that may present themselves to trustees, who may find that the conversion may affect the capital under their control, and in some way affect the terms of their trusteeship. The new securities will have a currency of 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 24, 26, 28, or 30 years, and it is intended that they shall be apportioned evenly in respect of most holdings. In the case of holders of securities not exceeding Â£1,000,* or trustees, provision is made that the Treasurer may spread the new issue over a lesser number of maturity dates than those mentioned. </para>
          <para>If the new securities were issued to mature at the same period, and if all interest became due on the same date, it would be most inconvenient to the Treasury. Therefore, the months in which the new securities will mature will be spread through the second half of the calendar year, as set out in the bill. </para>
          <para>The effect of the reduction by 22^ per cent, of the interest rates on the existing securities is shown in table 1 in the schedule to the bill. If this is referred to, it will be seen that in most cases' the reduction of the nominal rate brings about rates which have to be set out in pounds, shillings, and pence. For this reason, the new consolidated securities will be issued at the rates of 4 per cent., 3 J per cent., or 3 per cent., and provision is made for holders of securities on which the nominal interest rate reduced 'by 22-J per cent, would be in excess of 4 per cent, to receive a premium on their bonds when these are converted into the new 4 per cent, stock. The method of calculating the premium or discount is set out in detail in the schedule. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stuckey,</inline> who is an actuary, has rendered the Government very considerable service in working out these matters. </para>
          <para>There are certain securities for which special provision had to be made. The first of these are the tax-free securities. On them the interest reduction of 22Â£ per cent, will be maintained until the dates when they mature, with the existing conditions as to exemption from taxation. New securities issued in exchange for existing tax-free securities maturing on or before the 31st December, 1934, will mature on the original date of maturity of the existing securities, and will then be reconverted at par, and bear interest at 4 per cent., maturing on the 15th November, 1941. </para>
          <para>The taxable securities will continue to be taxable after conversion, but will be exempt from the special <inline font-style="italic">1%</inline> per cent, tax that was imposed last November; from State income tax; and from any further Commonwealth income tax. </para>

            <para>- Yes, to the whole of the taxable securities that will come under the conversion plan. In the case of securities held by savings banks, as it may be essential for the conduct of the business of such institutions that the existing dates of maturity shall be preserved, arrangements have been made for this to be done ; but there will be a deduction of 22J per cent, from the interest rate. </para>

It is necessary for the Government to give six months' notice of any change of interest on such certificates. Such notice will shortly be given, and, therefore, interest on those securities will be reduced from 5 per cent, to 8f per cent, as from the 1st February, 1932. There are only Â£240,000 of those certificates now outstanding. { </para><para>The date at which the conversion is to take place has been fixed as the 31st July, 1931. Interest will be payable on existing securities at the rates now applicable to them up to and including that date; but on and after the 1st day of August, 1931, interest will be payable at the rate' fixed for the new securities which will be issued under the act. </para><para>Owing to the change in the rate of interest upon conversion, it would be impossible to allow existing bonds, debentures, or treasury-bills to remain current.

              <para>- That is so. Anticipating that there might be some misgivings on that important point I have sought information regarding the practice and experience of the United Kingdom in handling its large conversion loans. In 1822 the British Chancellor of the Exchequer converted " navy and other 5 per cent, bonds " amounting to Â£152,000,000 into stock carrying a lower rate of interest. The owners were not asked to assent. The act provided that those who did not dissent were assumed to have assented to the terms proposed, and only two weeks was allowed to holders to notify dissent. That was before the days of telegraphs, and when other means of communication were imperfect. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member is making a somewhat hasty assumption. In 1824 the British Government converted Â£75,000,000 from- 4 per cent, to 3Â£ per cent., and again the nonexpression of dissent was assumed to signify assent. In 1830, Â£154,000,000 of 4 per cent, stock was converted into 3-J per cent, stock, and assent was assumed, unless dissent was expressed between the 26th March and the 24th April, one month. In 1844 another sum of Â£249,000,000 was converted from 3Â£ per cent, to 3J per cent., and assent was presumed, unless dissent "was signified between the 11th and the 23rd March, a fortnight.

              <para>- I was referring to certain tax-free securities maturing from 1931 to 1934. The present immunity from taxation will be continued to the original date of maturity, after which such securities will be converted into the consolidated stock. Huge amounts will mature in Australia during the next few years, and that emphasizes one of the incidental, but important, advantages of this conversion scheme. The primary object of it was not to discover an easy way to deal with maturing loans, but rather to reduce the rate of interest, as part of a complete plan for the distribution of the loss of national income, but incidentally this scheme will solve the important problem that would be presented by large loans maturing within the next few years. These have naturally caused a great deal of anxiety to Commonwealth and State Governments, and will be a matter of concern to subsequent governments unless a general conversion plan is agreed to. For instance, in 'the next seven years, Commonwealth securities alone, aggregating Â£258,000,009, will mature. The following analysis shows the principal Commonwealth securities, exclusive of treasury-bills, that will mature in each of the next ten years : - </para>

          </continue><para class="block">Under this conversion scheme ten new maturity dates will be fixed, extending to 30 years. This scheme will give a more even distribution of the debt over the intervening years, and provide for manageable amounts in each period. It provides, also, maturity dates which will enable a better spread of interest payments over the mouths of each year, and avoid the necessity for Treasurers to store money for the payment of large sums in June or December, or at other periods of the year which may be inconvenient. The total amount of the Commonwealth and State debts contracted within Australia is Â£556,000,000. If we take the holdings of the Commonwealth and State Savings Banks, the maturity dates of which are subject to arrangement, at Â£117,000,000; and tax-free securities held by the public and governmental authorities, other than savings banks, the maturity dates of which remain as at present, at Â£50,000,000; and treasury bills held by banks, which will not be converted into long-term securities, at Â£22,000,000, and certain securities representing overseas trade moneys at Â£7,000,000, we arrive at a total of Â£196,000,000, which will not be required to be distributed over the various maturity dates. This leaves Â£360,000,000 to be so distributed. If that amount were evenly distributed over ten maturity dates the sum of Â£36,000,000 would mature on. each date. </para><interjection>

              <para>- Yes. I think that we have a right to expect complete success for the conversion loan. It may be that a few individuals, for a variety of reasons, will dissent; but it would be a mistake to assume that the conversion as a whole will not be a success. In Great Britain the conversions in the earlier part of the nineteenth century, and those handled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goschen,</inline> covered almost 100 per cent, of the indebtedness. Of the huge total of Â£200,000,000 only Â£1,000.000 was left unconverted. It is significant, however, that one conversion scheme - I think it was proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> when Chancellor of the Exchequer in the early fifties - was not a success, and that in that instance the bondholders were given a long period in which to notify their intention to convert. That was a departure from what  had been the general practice up to then of assuming conversion in the absence of dissent. </para>

              <para>- Colossal as the conversion scheme is, the cost will be negligible. The Government will have no brokerage to pay, no underwriting commissions, nor any of the ordinary charges attached to the raising of a new loan. Nor will it have to make the usual costly appeal to the public for subscriptions. The only expense involved will be that of sending out notifications circularizing bondholders, and such advertising as may be necessary to bring the details of the plan fully before the notice of subscribers. </para>

          </continue><para>The condition of national emergency in Australia makes an adjustment of our interest burden imperative, and also necessitates what we hope will be achieved through this plan, namely, easier credit conditions, a healthier tone in the Australian money market, more confidence among investors in government securities of all kinds, future stability of the market, and lower interest rates for the future. If we can obtain those additional advantages, which would mean so much to the nation, from a conversion based on a voluntary appeal, that will undoubtedly outweigh any possible advantages which might be claimed for compulsion. The desirable objects I have enumerated can best be achieved by co-operation ; they cannot be achieved by terrorism or brutal threats of compulsion. Of course, the bondholder must realize that with him also it is a matter of give and take; that without this rehabilitation plan he might lose a great deal more than he will sacrifice under it. "Without it he might lose, or at least seriously imperil, the whole of his capital in so far as it is invested in government -bonds. If bondholders co-operate with the Government, and freely convert their "holdings, they will protect their own securities, and help the country as well. That ought to influence bondholders to do what they can to make the plan a success. </para><para>Regarding future interest rates, I hinted here during the course of my speech, and expressed the hope in more definite terms elsewhere, that the conversion plan may lead to a permanent reduction of government loan rates in Australia. I know that the plan does not guarantee any such thing. It brings down the nominal rate, and reduces the interest burden on outstanding securities, but it does not guarantee a permanent reduction of the interest rate, because if there continues to exist, after the conversion scheme has been carried through, lack of confidence and dread of what may happen in the future, the new securities may slump on the market as the existing securities have done. It is idle for me to claim that the Government's plan guarantees for the future a 4 per cent, government loan rate, and I know that it may be regarded as unduly optimistic even to hope that it may establish such a rate for any long period. But I certainly think that a 4 per cent, government loan rate is something that, we should aim at, and if the bankers, the stock exchange operators, the bondholders, and the general public become confident of our ability to emerge from our present difficulties, it will be possible to have a 4 per cent, consolidated Australian stock placed upon a permanent basis, and quoted at, or near, par upon the exchanges. To accomplish that we must have the acceptance. of this plan by the bondholders. We must have the thorough co-operation and proper recognition of the bona fides of each party to the scheme. We must have, too, the monetary support of the market. That, I believe to be essential in a matter of this kind. We owe it to the existing holders of government bonds to sup port the market and uphold the value of their securities. At present we have no means of doing this, except so far as it can be done by the employment of sinking funds in the hands of the Government, to purchase a particular class of stock. In England, at times, funds have been established for the purpose of supporting British consols. The Commonwealth, during the war, established a fund for the purpose of maintaining the market, and of helping the holders of securities. I believe that something of the kind might be done with respect to this conversion; but this operation is so gigantic that a fund would have to be of considerable dimensions to be effective. The Government is cooperating with the banks and other financial institutions which are vitally concerned in maintaining the value of their securities. We hope, therefore, to effect something in that direction. No provision has been made for maintaining the value of securities under the plan as agreed upon by the various governments, but it is a matter that we shall have to consider seriously with a view to bringing about stability in our security market. </para><para>I have given as much detail as I think necessary to enlighten those who wish to study the conditions of the proposed conversion. This proposal affects a vast number of people. Some of the small bondholders may regard themselves as being harshly treated; but the plan is designed to protect the interests of small and large bondholders alike, and to protect holdings in government securities, which would be imperilled unless some general financial rehabilitation were agreed to. </para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons)</inline> adjourned. </para>

            <para>- That Ls so. I do not know whether the travelling allowances for Ministers have been at the rate of Â£2 2s. a day, or, in the case of the Prime Minister, Â£3 3s. a day, since federation; but I should be much surprised if, upon investigation, I found that to be so. The Prime Minister, in reply to my question, said that he had investigated this matter, and had ascertained that on many occasions not one-third of the allowances provided for Ministers had been drawn by them. I find that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> drew Â£525 in twenty months. </para>

            <para>- I intend later to gather details of the travelling allowances of ministerial secretaries and expenditure on motor hire. I recognize that the Minister for Trade and Customs is most obliging and enterprising, and has many calls upon his time, but I am taking his case because he has drawn the highest allowance. Had I an opportunity to investigate the Prime Minister's statement that Ministers had drawn only one-third of the allowance to which they were entitled, I am convinced that the statement would bc found to be incorrect, at least in respect of most Ministers. An allowance of Â£525 in twenty months works out at Â£26 53. a month, Â£6 6s. a week, or Â£2 2s. a day of three days in every week since this Parliament was elected. During that period there have been 86 Sundays. This Parliament sat on 163 days during that period, and we must add to that the days on which the Minister was in Canberra attending Cabinet and caucus meetings. We have also to ascertain the number of days other than Sundays which the Minister spent in his own home, and the days on which he visited his own electorate. During the twenty months there were two periods of Christmas holidays. In view of those facts, I cannot accept the statement of the Prime Minister that the Minister for Trade and Customs and most of the other Ministers have drawn only one-third of the allowance that they could have drawn. What is the position to-day? As a member of this Parliament I am asked to support a reduction of ls. a week in a pension of 5s. 6d. now paid to the inmates of the old men's home at Magill, South Australia. I am asked to support that proposal, distasteful as it is to me, in order to assist, even in some small degree, to bring about financial stability. Therefore, I cannot remain silent while Ministers, on the figures I have quoted, are drawing travelling allowances of Â£2 2s. a day, while in receipt of a salary of Â£5 or Â£6 a day. What is the position of a Minister who is travelling on public business? He is supplied with a gold pass, which enables him to travel on the railways free of cost, and is not obliged to incur the expense of motor hire. "What expenses does he incur that necessitate an allowance of Â£2 2s. a day? It is too much to ask me to countenance such things. The Prime Minister has said that there must be a drastic reduction in governmental expenditure in certain directions, and surely the time has arrived when Ministers' travelling allowances should be substantially reduced, or entirely dispensed with. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> when holding the portfolio of Vice-President of the Executive Council, drew Â£382 in travelling allowances. He has not been a member of the Government for some months, but I should like the Prime Minister to say if' it is correct that he drew only one-third of the amount he could have drawn. In his case I have not had time to institute a comparison on the same basis as that used with respect to the allowances paid to the Minister for Trade and Customs. The position of the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> differs somewhat from that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> as he has been a member of the Cabinet for twenty months. The Postmaster-General has drawn Â£359, but I cannot believe that he has received only one-third of the amount to which the Prime Minister says he, in common with other Ministers, was entitled. The ex-Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> is another who has made a welter of this practice to the extent of Â£369. The present system cannot be allowed to continue, and I appeal to the Prime Minister to consider making an adequate reduction in Minister's travelling allowances, or discontinuing them altogether. </para>

            <para>- As the Government has decided to make a reduction in invalid, old-age and war pensions, I am prepared to do the work expected of me in this Parliament for Â£500 a year during the crisis, provided other members do likewise. There is no need whatever for Ministers to be paid Â£2 2s. a day as a travelling allowance, in addition to the remuneration they receive as Ministers. The action of some of them seems to me akin to exploitation, a word which I use in the sense of selfishly utilizing the opportunities available to obtain all one possibly can when serving in a public capacity. The Government must take drastic action in this matter. On the other hand, I wish to congratulate the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore),</inline> and the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Culley),</inline> who has recently resigned, upon the comparatively small amount which they have received from this source. The time is rotten ripe for action  to be taken in the direction of discontinuing travelling allowances to Ministers who are already well remunerated, particularly when the finances of this country are in such a state that the pensions of invalids, the aged, and those who served this country in the Great War have to be reduced. </para>

            <para>- There seems to be a general impression among those interested in the repatriation of excess coal-miners in Queensland that the Government is concentrating upon employing excess coal-miners by developing the shale-oil industry in New South Wales, and that some indifference is being shown to the excess coal-miners in Queensland. I ask the Prime Minister if the same consideration will be given to the claims of the men in that State as is apparently being given to the repatriation of excess coal-miners in New South Wales. In that State the Government has placed the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn,</inline> a member of the Development and Migration Commission, at the disposal of the committee, and I ask the Prime Minister if that gentleman's services can also be made available on behalf of the Queensland coal-miners to co-operate with the committee in that State. Already this matter has been delayed too long. Although the Government's offer of Â£100,000 was made fourteen months ago, not one man has yet been repatriated. I would be neglecting my duty if I did not urge expedition, particularly as many of the men are in financial difficulties and many are in very needy circumstances. I trust that the Government will make <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn's</inline> services available in the direction I have suggested, and that the work of the committee will be completed with the utmost expedition. </para>

        <para>The only item in the list which shows a profit in the profit and loss column is Metropolitan waterworks and sewers, the profit being Â£259,041. All the other operations show a loss, when earnings, expenses, and interest and sinking fund contributions are taken into account. It will thus be seen that I was fairly accurate in my statement. The total loan liabilities for 1929-30 in respect to the works that I have enumerated were Â£96,829,817; the total earnings, Â£5,939,440; and the expenses Â£4,176,911. There was thus an excess of earnings over expenditure, leaving out of account interest and sinking fund payments. But the obligations under that heading amounted to Â£5,045,084. The total loss on all the undertakings was therefore Â£3,282,555. As I have said, the position of South Australia is, to a large extent, the position of the other States. I wish to inform the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> that before I make statements of the kind to which he referred in his interjection, I take pains to find out the facts. In this particular instance, my statement was in accord with the facts. </para>

            <para>. - The honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> has again called attention to the amount drawn in travelling expenses by Ministers - a matter to which he referred at question time today. He used a race-course term, and said that Ministers "were making a welter of it". I endeavoured to show clearly in replying to the honorable member's question that Ministers were far from " making a welter of it ". The payment of travelling allowances to Ministers and public servants engaged on official business away from their homes is a practice which has been followed for at least 20 years. </para>

              <para>- I do not suppose that that amount has been payable for the full term. The amount payable a day, will, like all other expenditure, be subject to a reduction in accordance with the economy plan. This morning I said that Ministers had not drawn more than one-third of the amount to which they were actually entitled, and I emphasize that statement. In some cases, not more than a fifth of the amount to which Ministers are entitled has been drawn. My attendance at the Premiers Conferences alone would, at Â£3 3s. a day, have exceeded the total amount that I have drawn. The honorable member saw fit to single out the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> for special denunciation. </para>

              <para>- There are special circumstances in the case of the Minister for Trade and Customs. Since the assumption of office by this Government that honorable gentleman, while an honorary Minister, and not in receipt of a full ministerial salary, acted as Acting Minister for Trade and Customs. He has also acted as Acting Minister for Markets and Transport. Probably, he is the most energetic Minister Australia has ever had. He has had many requests from honorable members of all shades of political opinion to visit various districts. If he had claimed the full amount of travelling allowance to which he was entitled, he would have received a very much larger sum than he has actually drawn. </para>

              <para>- I have personally checked the returns, and I assure the honorable member that many additional days could have been charged for. It cannot be expected that Ministers, who are called upon to do a great deal of travelling in the discharge of their official duties, shall do it at their own expense. It is all very well to say that Ministers draw a salary, but that does not  by any  means cover the situation. I intensely dislike having to discuss these matters. I believe that this is the first occasion on which the subject has been brought up in Parliament. </para>

It must be remembered that the Minister for Trade and Customs has been preparing material for the purpose of taking charge of the debate on the most extensive tariff schedule that has ever been tabled in this Parliament. He has had to spend a large amount of time in making inspections, conducting interviews, and hearing deputations in various parts of the Commonwealth. He has handled this business in a most masterly way. It has not been possible for him to inform his mind on all these matters without considerable expenditure and much travelling.

          <para>The honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. D.

He was good enough to hand me the newspaper report upon which he based his statement. He also acknowledged that my statement on the subject was quite clear. As a matter of fact, the terms I used were taken from the resolution adopted by the soldiers' representatives. They asked me to do a certain thing, and I agreed to do it. The only thing that the Government fixed was the amount of the economies to be effected. The soldiers' committee was asked, at its own request, to make inquiries with the object of recommending how economies to this amount could be made with the least hardship and the fewest anomalies. In the circumstances, I cannot understand why there should be any uncertainty about the terms of reference, and if there is any such uncertainty I am surprised that I was not asked to clear it up. I point out that Professor Giblin and, in fact, all the members of the committee, were nominated by the soldiers' organizations.

            <para>Under the plan agreed upon by the Commonwealth and the State  for  meeting the grave financial emergency existing in Australia, the Commonwealth Government has undertaken that a saving of Â£1,291,000 will be effected in the expenditure on war pensions. The plans of the Government for effecting this saving were placed before Parliament by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth yesterday. </para>
            <para>It is the desire of the Government that the necessary saving should be made with the least possible hardship to war pensioners, and without creating anomalies. The Government accordingly invites the committee to examine the position and to submit to the Government its views us to the best course to be adopted to secure the necessary saving. </para>
            <para>The committee will be - given all possible facilities to obtain from the Repatriation Commission any information it desires in regard to war pensionpayments. </para>
            <para>In view of the urgency of the matter, it is desired that the committee commence its investigations at the earliest possible moment, and that the report of the committee be furnished to the Government in Canberra not later than Thursday morning, 2nd July. </para>
            <para>I shall be glad if you will be good enough to ask the committee to meet in Melbourne on Monday next and go straight on with its inquiries. </para>

              <para>- The Government has acceded to the request that a committee should go into the matter and make suggestions as to how economies in war pensions can best be made. I stated clearly in the House the other day that if the report of the committee arrived in time, and was acceptable to the Government, the bill would be amended accordingly. I did not undertake that the Government would accept the report; I made that reservation. I also said that, if the report did not arrive in time, the Government would have to go on with its legislation. But I added that even if we had proceeded with that legislation to the extent of having passed it through both Houses of Parliament, and the report which came to hand subsequently was acceptable to the Government, an amending bill to give effect to the committee's recommendations would be introduced. </para>

          <para>The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> raised the question of the repatriation- of the excess coalminers of Queensland. I regret that 1 did not make the papers available yesterday. I intended to do so, but overlooked the matter. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> shall, however, give instructions for them to be placed on the table of the Library. I have no objection to the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn</inline> being made available as requested by the honorable member, but I point out that we cannot agree to the whole Â£7,000 being expended in making an investigation. </para>
